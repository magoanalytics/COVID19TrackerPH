MANILA (4th UPDATE) - Philippine health authorities on Saturday raised Code Red as it confirmed local transmission and another case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the country, bringing the total number of patients to 6. 
Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said the latest patient is a 59-year-old woman who got infected from her 62-year-old husband, the country's fifth case of COVID-19. 
The man was, meanwhile, the first confirmed local transmission of the disease. 
The couple, who lives east of Manila, are now confined at the state-run Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) in Alabang, Muntinlupa City. Both have no recent travel history, records from the Bureau of Immigration (BI) showed.
""The DOH is currently exhausting all its efforts to identify others who may have come in contact with the confirmed cases to ensure that this localized transmission does not progress to community spread,"" Duque said.

What is Code Red?

To stem the spread of the disease, which has infected nearly 100,000 people and killed more than 3,300 worldwide, health authorities raised its alert system to ""Code Red, Sub-level 1.""
The alert is ""a preemptive call to ensure that national and local governments and public and private health care providers can prepare for possible increase in suspected and confirmed cases,"" Duque said.
A ""code red"" alert also means all hospital personnel are required to report for duty in their respective facilities to provide medical services. 
Announcing ""code red"" also prompted health authorities to recommend to President Rodrigo Duterte for the declaration of a state of public health emergency.

Duterte OKs declaration of state of public health emergency amid coronavirus spread- Go

In response to the DOH recommendation, the chief executive has agreed to declare a national public health emergency, according to Sen. Christopher ""Bong"" Go.
""Pursuant to the recommendation of the DOH and my suggestion as Chair of the Senate Committee on Health, President Rodrigo Duterte has agreed to issue a declaration of a State of Public Health Emergency due to the confirmation of a local transmission of COVID-19 in our country,"" he said.
In the event of a sustained community transmission or an increasing number of local cases whose links cannot be established, Duque said the strategy will be shifted from an intensive contact tracing to the implementation of community-level quarantine or lockdown and/or possibly, suspension of work or school.
SIXTH CASE
RITM director Dr. Celia Carlos revealed that the latest patient, who was admitted on March 5, was experiencing mild respiratory symptoms.
Her husband, the 5th coronavirus case who is suffering from severe pneumonia, is in critical condition, she added. 
""He still has severe pneumonia and other medical problems like diabetes and hypertension,"" Carlos said.
The man had coughs last Feb. 25 and was admitted at the Cardinal Santos Medical Center in San Juan City on March 1 with severe pneumonia. He tested positive on March 5. 
The man also frequented a Muslim prayer hall in San Juan, which has seen been disinfected. The worshipers in this prayer hall experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 have been asked to call the Department of Health hotline (02) 8651 7800 local 1149 o 1150 for referral to a health facility. 
According to Duque, the recovery of patients in critical condition is slow.
""Based on the experience, the clinical condition on severe cases as reported in China, it takes a very long time for them to recover from 3 to 6 weeks when critical. If mild, it's about 2 to 3 weeks,"" he said.
The first 3 COVID-19 cases in the Philippines involved Chinese nationals with history of travel to Wuhan, China, epicenter of the outbreak. One of them died of severe pneumonia on Feb. 1 while 2 recovered and have returned home. 
The fourth case, a 48-year-old Filipino man, had traveled to Japan, which has recorded 349 confirmed cases and 6 deaths from the illness. 
Health assistant secretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said the Philippines had 5 sub-national laboratories capable of diagnosing the virus.
These are the San Lazaro Hospital and Lung Center of the Philippines in Manila, Baguio General Hospital and Medical Center in Northern Luzon, Vicente Sotto Memorial Medical Center in the Visayas, and Southern Philippines Medical Center in Mindanao.
The country also has testing kits capable of completing about 2,500 procedures, Carlos added.
Duque also appealed to stakeholders to exercise utmost prudence in sharing sensitive information about suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19.
“Our objectives for sharing information are 2-pronged: ensure the public's health and safety by facilitating contact tracing and ensure that the individual’s right to privacy is not impinged. Hence, we appeal to all to coordinate closely with the Department of Health when disseminating information to the public and within their respective institutions. Let us make sure the information sharing process will yield the utmost benefit, and avoid unnecessary stress and stigma to individuals and institutions,"" the health chief said.

MANILA - The US Agency for International Development (USAID) has pledged millions of dollars of financial assistance to several countries, including the Philippines, to fight the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic.

Jean-Claude Coutausse, Pool/Reuters


PARIS - French officials have closed down about 120 schools in areas that have reported the largest numbers of coronavirus infections, and more could be shuttered in the coming days, Education Minister Jean-Michel Blanquer said Tuesday.
Both primary and secondary schools have been shut in the Oise department north of Paris, where the main cluster of French cases has emerged, and where 2 people who have died of the virus lived. 
Officials have reported 191 coronavirus cases in France so far, and 3 deaths.
The Oise closures are affecting about 35,000 pupils, Blanquer told LCI television, while an additional 9,000 have been told to stay home in the Morbihan department of Brittany on the Atlantic coast.
One class of some 20 students has been suspended in Montreuil, a suburb just east of Paris, after a pupil tested positive for the virus, Blanquer said.
The Oise schools will remain closed until further notice, while Morbihan authorities have ordered doors shut until at least March 14.
""These figures are evolving quickly,"" Blanquer said, adding: ""There could be similar measures taken in the coming days"" at other schools.
Authorities have already halted all class trips outside the country, and prohibited any gatherings of more than 5,000 people in enclosed spaces.
Schools are increasing stocks of soap for washing hands, but Blanquer said there were no plans to order a nationwide school shutdown, for now.
""It wouldn't make sense to confine everyone, to paralyze the country, it would be counter-productive,"" he said.
President Emmanuel Macron, who is scheduled to visit the health ministry's crisis management center on Tuesday, has called off several events this week as France scrambles to contain the outbreak.
Contagion fears have led to shortages of sanitizing hand gels and face masks, with suppliers racing to replenish stocks even though much of the production is in China, where authorities have closed thousands of factories after the coronavirus emerged there in December.
Demand for thermometers has also soared, with one French producer, STIL, relaunching production at its factory south of Paris for the first time in 15 years after having moved manufacturing to Chinese partners.
""We can't do without China completely, but with this coronavirus the balance could shift for French companies to not be completely reliant"" on Chinese producers, STIL's president Gerard Lux told AFP.

MANILA - All Filipinos living in Italy are free from the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) amid the rise of cases there, the Philippine foreign ministry said Tuesday.
""Based on reports from our posts in Rome and Milan as of today, no Filipinos have been reported as affected by COVID - PUM [person under monitoring], PUI [patient under investigation] or COVID positive,"" said Assistant Secretary Eduardo Meñez of the Department of Foreign Affairs' Office of Strategic Communication and Research.
The death toll from coronavirus in Italy jumped to 52 on Tuesday (Manila time) from 34 the day before.
The increase in deaths was the largest since the outbreak surfaced 10 days ago in the wealthy northern regions of Lombardy and Veneto.
Lombardy, around Italy's financial capital Milan, is by far the hardest hit, with 38 casualties.
The virus has since spread south but the vast majority of cases remain centered on the original hotspots, with the addition of Emilia Romagna, another affluent region which borders on both Lombardy and Veneto and now has more cases than Veneto.
In total, 2,036 people have tested positive in Italy, up from 1,694 on Sunday. Of these, 149 have recovered, the civil protection agency said. - With reports from Willard Cheng, ABS-CBN News and Gavin Jones and Angelo Amante, Reuters

MANILA - China's flag carrier Air China on Thursday will mount special flights from Beijing to Manila and vice versa to evacuate stranded passengers due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak.
The aircraft will depart Beijing at 10:55 a.m. and is set to arrive in Manila at 4:05 p.m., the Chinese Embassy in Manila said in a tweet.
It will return to Beijing at 5:40 p.m. and is expected to arrive at 10:35 p.m.
Asked about the flights, the embassy said ""there are still many people from both countries stranded in the other country and they need to return to their homes.""
The Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA), in an advisory published on Feb. 19, said some commercial flights in some parts of China were available for Filipinos who wished to return home.
These areas are Beijing, Chengdu, Chongqing, Guangzhou, Guiyang in Guizhou Province, Hong Kong, Kunming in Yunnan Province, Macau, Shanghai and Xiamen.
""Returning Filipinos are reminded of the mandatory 14-day quarantine upon arrival regulation implemented by the Bureau of Quarantine per guidelines of the Department of Health (DOH),"" the DFA said.
To stem the spread of the fast-spreading disease, the Philippine government in February imposed travel restrictions to China and its special administrative regions of Macau and Hong Kong. The ban on the two Chinese territories was eventually relaxed in favor of migrant workers and some specific visa holders.

ROME - The governor of Veneto, one of the regions worst hit by an outbreak in Italy of coronavirus, apologized on Saturday for criticizing China over the contagion and saying Chinese people ""eat live mice.""
Luca Zaia has pinned the blame on China for the flare-up in Italy, which has led to at least 21 deaths, saying that unlike Italians, the Chinese did not have good standards of hygiene.
""The hygiene that our people, the Venetians and the Italian citizens have, the cultural training we have, is that of taking a shower, of washing, of washing one's hands often,"" Zaia said in a Antenna 3-Nord Est TV television interview on Friday.
""It is a cultural fact that China has paid a big price for this epidemic because we have seen them all eat mice live or things like that.""
His words stung the Chinese embassy in Rome. ""At a crucial time like this, when China and Italy stand side-by-side to deal with the epidemic, an Italian politician has spared no slander about the Chinese people. This is a gratuitous attack that leaves us stunned,"" it wrote on Facebook.
Political opponents of Zaia also denounced his comments, saying they would damage ties between the 2 countries. The Veneto governor, who is a member of the rightist League party, said he had not meant to cause offense.
""My words came out badly, I agree. If anyone was offended, I am sorry,"" he told Corriere della Sera newspaper on Saturday. ""I wanted to say that when it comes to food health and safety, controls change from country to country.""
The new coronavirus emerged at the end of 2019 in the Chinese city of Wuhan where scientists believe it might have passed to humans from animals at a local market where bats, snakes and other wildlife were sold. 
China temporarily shut down all such markets in January, warning that eating wild animals posed a threat to public health and safety.
The total accumulated number of confirmed cases in Italy has risen to almost 900, latest data shows, making it the worst affected country in Europe.
In China, the virus has caused nearly 80,000 infections and 2,835 deaths, according to official figures.

MEXICO CITY - Mexico's health ministry said the country has confirmed 3 cases of the coronavirus, becoming the second Latin American nation reached by the global outbreak.
The 3 men -- 2 in Mexico City and 1 in the northern state of Sinaloa -- are all believed to have visited northern Italy, the epicenter of the virus in Europe.
""Probably all 3 were infected from the same source. All 3 are imported cases,"" Jose Luis Alomia, general director of epidemiology at the Ministry of Health, said at a press conference Friday.
Senior health ministry official Hugo Lopez-Gatell told a separate news conference that 1 of the men, a 35-year-old in the capital, ""has a mild, mild illness"" with symptoms ""similar to that of a cold.""
""He is a young individual and so he is at very low risk,"" he said.
The patient and 5 members of his family have been isolated at the National Institute of Respiratory Diseases, Lopez-Gatell added.
The second case, a 41-year-old man who returned from Bergamo in Italy, is in isolation at a hotel in Sinaloa after being tested by regional authorities, officials said.
A 59-year-old man in Mexico City who also visited northern Italy is the third case but authorities did not say whether he had been hospitalized.
Italy has recorded 650 cases of the coronavirus and 17 deaths across cities in the north.
In Mexico, 2 more suspected cases are under analysis in the central state of Guanajuato and 1 in northwestern Durango.

SEOUL - South Korea urged citizens on Saturday to stay indoors as it warned of a ""critical moment"" in its battle on the coronavirus after recording the biggest daily jump in infections, as 813 new cases took the tally to 3,150.
South Korea is grappling with the largest outbreak of the virus outside China, as a new death took the toll to 17, amid a record daily increase in infections since the country confirmed its first patient on Jan. 20.
""We have asked you to refrain from taking part in public events, including a religious gathering or protest, this weekend,"" Vice health minister Kim Kang-lip told a briefing.
It was a ""critical moment"" in reining in the spread of the virus, he said, adding, ""Please stay at home and refrain from going outside and minimize contact with other people.""
As many as 657 of the new cases were from southeastern Daegu city, the site of a church at the center of the outbreak, and 79 from the nearby province of North Gyeongsang, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) said.
In the nearby city of Gumi, LG Display has shut a display module plant for disinfection work until Tuesday, after an employee of a bank in the building tested positive for the virus.
Health authorities have run tests on more than 210,000 members and 65,000 trainees of the church linked to a majority of cases after a 61-year-old woman known as ""Patient 31"" attended religious services there before testing positive.
More than 88 percent have been checked, and about 3,300 have shown symptoms such as fever, Kim added.
Some provincial officials want to press criminal charges against the church, saying it refused to release a complete list of members, although the church denied the accusation, and urged an end to ""slander and oppression"" of its followers.
Kim said the government was working with the municipal authorities to check if the church provided an incomplete list.
A court rejected a plan by conservative groups critical of President Moon Jae-in for a massive weekend rally in downtown Seoul, citing health concerns.

""Kaya 'pag winter sa ibang bansa, talagang nagkakasakit. Higit sa malamig, madilim, walang araw. All of these, it weakens the immune system,"" ani Mercado, na ngayo'y deputy secretary-general ng Centers for Health in Humanitarian Action ng Philippine Red Cross.
""Hindi tayo maka-relate do'n eh. Palaging mainit at laging lalabas 'yong araw [dito]. Actually, pasalamat tayo maraming araw,"" dadgag niya.
Sa kabila ng pagkalat ng COVID-19 na nakapagdudulot ng respiratory infection, naobserbahan ni Mercado na mabilis kumalat ang sakit sa mga lugar na may malamig na klima, gaya ng China, Japan, Italy at South Korea.
""In the 2 months we've seen this virus, hindi natin siya nakikita na kumakalat ng sukdulan sa lugar na mainit, na marami, na libo-libo,"" aniya.
Base sa datos ng World Health Organization (WHO) nitong Biyernes, Pebrero 28, nakapagtala na ng higit 78,000 na kaso ng impeksiyon sa China, kung saan nagmula ang sakit. 
Karamihan dito ay nasa Hubei province na sentro ng outbreak at may daily average temperature na 7 degrees Celsius noong Enero at 10 degrees Celsius nitong Pebrero.
Sa hiwalay na panayam ng DZMM, sinabi ni Health Secretary Francisco Duque III na hindi sigurado kung may kinalaman ang klima sa bilis ng pagkalat ng virus.
""Ang Singapore, ang Malaysia maiinit din 'yan pero mayroon sila. In fact, ang Singapore nga mayroon silang local transmission. Siguro hindi gano'n ka agresibo 'yong virus sa maiinit na lugar pero hindi naman nangangahulugan na hindi siya tatama,"" aniya.
May 96 na kaso ng COVID-19 ang Singapore habang 24 naman sa Malaysia.
Nakapagtala naman ng 3 kaso ng coronavirus ang Pilipinas, kung saan isa ang namatay habang nag-negatibo na sa sakit ang 2 iba pa. Pareho silang mga Chinese na galing sa Wuhan City, Hubei province.
Sa kasalukayan, may binabantayan ang mga awtoridad na 30 pasyente na posibleng may novel coronavirus.

LOS ANGELES (UPDATE) - US health officials reported Friday a fourth case of novel coronavirus of unknown origin, indicating the disease was spreading in the country.
The latest case is a boy under 18 in Washington State who tested ""presumptive positive,"" local authorities said without releasing further details about the patient.
He is currently in home isolation in Snohomish County. The high school he attends will be shut until March 3 while it is deep cleaned, the Washington State Department of Health said.
In neighboring Oregon, authorities said Friday an adult who had had contact with people at an elementary school had been hospitalized and was also considered ""presumptive positive.""
A positive test is treated as ""presumptive"" until the results have been confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
""We've been expecting this and we're prepared for it,"" Oregon's Health Authority director Patrick Allen told reporters.
The school will be closed until March 4 as it undergoes a deep clean, officials said, adding they would talk to employees and parents.
Earlier Friday, Californian health authorities said an older woman was confirmed infected with unknown origin -- the second such case in the northern part of the state.
""This new case indicates that there is evidence of community transmission but the extent is still not clear,"" said Sara Cody, director of public health for Santa Clara County.
""What we know now is that the virus is here, present at some level, but we still don't know to what degree,"" she added.
The 2 cases in California are close to Silicon Valley, where tech giants like Apple, Google and Tesla are based.
The latest infections have heightened fears of an outbreak across the country.
President Donald Trump, however, downplayed the risk in the US at a campaign rally in South Carolina, accusing Democrats and the press of stirring up hysteria.
""We are preparing for the worst,"" he said. ""My administration has taken the most aggressive action in modern history to prevent the spread of this illness in the United States.""
He called the coronavirus the Democrats' ""new hoax.""
""The Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus. They're politicizing it,"" he said. ""They don't have any clue. They can't even count their votes in Iowa.""
According to the Centers for Disease Control more than 60 people are infected with the disease in the United States, the majority of them in California.
The state's governor Gavin Newsom said Thursday 33 people had tested positive for the virus, and 5 of them had left California.
Worldwide more than 85,000 people have been infected and over 2,900 have died.
The escalating number of cases has sent stock markets tumbling and heightened fears the disease could wreak havoc on the world economy.

Kazuhiro NOGI, AFP


TOKYO - Major cherry blossom festivals in Japan have been canceled due to the deadly new coronavirus, the latest in a growing list of events quashed as the epidemic spreads globally. 
The traditional spring celebrations in Tokyo and Osaka, which attract millions of people wanting to seeing the white and pink flowers, will not go ahead as planned in April.
""We are sincerely sorry for those who were looking forward to the viewing... but please give us your understanding,"" the Japan Mint in Osaka said Friday. 
Other cherry blossom events -- feverishly anticipated by locals and tourists -- are likely to follow suit, according to local media. 
Organizers of Tokyo's Nakameguro Cherry Blossom Festival said people could still enjoy the blooming trees that grow along public roads. 
Trees in Tokyo will soon be in full bloom, with friends, families and colleagues typically flocking to parks for sometimes raucous, alcohol-fueled celebrations.
The cancellations come as authorities step up efforts to tackle the outbreak in Japan, which has reported more than 230 infections and 5 deaths.
Schools are closed and the government is urging people to work from home or commute during off-peak hours and avoid large gatherings. 
The operator of Tokyo's 2 Disney resorts -- Disneyland and DisneySea -- said Friday the parks would be closed for around 2 weeks due to the virus.
Universal Studios Japan in Osaka has also shuttered for a fortnight.

Courtesy of the Quezon City Government


MANILA - The Quezon City government has started training village health workers as local first responders in handling contagious illnesses like the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Members of the Barangay Health Emergency Response Teams (BHERT) from 20 villages were taught how to properly wear personal protective equipment (PPEs) to prevent the risk of infection.
""Wearing PPEs involves a tedious process to make sure that the responder is fully protected from possible contamination,” said city epidemiologist Dr. Rolando Cruz.
Amid the global outbreak of the novel coronavirus, city mayor Joy Belmonte ordered the distribution of PPE kits to barangays.
Each PPE kit contains anti-fog goggles, disposable latex gloves, a disposable plastic shoe cover, a disposable coverall, a disposable surgical gown, an N95 face mask, a disposable surgical mask and a disposable cap.
The trainings were conducted after Interior Secretary Eduardo Año issued a memorandum ordering local chief executives to activate BHERTs to address the COVID-19 outbreak.
The DILG circular tasks BHERTs to visit the homes of persons who came from countries affected by the outbreak and list down names of persons that the traveler had contact with.
BHERTs are instructed to immediately isolate a suspected coronavirus carrier in a room away from family members and contact local authorities in transporting them to the nearest healthcare facility equipped to handle such cases.
For Cruz, communities should know how to properly respond to public health emergencies.
""Sa lahat ng health workers, parehas tayo magtulungan at gawing ligtas at maayos ang mga barangay. Trust the right information para sa ating mga nasasakupan sakaling maging community ang transmission ng COVID,” he said.
(To all health workers, let's work together and make our villages safe. Trust the right information in case the COVID transmission becomes local.)
The novel coronavirus, believed to have originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan, has infected more than 83,000 people all over the world, according to data from the World Health Organization (WHO).
The fast-spreading illness also killed more than 2,800 people, majority in China.
In the Philippines, health authorities were monitoring 30 people suspected of carrying the strain of COVID-19 as of Friday. Three Chinese nationals who had traveled to the Philippines were earlier confirmed to have contracted the disease, one of whom died.

HONG KONG - All pets of people in Hong Kong infected with the coronavirus will be quarantined, with 1 dog already in isolation, the city's authorities said Friday.
The move is the first reported case anywhere in the world of a government quarantining pets over the outbreak and was prompted by a positive test in the pet of an infected patient.
The canine has been placed in quarantine for 14 days as a precaution but has no ""relevant symptoms,"" Hong Kong officials said Friday.
""Nasal and oral cavity samples tested weak positive for COVID-19,"" a government spokesman said without explaining why they tested the animal in the first place.
He said it was unclear whether the dog had actually contracted the virus or tested positive for low levels due to environmental contamination of the dog's mouth and nose.
The animal was collected from the owner's home on Wednesday after the 60-year-old woman was diagnosed with the contagion and placed in a hospital isolation ward.
It would be closely monitored, undergo further tests and held in quarantine until it returned a negative result, authorities said.
There is no evidence domestic animals such as dogs and cats can catch the virus or transmit it to humans but the department said all pets of infected people should be quarantined and tested for the virus for 14 days.
The financial hub has confirmed 94 cases of the new coronavirus in humans, with 2 deaths earlier this month. 
The epidemic, which emerged in central China in December, has infected more than 83,000 people globally.

TOKYO (UPDATE) - Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe called Thursday on schools to close nationwide from March 2 for several weeks to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus.
""The government considers the health and safety of children above anything else,"" Abe said.
""We request all primary, junior high and high schools... across the nation to close temporarily from March 2 next week until their spring break.""
The spring break for public schools usually starts in late March in Japan and lasts several weeks.
""Efforts to prevent the spread of infections among children are being made in various areas,"" Abe added. 
Many public elementary schools and junior high schools in northern Hokkaido were already closed on Thursday after the governor requested public schools to close for about a week.
The city of Osaka also said it will close its kindergartens, elementary and junior high schools from Saturday for 2 weeks.
Abe's call comes after the government urged organizers of major events to consider cancelling them, and called on businesses to allow employees to work from home or commute off-peak.
Authorities have said the coming 2 to 3 weeks will be critical in determining whether they can stem the outbreak of the virus, which has infected nearly 200 people in the country and been linked to the deaths of 3.
Japan has also struggled to deal with the fallout from a cruise ship that it quarantined off its coast, where more than 700 people tested positive for the virus. Four people who became sick on the boat have died.
""It's extremely important to prevent one patient cluster from creating another and we think we should take thorough measures,"" Abe said at a cabinet-level meeting on the virus.
He also urged ministers to work on legislation for minimizing the negative impact on the economy and daily lives of Japanese.

MADRID - With governments scrambling to contain a slew of new coronavirus cases popping up across Europe, here is an overview of the countries affected, where people have died and the precautions being taken. 
ITALY
With 12 deaths and 400 infections, Italy is the European country worst affected by the COVID-19 outbreak. It has also been a point of contagion with many cases in other countries involving people who returned home after travelling in infection-hit areas of northern Italy.
FRANCE
France has so far registered 18 infections and 2 deaths, and has urged its nationals to delay any plans to visit virus hot spots in northern Italy. Students returning from China, Singapore, South Korea and the Italian regions of Lombardy and Venice are being asked to remain at home for 2 weeks after their return. 
GERMANY
In Germany, 18 people have been infected including 2 diagnosed on Tuesday. One is a 25-year-old man believed to have been infected in the Italian city of Milan. 
BRITAIN
Britain has so far recorded 13 cases since the start of the epidemic. The government has requested travelers returning from affected areas in northern Italy, China, South Korea and Iran to isolate themselves and inform authorities.
SPAIN
The same has happened in Spain, which has registered 12 cases, 10 of which have been detected since Monday. Nine involved Italians or people who had recently visited Italy. 
Among that number are 4 Italians who were visiting Tenerife in the Canary Islands. The hotel where they were staying has been quarantined. 
To curb the spread, Madrid has advised against travel in northern Italy and sought to identify other potential cases that may have slipped under the radar by testing those already in hospital with respiratory problems or returning from high-risk areas with flu-like symptoms. 
CROATIA
Three people have tested positive for the virus, including a young man who recently stayed in Italy and his brother. A third case was detected Wednesday in a man who works in the Italian city of Parma.
AUSTRIA
A young Italian couple have tested positive. The Innsbruck hotel where the woman worked as a receptionist was initially placed in quarantine but the measure was lifted on Wednesday following tests. Austria has also urged its nationals to avoid visiting affected areas of neighboring Italy. 
FINLAND
Two virus infections were confirmed Wednesday -- a Chinese tourist in Lapland and a second case involving a Finnish national who had recently visited northern Italy.
SWEDEN
Two cases have been detected so far. One was registered at the end of January in a woman who had visited Wuhan, the Chinese city where the virus emerged in December. On Wednesday a second infection was discovered.
BELGIUM
One case was detected in a Belgian national who was repatriated from Wuhan in early February. He has completed his quarantine period.
GEORGIA
Georgia on Wednesday announced the first confirmed case of the novel coronavirus in the South Caucasus region.
GREECE
Athens announced its first infection on Wednesday, a woman aged 38 who had recently returned from northern Italy. 
The Greek government said Tuesday that in the event of a mass outbreak, it would activate temporary restrictions on travel to and from countries with a large number of infections as well as temporarily close schools, places of worship, cinemas, theaters, sports halls and businesses.
NORTH MACEDONIA
One case has been detected -- a woman who recently returned from Italy. 
SWITZERLAND
A first case was detected on Tuesday in a man in his 70s who was infected near Milan.
ROMANIA
Romania reported its first case on Wednesday -- a man who was in contact with an Italian who visited the country last week.
NORWAY
Norwegian health authorities announced Wednesday the first case of the new coronavirus in the Nordic nation in someone who returned from China last week. They said the patient was not ""in danger.""

TOKYO - A woman working as a tour-bus guide in Japan tested positive for the coronavirus for a second time, Osaka's prefectural government said Wednesday, the first person in the country to do so amid growing concerns about the spread of the infection.
The second positive test comes as the number of confirmed cases in Japan rose to 186 by Thursday from around 170 the day before. Tokyo has urged big gatherings and sports events be scrapped or curtailed for 2 weeks to contain the virus while pledging the 2020 Olympic Games will still go ahead in the city.
The 186 cases reported by Japan's health ministry are separate from 704 reported from an outbreak on a cruise liner that was quarantined off Tokyo earlier this month. A total of 7 people have died, including 4 from the ship.
The woman, a resident of Osaka in western Japan, tested positive on Wednesday after developing a sore throat and chest pains, the prefectural government said in a statement, describing her as being in her 40s. She first tested positive in late January and was discharged from the hospital after recovering on Feb. 1, according to the statement.
The health ministry confirmed the case was the first in Japan where a patient tested positive for coronavirus for a second time after being discharged from hospital, the Nikkei newspaper said.
Though a first in Japan, cases of second positive tests have been reported in China, where the disease originated late last year. The outbreak has spread rapidly and widely, infecting about 80,000 people globally and killing nearly 2,800, the vast majority in mainland China.
""Once you have the infection, it could remain dormant and with minimal symptoms, and then you can get an exacerbation if it finds its way into the lungs,"" said Philip Tierno Jr., Professor of Microbiology and Pathology at NYU School of Medicine.
He said much remains unknown about the virus. ""I'm not certain that this is not bi-phasic, like anthrax,"" he said, meaning the disease appears to go away before recurring.
Asked to comment on prospects for the Olympic Games going ahead in Tokyo this summer, Prof. Tierno said, ""The Olympics should be postponed if this continues... There are many people who don't understand how easy it is to spread this infection from one person to another.""
Japan has changed its strategy in combating the contagion, seeking to slow its spread and minimize the number of deaths.
As part of the attempt to contain the outbreak, Tokyo Olympics officials are considering scaling down the torch relay, Tokyo 2020 CEO Toshiro Muto said Wednesday.
The government is also considering scaling back this year's March 11 memorial ceremony for victims of 2011's massive earthquake and tsunami, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told reporters on Thursday.
Meanwhile, a major Japanese bank reported an employee had tested positive for coronavirus. MUFG Bank, part of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc, the country's largest lender by assets, said a member of staff at a branch in central Aichi prefecture, had been confirmed to have the virus on Wednesday.

When does an epidemic become a pandemic? As the novel coronavirus continues its spread across the globe, what does the designation mean to world healthcare systems as they try to rein in the deadly disease? 
The World Health Organization has yet to declare the current outbreak, which originated in central China last month, a pandemic. 
It has indicated however that we should prepare ourselves for one.
The WHO defines a pandemic as a situation in which ""the whole world's population would likely be exposed to this infection and potentially a proportion of them fall sick,"" said its emergencies director Michael Ryan.
WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that countries should be doing everything they could ""to prepare for a potential pandemic"".
""For the moment we are not witnessing the uncontained global spread of this virus and we are not witnessing large-scale deaths,"" he said on Monday.
While the number of fresh cases in mainland China has slowed slightly in recent weeks, several other countries have seen infections mushroom. 
These include South Korea, which has seen more than 1,100 people infected, and Italy, with more than 300 confirmed cases.
On Tuesday Iran reported four more deaths, taking the total number of fatalities to 19 and confirmed infections to 139.
""What we see are epidemics in different parts of the world, affecting countries in different ways and requiring a tailored response,"" said Tedros.
The WHO has not updated its designation of the outbreak since January 30, when it classed it as ""a public health emergency of international concern"".
Under its old warning system, which had six stages of alert, the WHO could simply start referring to coronavirus as a pandemic, which comes from the Ancient Greek for ""pan demos"": all people.
""Definitions and terminology aside, our advice remains the same,"" said WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic.
For Bharat Pankhania, of the University of Exeter Medical School in England, coronavirus is already a pandemic ""in all but name"".
""It's only a matter of time before the World Health Organisation starts to use the term in its communications,"" he said.
David Heymann, professor of Infectious Disease Epidemiology at London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine said the terminology risked being a distraction. 
""What is necessary is to understand the current situation in each country,"" he said.
Tedros did hint that designating the outbreak a pandemic prematurely might do more harm than good.
""Using the word pandemic now does not fit the facts, but it may certainly cause fear. This is not the time to focus on what word we use,"" he said.
He added that even if a pandemic is declared, the world alone ""will not prevent a single infection today or save a single life today.""

The world is ""simply not ready"" to rein in the new coronavirus outbreak, the head of a joint WHO-China mission of experts said Tuesday, urging countries to learn from China's expertise.
""You have to be ready to manage this at a larger scale... and it has to be done fast,"" Bruce Aylward told reporters in Geneva, insisting countries everywhere have to ""be ready as if this hits us tomorrow"".
His comments came after the World Health Organization announced that the epidemic had peaked at its epicenter in China, where it has killed more than 2,600 people and infected over 77,000 others.

But the situation has worsened elsewhere with nearly 2,700 other cases and more than 40 deaths globally. That has prompted restrictions on travelers from infected nations, the cancellation of football matches and national efforts to isolate suspected patients.
Aylward, who led an international mission of experts to China that wrapped up on Monday, hailed the dramatic and concerted measures taken in that country to rein in the outbreak.
But he voiced concern that other countries were not preparing quickly enough to react if they were hit hard by the outbreak.
""How many countries are planning hospital bed, planning ventilators... and the lab capacity to be able to manage this?"" he asked
""There has to be a shift in mindset,"" he insisted. ""You have to plan.""

Austria, Croatia report first cases of coronavirus infection

But so far, he warned, countries ""are simply not ready"".
He also cautioned that China's quick response and quality treatment of COVID-19 cases may have given other countries ""a false sense of security"".
""China knows how to keep people alive from COVID... That is not going to be the case everywhere in the world,"" he said. ""It is a serious disease.""
He voiced particular concern that poorer countries with weak health care systems were the most at risk.
Aylward also said his team's findings in China appeared to belie theories circulating that the number of cases being detected is only the tip of the iceberg and that a lot of undetected transmission is going on.
""There is not a lot of evidence of that,"" he said.

SEOUL - South Korean health authorities said on Tuesday they aim to test more than 200,000 members of a church at the center of a surge of new coronavirus cases that has taken the country's tally to 893.
South Korea's fast-spreading outbreak has fueled fears that the coronavirus, which is believed to have begun in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in December, is developing into a global pandemic.
About 60 percent of South Korea's cases have been linked to the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, where the first case was reported in a 61-year-old woman, but it is not known how she became infected.
Of 60 new cases reported on Tuesday, 16 were in the southeastern city of Daegu, where the church is located, and 33 from nearby North Gyeongsang Province, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.
South Korea also reported its ninth death from the virus, a patient from a hospital in North Gyeongsang Province.
The leader of the Shincheonji Church said it had agreed to provide authorities with the names of all its members in South Korea, estimated by media at about 215,000 people.
The government would conduct coronavirus tests on all members ""as soon as possible"" once it got the information, the prime minister's office said in a statement.
""It is essential to test all of the church members in order to contain the spread of the virus and relieve public anxiety,"" the office said.
Vice Health Minister Kim Kang-lip said the priority was to test some 1,300 of the 9,200 members of the Daegu church who are showing symptoms, which he said would be completed by Wednesday.
""We will make utmost efforts with the goal of stabilizing the situation in Daegu within 4 weeks,"" he told a briefing, adding that the government would trace all other Daegu citizens having symptoms for isolation and checks.
US WARNING
The church, which has faced public criticism of its handling of the outbreak, asked the government to ensure the personal details of its members did not become public.
The church founder and self-proclaimed messiah, Lee Man-hee, said the church was cooperating with the government to stop the outbreak and beside its members, it would also check people in church training programs.
""All of these will be implemented on the premise that the government takes steps to protect their personal information,"" Lee said in a letter posted online.
North Gyeongsang Province has also seen surges in cases in recent weeks, most from a hospital in Cheongdo, which was designated a ""special care zone"" along with Daegu last week.
On Tuesday, 21 of the 33 cases from the province were confirmed to have come from a residential home for the disabled people in Chilgok County, also near Daegu, traced to a worker there whose mother is a member of the Shincheonji church in Daegu, Governor Lee Cheol-woo said.
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, meanwhile, raised its warning level for South Korea and recommended Americans avoid all nonessential travel to the country, citing the ""widespread, ongoing outbreak"" of the coronavirus.
The US and South Korean militaries said they were considering scaling back joint training due, in one of the first concrete signs of the virus' fallout on global US military activities.
South Korean Defense Minister Jeong Kyeong-doo told a news conference in Washington 13 cases had been confirmed in the South Korean armed forces.
More than 400 South Korean citizens were set to return from Israel, which imposed an entry ban and arranged 2 charter flights after more than 2 dozen South Korean Catholics who had gone on a pilgrimage there tested positive for the virus.

NEXU Science Communication via Reuters


GENEVA - The new coronavirus has peaked in China but could still grow into a pandemic, the World Health Organization has warned, as infections mushroom in other countries.
Financial markets have gone into a tailspin after grim news of deaths and outbreaks in the Middle East, Europe and Asia, even as the Chinese epicenter appeared to be calming, with the death toll at its lowest for 3 weeks.
But the situation is worsening in other countries, with more than 2,000 cases and 30 deaths reported abroad, prompting a raft of restrictions on travelers from infected nations.
South Korea, Italy and Iran have logged particularly sharp increases in infections and deaths, while several countries in the Middle East reported their first cases of the novel coronavirus.
But WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyes insisted the virus could still be contained, praising China's drastic quarantine measures in several cities for helping to prevent an even bigger spread.
""For the moment we are not witnessing the uncontained global spread of this virus and we are not witnessing large-scale deaths,"" Tedros told reporters in Geneva.
He added, however, that countries should be ""doing everything we can to prepare for a potential pandemic.""
The term ""pandemic"" is used to describe an illness that spreads across numerous communities.
SOUTH KOREA HOTSPOT
South Korea, which has the largest number of cases outside China, reported 60 more infections and 1 more fatality on Tuesday, raising its death toll to 8 and total patients to nearly 900.
South Korea's outbreak has centered around a religious sect in Daegu, the country's fourth largest city.
The country is on its highest ""red"" alert. As part of the containment efforts, school holidays were extended nationally while the 2.5 million people of Daegu were told to remain indoors.

South Korea reports 60 new coronavirus cases, total 893

The US Centers for Disease Control raised its caution level to warn Americans against ""all non-essential travel to South Korea.""
Italy, which has reported 7 deaths and over 200 cases, has locked down 11 towns, while upcoming football matches in its Serie A and the Europa League will be played behind closed doors. 
With police manning checkpoints to enforce a blockade, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte has said that residents could face weeks of lockdown.
IRAN FEARS
The disease -- officially known as COVID-19 -- spread to new countries including Afghanistan, Bahrain, Iraq, Kuwait and Oman.
At least 12 people have died in Iran, the highest toll outside China.
But there were concerns the situation might be worse than officially acknowledged. The semi-official ILNA news agency quoted 1 local lawmaker in hard-hit Qom -- a religious center -- who said 50 people had died there.
The Iranian government denied the report, and pledged transparency.

Iran says 43 infected with coronavirus, 8 dead - official

Even so, authorities have only reported 64 infections in Iran, an unusually small number that would mean an extremely high mortality rate.
Michael Ryan, head of WHO's health emergencies program, said a team from the UN agency would be arriving in Iran on Tuesday.
But he cautioned against drawing any conclusions about the mortality rate. Iran ""may only be detecting severe cases"" because the epidemic was still at an early stage, he said.
Several countries have taken measures to prevent arrivals from Iran.
CHINA PEAK
In China, 508 new cases were reported, with all but 9 at the epicenter in central Hubei province. Although that was up from 409 on Monday it was much lower than new infections being reported just a week ago.
China's death toll reached 2,663 on Tuesday, after 71 more people died.
WHO's Tedros said the epidemic peaked in China between Jan. 23 and Feb. 2.
China has placed some 56 million in Hubei and its capital under quarantine since late last month, while other regions have enacted some forms of travel curbs and measures to keep millions more people indoors.
Bruce Aylward, leader of a WHO mission of international experts, said late Monday it was time for China to start lifting some of the restrictions.

TOKYO (UPDATE) - A fourth person has died after being taken to hospital from a quarantined coronavirus-stricken cruise ship off Japan, local media reported on Tuesday.
Public broadcaster NHK and other local outlets said the fatality was a man in his 80s, with the Yomiuri Shimbun saying the man had tested positive for the new coronavirus and died of pneumonia.
The health minister did not immediately respond to a request to confirm the reports.
Three others, all Japanese, have so far died after becoming sick on the ship. Two were confirmed to have the new coronavirus, while the health ministry declined to comment on whether the third person tested positive for the virus.
At least 691 people who were on board the Diamond Princess have so far tested positive for COVID-19, according to the health ministry.
Around a 1,000 people were allowed to leave the ship after it completed a 14-day quarantine if they tested negative and displayed no symptoms.
But several people who left the boat after getting the all-clear have since tested positive, and the health ministry has admitted some people were allowed to disembark despite not being tested during the quarantine.
Separately, Japan has confirmed at least 156 cases of infection with the virus, and 1 death.

CASALPUSTERLENGO - Italy reported Monday its fifth death from the new coronavirus, as the number of people contracting the disease continued to mount and officials called for calm.
The death of an 88-year-old man was the fourth in the northern Lombardy region, where villages have been put under lockdown and security measures enforced in a bid to stem the spread of the disease.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte has said that residents could face weeks in lockdown in an effort to sit out the virus.
Angelo Borrelli, head of the country's civil protection agency, said 219 people had now tested positive in Italy, which has the most confirmed cases in Europe.
Five people have died of the virus in the past 4 days, including 1 in the Veneto region.
An Alitalia flight from Rome was being held in Mauritius Monday, after 40 people from Lombady and Veneto were told they could not disembark unless they consented to being placed in quarantine.
Alitalia said it was arranging for their immediate repatriation instead, despite none of the passengers showing any symptoms.
Eleven towns -- 10 in Lombardy and 1 in neighboring Veneto -- are under lockdown, with some 50,000 residents prohibited from leaving.
Regional authorities have ordered gathering spots, such as bars, restaurants, cinemas and discos to close.
The spread of the virus has disrupted high profile events including Milan Fashion Week and the Venice Carnival, while Serie A football matches have been postponed. Operas have also had to be cancelled at Milan's famed La Scala.
Masses in churches across the affected regions have been cancelled and funerals limited to immediate relatives only.
The stock market in Milan was down nearly 5 percent on Monday in a broad-based sell-off over virus fears.
'OUTBREAK IN HOSPITAL'
Most of the cases in Italy are in Lombardy, a prosperous region in the country's north where Milan is located.
They can be traced back to a 38-year-old man in the town of Codogno whom authorities have called ""patient one.""
Investigators are reconstructing minute by minute the man's movements over the past few weeks -- where he slept, ate, walked -- in a bid to trace everyone he could have come into contact with.
""We had the most unfortunate situation possible; the outbreak of an epidemic in a hospital,"" infectious disease expert Massimo Galli told the Corriere della Sera daily.
""Unfortunately, in these cases, a hospital can turn into a frightening amplifier of contagion,"" he said.
The 38-year old patient had not traveled to China and doctors failed to treat him with the necessary precautions.
The man initially believed to have given him the virus after returning from Shanghai later tested negative.
""We still do not know who brought the coronavirus to Codogno,"" Galli said.
'EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO TRACK'
Simon Clarke, Cellular Microbiology associate professor at Reading University in England, said: ""It seems that the virus can pass from person to person without symptoms, making it extremely difficult to track, regardless of what health authorities do.""
""While it remains the case that most people who become infected will have light symptoms or none at all, such uncontrollable spread would present a serious risk to vulnerable individuals.""
Fontana urged residents to stay calm and stop panic buying.
""Rushing to stock up on food doesn't make any sense. There are enough supplies.""
Milan mayor Beppe Sala echoed his plea, saying: ""Rather than dashing to the supermarkets to grab food, perhaps we should spend time looking after the most vulnerable, such as old people, who are particularly at risk.""
Schools have been closed as a precaution in Lombardy, Veneto, Piedmont, Emilia Romagna and Friuli Venezia Giulia.
Piedmont shares a border with France, while the other regions neighbor Switzerland, Austria and Slovenia.
France has said there is no need to close borders in response to the spread of virus in Italy.
Hungarian authorities issued a warning to citizens travelling to northern Italy, asking them to postpone their trip if possible, while incoming passengers will be screened at Budapest and Debrecen airports for fever symptoms.
Croatia meanwhile suspended all school strips to Italy for a month and advised against travel to Lombardy and Veneto, Italian media reported.

Thousands of Russian-linked social media accounts have launched a coordinated effort to spread alarm about the new coronavirus, disrupting global efforts to fight the epidemic, US officials say.
The disinformation campaign promotes unfounded conspiracy theories that the United States is behind the COVID-19 outbreak, in an apparent bid to damage the US image around the world by seizing on health concerns.
State Department officials tasked with combating Russian disinformation told AFP that false personas are being used on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to advance Russian talking points in multiple languages.
""Russia's intent is to sow discord and undermine US institutions and alliances from within, including through covert and coercive malign influence campaigns,"" said Philip Reeker, the acting Assistant Secretary of State for Europe and Eurasia. 
""By spreading disinformation about coronavirus, Russian malign actors are once again choosing to threaten public safety by distracting from the global health response,"" he said.
The claims that have been circulating in recent weeks include allegations that the virus is a US effort to ""wage economic war on China,"" that it is a biological weapon manufactured by the CIA or part of a Western-led effort ""to push anti-China messages.""
US individuals including Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, a philanthropist who has spent billions on global health programs, have also been falsely accused of involvement in the virus.
The disinformation campaign was identified by US monitors in mid-January after Chinese officials announced a third death from the new coronavirus in Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak.
More than 2,340 people have since died, mostly in China, and the number of cases exceeds 76,000, most are in China.
- Close coordination observed -
Several thousand online accounts -- previously identified for airing Russian-backed messages on major events such as the war in Syria, the Yellow Vest protests in France and Chile's mass demonstrations -- are posting ""almost near identical"" messages about the novel coronavirus, according to a report prepared for the State Department's Global Engagement Center and seen by AFP.
The accounts -- run by humans, not bots -- post at similar times in English, Spanish, Italian, German and French and can be linked back to Russian proxies, or carry similar messages to Russian-backed outlets such as RT and Sputnik, it said. 
Russian state-funded media started pushing anti-Western messages about the cause of the epidemic on January 20, with operators of the social media accounts beginning to post globally the following day, US officials say.
""In this case, we were able to see their full disinformation ecosystem in effect, including state TV, proxy web sites and thousands of false social media personas all pushing the same themes,"" said Special Envoy Lea Gabrielle, the head of the State Department's Global Engagement Center, which is tasked with tracking and exposing propaganda and disinformation.
During many past news events, the accounts would post actively for up to 72 hours. But messages about the new coronavirus have been uploaded every day over the past month -- a sign, US officials said, of Russia's investment in a story unlikely to disappear soon from the headlines.
""In the Russian doctrine of information confrontation, this is classic,"" said another official from the Global Engagement Center. 
""The number of coronavirus cases globally hasn't reached its apex, so the Russian strategy is to very cheaply but very effectively take advantage of the information environment to sow discord between us and China, or for economic purposes.""
Experts saw parallels with previous conspiracy theories traced to Moscow, including a KGB disinformation campaign in the 1980s that convinced many around the world that US scientists created the HIV virus that causes AIDS.
US intelligence has also said that Russia interfered through social media manipulation in the 2016 election and seeks to do so again in 2020. The Kremlin has denied the charges and President Donald Trump has scoffed at suggestions of Russian help.

Bats are known carriers of this strain of the coronavirus, whose official name is SARS-CoV-2, but scientists think it spread to humans via another mammal species, possibly pangolins.
The US believes the latest Russian disinformation campaign is making it harder to respond to the epidemic, particularly in Africa and Asia, with some of the public becoming suspicious of the Western response.
The World Health Organization warned Friday that the window to stem the outbreak was narrowing, voicing alarm at a surge of cases with no clear link to China.
A State Department official said that Russian operatives appeared to have been given ""carte blanche"" to attack the US reputation.
""Whether or not a particular theme is being directed at the highest levels doesn't matter. It's the fact that they have freelance ability to operate in this space to do whatever damage they can, which could have seismic implications.""

TEHRAN - Iran on Saturday reported 1 more death among 10 new cases of coronavirus, bringing the total number of deaths in the Islamic republic to 5 and infections to 28.
""We have 10 new confirmed cases of COVID-19,"" health ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour said on state television.
""One of the new cases has unfortunately passed away,"" he added, noting that 8 of them had been hospitalized in Qom and 2 in Tehran, without specifying where the death occurred.
The COVID-19 outbreak first emerged in Iran on Wednesday, when officials said it killed 2 elderly people in Qom, a Shiite holy city south of the capital.
They were the first confirmed deaths from the disease in the Middle East.
Since then, Iran has carried out tests on 785 suspected cases, Jahanpour said.
""Most of the cases are either Qom residents or have a history of coming and going from Qom to other cities,"" the health ministry spokesman said.
Qom is a center for Islamic studies and pilgrims, attracting scholars from Iran and beyond. An official said the first 2 victims, who were Qom residents, had not left Iran.
Following the announcement of the deaths, neighboring Iraq on Thursday clamped down on travel to and from the Islamic republic, with its health ministry announcing people in Iran were barred from entering the country ""until further notice.""

A longer incubation period could complicate efforts to contain spread of the epidemic that has so far killed more than 2,000 people and spread outside China.

BEIJING - China is bringing in 7 cruise ships to house medical workers in Wuhan, state media said on Saturday, at a time when such ships are under scrutiny after hundreds of passengers on the Diamond Princess liner in Japan contracted the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
The first of these ships, the Blue Whale, arrived in Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, on Friday from Yichang, a nearby city down the Yangtze River.
The 7 ships will provide 1,469 beds in total.
Tens of thousands of medical workers have been brought into central Hubei province and its capital, Wuhan, from across China to help contain the coronavirus outbreak.
A senior Chinese health official said last week as of Feb. 11, 1,716 health workers had been infected by the coronavirus, including several who died.
The ships are normally used for river cruises in the Three Gorges scenic area, Xinhua added.
The ships are expected to provide safe dining and living conditions for medics to keep them refreshed as they fight the epidemic, state media said.
The Diamond Princess, held under quarantine in Yokohoma, Japan, since Feb. 3, has reported more than 630 cases, accounting for the biggest infection cluster outside China.
Several countries have already evacuated scores of passengers from the ship, which carried about 3,700 people. A second group of Chinese citizens from Hong Kong were among those flown home from Japan, Xinhua reported.

MELBOURNE - The Australian government said Saturday it would allow the return of some Chinese high school students who have been blocked from entering the country due to coronavirus restrictions, reopening its doors to a market that is key for the economy.
Thousands of Chinese students were prevented from heading to Australia after the long summer break for the start of school and university terms this month when the government imposed a travel ban for most people travelling from China.
Australian officials said the targeted easing of the ban would allow about 760 Chinese high school students - none from Hubei province, which is the epicenter of the outbreak - to apply to return.
The students would be considered on a case-by-case basis and those who were successful would be subjected to a 14-day self-imposed quarantine on arrival in Australia, officials said.
""It is incredibly important that we bring some normality back to the international student market,"" Education Minister Dan Tehan told reporters. ""It is a small step we are taking, it is a precautionary step.""
Tehan said the government would next week consider whether to allow the return of tertiary education students.
Chinese students made up almost 40 percent of the international higher education population in Australia in 2018, according to the most recent official data.
That broader population has grown by more than 10 percent over each of the past 3 years, contributing more than A$30 billion ($21 billion) to the domestic economy.
Australia introduced its travel restrictions on all foreign nationals who had been in China within 2 weeks of planned travel to Australia from entering the country.
Australian nationals and permanent residents were exempt from the ban, which has been extended twice and remains in place until Feb. 29.

SEOUL (UPDATE) - South Korea reported 142 more coronavirus cases Saturday, the sharpest spike in infections yet, with many new cases involving patients being treated in hospital for mental health issues.
The national toll of 346 is now the second-highest outside of China, with the jump in cases at the hospital in the southern city of Cheongdo following a similar spike among members of a religious sect in the nearby city of Daegu.
Among the new cases, 92 were ""related"" to patients or staff at Cheongdo Daenam Hospital, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) said.
""Most of the hospital's patients who have been diagnosed are those who had been staying as inpatients for mental illnesses,"" Seoul's vice health minister Kim Gang-lip told reporters.
Some cases show ""no confirmed epidemiological connections,"" meaning they are not sure where or how they contracted the virus, he added.
Authorities reported another death on Saturday, taking the toll to 2. Both victims had been inpatients at the hospital.
Almost 170 members of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus have now been infected, starting with a 61-year-old woman who attended at least 4 services at the church's Daegu branch before being diagnosed.
""Those who are related to Shincheonji's Daegu branch account for 48 percent of all confirmed cases,"" KCDC director Jung Eun-kyeong told reporters.
KCDC said some 9,300 Shincheonji members in Daegu have either been quarantined at facilities or have been asked to stay at home. Among them, 1,261 said they had symptoms, health officials added.
The mayor of Daegu -- South Korea's fourth-biggest city, with a population of over 2.5 million -- has advised locals to stay indoors, while access to a major US military base in the area has been restricted.
CHURCH 'DEEPLY SORRY'
One of the Shincheonji members in Daegu visited China -- where the deadly virus was first detected -- in January, while some 3 others are believed to have traveled to other countries, KCDC director Jung said.
Cheongdo, some 27 kilometers south of Daegu, is the birthplace of Shincheonji's founder Lee Man-hee.
County officials said on Friday that a 3-day funeral was held for one of the church members 3 weeks ago at a hall owned by the Cheongdo hospital.
Shincheonji is often accused of being a cult and claims its founder Lee has donned the mantle of Jesus Christ and will take 144,000 people with him to heaven on the day of judgement.
But with more church members than available places in heaven, they are said to have to compete for slots and pursue converts persistently and secretively.
President Moon Jae-in on Friday called for a ""thorough investigation"" of everyone who attended the funeral and Shincheonji services.
The central government on Friday had declared Daegu and Cheongdo ""special management zones,"" with Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun saying the region would be supported with medical personnel, beds and equipment.
Authorities in Seoul banned public rallies at 3 main locations on health and safety grounds.
The US army garrison in Daegu -- where around 10,000 soldiers, civilians and family members live or work -- has restricted access and instructed any American troops who recently attended Shincheonji services to self-quarantine.
Shincheonji offered an apology, suspending its worship services and gatherings nationwide.
""We are deeply sorry that because of 1 of our members, who thought of her condition as a cold because she had not traveled abroad, led to many in our church being infected and thereby caused concern to the local community,"" it said in a statement.
But its leader Lee told his followers the outbreak had been ""caused by the Devil"" and compared it to the biblical testing of Job, Yonhap news agency reported.

BEIJING (UPDATE) - The death toll in China from the new coronavirus outbreak rose by 109, the National Health Commission said Saturday, bringing the total number of fatalities to 2,345.
Another 397 new cases were reported nationwide, down from nearly 900 officially reported Friday, bringing the total number of cases to over 76,000.
The drop in new cases of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) came as officials in Hubei province -- whose capital city Wuhan is the epicenter the outbreak -- were ordered to revise figures to clear ""doubt"" around the data.
The number of new cases nationwide for Feb. 19 was revised up to 820 up from 394 previously reported, the National Health Commission said Saturday.
It also adjusted upwards the total confirmed cases for Feb. 20 by over 400 cases to 75,891.
The decision to amend Hubei's past data, which was announced on Friday by local authorities, is the latest in a string of changes made to Hubei's counting method -- further complicating efforts to track the spread of the illness.
Last week, Chinese health officials added patients from Hubei who had been diagnosed via clinical methods including lung imaging on top of those confirmed by lab tests.
But on Thursday, Hubei officials backtracked the decision and deducted 279 cases -- which they were ordered to re-add to the count on Friday.
The virus has spread to several parts of the world, triggering travel restrictions to and from China in some countries.

TOKYO - Newly released data from a Japanese research institute appears to back the government's case that its quarantine strategy for the Diamond Princess cruise ship was successful in stemming contagion of the coronavirus among passengers.
Japan has been criticized for its handling of the quarantine, as more than 620 people on board have been infected with the virus and 2 elderly passengers have died.
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has said the quarantine may not have been sufficient.
But a report released on Wednesday by the National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID) showed that the onset of symptoms from confirmed cases of COVID-19 peaked on Feb. 7 before tailing off to zero by Feb. 15.
Cases among crew were observed to steadily increase, peaking on Feb. 13.
""The decline in the number of confirmed cases, based on reported onset dates, implies that the quarantine intervention was effective in reducing transmission among passengers,"" according to the report. Later transmission ""appears to have occurred mostly among crew or within passenger cabins.""
The NIID is Japan's top research institute of infectious diseases.
More than 620 passengers have been infected on the ship, which has been quarantined since Feb. 3, initially with about 3,700 people on board. The health ministry announced on Thursday that 2 passengers in their 80s had died, the first fatalities from the ship.
The NIID report was ""very reassuring,"" said Kentaro Iwata, an infectious disease specialist from Kobe University Hospital who had been one of the harshest critics of the quarantine. After visiting the ship, Iwata had posted YouTube videos decrying the infection controls he saw.
The videos got over a million views before Iwata took them down, saying at a press briefing on Thursday that the new data and reports of improved controls on the ship convinced him that the government had responded to his criticism.
The United States, Canada and other nations evacuated their citizens ahead of the Feb. 19 end of the quarantine. Remaining passengers have been released in batches and advised by health authorities to stay at home and monitor their condition.
The health ministry will provide assistance to those returning passengers, as there is still a risk they could develop symptoms, said Koji Wada, a professor at the International University of Health and Welfare in Tokyo.
""We can say the quarantine has been done as we planned,"" said Wada, who has worked as an advisor on site at the Diamond Princess. ""I'm not sure if I can say it's a success.""

ROME - Taiwan on Wednesday imposed a ban on live pigs and pork product imports from Italy following Rome's suspension of flights between the 2 countries in response to the coronavirus outbreak.
Italy stopped all flights between the country and Taiwan, China as well as Hong Kong and Macau on Jan. 31 to stop the spread of the virus.
""Deletion of recognition of Italy as a country free of African swine fever,"" a statement published by the Taiwan's Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine said.
Rome's flight ban did not play well in Taipei, which summoned Italy's representative Davide Giglio to urge a speedy resumption of flights.
Beijing was also not happy with the ban and has lobbied to have it lifted but so far with no success.
Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio said earlier this month that the block on flights was an emergency measure.
""We will keep it in place as long as health authorities and... the scientific community tell us we should.""
Taiwan's imports of commercial goods from Italy amounted to $2.6 billion in 2019 with machinery, chemical products, leather, vehicles and textiles leading the list, according to the Taipei's representative office in Rome.
The website of Taiwan's state-owned Central News Agency reported the Taiwan government as saying: ""After conducting a rolling assessment of the international outbreak of African swine fever, the bureau has concluded that the epidemic on the Italian island of Sardinia is escalating.""

MANILA - A Filipino sailor who had contracted the novel coronavirus aboard a cruise ship moored off Japan's coast has been cleared of the disease, the Philippine Embassy in Japan said Wednesday.
The Filipino crew member of Diamond Princess has been given a clean bill of health and is scheduled to be discharged from hospital, the embassy added.
The sailor was then the first known case of a Filipino infected with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

As of Wednesday, 40 other Filipino crew members of the Carnival Corp-operated cruise liner are recuperating in medical facilities around Tokyo after catching the flu-like disease, which health authorities said can be transmitted between humans through close contact or droplets.
""The embassy is in touch with those who have been admitted to hospitals in order to ensure their well-being and to provide them any assistance they need,"" the embassy said.

DFA orders repatriation of Filipinos aboard virus-hit cruise ship in Japan

As the quarantine came to an end on Wednesday, the embassy, in coordination with the Japanese Government and the management of Princess Cruises, is threshing out details on the repatriation of the Filipino crew and passengers on board the Diamond Princess.
Filipino passengers cleared for disembarkation from the vessel will be repatriated at the soonest possible time, the embassy said.
Filipino crew members undergoing treatment have to be cleared of the disease first before they could return to the Philippines, it added.
At least 542 people on board the ship, which carries more than 3,700 guests and crew members, had tested positive for COVID-19.
The ship was kept in quarantine starting Feb. 3 after a passenger, who disembarked in Hong Kong, was found to be infected with the virus.
Hundreds are expected to disembark the ship in the coming days after testing negative for COVID-19 and completing the 14-day mandatory quarantine.

MANILA - Foreign Affairs Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr. has ordered the Philippine Embassy in Tokyo ""to immediately repatriate"" Filipinos aboard Diamond Princess off Japan's coast after the coronavirus-stricken cruise ship completed a 2-week quarantine.
""It’s our duty to take care [of] our Overseas Filipinos wherever they are. I want them home now!"" he wrote in a tweet on Wednesday.
Some 41 out of 500 Filipinos aboard the ship contracted the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the Department of Health (DOH) said.

DOH wants cruise ship passengers repatriated, quarantined; 41 positive for COVID-19

All of those who tested positive are crew members of the Carnival Corp-operated cruise liner. They were confined in hospitals in Japan and were responding well to the treatment, the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) had said.
The repatriates will have to undergo another 14-day quarantine in the Philippines, said Health Assistant Secretary for Public Health Services Maria Rosario Vergeire.
The ship was kept in quarantine since Feb. 3 after a passenger, who disembarked in Hong Kong, was found to be infected with the virus.
When the quarantine came to an end on Wednesday, more than 500 people were confirmed to have been infected by COVID-19, a new strain of coronavirus that originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan.
Earlier this month, the Philippine government repatriated 30 Filipinos from Wuhan. 
They are currently staying at the New Clark City in Capas, Tarlac for a 2-week quarantine, the incubation period of the virus.
The fast-spreading disease has killed more than 2,000 people and infected more than 74,000 others in China as of Wednesday.

,Feb 19 2020,nCov,Foreign pilots at Chinese airlines return home on unpaid leave as demand plummets,"Stella Qiu and Jamie Freed, Reuters","

BEIJING/SYDNEY - Foreign pilots at some Chinese airlines have returned to their home countries and are considering other jobs after being placed on unpaid leave as demand falls because of the coronavirus, affected flight crew told Reuters.
Meanwhile, Chinese pilots with greater job security said their income has been sharply reduced because most of their pay is based on flying hours.
Data firm OAG estimates about 80 percent of scheduled airline capacity to, from and within China has been cut this week because of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that has killed more than 2,000 people. Chinese airlines have been the hardest hit.
Major employers of foreign pilots, including China Southern Airlines Co Ltd and HNA Group's Hainan Airlines Holding Co Ltd, have acted swiftly to cut their losses, according to pilots and industry experts.
China Southern did not respond immediately to a request for comment, and HNA declined to comment.
""All the foreign pilots are on leave until the virus situation gets better,"" said an expatriate captain at China Southern who, like all of those who spoke to Reuters, requested anonymity because he was not authorized to speak with media. ""For the moment we are all in our home countries.""
Expats are typically paid more than local staff and work on contracts, which means they are more expendable in a downturn, industry experts said.
""We have seen pilots heading back to Australia in January and February due to the stand down and seeking new roles,"" said Kirsty Ferguson, the head of Sydney-based airline interview coaching firm Pinstripe Solutions.
As China's airline sector ballooned, it imported foreign experience: the number of foreign pilots flying with Chinese airlines more than doubled to over 1,500 between 2010 and 2019, according the Civil Aviation Administration of China.
China will need another 124,000 pilots in the next 20 years, according to Boeing, as an expanding middle class drives demand for air travel. But foreign pilots said being put on leave without pay makes it less likely they'll return when demand recovers.
A foreign captain at Fuzhou Airlines, part of HNA Group, said he was placed on unpaid leave when the virus hit and was concerned it would be permanent.
""They hope people will find other jobs as none can go without pay forever,"" he said. ""This way they 'save their face,' and secondly they don't feel obliged to dismiss you properly according to the contract.""
The pilot said that he was looking for jobs closer to home, but that so far those options paid less than in China. Foreign pilots can make more than $300,000 a year there, making it one of the best-paying markets in the world.
A pilot at Tianjin Airlines, also part of HNA Group, said he was told it would be at least three to four months before the carrier starts recalling expatriate captains. He has found work with another foreign airline, he said.
HNA declined to comment.
A local pilot at China Southern said he was barely flying and as a result was receiving only his base salary, roughly 1/6 to 1/8 of his normal pay.
""What we can do now is keep a good mentality and enjoy the company of our family at home,"" he said. ""Eat well, sleep well and exercise well and keep learning. Build up the energy so that we'll be well prepared for whatever comes later.""

GENEVA/SEOUL - There are no indications that there are cases of the new coronavirus in North Korea, a World Health Organization (WHO) official said, despite South Korean media reports suggesting the outbreak had spread to the isolated country.
""At the moment there are no signals, there are no indications we are dealing with any COVID-19 there,"" Dr. Mike Ryan, head of WHO's emergencies program, told a news conference in Geneva on Tuesday.
COVID-19 is the name of the disease caused by the new coronavirus.
WHO officials had ""no reason to believe that there are any specific issues"" going on in North Korea, and would be providing authorities in the North with more laboratory supplies to conduct diagnostic tests, Ryan said.
Some South Korean media outlets have reported multiple cases and possible deaths from the virus in North Korea, but there has been no independent verification.
On Tuesday, Rodong Sinmun, the official newspaper of North Korea's ruling party, quoted a public health official reiterating the country had ""no confirmed case of the new coronavirus so far.""
An outbreak of the disease - which has killed more than 2,000 people in neighboring China - could be devastating for the under-resourced health system in North Korea, experts said.

WHO urges calm as China virus death toll reaches 2,000 

Last week, the US State Department said it was ""deeply concerned"" about the possible impact of a coronavirus outbreak in North Korea and was prepared to facilitate efforts by US and international organizations to contain the spread of the virus there.
Aid organizations have called for exemptions from sanctions that restrict most trade and business with North Korea.
Already one of the most closed-off countries in the world, North Korea has stopped flights and train services with its neighbors, established month-long mandatory quarantines, suspended international tourism, and imposed a near-complete lockdown on cross-border travel.
The WHO has prioritized aid for North Korea, and a shipment of protective equipment and supplies was due to be shipped there this week, Ryan said.
""The government is very anxious as you can imagine, as all governments are, to make preparations and are seeking our technical and operational assistance to help them get ready,"" he said.

Vietnam's inaugural Formula One Grand Prix will take place in Hanoi in April as planned, organizers told AFP on Tuesday, avoiding the fate of the Chinese Grand Prix which was postponed over the deadly coronavirus outbreak.
The virus, which has killed more than 1,800 people in China, has trashed Asia's sporting calendar, forcing the postponement of top events including the Hong Kong Sevens rugby.
But Vietnamese authorities said the country's inaugural F1 race would go ahead as ""scheduled"" on April 5, Le Ngoc Chi, CEO of Vietnam Grand Prix told AFP.
That flies in the face of mounting fears over the spread of the virus from neighboring China and the risk of transmission among the crowds expected to make the journey to the Vietnamese capital.
""The time for the... F1 race will not be postponed or delayed,"" Tran Trung Hieu, deputy director of Hanoi's tourism department was quoted as saying by state media Tuesday.
""Although this is a sports event, it has a very huge impact on Vietnam and Hanoi's tourism,"" he said, adding all measures will be taken to ensure safety.
AFP reporters saw workers building stands at the racetrack as construction continued this week.
- Football friendly cancelled -
The go-ahead comes the same day Vietnam's football federation announced that an international friendly scheduled a week before the F1 race will be cancelled.
Vietnam and Iraq's national teams were supposed to play on March 26 as preparation for World Cup qualifiers
But the match has been cancelled because of the outbreak and at ""the request of the Iraq Football Federation"", said a statement from Vietnam's Football Federation.
Last week, Vietnam became the only country outside of China to enforce a mass quarantine of a community to contain a cluster of virus cases.
Checkpoints have been set up around the six villages that make up Son Loi, about 40 kilometers outside Hanoi after six people were detected with the virus there.
Vietnam, which shares a porous border with China, has 16 confirmed cases of the coronavirus, including those in Son Loi.
It banned all flights to and from mainland China in a bid to stop the virus from spreading.
It also suspended new tourist visas for Chinese nationals or foreigners who had been in China over the past two weeks.
The communist country will get its first taste of the glitz and glamour of Formula One with the Hanoi race, as the sport attempts to reach new markets in Southeast Asia.
Hanoi has bet big on the event's popularity, signing a 10-year, multi-million-dollar deal with Formula One last year which state media said would cost Vietnam $60 million per year.
The fee has been picked up in full by the country's largest private conglomerate, VinGroup, which is hoping to dazzle with a night race on a street track.
The commitment to hold the race will likely be welcomed by Formula One chiefs who are scrambling to fit the postponed Shanghai race into this season's schedule.
The Chinese GP, scheduled for April 19, last week joined the World Athletics Indoor Championships and European Tour and LPGA golf tournaments in being shelved because of the deadly outbreak.

MANILA - Southeast Asia's holiday hot spots, hit by billions in lost business from Chinese tourists, are turning to markets closer to home to soften the blow from travel restrictions caused by the coronavirus epidemic.
To make up for foregone revenues, firms in the region are dangling discounted airfares, hotel accommodation and tour add-ons in a bid to boost domestic travelers.
Home to rich culture, white sand beaches, diverse marine life, lively nightlife and affordable tours, Southeast Asia is the favorite for Chinese tourists, the region's top foreign visitors. But travel restrictions on China, the origin of the new coronavirus, since late January have led to losses in the region's hospitality sector.
In the Philippines, the government and tourism players last week launched a travel campaign led by President Rodrigo Duterte.
""Come with me and be my travel companion. I'll be travelling around the Philippines,"" Duterte said in video address, offering assurances that the virus posed no risks to local tourists in their own country.

Member firms of the Tourism Congress of the Philippines are offering discounts of up to 50 percent on hotels, free upgrades and complimentary items like breakfasts.
Other firms are offering individual customers corporate or government rates for tours and hotel accommodation, which are 15 percent to 30 percent cheaper, Arwin Paul Lingat, president of a tourism officers group, told Reuters.
Manila's Golden Phoenix Hotel has slashed its rates by two-thirds, its marketing director Christine Ann Ibarreta said.
LOCAL SWEETENERS
China's health authorities are reporting thousands of new cases daily of the coronavirus infection, which has killed 1,868 people, mostly in China. The flu-like virus' spread has also prompted countries to shut doors to Chinese travelers, who are a major source of growth for many Southeast Asian economies.

China virus death toll passes 1,800: gov't 

Southeast Asia welcomed more than 29 million mainland travelers in 2018, up 15 percent from a year earlier, data from the ASEAN Statistical Yearbook 2019 showed. That was nearly double the entire European market and almost 5 times the number of North American tourists.
Southeast Asian airlines are making fares attractive for cost-sensitive locals. Indonesia's biggest budget carrier, Lion Air, is reducing fares by up to 60 percent on select flights.
Philippines' largest carrier, Cebu Pacific, which has refunded 1.5 billion pesos ($29 million) to passengers, is offering seats on flights for as little as $2 before taxes while Philippine Airlines launched promotional discounts of 20 percent to 40 percent.
Thailand, Southeast Asia's biggest market for Chinese tourists, is now offering special packages for local elderly, which allows their expenses to be used for their children's tax deductions.
The Thai government is also providing tax breaks and soft loans to help slow job losses.
Vietnam, the region's second-largest market for Chinese tourists, said it would waive entrance fees to some tourist attractions when the outbreak is over. It has also simplified visa procedures for some non-Chinese arrivals. The coronavirus epidemic could wipe $5.9 billion to $7.7 billion from Vietnam's tourism earnings in the next 3 months.
Indonesia, Southeast Asia's largest economy, has also pledged to boost spending and incentives to soften the virus's business impact.
Bali, Indonesia's main tourist magnet because of its aquamarine water, white sand beaches and majestic cliffs, has seen 20,000 cancellations, said Hariyadi Sukamdani, head of the country's hotels and restaurants association.
In Kuala Lumpur, a 3,600-member industry group has planned for April its first ever ""Cuti Cuti Malaysia"" (Holiday in Malaysia) travel fair, exclusively focused on domestic tourism.
""Individual hotels, airlines, travel companies, theme parks, dive resorts, have reduced their normal rates, some by 20 percent and 30 percent,"" Tan Kok Liang, the industry group's president, told Reuters.
Despite the big push, industry experts do not expect local business to do much more than cushion the hit to the region's tourism sector.

""The domestic, to be honest, will not make up for what the international market brings here,"" Tourism Congress President Jose Clemente told a congressional hearing. ""Our objective right now is just to survive the storm... What we're trying to do is to have some cash flow.""

MANILA - Philippine government agencies on Tuesday announced it is safe to attend concerts and other big gatherings despite the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China.
A statement posted by the Department of Tourism (DOT) on its Twitter account said that it is “safe to organize and attend public gatherings, meetings and festivals as long as all precautionary measures identified by the DOH (Department of Health) are observed.”
The joint announcement by the DOH, DOT and the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) was meant to clarify an earlier advisory released by the DOH recommending people to avoid big crowds and cancel such events.

DOH recommends halting concerts as new coronavirus continues to spread

The three agencies reminded the public to practice good hygiene by washing hands regularly. It also urged those experiencing such symptoms as cough, colds, sore throat and fever to seek medical attention.
“All preventive and precautionary measures have been put in place by the national government to contain the spread of the COVID-19,” the agencies said.
They said guidelines are already in place in hotels and resorts across the country even before a temporary travel ban against travelers from China was imposed. It emphasized that facilities have infrared thermometers and hand sanitizers.
“The safety of the public, especially our tourists and employees in the tourism sector, remains the priority of the Philippine government,” it said.
As of Tuesday, there are more than 70,000 people infected with COVID-19, a new disease caused by a new strain of coronavirus that is believed to have originated from Wuhan city in China. 
There are already more than 1,800 deaths worldwide, mostly in China.
In the Philippines, there were 3 confirmed cases of COVID-19. While one of the Chinese travelers died due to the disease, the other two have already recovered.

BEIJING (UPDATE) - The head of a leading hospital in China's central city of Wuhan, the epicenter of a coronavirus outbreak, died of the disease on Tuesday, state television said, becoming the second prominent Chinese doctor to have succumbed to the pathogen.
Liu Zhiming, the director of Wuhan Wuchang Hospital, died at 10:30 a.m., it said.
Earlier this month, millions in China mourned the death of Li Wenliang, a doctor who was previously reprimanded for issuing an early warning about the coronavirus.

Death of Chinese doctor fuels anger, demands for change on China's handling of virus crisis

Tens of thousands of medical workers have been fighting to contain the spread of the coronavirus, believed to have first surfaced in a seafood market in Wuhan, the capital of the central province of Hubei.
As in the case of Li's death, there was confusion on the Chinese internet about Liu's condition on Monday night.
On Monday night, the Communist Party propaganda department of the Hubei Health Commission wrote in a social media post that Liu had died.
But it said in a subsequent post that Liu was alive.
""According to Liu's relative, the hospital is still trying its best to rescue him,"" the commission said in the second post, adding that the previous misinformation was from a good friend of Liu who was not aware of the latest situation.
It has not posted any message since state television announced Liu's death on Tuesday morning.
Beijing was accused of covering up the full extent of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003. In the current coronavirus outbreak, Beijing has called for transparency.
A senior Chinese health official said on Friday that 1,716 health workers have been infected by the coronavirus and 6 of them have died.

BEIJING - On a Friday night in one of Beijing's central shopping districts, the popular Megabox cinema is shuttered and empty.
Like entertainment venues across the capital, the 8-screen movie theater has been closed for nearly a month in response to the coronavirus outbreak that has swept China, infecting more than 70,000 people.
Glossy posters for this year's blockbusters hang inside the closed entrance, while a sign outside says it was closed to ""avoid spreading infections.""
No reopening date was given.
The government told hundreds of millions of people to stay home through the Lunar New Year holiday -- a crucial period in China's movie industry.
Normally, blockbuster films are released and consumers pack cinemas -- but this year, all was quiet.
The closures could have a devastating impact on China's film industry -- and its target to overtake the US this year as the biggest box office in the world.
With sales decimated in the first 2 months of the year, this now looks unlikely.
""Based on 2019, the contribution from Chinese New Year was about 20 to 30 percent of the total box office,"" said Wilson Chow, head of PwC's global technology, media and entertainment and telecommunications practice.
""It is really a big portion.""
'NOT OPTIMISTIC'
The takings at the box office on the first day of the new year in 2019 was $240 million, according to Chow.
This year, the same day managed just $300,000.
""I'm not very optimistic (of overtaking US sales this year),"" he said, describing the virus as ""a big blow to the industry.""
Film groups in China are only beginning to count the cost.
State-owned China Film Co. said during the New Year holiday last year it earned 144.03 million yuan ($20 million) at the box office -- nearly 8 percent of annual earnings.
This year, cinemas have closed and films the group has produced are postponed.
""The coronavirus outbreak has ground China's film industry to a halt,"" said Deloitte China's Polly Lee.
She says only 117,000 people went to the cinema during the first few days of the holiday -- compared with 130 million last year.
Shares in Shenzhen-listed Wanda Film have tumbled by more 25 percent since mid-January, with Hong Kong-listed iMax China down over 16 percent.
Chow warned older or less successful cinemas might be forced to close permanently.
'DESTROYING THE INDUSTRY'
The outbreak could also hit the pipeline.
Hengdian Studios -- China's largest film and TV production site -- said some production work began again last week, but only with crew members who have undergone a 14-day quarantine.
Beijing's Film Bureau promised to give financial support to production companies hit by the outbreak.
The loss of lucrative Chinese audiences will have a global impact.
According to state agency Xinhua, more than 40 non-domestic made films last year had box office sales over 100 million yuan ($14 million).
The virus has also caused waves in China's film circles.
One anticipated blockbuster, ""Lost In Russia,"" was set to be released during the new year holiday -- but the film studio, Huanxi Media, decided to release the film online instead of waiting for cinemas to reopen.
The studio signed a partnership to screen it for free with internet firm Bytedance, which paid Huanxi a 1-time fee of $90 million to release it on its Douyin and Toutiao platforms.
The move was popular with those trapped at home, but prompted a huge backlash from cinemas.
A joint letter signed by the country's biggest theater chains threatened to boycott future releases from Huanxi. 
It claimed the agreement was ""intentionally destroying the movie industry.""
GLOBAL IMPACT
The streaming giants have had an unexpected hit from the locked-down holiday, with shares surging for the likes of Baidu's Nasdaq-listed iQiyi and Bilibili.
iQiyi said it has brought forward the release of new programs and released VIP films for free viewing during the holiday.
Meanwhile others remain in limbo. Disney was hoping its new film Mulan -- based on the tale of a legendary Chinese warrior -- would be a huge hit with Chinese audiences.
Now the US entertainment giant, which will also face losses from closing its Disneyland parks in China and Hong Kong, can't even be sure when the film will open.
Even the Oscar awards felt the coronavirus impact.
The first film from Barack and Michelle Obama's production house, ""American Factory,"" won best documentary, about a Rust Belt factory reopened by a Chinese billionaire.
But the film's co-producer and the factory's chairman were unable to leave China for the ceremony -- due to US travel restrictions over the coronavirus.

HONG KONG - Pressures to scrap a Philippine travel ban on Hong Kong amid the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak continue to generate support with more than 100 Filipino organizations in one of China's special administrative regions petitioning President Rodrigo Duterte for it on Monday.
The appeal was received by Philippine Consul General Raly Tejada, who immediately assured the group he would relay their concerns to Manila. The government's Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Infectious Disease will meet Tuesday and tackle the travel ban issue.
""They will review the travel ban tomorrow and take into account all facts and reports necessary to make an informed decision,"" Tejada told ABS-CBN News.
Representatives of migrants' rights advocates, those from religious groups, and Filipinos permanently residing in Hong Kong handed the petition to the Philippine Consulate General office.
The Society of Hong Kong Accredited Recruiters of the Philippines (SHARP) said an estimated 25,000 Filipino workers have been affected by the ban that was imposed on Feb.2. Some Hong Kong residents who were vacationing for the Lunar New Year break were also caught flat-footed.
""We all feel that the travel ban, which was imposed without a warning or consultation, is unjustified and oppressive. It was decided upon without a comprehensive understanding of how it would affect us,"" the petition letter reads.
It said the ban was ""not even in line with health protocols set by the World Health Organization.""
The group said the Philippine government's response to the travel ban crisis ""leaves much to be desired"" as the P10,000 compensation from the Overseas Workers' Welfare Administration could not cover expenses incurred after being stranded at the airport.
""Moreover, non-OFWs were given 'no help at all' when many of them don't even have houses in the Philippines,"" the petition said.
""They are also in danger of suffering even more if they lose their jobs, as they pay high rents and other expenses such as school fees for their children in Hong Kong.""
Members of Migrante-Hong Kong echoed calls for the review of the travel ban, urging the government to grant exemption to returning migrant workers, students and residents.
The appeal was also conveyed in Manila when a separate Facebook-generated group, ""#StrandedPH"", consisting of mostly Filipino residents who are stranded in the Philippines, met with OWWA Administrator Hans Cacdac and Deputy Administrator Esther Margaux Uson on Monday.
Joms Ortega, one of the administrators of StrandedPh, said that the meeting 'went really well'.
""We're hopeful for good news soon. So pray na lang po tayo. Pero no promises pa rin talaga (So, let's just pray. But still, no promises),"" said Ortega in a public post on #StrandedPH.
The group said it hoped the Philippine government would ""understand the consequences of the ban to the OFWs,"" and that they were willing to sign a waiver of obligations for the Philippine government ""if anything undesirable happens to us"" in their return to work in Hong Kong.

MANILA - Locating hundreds of people who may have come in contact with a Chinese woman positive for the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) in the Philippines has reached a dead end, the Philippines' top health official said Monday.
""Wala na talaga. Mahirap ang contact-tracing natin,"" Health Secretary Francisco Duque III told radio DZMM.
(It's already a dead end. Contact-tracing has become difficult for us.)

Philippines confirms 3rd new coronavirus case

Instead of contact tracing, the country's health system will be focused instead on ""case management"" or the early detection and appropriate treatment of infected patients.
""Ang labanan dito ay case management na tayo, sa hospital talaga... 'Yong early detection, early testing, dapat maaga para maiwasan ang komplikasyon,"" Duque said.
(Fighting the disease is now through case management in the hospital. It involves early detection, prompt testing to avoid complications.)
As of Monday, Feb. 17, only 255 out of 740 people who may have come in contact with the country's third confirmed case of COVID-19 had been traced, the health department said in its latest advisory.
Of the number, 172 were interviewed wherein 155 completed their home quarantine. Fifteen patients who earlier exhibited flu-like symptoms were discharged while 2 left the country.
This includes the Chinese woman's co-passengers of her flights from Hong Kong to Cebu and staff of hotels and hospitals during her last stop in Bohol.

Meanwhile, authorities were able to locate 280 people who came in contact with the first 2 confirmed cases of COVID-19—a Chinese couple from Wuhan—in the country. The male Chinese tourist died.
Of the number, 221 had completed home quarantine while 14 were still ordered to self-isolate.
Of the 45 people who were considered patients under investigation (PUIs) after showing symptoms of the disease, 31 have already been discharged from the hospital, 6 are under strict monitoring, and another 6 have left the country after being discharged.



The Philippines is currently monitoring 171 patients suspected of contracting the new coronavirus strain while 350 have been discharged.
In China, the virus has killed more than 1,700 people and infected more than 70,000 others as Monday.

,Feb 17 2020,nCov,Japan issues coronavirus medical guidance as infections rise,Kyodo News,"
Another 99 on cruise ship in Yokohama test positive for coronavirus
TOKYO - Japan's health ministry issued guidance Monday for when people with symptoms consistent with the new coronavirus should consult medical institutions, as the country steps up efforts to contain the outbreak.
The ministry is now encouraging people who have had a temperature of 37.5 C or higher for four days, are feeling lethargic or are experiencing shortness of breath to contact local authorities in charge of responding to the outbreak by telephone.
The government's guidance is intended to give those worried about contracting the virus an idea of when to seek an advice from a doctor. Elderly people and those with underlying conditions such as diabetes and high blood pressure are viewed as more vulnerable to the respiratory disease, now officially named COVID-19.
The new coronavirus, which originated in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, has infected more than 510 people in Japan, including 454 people quarantined on a cruise ship, and a government panel of medical experts has said the country is at an early stage of infection.
The United States flew two chartered flights from Tokyo's Haneda airport on Monday morning to evacuate hundreds of its citizens from the cruise ship hit by the new coronavirus that has been quarantined in Yokohama. Japan also evacuated more of its nationals as well as their family members from Wuhan and surrounding areas.
With infections climbing, Japan is scrambling to strengthen its virus testing capabilities and prepare medical facilities to treat infected people.
Speaking at a press conference, health minister Katsunobu Kato noted that people with colds or influenza tend to see their health recover after three to four days on average while those infected with the new coronavirus do not.
Kato also asked individuals who have developed cold-like symptoms to keep track of their temperature and refrain from going to work or school.
Hundreds of U.S. citizens from the Diamond Princess left Yokohama port near Tokyo around 1:40 a.m. Monday on 10 Japanese Self-Defense Forces coaches with drivers in protective suits.
Among the evacuees, 44 tested positive for the virus, The Washington Post said, quoting Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.
Fauci told CBS news that those who tested positive are ""going to be in hospitals in Japan,"" adding, ""the degree of transmissibility on that cruise ship is essentially akin to being in a hot spot.""
The 328 evacuees who were allowed to board the U.S.-chartered flights will be quarantined for 14 days and housed at Travis Air Force Base in California or Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland in Texas.
Japan had been in contact with the United States about the possibility of evacuating the U.S. citizens since the early stages of the quarantine that began on Feb. 3, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said.
""We understand that the United States has made its own decision after comprehensively taking into account such factors as reducing the burden on our country,"" Abe told a parliamentary session.
Australia, Canada, Hong Kong and Israel have also said they are preparing to send chartered flights to Japan to evacuate their citizens from the vessel. Around 3,000 passengers and crew remain on the ship.
Medical and other staff who may have had close contact with those aboard the ship have also contracted the virus, with a Japanese health ministry official in his 50s who worked as a liaison on the vessel hospitalized after testing positive for the virus.
In a separate case in Kanagawa Prefecture near Tokyo, a nurse who had taken care of a woman in her 80s who later became the first domestic fatality of the viral outbreak last week was also confirmed as infected with the virus.
The nurse in her 40s developed a fever and vomited on Friday. She took a virus test the following day due to her close contact with the elderly woman who died Thursday, according to the local government.
Abe told parliament that the government plans to start airing TV commercials to raise awareness about the new coronavirus later Monday, while it will also strive to provide more information in English.
Japan's fifth chartered flight to evacuate its nationals from Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, arrived at Haneda airport Monday morning. On the Boeing 767 were 36 Japanese citizens and 29 family members who are Chinese.
All Japanese citizens and their family members of other nationalities in Hubei Province who had wished to return to Japan have done so. The government believes its evacuation operation using chartered flights is complete, according to the Foreign Ministry.
Of the 65 passengers, 13 were aged 12 or younger and six were aged 60 or above. Twenty-eight of the evacuees were residents of Wuhan, while 37 were from other cities in the province.
They will undergo screening and those without symptoms will stay at a state facility in Saitama Prefecture, north of Tokyo, the government said.
The government will continue to provide support to ensure the safety of those who remain in the Chinese province as well as travelers, the ministry said.
A total of 828 people returned to Japan on the five chartered flights.

TOKYO - Japan evacuated more citizens from the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak on Monday, while the disease's spread prompted a hospital to stop accepting new patients and raised the possibility of restricting participants at next month's Tokyo Marathon.
A fifth government-chartered flight carrying 65 Japanese arrived in Tokyo from Wuhan, China, early on Monday, bringing the total number repatriated from the city to 763, broadcaster NHK reported.
With more than 400 people infected, most of whom are passengers on a cruise ship docked in Yokohama, Japan is the country most affected by the epidemic behind China, where the outbreak was first detected in December and which has now killed more than 1,700 people.
A hospital in Sagamihara, 50 kilometers (31 miles) west of Tokyo, said it would suspend admissions of new patients as one of its nurses tested positive for the virus after treating a patient who later died of the disease.
The widening fallout is damaging output and tourism in Japan, undermining growth and potentially pushing the country into recession, analysts say.

More Pinoys on Japan cruise ship positive for COVID-19 infection

The risk that cases in Japan may increase is threatening to limit one of the world's biggest marathons, scheduled for March 1.
Organizers of the Tokyo Marathon are considering restricting the number of general participants in this year's race as a precaution against the further spread of infection, the Asahi newspaper reported, citing unnamed sources.
Marathon organizers were not immediately available for comment.
Trimming down the size of the marathon, which has more than 300,000 entrants this year, would be the latest effect on an international sporting event in Japan due to the virus.
The FIBA Asia Cup 2021 has postponed a qualifying basketball match between Japan and China, which was initially scheduled to be held in Chiba, near Tokyo, later this week.
As hundreds of passengers prepare to be evacuated from the quarantined cruise ship, one member of the testing team from Japan's health ministry has tested positive for the disease, the ministry said.
Companies are stepping up measures to prevent the spread of the virus, SARS-CoV-2 as the number of infections in the country ticks up daily. A growing number of cases have been reported in people who have neither visited China nor have had direct contact with people arriving from the country.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp, one of Japan's biggest companies, said it was urging its roughly 200,000 group-wide employees to work from home or stagger their commutes.
On Friday, NTT Data Corp said an external employee who works at one of its buildings was confirmed with the coronavirus. The company had ordered 14 workers who had come into close contact with this person to work at home, it said.

TOKYO—The United States said it would send an aircraft to Japan to bring back U.S. passengers on the quarantined cruise ship Diamond Princess, where the most coronavirus infections outside China have occurred.
The U.S. Embassy in Tokyo said in a letter on Saturday to passengers that a chartered plane would arrive in Japan on Sunday evening and that it recommended ""out of an abundance of caution"" that U.S. citizens disembark and return home for further monitoring.
The passengers would be required to undergo further quarantine of 14 days upon arriving in the United States and if they choose not to return on the flight, they would not be able to return home ""for a period of time"", the letter said.
""We understand this is frustrating and an adjustment, but these measures are consistent with the careful policies we have instituted to limit the potential spread of the disease,"" it said.
It also said passengers would be screened before the flight and the U.S. government was working with Japan so that any people with symptoms would receive proper care if they could not board the plane.
Japan confirmed it was coordinating with the U.S. government for Americans to leave the ship and return home, saying that would ease its burden in resolving the situation.
Other countries might follow suit and ask to bring back their own citizens from the ship before the quarantine period ends next week, a Japanese government official told reporters.
The cruise ship, owned by Carnival Corp, has been quarantined since arriving in Yokohama on Feb. 3, after a man who disembarked in Hong Kong before it traveled to Japan was diagnosed with the virus.
It had some 3,700 passengers and crew on board. Another 67 people have tested positive for the virus, Japanese Health Minister Katsunobu Kato said on Saturday, bringing the total to 285 cases. Those testing positive are transferred to Japanese hospitals.
Japanese public broadcaster NHK has reported that there were more than 400 U.S. citizens on board.
The cruise liner's quarantine is set to end on Wednesday and while some passengers were disheartened at the prospect of more time in quarantine, others were more understanding.
""They are very concerned about spreading the virus, and there’s no good way to transport people from Japan without possible transfer of virus, so it is the logical thing to do,"" Sawyer Smith, 25, told Reuters.
The plane will land at Travis Air Force Base in California and some passengers will then continue onward to Lackland Air Force Base in Texas.
The letter did not specify how long U.S. citizens who choose not to board the chartered flight might have to wait before they could return home, saying only that the final decision would be up to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

SHANGHAI/BEIJING—China must make every effort to maintain economic and social control as it battles the coronavirus epidemic, and avoid causing panic that could lead to secondary ""disasters,"" President Xi Jinping told senior officials earlier this month.
Reuters reported this week that Xi had warned officials on Feb. 3 that efforts to contain the new coronavirus had gone too far, threatening the economy. Those comments came days before Beijing rolled out measures to soften the blow.
The epidemic has become a major test for Xi in how to balance stamping out the epidemic with protecting an economy already growing at its slowest in nearly three decades.
His Feb. 3 speech to the Politburo's Standing Committee was published in full by the leading Communist Party theoretical journal Qiushi on Saturday. It showed how Xi had urged officials to roll out policies to support the economy even as they worked to control the spread of the coronavirus.
In the speech, he said that the epidemic, which has killed more than 1,500 people and infected over 66,000 so far, was impacting the economy, especially service industries. Actions needed to be taken to maintain China's industrial chain and encourage enterprises to resume production, he said.
China ""still has to adhere to this year's economic and social development goals"", Xi said in the speech.
He also said it was necessary to increase financial support, such as preferential policies for loan interest rates and terms, and get migrant workers in major industries back to work.
Big projects, especially those in manufacturing, should start construction on time, he said, adding that boosting consumption was an important hedge against the epidemic's impact. Work should be done to promote the wider adoption of 5G technology, as well as the purchase of products associated with healthy living and cars, Xi added.
The epidemic had revealed ""shortcomings and deficiencies"" in national governance, he said, such as how the wildlife animal industry had remained huge despite clear risks in their consumption, and how the country's reserves of health and anti-epidemic materials were seriously inadequate.
A tendency to insist on formalities and bureaucracy have also emerged, creating problems in fighting the epidemic, he said, adding that party members who did not adequately engage in the work must be held accountable and removed from their posts.
He also said he gave instructions on preventing and containing the coronavirus on Jan. 7, when he chaired another Politburo Standing Committee meeting. China first confirmed that the virus had passed from person-to-person and infected some medical staff on Jan. 20. (Reporting by Brenda Goh and Huizhong Wu; Editing by Andrew Cawthorne)

An 80-year-old Chinese tourist has died from the new coronavirus in France, the first death confirmed outside of Asia, French Health Minister Agnes Buzyn said on Saturday.
Buzyn said she had been told about the death of the patient -- in hospital in Paris since late January -- late on Friday, adding that his condition ""had deteriorated rapidly"" after several critical days.
The virus originated late last year in China, where it has since infected more than 66,000 people and killed more than 1,500.
Three deaths from the virus have so far been recorded outside mainland China -- in the Philippines, Hong Kong and Japan.
The scale of the epidemic ballooned this week after officials in the Chinese province of Hubei -- the epicenter of the outbreak -- changed their criteria for counting cases, adding thousands of new patients to the tally.
Some 56 million people in Hubei and its capital Wuhan are now living under quarantine, virtually sealed off from the rest of the country in an effort to contain the virus.
Away from China, almost 600 cases have been confirmed -- roughly 35 of which have been reported in the European Union.
Six people with the virus remain in hospital in France, Buzyn said, adding that none were seriously ill.

MANILA - All public Masses in Singapore have been suspended indefinitely starting Saturday, Feb. 15, to curb the spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Singapore said Friday.
""As Catholics, we need to be responsible in playing our part to contain the spread of this virus by avoiding large gatherings of people,"" Archbishop of Singapore William Goh said in a statement.
Also suspended are large gatherings, such as sessions, retreats and seminars.
Weddings and funerals, which are considered private services where only invited guests can attend, are allowed, but arrangements will have to be made with the parish priest.
""Thank you for your patience and understanding. Let us continue to pray for each other, especially those who have succumbed to this illness... Pray also for those in the front-lines -- the doctors and the nurses -- who are putting their own well-being in the service of the sick,"" Goh added.
The Philippine Embassy in Singapore also advised Filipinos to observe the precautionary measures against the disease.
In Singapore, there are 58 confirmed cases of COVID-19 as of Friday, data from the World Health Organization (WHO) show. Of this number, 36 are attributed to possible local transmission.
To fulfill the obligation of keeping the Day of the Lord holy, the Catholic faithful in Singapore are advised to follow the broadcast of the Mass on the CatholicSG Youtube channel; gather as a family for the Liturgy of the Word by spending time together in prayer, reading the Word of God of the Sunday Liturgy, and interceding for the world; or spend at least half an hour in quiet time to pray and read the Word of God.
The Catholic Church in Hong Kong earlier implemented a similar measure amid the threat of the COVID-19 outbreak.
All public Masses were suspended for 2 weeks in Hong Kong, which has recorded 53 confirmed cases of coronavirus infection and 1 death.

BEIJING - China is disinfecting and isolating used banknotes as part of efforts to stop the spread of the new coronavirus that has killed more than 1,500 people, officials said Saturday.
Banks use ultraviolet light or high temperatures to disinfect yuan bills, then seal and store the cash for 7 to 14 days -- depending on the severity of the outbreak in a particular region -- before recirculating them, China's central bank said at a press conference.
The virus, which has infected more than 66,000 people in China and spread to more than 2 dozen other countries, has sparked a rush to disinfect public places and minimize contact between people.

Death toll in China epidemic surges past 1,500

Pharmacies across the country sold out of disinfectants and surgical masks in just days after a lockdown was announced in late January on Wuhan city, where the COVID-19 illness is believed to have emerged.
Office buildings have installed packets of tissue in elevators that tenants are encouraged to use when pressing buttons, while ride-hailing company Didi exhorts drivers to disinfect their cars daily.
'EMERGENCY ISSUANCE'
Fan Yifei, deputy governor of China's central bank, said Saturday that banks have been urged to provide new banknotes to customers whenever possible.
The central bank made an ""emergency issuance"" of 4 billion yuan in new notes to Hubei province, the epicenter of the outbreak, prior to the recent Lunar New Year holiday, Fan added.
The measures are intended to ""secure the public's safety and health when using cash,"" Fan said.
But it is unclear how wide an impact the central bank's disinfection work will have, with increasing numbers of Chinese people preferring mobile payments over cash in recent years.
In 2017, nearly three-quarters of Chinese respondents told an Ipsos survey they could survive a whole month without using more than 100 yuan in cash.
According to the World Health Organization, COVID-19 can be spread through contaminated objects in addition to droplets and direct contact with infected patients.

LOS ANGELES - Hawaii health authorities began a search on Friday for anyone who may have had close contact with a Japanese tourist who fell ill on the island of Oahu and tested positive for a new coronavirus soon after returning to his home country.
The case came to public attention at a Honolulu news conference by Gov. David Ige and senior state health officials, who said the man in question is believed to have become infected in Japan before embarking on his trip, or while en route to Hawaii.
That assumption is based on the 14-day incubation period of the virus, and the fact that the man became symptomatic after less than a week in Hawaii, the state health officials said.
The patient and his wife visited the island of Maui from Jan. 28 to Feb. 3, then traveled to Oahu, where they stayed until flying on Feb. 7 back to their home in the Aichi Prefecture of central Japan, the officials said.
The man had exhibited no sign of illness until reaching Oahu, where he first developed cold-like respiratory symptoms but no fever, the state's health direct, Dr. Bruce Anderson, told reporters.
Once back in Japan, he became more seriously ill and was tested for the coronavirus after going to a hospital, Anderson said.
Hawaii officials were notified through the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Friday, and state authorities in turn alerted local health providers to be on the lookout for coronavirus-like illnesses.
""We do believe that this is a serious concern, and I want to assure you that this scenario is exactly what we've been preparing for and are prepared for,"" the governor said.
The greatest immediate focus is to identify and track down individuals who had ""prolonged, face-to-face contacts"" with the Japanese man after he began showing symptoms on Oahu, said Dr. Sarah Park, the state's chief epidemiologist.
Based on what is known about transmission of the disease, the patient was unlikely to have been contagious while on Maui because he was asymptomatic then, and anyone who had fleeting, incidental contact with him after he became ill, such as passing him in a hallway, would be considered at low risk, Park said.
The man's apparent lack of fever while in Hawaii also bodes well because infected individuals are believed to be most contagious when feverish, she said.
The man's precise travel itinerary remained unclear, except that he stayed at a Hilton Grand Vacations time-share condo in the Waikiki section of Honolulu, Anderson said, adding that he only sought medical care upon returning to Japan.
State health officials said they were consulting Japanese authorities to get more details of his Hawaii visit.
Hawaii, the US Pacific island state closest to the origin of the coronavirus outbreak, has seen no infections documented on its soil, while the number of US cases confirmed nationwide stands at 15, none fatal. Eight cases are in California.
The worldwide total now exceeds 66,000 cases, with more than 1,500 deaths, most of them in China's Hubei province, the epicenter of the outbreak.
Beyond China, nearly 450 cases have been tallied in some 24 countries and territories, and 3 deaths. Japan is among the nations hardest hit, with 251 confirmed cases, most of them on a cruise liner quarantined in a port.
Japan confirmed its first coronavirus death on Thursday.

MANILA - The Bureau of Immigration (BI) said Saturday it had implemented the lifting of travel restriction the Philippines imposed on Taiwan due to the outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
BI Commissioner Jaime Morente said he had instructed all immigration personnel to allow foreigners and Filipinos to travel to and from the self-governing territory.
""We have received an order from the Office of the President yesterday [Friday] afternoon lifting the travel restrictions,"" Morente said.
""This follows the resolution of the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Infectious Disease (IATF), which we are bound to implement immediately. Hence, travel may now be made by any foreign national to Taiwan from the Philippines and vice versa,"" he added.
Also allowed to enter the Philippines are members of the diplomatic corps traveling from Taiwan, regardless of nationality.

Philippines lifts travel ban to Taiwan

The decision to lift the ban, announced Friday, came as Taiwan threatened sanctions against the Philippines, including scrapping visa-free privilege for Filipinos.
Presidential spokesperson Salvador Panelo had said the task force reached the decision given strict measures and protocol Taiwan had been undertaking against the spread of the virus.
Taiwan said it had only 18 cases of the virus compared to more than 66,000 in China.
Nearly 160,000 Filipinos live and work in Taiwan, mainly in factories and as household helpers.
Philippine immigration authorities currently do not allow foreign travelers from China and and its special administrative regions Hong Kong and Macau to enter Manila.

Death toll in China epidemic surges past 1,500

The COVID-19, which has killed more than 1,500 people and infected more than 66,000 others, originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan.
Only Filipinos and permanent resident visa holders are allowed to enter the Philippines. Filipinos are also temporarily barred from traveling to China.
The task force, Morente said, is ready to enforce the possible lifting of the travel ban in other territories. This as Palace officials said Friday the ban would undergo periodic review.
""We are on standby, ready to implement any policy change as deemed appropriate by the IATF,"" he said.

MELBOURNE - The Chinese gymnastics team entered into next week's World Cup in Melbourne has pulled out due to Australian government travel restrictions put in place to limit the coronavirus outbreak, organizers said Saturday.
The restrictions on foreign nationals traveling from China were introduced in early February and extended for another week on Thursday.
The extension effectively rules out China's participation at the Feb. 20 to 23 World Cup, which offers qualifying points for this year's Tokyo Olympics.
""It has been a very challenging few weeks for us all, but none more so than for the Chinese gymnasts and officials who have been training and preparing to come to Melbourne,"" Gymnastics Australia CEO Kitty Chiller said in a statement.
""I have been in regular contact with the Chinese Gymnastics Association and its President, who informs me all of their delegation are well and have shown no sign of infection.""
""Despite this, we all have to respect the Australian Government's travel restrictions.""
Among the 12 Chinese entries listed on the World Cup's website are 4-time world champion Zhang Chenglong, who claimed the men's team gold at the 2012 London Olympics and bronze at the Rio Games.
Zhang's Rio teammates You Hao and Liu Yang will also miss out, along with Xiao Ruoteng, a former men's all-around world champion.
Chinese athletes in other sports have also suffered disruptions to Olympic preparations.
The entire Chinese women's soccer team and staff were confined to a Brisbane hotel for nearly 2 weeks due to quarantine restrictions after arriving in Australia in late-January for an Olympic qualifying tournament.
The coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak has killed more than 1,500 people, mostly in China's central Hubei province. Confirmed infections have risen above 66,000.

Another repatriate, a 25-year-old woman, will also be brought to the Bataan General Hospital and Medical Center “for further evaluation and management after exhibiting anxiety-related symptoms.”
Asked if the patient’s anxiety-related symptoms could be because of her isolation or repatriation, Vergeire said, “We can’t say for now.”
Experts at the hospital will be able to determine the patient's condition. 
“Ang pinakita niyang sintomas, hindi makatulog at balisa po siya,"" she said.
(The symptoms she's showing is inability to sleep and feeling restless.)
Vergeire assured the public the symptoms of the repatriates will be managed. She also said both are not related to COVID-19, which has infected over 60,000 people and has killed more than 1,300 in China as of Friday.
The 30 Filipino repatriates and government personnel who assisted them were kept in isolation rooms at the New Clark City upon their arrival last Sunday. They were repatriated amid travel restrictions on China and its territories.

On Tuesday, a 34-year-old female repatriate and an infant were admitted to the regional hospital because of diarrhea. Both tested negative for COVID-19 as well.

They also returned to New Clark City to finish the 14-day quarantine.
While local government officials have expressed concerns that the repatriates might be infected with the dreaded disease, none have tested positive for COVID-19. 
There are no announcements yet if another batch of overseas Filipino workers will be repatriated from Wuhan, the epicenter of the disease, or other areas in China.

,Feb 14 2020,nCov,Virus could mean $5 billion in airline losses: UN agency,Agence France-Presse,"



MONTREAL, Canada - The new coronavirus outbreak could mean a reduction of $4 to 5 billion in worldwide airline revenue, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) said Thursday. 
The UN agency reported that 70 airlines have canceled all international flights in and out of China and 50 others have reduced their operations. 
Preliminary estimates show this has meant a reduction of nearly 20 million passengers compared to expectations for the first quarter of 2020. 
That figure equates to potential lost revenue of up to $5 billion, the agency said.
The virus has killed 1,483 people in China and infected more than 64,600 there. Overseas, nearly 600 cases have emerged in around 30 locations
""Prior to the outbreak, airlines had planned to increase capacity by 9 percent on international routes to/from China for the first quarter of 2020 compared to 2019,"" ICAO said in a statement.
The reality has been a reduction in foreign airline traveler capacity of 80 percent. 
Japan looks to be hardest-hit from a reduction in Chinese air travelers in the first quarter, ICAO said. The country could lose $1.29 billion in tourism revenue, with Thailand not far behind at a $1.15 billion loss potential. 
ICAO said the effects of the COVID-19 virus outbreak on the airline industry are expected to be larger than the 2002-2003 SARS epidemic because flight cancellations are more widespread this time. 
In addition, China's international air traffic has doubled and its domestic air traffic increased 5-fold in the last 17 years. 
Chinese authorities have locked down Hubei province, the virus epicenter, and have restricted movements in several cities as part of an unprecedented effort to contain the virus.
Britain, Germany, the US, Japan and others have advised against travel to China.

MANILA - President Rodrigo Duterte has urged Filipinos to travel around the Philippines in light of fears on international travel due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak.
Duterte, in a taped message, called on the public to boost local tourism as tour operators reported at least P10 billion in losses due to a travel ban to and from China, the country's second largest tourism market and epicenter of the deadly virus.
“To my fellow Filipinos, I encourage you to travel with me around the Philippines. I assure you that everything is safe in our country, be it an issue of health, be it an issue of law and order and be it an issue of accessibility,” the President said.
“Come with me and be my travel companion. I’ll be traveling around the Philippine. Pasyal tayo dito sa atin. Unahin natin 'yung atin. Mabuhay ang Pilipino. Mabuhay ang turismo ng Pilipinas,” he added.
(Let’s tour around and prioritize our country. Cheers to the Filipino people and Philippine tourism.)
Duterte, who met with airline companies earlier this week, said carriers and hotels had agreed to lower rates “so that we can be a viable market.”
“Maraming magagandang mapuntahan sa Pilipinas, wala kayong dapat alalahanin,” he said.
(There are many beautiful places in the Philippines. You don’t have to worry about a thing.)

 
The Philippines has imposed travel restrictions on China and its territories in a bid to control the spread of the COVID-19.
China is the Philippines second largest source of foreign tourist arrivals, next only to South Korea, and accounts for nearly a fifth of the total, tourism department data showed.
Earlier this month, Tourism Secretary Bernadette Romulo-Puyat said the government was eyeing to boost promotions in South Korea and the United States, the Philippines' top and 3rd largest tourist markets, respectively.

BEIJING - China's death toll from the new coronavirus epidemic was revised downwards to 1,380 on Friday after officials said some fatalities had been counted more than once.
The National Health Commission removed 108 deaths after discovering ""duplicate statistics"" in hard-hit central Hubei province, according to its daily update, without providing more details.
The commission also subtracted 1,043 from the total number of confirmed infections in Hubei after a ""verification.""
The death toll now stands at 1,380 even after accounting for 116 new deaths in Hubei and 5 others reported elsewhere in China on Friday, according to the commission.
The total number of cases has now risen to 63,851.
The extent of the epidemic seemed to deepen on Thursday after authorities in Hubei started counting patients who were diagnosed through lung imaging, in addition to those who undergo lab tests.
The revision added nearly 15,000 patients to Hubei's count in a single day, with officials explaining that past cases were included. The first cases emerged in December in Wuhan, Hubei's capital.
Hubei reported more than 4,800 new cases on Friday.

TOKYO - Japan on Friday vowed to step up testing and containment efforts for the coronavirus after suffering its first death and the confirmation of new cases, including a doctor and taxi driver.
Japan's health ministry said Thursday that a woman in her 80s living in Kanagawa prefecture, just to the west of Tokyo, had died. She was transferred between hospitals as her condition worsened and was only confirmed to have the coronavirus after her death.
A Tokyo taxi driver, who Japanese media said was the woman's son-in-law, as well as a man in his 20s just east of Tokyo and a doctor in Wakayama, western Japan, were also confirmed to have the virus.
""We will stay in touch with local governments and expand our testing procedures and treatment of patients in order to prevent the spread of the illness,"" Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told reporters, a day after a task force on the disease drew up new measures to deal with it, including spending 10.3 billion yen from budget reserves.
Planners will also keep in close contact with Japan's military, chief cabinet secretary Yoshihide Suga told a news conference, without giving further details.
He said the number of people confirmed to have the virus in Japan had risen to 33, with another 218 on a cruise ship quarantined at a port in Yokohama.
Japanese media reported after Suga's remarks that a man in Wakayama, at the same hospital as the doctor, had also tested positive.
Both Suga and health minister Katsunobu Kato said there was no evidence the coronavirus, dubbed SARS-CoV-2, was spreading widely in Japan, although Kato said that it might and that the government needed to prepare for that situation.
Separately, some passengers on the cruise ship Diamond Princess, which has been moored Yokohama, just south of Tokyo, were set to start disembarking on Friday instead of waiting for the originally targeted date of Feb. 19.
Elderly passengers who have medical conditions or are in windowless rooms can complete their quarantine onshore, Kato said.
The ship was quarantined on arrival in Yokohama, near Tokyo, on Feb. 3 after a man who disembarked in Hong Kong before it traveled to Japan was diagnosed with the virus, which has now killed more than 1,350 people in mainland China.
About 80 percent of the ship's passengers are 60 or older, with 215 in their 80s and 11 in their 90s, according to Japanese media. The ship, managed by Princess Cruise Lines and owned by Miami-based Carnival Corp, typically has a crew of 1,100 and a passenger capacity of 2,670.

TOKYO - A taxi driver in Tokyo has tested positive for the coronavirus, NHK public TV reported, marking a further spread of the disease in Japan even as authorities said some passengers aboard a ship quarantined off its coast would finally be allowed to disembark.
The broadcaster, quoting sources, said the health ministry was trying to trace the route of the contagion, adding that the driver said he had carried passengers who appeared to be Chinese.
No further details were immediately available, including word on the condition of the man, who NHK said was in his 70s. The case is likely to raise further concerns about the spread of the flu-like virus given how many people a city taxi driver has likely been in contact with.
The news came after Japan said it would allow some elderly passengers on the quarantined cruise liner who test negative for the new coronavirus to disembark ahead of schedule and another 44 new cases were confirmed aboard the Diamond Princess.
Health Minister Katsunobu Kato said elderly passengers who have preexisting conditions or are in windowless rooms would be allowed to leave starting from Friday, rather than the originally targeted date of Feb. 19, and complete their quarantine ashore.

Japan cruise ship virus cases jump to 218

With the number of those infected on the cruise ship now up to 218 plus 1 quarantine officer, concerns have been raised about conditions on the ship, where about 3,500 people remain on board.
The liner was quarantined on arrival in Yokohama, near Tokyo, on Feb. 3 after a man who disembarked from the liner in Hong Kong before it traveled to Japan was diagnosed with the virus that has now killed more than 1,350 in mainland China.
About 80 percent of the ship passengers were aged 60 or over, with 215 in their 80s and 11 in their 90s, according to Japanese media. The ship typically has a crew of 1,100 and a passenger capacity of 2,670.
Separately, NHK also reported on Thursday what a doctor in central Japan had tested positive for the virus. It was not immediately clear whether he had any connection to China.
Hundreds of infections have been reported in more than 2 dozen countries and territories besides China, but only 2 people have died from the virus outside mainland China - 1 in Hong Kong and another in the Philippines.

Japanese nationals who have been staying in hotels or other facilities since returning on 4 charter flights from China's Wuhan, the epicenter of the epidemic, have begun going home.
All 197 people from a Jan. 29 flight who tested negative were either home or en route and another 200 or so from a second flight could head home later on Thursday, NHK said.

TOKYO - Japan will take emergency steps against the spread of the new coronavirus worth 15.3 billion yen (P7 billion), Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said Thursday.
The amount includes 10.3 billion yen from reserve funds in the state budget, Abe said, adding that the Cabinet will approve its use on Friday.
As face masks are in short supply across the country, Abe said the government aims to secure over 600 million units a month by encouraging companies to boost output.

MANILA - The number of Filipinos confirmed to have contracted the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) while on board a quarantined cruise ship moored off Japan has climbed to 11, the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) said Thursday.
All of the Filipinos who got the virus are crew members of Diamond Princess, Foreign Affairs Assistant Secretary Eduardo Meñez said in a text message to ABS-CBN News.
""All of them are now confined in various hospitals in and around the Tokyo area,"" the agency said in a statement, adding they are responding well to treatment.
The Philippine Embassy in Tokyo has sent supplies to the patients and also those still quarantined inside the ship.
""An embassy team also visited the hospitals this afternoon to speak with the doctors and social workers assigned to the Filipino patients in order to ensure their well-being,"" the agency added.
The ship has been kept in quarantine since Feb. 3 after a passenger, who disembarked in Hong Kong, was found to be infected with the virus.
Passengers are expected to stay until Feb. 19, 14 days after the isolation period began.

BEIJING - Prosecutors in China have brought criminal charges against a 59-year-old man who strapped on firecrackers and doused himself with gasoline to defy a ban on public gatherings during a coronavirus epidemic, the Xinhua news agency said.
The resident of the southwestern city of Chongqing planned a birthday banquet for more than 10 tables of guests on Jan. 28, the state-run agency said on Wednesday, but local officials battling the outbreak asked him to cancel the plan.
But on Jan. 26, after the man failed to convince them to let the party go ahead, he wrapped firecrackers around his waist, poured gasoline on his chest and held up a lighter, trying to threaten them into agreeing.
""The actions prevented town and village cadres from carrying out epidemic prevention and control work,"" Xinhua said, adding that 10 patients visiting a clinic on a lower level of the same building had also been affected.
It was not immediately clear what kind of penalties the man would face if convicted.
Authorities have banned large gatherings, such as banquets and parties, as they try to rein in the virus epidemic, which has killed more than 1,100 and infected more than 40,000 in China.

HONG KONG - Hotpot has become the latest casualty of the coronavirus outbreak after 10 members of a family in Hong Kong became infected after sharing the dish, a much loved favorite during winter.
Comprised of a vat of soup at the center of a table, hotpot is a deeply communal dish.
Those enjoying it dip a variety of meats, seafood and vegetables into the bubbling broth, which becomes more intense as the meal progresses.
But health experts have sounded warnings after a cluster of coronavirus cases were discovered in one Hong Kong family who all shared a hotpot with a carrier from mainland China over the Lunar New Year holiday.
As the tenth positive case was confirmed within the family on Monday, stocks for large hotpot companies with restaurants in Hong Kong and mainland China plunged.
Xiabuxiabu closed down 7.1 percent, Haidilao ended 4.8 lower while Yihai International, which makes seasonings and sauces for hot pot, dropped 2.7 percent.
In Hong Kong, major restaurant chains including Fairwood, Cafe de Coral, Yoshinoya and Maxim's announced they were temporarily pulling hotpot from their menus.
Maxim's also confirmed that 2 of the infected family members from the hotpot cluster worked in 2 of their branches, which would be closed for disinfecting.
Haidilao, China's largest hotpot chain, has already closed all its branches on the mainland, where the virus outbreak has killed more than 1,000 people.

It said it would not close its Hong Kong branches but would start checking the temperatures of patrons.
Sam Wong, who owns 66 Hotpot, a family-run restaurant in the bustling district of Mongkok, said some 20 customers have canceled bookings since the news of the family cluster emerged.
""I don't think the focus should be placed specifically on hotpot considering the habit among Chinese people of communally sharing food,"" Wong, 39, told AFP.
""But given hotpot is part of this cluster infection case, our business can't help but be affected,"" he added.
Wong said he was conducting thermometer checks on all customers, had placed disinfectant soaked floor mats at his restaurant entrance and was replacing reusable chopsticks with disposable ones.
Emily Mok, a flight attendant, came to Wong's restaurant before it opened on Monday evening and ordered a hotpot for take-away.
""My boyfriend and I will have hotpot at home because we don't want to consume it in a restaurant, where we don't know who is sitting next to us,"" she said.
Even before this year's health crisis, Hong Kong's catering industry had been battered by months of political unrest as Hong Kongers push for greater democratic freedoms and police accountability.
In the last quarter of 2019, when the protests were at their most violent, the catering industry suffered a 14 percent drop compared to the same period last year, according to government figures.
Retail, tourism and entertainment industries have been similarly hit.
Wong's restaurant had weathered the unrest because he was a well-known pro-democracy supporter.
With protesters keen to support the businesses, Wong said he almost always had queues outside.
""Now you can simply walk in,"" he lamented.

GENEVA - China's coronavirus outbreak poses a ""very grave threat for the rest of the world,"" the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) said Tuesday in an appeal for sharing virus samples and speeding up research into drugs and vaccines.
WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus was addressing the start of a 2-day meeting aimed at accelerating development of drugs, diagnostics and vaccines against the flu-like virus amid growing concerns about its ability to spread.
To date China has reported 42,708 confirmed cases, including 1,017 deaths, Tedros said.

""With 99 percent of cases in China, this remains very much an emergency for that country, but one that holds a very grave threat for the rest of the world,"" he told more than 400 researchers and national authorities, including some taking part by video conference from mainland China and Taiwan.
Tedros, speaking to reporters on Monday, referred to ""some concerning instances of onward transmission from people with no travel history to China,"" citing cases this week in France and Britain.
Five British nationals were diagnosed with the coronavirus in France, after staying in the same ski chalet with a person who had been in Singapore.
""The detection of this small number of cases could be the spark that becomes a bigger fire. But for now it's only a spark. Our objective remains containment,"" he said.
Hong Kong residents evacuated from a residential building where a man and woman confirmed with coronavirus live tested negative for the virus, health authorities said Tuesday, easing concerns of a cluster of the outbreak in the Chinese-ruled city.
Many questions remain about the origin of the virus, which emerged at a wildlife market in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in December, and is spread by people in droplets from coughing or sneezing.

""We hope that one of the outcomes of this meeting will be an agreed roadmap for research around which researchers and donors will align,"" Tedros told the closed-door meeting, according to remarks made available by the UN agency.
""The bottom line is solidarity, solidarity, solidarity. That is especially true in relation to sharing of samples and sequences,"" Tedros said. ""To defeat this outbreak, we need open and equitable sharing, according to the principles of fairness and equity.""
Dr. Mike Ryan, WHO's top emergencies experts, told reporters on Monday: ""This is an amazing initiative to centralize our knowledge.""
The aim was to identify gaps and generate scientific information for urgently needed medical interventions, he said.
""This is not just simply scientific discourse, there are big issues to do with how that whole process is governed,"" Ryan said, citing the need to ""ensure equitable access"" to any products derived from research and approved by regulators.
""Bringing everybody together I think will give us a leap-frog moment in terms of coherence, priority-setting,"" he said.

TOKYO - Two Japanese citizens evacuated from the epicenter of a novel coronavirus outbreak have been diagnosed with the infection after initially testing negative, the health ministry said Tuesday.
One of the 2, a man in his 50s who returned from the Chinese city of Wuhan on the first Japanese evacuation flight on Jan. 29, previously twice tested negative for the virus. 
However, a third test 12 days later found the man -- who has been isolated in his hotel room since his return -- was infected.
According to the World Health Organization, the coronavirus incubation period ""could be up to 14 days.""
The second evacuee, a Japanese man in his 40s, returned from Wuhan on Jan. 30 and initially tested negative for the virus, but was diagnosed after a second test on Monday.
The new cases bring the number of infections inside Japan to 28, excluding dozens diagnosed aboard a cruise ship moored off the coast.
So far, 135 people on board the Diamond Princess have tested positive for the virus since it arrived off Japan on Monday.
Authorities on Tuesday were removing from the ship the most recently diagnosed 65 crew and passengers.
The ship was carrying 3,711 people when it arrived off Japan on the evening of Feb. 3, and was officially placed into quarantine 2 days later. 
Only those diagnosed with the virus or suffering other serious health conditions have been allowed off the boat, which is expected to remain in quarantine until at least Feb. 19.
People on board the ship on Tuesday tweeted that medicines were being delivered to passengers, and that the ship's captain had announced the vessel would head out to sea overnight to produce fresh water and other operations.
Japan has evacuated hundreds of its citizens from Wuhan since the outbreak began. They have been asked to self-quarantine, with most staying in government-appointed hotels for a period of 14 days. 
Evacuees from the first flight, which landed Jan. 29, are expected to be released from self-quarantine this week after undergoing an additional test for the virus, officials said.
Japan is planning to send a fifth evacuation flight to Wuhan later this week.

MANADO, Indonesia - Bat meat is still popular in some parts of Indonesia, despite research suggesting the coronavirus spreading from China might have originated in bats before being passed on to humans.
Bats are traditionally eaten by the Minahasan people from North Sulawesi in the form of a curry-like dish called Paniki. Whole bats are used in Paniki, including the head and wings.
""It (the coronavirus) has not affected sales,"" said bat seller Stenly Timbuleng at his stall in Tomohon, a city in North Sulawesi, south of the provincial capital of Manado.
""In fact... sales continue. It is always sold out.""

On an average day, Timbuleng sells 50 to 60 bats and during festive periods, he can sell up to 600.
""Bats are the favorite indigenous protein, particularly in North Sulawesi,"" Indonesian culinary expert and author of half a dozen of cookbooks, William W. Wongso, told Reuters.
""My favorite part is the wings,"" Wongso added.
Glands from the armpits and the neck of the bat are first removed to get rid of the bad smell.
It is then grilled or torched to get rid of the bat's hairs before being chopped and cooked in a stew of herbs, spices and coconut milk.

How do bats live with so many viruses?

The coronavirus is believed to have originated in a food market in the Chinese city of Wuhan that was illegally selling wildlife. Health experts think it may have originated in bats and then passed to humans, possibly via another species.
In China, the virus has killed more than 1,000 and infected more than 42,700.
There are 319 coronavirus cases in 24 countries and territories outside of China, according to the World Health Organization (WHO) and Chinese health officials.
None has been reported in Indonesia, but the outbreak has prompted many Manadonese restaurants in the capital, Jakarta, to take bats off the menu.

Several companies and institutes in Australia, China, France, Germany and the United States are racing to develop a vaccine -- a process that normally takes years.
Asked whether scientists from Taiwan would be allowed to take part in this week's Geneva conference, WHO officials said that they would do so but only online -- along with colleagues from other parts of China.
While the WHO does not deal with Taiwan directly and only recognizes Beijing, Taiwan was often allowed to attend annual assemblies and sideline meetings as an observer.
But in recent years it has been frozen out as Beijing takes an increasingly combative stance towards democratic Taiwan, which it considers its own territory.

BEIJING - The 2 most senior health officials at the epicenter of China's deadly virus outbreak have been sacked, state media said Tuesday, as pressure mounts over the way local authorities have handled the epidemic.
Zhang Jin, the Communist Party boss of the provincial health commission in Hubei, and its director Liu Yingzi have been removed from their positions, reported state broadcaster CCTV, after a decision by the province's party committee Monday.
The area has found itself at the center of a coronavirus outbreak that has killed more than 1,000 people and infected over 42,000 across China since December.

China virus toll passes 1,000 as Xi visits frontline hospital

Local officials have faced mounting pressure for perceived incompetence -- particularly after the death of a Chinese doctor in the provincial capital Wuhan who was punished for raising the alarm about the new virus.
Deputy director of China's National Health Commission Wang Hesheng will take over the 2 roles, said CCTV.
In another sign of personnel changes at ground zero of the outbreak, senior Beijing official Chen Yixin has been sent to Wuhan to guide epidemic control work.
IMAGE OF STABILITY
Chen -- a former deputy party chief of Hubei -- has been appointed deputy head of a central government group dispatched to the province, according to a report from the health commission on its WeChat account.
Analysts have said local authorities played down the extent of the outbreak in early January because they were holding political meetings at the time and wanted to project an image of stability.
Hubei remains on virtual lockdown to curb the spread of the virus.

Local Communist Party secretary Ma Guoqiang acknowledged last week that officials had worsened the spread by failing to restrict travel earlier. 
Wuhan authorities also faced criticism in January for going ahead with an annual public banquet for 40,000 families just days before the city was placed on lockdown.
Other manpower changes have been taking place in the province, including the removal of a top Red Cross official in Wuhan for dereliction of duty.

TAIPEI (3rd UPDATE) - Taiwan urged the Philippines on Tuesday to lift a travel ban on its citizens after Philippine airlines canceled flights to Taiwan due to a government ban on all foreigners traveling from the island to help contain the spread of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV).
Ministry spokeswoman Joanne Ou made the comments at a regular news briefing in Taipei, adding that some Taiwanese were stranded at airports in the Philippines after the ban was announced earlier this week.
The Philippines' 2 largest airlines -- Philippine Airlines and Cebu Pacific -- canceled flights to Taiwan after the government expanded its travel ban to include all foreigners coming from the island to help contain the spread of the coronavirus.
The Philippines' Bureau of Immigration said Monday the travel ban would take effect immediately and would follow the same procedures as in the previously announced restriction that covered China and its Special Administrative Regions Hong Kong and Macau.
Filipinos and foreigners with permanent resident visas may be allowed entry but will be turned over to the Bureau of Quarantine for assessment, Immigration Commissioner Jaime Morente said in a statement.
More than 115,000 Filipinos live and work in Taiwan, mainly in factories and as household helpers.

54 foreign passport holders, some of them natural-born Filipinos, are stuck at the NAIA after the PH govt announcement of travel ban in Taiwan at 9:50PM, Feb 10. They flew from from Taiwan at 10PM and arrived in PH around midnight.

PASSENGERS STRANDED
Some 50 passengers were stuck at the capital's airport after the Philippine government imposed a travel restriction for Taiwan.
The passengers told ABS-CBN News they came from the US and transited through Taiwan. They only learned about the travel ban after arriving at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) Terminal 1.
Most of them were natural-born Filipinos but are US passport holders.
They were not sent for quarantine inspection but were told to fly back to Taiwan.
PALACE: UP TO HEALTH ADVISORIES
Malacañang said lifting the travel ban on Taiwan would depend on the recommendation of the World Health Organization and its national health department.
Taiwan was included in the ban because it is a “part of China,” Palace spokesman Salvador Panelo said Tuesday.
“Since there is a ban on China, necessarily, Taiwan, being part of China, is included. And we always follow the recommendations of the World Health Organization,” Panelo told reporters.
The Taipei Economic and Cultural Office (TECO) in the Philippines meanwhile lamented the ""wrong"" inclusion of Taiwan in the travel ban.
""The Republic of China (Taiwan) is a sovereign and independent state. Taiwan issues its own passport and visas and has exclusive jurisdiction over its people and territory. In fact, Taiwan is not, nor has it ever been, part of the PRC,"" the office said in a statement.
Taiwan is an independently governed territory but the Philippines considers it part of China under the one-China policy.
TECO added that Manila should not be ""misled by WHO’s wrong information on Taiwan"" as part of mainland China.
""It is a factual error for the World Health Organization (WHO) to regard Taiwan as a part of PRC.""
For now, Panelo said the travel ban on Taiwan stays “until the WHO makes any announcement and until the DOH (Department of Health) recommends to the President [its lifting].”
Cases of the virus have been confirmed there.
“If the WHO says there is a need for the lifting of the ban in any part of those already announced with a travel ban then we will, I suppose, do so,” he said.

BANGKOK - Thailand has barred passengers from Holland America's cruise ship MS Westerdam from disembarking, its health minister said Tuesday, the latest country to turn it away amid fears of the coronavirus despite no confirmed infections aboard.
The company, owned by Miami-based Carnival Corp, had said on Monday that passengers would disembark in Bangkok on Feb. 13 and that there was no reason to believe anybody aboard had the virus.
""I have issued orders. Permission to dock refused,"" Public Health Minister Anutin Charnvirakul said in a Facebook post.
The Westerdam has already been turned away from several countries, including Japan, the Philippines and Thailand, amid fears of the coronavirus, which has killed more than 1,000 people and infected more than 40,000 since it was first reported in the Chinese city of Wuhan less than 2 months ago
Holland America says no one on board has the virus. Media reports say it carries 1,455 passengers and 802 crew; its original destination was Yokohama, Japan, which refused it permission to dock.
""The ship is not in quarantine and we have no reason to believe there are any cases of coronavirus on board despite media reports,"" the company said.
It had earlier said the Westerdam was sailing toward Bangkok, and it is not immediately clear whether the ship would change course.
Another cruise ship, the Diamond Princess, with 3,700 passengers and crew on board, is quarantined in the Japanese port of Yokohama, with 135 cases of coronavirus detected on the Carnival Corp-owned vessel.
Most of the coronavirus cases have been inside China, but there have been 319 cases in 24 other countries, including 1 death, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Monday.

(UPDATE) The 13th case of coronavirus in the United States was detected in California in a person under federal quarantine after returning from Wuhan, China, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said Monday.
The adult patient was among US nationals evacuated from Wuhan, the epicenter of the disease, who were under mandatory quarantine for 14 days at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar, near San Diego, the CDC said in a statement.
The individual was taken to the University of California San Diego Medical Center for observation and isolation and is ""doing well,"" the hospital said in a statement.
""CDC is conducting a thorough contact investigation of the person who has tested positive to determine contacts and to assess if those contacts had high risk exposures,"" the CDC said.
Some 800 US nationals have been evacuated from Wuhan and flown to air bases in the United States where they are subject to the CDC’s first public health quarantine in 50 years.
The US has imposed mandatory quarantines and travel restrictions with China to slow the spread of coronavirus within the United States. US officials fear a global pandemic if the virus is allowed to gain a foothold outside China, where the death toll has climbed to more than 1,000.

The latest individual diagnosed with coronavirus was the first confirmed case among some 800 US nationals evacuated to military bases in the United States on flights from Wuhan, the epicenter of the disease.
The person was among 4 evacuees taken to the UC San Diego Medical Center for further evaluation last week after arriving at the Miramar air base.
On Sunday, the CDC said all 4 patients initially tested negative for the virus and were discharged and returned to quarantine at the base. Further testing showed 1 of the 4 was positive and the patient was returned to the hospital.
Another patient from MCAS Miramar was taken to the hospital on Monday for evaluation, the medical center said.
""Both patients are doing well and have minimal symptoms,"" the hospital said.
None of the coronavirus cases confirmed in the United States has proved fatal and several patients have been released from hospital.
With most US-China flights suspended, only a handful of US nationals arriving on commercial flights have been quarantined under rules imposed on Feb. 2 to curb the virus' spread, according to a Reuters survey.
Of 8 states with airports screening travelers for the virus, 6 said they had no one under quarantine, New York reported 4 people and Illinois a ""tiny"" number, the survey found.

MADRID - Major tech companies are skipping the Mobile World Congress this year because of fears over the coronavirus, though Chinese groups and other big names still plan to attend the top industry event.
Amazon and Sony said Monday they would stay away from the world's biggest mobile tech fair in Barcelona, joining Swedish telecoms equipment maker Ericsson and South Korean giant LG.
NTT DoCoMo, the biggest Japanese telecommunications operator and one of the biggest in Asia, said it too would be absent for reasons of ""security"" stemming from the virus.
The annual gathering is scheduled for Feb. 24 to 27 this year.
""Due to the outbreak and continued concerns about novel coronavirus, Amazon will withdraw from exhibiting and participating in Mobile World Congress 2020,"" a Spanish-language statement said.
A Sony statement said: ""As we place the utmost importance on the safety and well-being of our customers, partners, media and employees, we have taken the difficult decision to withdraw from exhibiting and participating at MWC 2020 in Barcelona.""
LG, which normally has one of the biggest stands, said last week that its decision ""removes the risk of exposing hundreds of LG employees to international travel which has already become more restrictive as the virus continues to spread across borders.""
Like Sony, LG plans separate events to unveil its new mobile products.
Other trade shows have also been hit by the virus, with the biennial Singapore Airshow reporting the loss of more than 70 participants, including US group Lockheed Martin and Bombardier of Canada.
The MWC is a major date on tech company calendars and normally draws more than 100,000 people from all over the world to see the latest innovations and gadgets.
The mobile trade association GSMA that organizes the congress said Sunday it was taking drastic precautions this year to ease fears that it could become a hub for the virus to spread.
To date, more than 40,000 people have been infected and more than 900 have died in the outbreak that began in China's Wuhan city. Most deaths have been in China.
The Barcelona congress will be off limits to anyone from the Chinese province of Hubei, where the virus first broke out, and visitors from other parts of China will have to show they have been outside the country for two weeks before arriving in Spain.
Shenzhen-based ZTE, which makes smartphones and wireless networking equipment, and Huawei have said they still plan to attend, along with compatriots Oppo, Vivo and Xiaomi.
Finnish phone maker Nokia and the South Korean giant Samsung are also still expected.
""We remain more than 2,800 exhibitors strong,"" a GSMA statement said.
Daily disinfection
ZTE's exhibition stand and equipment will be disinfected daily and its booth exhibition staff will come from countries outside China, mainly from Europe, it said.
Senior executives taking part in ""high-level meetings"" at the gathering ""will self-isolate themselves in Europe for at least two weeks prior to the MWC,"" a ZTE statement said.
The company plans to showcase new 5G devices this year.
Huawei staff, including executives, have also arrived two weeks early and shut themselves up in their hotels, a company spokesman told AFP.
GSMA said: ""We are grateful for the preventative measures our Chinese exhibitors have put in place, notably ZTE and Huawei.""
Meanwhile, personnel will be on hand to take visitors' temperatures and exhibitors will be advised on how best to disinfect their stands.
Spain has not declared a health emergency and only two cases of coronavirus have been detected in the country so far, one in the Canary Islands and another on the Mediterranean island of Majorca.
""Everything will be done to ensure the participant's peace of mind,"" Barcelona Mayor Jaume Collboni told Antena 3 television.
But an association of Barcelona hotel operators acknowledged they had recorded cancellations for the period, which represents one of the Catalan city's most important events.

MANILA- Residents of Capas town in Tarlac need not worry about a possible spread of the 2019 novel coronavirus since authorities placed enough safeguards in the quarantine zone for repatriated Filipinos from the epicenter of the virus, a government official said Monday.
Police are guarding the perimeter of the quarantine site in New Clark City, an 18-minute drive from Capas while health authorities guard the repatriated Filipinos under observation, the Department of the Interior and Local Government said.
""There is really nothing for the people of Capas to be worried about since none of these repatriates showed symptoms of the disease,"" DILG Undersecretary Jonathan Malaya told reporters in Malacañang.
Thirty Filipinos from the Chinese city of Wuhan arrived in the Philippines on Sunday, marking the country's first evacuation of its nationals from the epicenter of the new coronavirus which has killed at least 900 people.

30 Filipinos from nCoV-stricken Wuhan arrive in Philippines

Prior to the arrival of repatriated Filipinos, Capas town Mayor Reynaldo Catacutan urged the national government to reconsider New Clark City as a quarantine site, saying the local government was not consulted in the ""last-minute"" decision.
Malaya on Monday however clarified that the national government need not seek the permission of the local government of Capas for the quarantine site since New Clark City is a property of the national government managed by the Bases Conversion and Development Authority.
He, however, assured residents of Capas that ""all precautionary measures are in place to ensure their safety and protection to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.""
The Philippines has so far monitored 267 patients suspected of carrying the new strain of virus, of whom 230 were admitted to hospitals and 19 were discharged. Three, all Chinese nationals, were confirmed to have acquired the virus.
The country recorded the first fatality outside of China with the death of a 44-year-old patient on Feb. 1.

The Filipinos and their spouses are scheduled to depart China on Saturday night and are expected to arrive at the Clark International Airport on Sunday morning.
They will be brought to the Athletes' Village in New Clark City in Tarlac for a 14-day quarantine period.
Dulay also allayed fears of those living near the quarantine area.

(First of all, the Athletes' Village is far from downtown Capas. Secondly, the task force secured the living quarters and flight of the repatriates. We are following quarantine protocols.)

Capas, Tarlac mayor Reynaldo Catacutan earlier expressed concerns over the plan to use the Athletes’ Village as a quarantine site.
""We acknowledge that the Bases Conversion and Development Authority has full jurisdiction over NCC, but I, as the Mayor of Capas, appeal in behalf of all Capaseños to our dear President Rodrigo Duterte and DOH Secretary Francisco Duque to consider another place or facility as isolation area,"" he said.
The Bureau of Immigration (BI), on its part, said the repatriates and their spouses will undergo stringent screening.
""We're going to process all the necessary immigration arrival formalities. 'Yong passport, dadalhin sa'min in a sanitized bag, and then, of course, we have all the protection as well.

SINGAPORE - Anxious Singapore shoppers formed long lines at grocery stores Saturday and cleared the shelves of essential items, after the city-state raised its alert level over China's coronavirus outbreak.

Singapore, which has reported 33 cases, raised its alert level Friday to ""orange"" -- the same as during the deadly 2003 SARS outbreak, indicating the virus is severe and passes easily between people.
The announcement triggered panic in the city-state of 5.7 million starting late Friday, with shoppers -- many wearing masks -- rushing to stock up on items including rice, noodles and toilet paper.
Pictures circulating on social media showed empty shelves in some stores, carts filled with goods and long lines at counters, which continued into Saturday.

As coronavirus infections continue to rise, the BI will now require both foreign and Filipino passengers abroad to completely fill out and submit their arrival cards.
Morente said he instructed immigration duty supervisors to strictly enforce the new policy so the bureau could help in tracing passengers who have traveled to China.
Previously, only foreign passengers arriving at the airports are required to fill out the arrival cards while Filipinos are obliged to fill out embarkation cards when they leave the country.
The bureau has also implemented strict screening of applications for the extended stay of foreign tourists to check if they traveled to China, Hong Kong and Macau within 14 days from their arrival, Morente said.
Applicants covered by the restriction shall be turned over to the Bureau of Quarantine for medical assessment, he added.

TOKYO - Three more people on a cruise ship off Japan have tested positive for the new coronavirus, bringing the number of infected aboard to 64, the government said Saturday, with passengers facing a 2-week quarantine.
The latest confirmation came a day after an additional 41 passengers were found to have contracted the virus, which has killed hundreds of people, most of them in China, where it has infected more than 30,000 on the mainland.

Japanese authorities have so far tested about 280 people on board the Diamond Princess, which was quarantined after a former passenger, who disembarked in Hong Kong last month, was diagnosed with the virus.
Test results from 6 more people were released on Saturday, with 3 of them confirmed infected, the health ministry said without giving further details such as their nationalities.
The 3 people have already been sent to hospital, the ministry said in a statement.
There were more than 3,700 passengers and crew on the ship when it arrived off Japan's coast on Monday evening. It docked in Yokohama on Thursday to resupply for a quarantine that could last until Feb. 19.
One of those found infected is in serious condition. Many on board are elderly and at greater risk of developing complications from the virus.
Testing was initially carried out on those who displayed symptoms or had come into close contact with the former passenger diagnosed.
'VERY, VERY SCARY'
Japan has already reported at least 25 cases of coronavirus aside from the infections on board the ship, and evacuated hundreds of citizens from Wuhan, the Chinese city where the pathogen emerged, including on a fourth flight Friday.
Passengers on the ship have been asked to stay inside their cabins to prevent new infections and have expressed confusion and frustration.
The World Health Organization (WHO) called on Tokyo to provide sufficient support, including mental care, for the passengers and patients.
""There's a lot to do to support those patients. Not just from the point of view of their physical health but from a mental health perspective,"" Michael Ryan, head of the WHO's Health Emergencies Programme, told reporters in Geneva on Friday.

The primary path is believed to be virus-laden droplets from an infected person's cough, though researchers in early cases have said they focused heavily on patients with respiratory symptoms and may have overlooked those linked to the digestive tract.
A total of 14 out of 138 patients (10 percent) in a Wuhan hospital who were studied in the new paper by Chinese authors in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) initially presented with diarrhea and nausea one or two days prior to development of fever and labored breathing.
The first US patient diagnosed with 2019-nCoV also experienced loose bowel movements for two days and the virus was subsequently detected in his stool. There have been other such cases in China documented in the Lancet, albeit infrequently.
""Importantly, 2019-nCoV has been reported elsewhere in the feces of patients with atypical abdominal symptoms, similar to SARS which was also shed in urine, suggesting a fecal transmission route which is highly transmissible,"" William Keevil, a professor of environmental healthcare at the University of Southampton said in a comment to the UK's Science Media Centre.
The possibility is not totally surprising to scientists, given that the new virus belongs to the same family as SARS.
Fecal transmission of SARS was implicated in sickening hundreds in Hong Kong's Amoy Gardens housing estate in 2003. A rising plume of warm air originating in bathrooms contaminated several apartments and was transported by wind to adjacent buildings in the complex.
Based on the literature, ""the 2019-nCoV virus found in stool may be transmitted through fecal spread,"" added Jiayu Liao, a bioengineer at the University of California, Riverside.
But, he added: ""We still do not know how long this virus can survive outside the body -- HIV can only survive roughly 30 minutes outside the body -- and what temperature range the 2019-nCoV is sensitive to.""
Fecal spread could present new challenges to the virus's containment, but is more likely to be a problem inside hospitals, which can become ""amplifiers"" of epidemics, said David Fisman, an epidemiologist at the University of Toronto.
Benjamin Neuman, a virology expert at Texas A&M University-Texarkana, cautioned that while fecal transmission was ""certainly worth considering,"" ""droplets and touching contaminated surfaces then rubbing eyes, nose or mouth"" were likely the main way the virus was transmitted based on current data.

MAYNILA - ""The Brave 5"" kung ituring ni Health Undersecretary Gerardo Bayugo ang medical team na pinalilipad papuntang Hubei - na episentro ng 2019 Novel Coronavirus.
Ang grupo, na kinabibilangan ng dalawang nurse na sina Rowell Divinagracia at Jay Juan; medical technician na si Elmer Collong; doktor na si Oliver Macalinao at isa pang doktor mula sa Bureau of Quarantine ang inatasang bantayan ang kalagayan ng mga Pinoy na ire-repatriate o ililikas mula sa Hubei.
May halo mang kaba, mas nanaig sa kanila ang matulungan ang mga kababayang makauwi.
""Mas nananalaytay yung pagiging Filipino ko, that I have to help. Kaya ba nating iwanan 'yong mga kababayan natin gustong umuwi. Papabayaan ba natin sila? For me hindi ko kaya 'yon,"" ani Divinagracia.
""The fact that these people want to go home and they’re our countrymen, talagang hindi puwedeng iwanan 'yon,"" ani Collong.
Matagal nang nurse sa DOH si Juan at karangalan para sa kaniya na makapaglingkod sa isa sa pinakamalaking health emergency na tumama sa mundo nitong nakalipas na linggo.
""'Pag meron ka nang passion to serve, yun na yun eh. susunod na yung pagiging prepared mo,"" ani Juan.
Pag-uwi,sa harap uupo ang mga medical personnel at sa gitnang bahagi ng eroplano pauupuin ang 45 Pinoy na pauuwiin.
Mananatili namang bakante ang huling limang hilera ng eroplano sakaling makaramdam ng sintomas ang mga pasahero, ayon kay Macalinao.
Pagdating sa paliparan, isasailalim sa screening ng Bureau of Quarantine ang mga Pinoy.
Pagkatapos, isasailalim sila sa mga protocol at quarantine, na itinayo ngayon sa New Clark City at ituturing na pasyente.

Samantala, umalma naman ang lokal na pamahalaan ng Capas sa planong gawing quarantine area ang New Clark City, batay sa resolusyong inilabas nila ngayong Biyernes.
Ayon kay Capas acting mayor Roseller Rodriguez, hindi sila naabisuhan tungkol dito.
""There was no coordination we were not informed by the DOH the BCDA that they will use the athletes village as quarantine station,"" aniya.
Pero paliwanag ng kinatawan ng Health regional office na hindi naman daw basta-bastang mahahawa sa bagong coronavirus maliban na lang kung magkakaroon ng interaksyon sa isang nahawa rito.
Giit pa nila, pinili ang New Clark City dahil mas kumpleto ito sa gamit at magiging mas komportable umano ang mga titira rito.
Ayon sa Bases Conversion and Development Authority, sisiguruhin nilang ligtas ang mga residente at poproteksyunan nila ang mga ika-quarantine sa NCC.
Plano namang makipag-ugnayan ng DOH sa alkalde ng Capas para masigurong hindi mahawa ang mga residente.
Sa ngayon, naka-lockdown na ang New Clark City.

HONG KONG- Hong Kong on Friday said it would deploy an army of volunteers to bolster plans to forcibly quarantine all arrivals from mainland China, warning that anyone caught breaching the new rules faces up to 6 months in prison.
In a major escalation of its battle against the new coronavirus, the international finance hub has said anyone arriving from the mainland from Saturday will have to undergo 14 days compulsory quarantine.
Officials hope the new measures will virtually halt all cross-border traffic while allowing the city to remain stocked with food and goods from the mainland where the virus has killed more than 600 people.
Cabinet ministers unveiled the quarantine plans just 6 hours before the new policy was due to come on.
Hong Kong residents arriving from mainland China will be allowed to self-quarantine at home. Chinese and international visitors will be able to self-quarantine at hotels or any other accommodation they have arranged.
""If they cannot arrange accommodation, they will be taken to the temporary facilities prepared by the government,"" Health Secretary Sophia Chan said.
Anyone who has been to mainland China in the past 14 days and then flies into Hong Kong from another destination will also be quarantined. 
Officials -- backed by volunteers from the civil service and some students -- will conduct spot checks or make daily phone calls to ensure people were staying at home.
Those caught breaking their quarantine face up to six months in jail and a HK$25,000 ($3,200) fine.
""We will be stopping a lot of people with the new measures,"" Security Minister John Lee said.
PANIC-BUYING 
The new regulations have been enacted under a sweeping emergency law that allows city leaders to bypass the legislature during a disease outbreak.
Exemptions would be made for a variety of key jobs, including flight and shipping crews as well as cross border truck drivers to ensure goods and food keep coming into the city.
Hong Kong has been hit by a wave of panic-buying in recent days with supermarket shelves frequently emptied of crucial goods such as toilet paper, hand sanitizer, rice and pasta.
The government has blamed false online rumors of shortages, saying supplies are stable.
""The problem of supply shortage doesn't exist,"" said Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung.
""Citizens do not need to worry or make excessive purchases out of panic. I urge the public not to believe in rumors.""
The new coronavirus that emerged in Wuhan at the end of last year has killed more than 630 people and spread around the world.
The latest figures from China show there are more than 30,000 people infected there.
Outside mainland China, there have been more than 320 infections reported in two dozen countries.
Hong Kong has 25 confirmed cases, with one patient who died earlier this week. Many of the newer infections have no history of travel to mainland China, prompting fears that the city now has a local self-sustaining outbreak.
There have been growing calls for the border with China to be sealed entirely. 
Hong Kong's pro-Beijing leadership, which currently has record-low approval ratings after months of pro-democracy protests, had been reluctant to make such a move.
Thousands of medical workers, including some doctors and nurses, have been on strike this week in a bid to force the government to entirely seal the border.
On Friday, hundreds of union members occupied the offices of the Hospital Authority. Late Friday the union called off its strike.

GAPYEONG, South Korea- Thousands of couples -- some in facemasks -- tied the knot in a mass Unification Church wedding Friday, despite concerns in South Korea over the spread of the coronavirus outbreak.
The church founded by Sun Myung Moon -- revered as a messiah by his followers -- distributed face coverings to the 30,000 crowd, but only some donned them.
""I am overwhelmed that I am getting married today,"" said Choi Ji-young, who met her husband -- matched by the church -- only two months ago.
""It would be a lie if I said I was not concerned at all about the infection,"" said the 21-year-old university student. ""But I feel like I will be protected from the virus today.""
South Korea has recorded 24 cases of the novel coronavirus outbreak that emerged in neighboring China, where more than 30,000 cases have been confirmed, and Seoul has barred entry to foreigners who have recently been in Wuhan, the epidemic's center.
Festivals, graduation ceremonies, and K-pop concerts have been canceled over fears large events could facilitate virus transmission, and authorities have asked religious groups to co-operate in preventing it spreading.
The church went ahead with the event because it had been ""four years in the making"" as part of the celebrations of the 100th anniversary of Moon's birth, said official Jang Young-chul.
But followers from China were asked not to come, he added.
Nearly 6,000 identical-dressed couples from 64 countries -- many of whom met for the first time in recent weeks -- married in Gapyeong, a festive mood filling the venue as newlyweds took group photos and were congratulated by friends and relatives.
'GOD'S CONTROL'
Mass weddings, often held in giant sports stadiums with tens of thousands of couples, have long been a signature feature of the church, whose followers have been dubbed ""Moonies"" after its founder, who died in 2012.
They began in the early 1960s, involving just a few dozen couples at first but with numbers mushrooming over the years. In 1997, 30,000 couples took part in a joint wedding in Washington, and two years later around 21,000 filled the Olympic Stadium in Seoul.
Those who choose to be matched by the church must confirm under oath that they are virgins, and after their wedding, the couple must refrain from sexual relations for a minimum of 40 days.
Kim Chang-seong, 27, who was marrying a woman whom he met 20 days ago, said he was not concerned about infection because the mass wedding had ""special meaning"" for him.
""By marrying a fellow church believer, I am taking a path paved by our church leaders.""
The teachings of the Unification Church are based on the Bible but with new interpretations, and Moon saw his role as completing the unfulfilled mission of Jesus to restore humanity to a state of ""sinless"" purity.
While it claims a worldwide following of three million, experts suggest the core membership is far smaller.
Evelyne Chimfwembe, who flew in from Botswana to attend the ceremony with her husband of 28 years, said she was not worried about the virus as she believed the event would be ""under God's control.""

MANILA- The Department of Health on Friday said that the body of the first novel coronavirus fatality has been finally laid to rest, but was short on details whether the patient was cremated.
Health Undersecretary Eric Domingo confirmed that the man's body and that of another patient who tested negative for novel coronavirus but died because of pneumonia “have been disposed properly already.”
“They are no longer in San Lazaro (Hospital),” Domingo said, assuring the public that safety procedures were followed.
Domingo declined to say if the 44-year-old's corpse was buried in a public cemetery, as earlier suggested by Health Secretary Francisco Duque.
“I cannot divulge for privacy reasons and for the dignity of the buried,” he said, however refusing to deny or confirm that a burial took place.
Earlier, the DOH said funeral parlors were refusing to cremate the body of the first n-CoV related death outside China.

Domingo said the cadaver does not pose health hazards, ""as long as it is handled and buried properly.""
The 44-year-old Chinese man came to the Philippines from Wuhan city, the epicenter of the 2019 novel coronavirus acute respiratory disease (2019-nCoV ARD), on January 21 with his partner. While his 38-year-old partner has recovered, the man died on February 1.
Health Secretary Francisco Duque III earlier lamented that the health agency was unable to have the body cremated due to fears that the cadaver still had the virus, which has already infected 30,000 people and killed more than 600 mostly in China.

MANILA – The suggested retail price (SRP) for surgical face masks may increase to P10 to P12 per piece from P8 due to rising costs of raw materials, Trade Secretary Ramon Lopez said Friday. 
Prices of raw materials for face masks have increased, and costs of surgical face masks abroad have also spiked by P10, Lopez told reporters. Local suppliers were still keeping prices at P8 as of Feb. 7. 
A surge in demand for surgical and N95 masks was observed following the Taal Volcano eruption and the global outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus. 
“Yes, the suggested retail price may increase. I won't say double for now as we are still getting various costings,” Lopez told ABS-CBN News. 
Any changes in the prices, however, will be consulted with the Department of Health.

SINGAPORE - Singapore on Friday reported 3 more coronavirus cases that have not been linked to previous infections or travel to China, prompting it to raise its alert to orange, the same level it reached during the SARS outbreak in 2003.
Singapore now has 33 confirmed coronavirus cases.
The orange alert means the virus is severe and passes easily from person to person and was last raised during an outbreak of H1N1 influenza from 2009 to 2010.
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) killed more than 30 people in Singapore and hundreds worldwide.
""As there are now a few local cases without any links to previous cases or travel history to China, we have stepped up our risk assessment,"" the health ministry said in a statement, adding that firms should be prepared for ""widespread community transmission.""
The highest alert is red, which indicates the virus is spreading widely.
Singapore advised businesses to cancel or defer non-essential large-scale events but said the Singapore Airshow will go ahead next week although organizers may limit public visitors.
Of the new cases reported on Friday, 1 was a teacher and authorities said all students and staff who had come into contact with her would have to spend 2 weeks at home.
A British man has also contracted the coronavirus after traveling to a business meeting in Singapore, which has also been linked to cases in the city-state, Malaysia and South Korea, health ministry official Kenneth Mak said.
Mak said authorities had not yet identified the source of infection at the meeting of more than 100 employees from an as-yet-unnamed firm at the Grand Hyatt Hotel in mid-January.

MANILA - The Department of Health on Friday appealed to the local government units to allow repatriated Filipinos from Hubei, China to stay in assigned quarantine sites, as it allayed fears that the virus will easily spread.
“Mga kababayan naman natin itong uuwi. Hahanapan naman natin sila ng lugar na safe, na malayo sa komunidad,” said Health Undersecretary Eric Domingo during a press conference.
“We will appeal naman sa puso’t damdamin nila (LGUs) na i-welcome itong mga kababayan natin dahil sisiguraduhin ng lahat ng ahensya ng gobyerno na hindi malalagay sa panganib yung kanilang mga mamamayan,” he added.
(Those who will go home are our fellowmen. We’ll find a safe place for them that will be far from the community. We’ll appeal to the hearts and emotions of our LGUs to welcome our fellow Filipinos because our government agencies will ensure that the rest of the population won’t be in danger.)
Earlier in the day, Capas, Tarlac Mayor Reynaldo Catacutan appealed to the health department to find another place to house some 40 repatriated Filipino workers.
Capas, Tarlac houses The Athletes' Village, where the repatriates will be quarantined for 14 days.

Domingo said the Inter-agency Task Force led by the DOH will work together to talk to the LGU. “Hindi naman pwedeng lahat ng LGU aayaw,” he said.
(We can’t have all LGUs refusing.)
The health official also explained that only those without symptoms will be allowed to board the plane going to the Philippines. Those who are sick will have to be left behind in China to be admitted to a hospital.
“We’ll have DOH personnel on the flight to monitor if anyone will develop symptoms. And this flight will only take a few hours,” he said.
“As soon as they arrive, we’ll have the Bureau of Quarantine escort them,” he added. “Those who are sick or are not feeling well will be brought to the hospital.”
“Ang ilalagay lang natin sa quarantine facility yung malulusog at walang pinapakitang sintomas,” he clarified.
(Those who will be brought to the quarantine facility are those who are healthy and those who do not show symptoms.)
As of Friday, more than 600 people have died from the new strain of coronavirus while more than 30,000 have been infected. Most of the patients are from China.

HONG KONG - Hong Kong Airlines said Friday it has been forced to slash hundreds of jobs and ask remaining staff to take unpaid leave as the coronavirus outbreak compounds problems at the already-struggling firm.
The announcement by the city's number two carrier comes days after Cathay Pacific said it had asked all its 27,000 workforce to take three weeks leave without salary between March and June because of collapsing demand caused by the health crisis.
The virus, which has infected 24 people, one of whom died, comes just as the city was struggling to recover from months of sometimes violent protests that battered the economy and gutted the key tourism sector.
Hong Kong Airlines said in a statement that strict entry and quarantine measures imposed by countries around the world have further impacted travel demand in the city and the firm had to take ""vigorous measures"" to mitigate the challenges.
The company said it will lay off 400 employees, with the remainder asked to take a minimum of two weeks no-pay leave per month or work three days a week from Feb. 17 until the end of June.
""There has never been a more challenging time in Hong Kong Airlines' history as of now,"" the company said in an email statement to AFP.
""As uncertainty looms with the evolving nature of this global issue, weak travel demand will likely continue into the summer season and we need to take further action to stay afloat.""
The airline is owned by struggling Chinese conglomerate HNA Group, which has been looking to lower its debt burden.
In November it announced it would delay salary payments to some staff as it struggled to find cash, triggering a warning from regulators that its licence might be at risk. While it managed to keep flying thanks to an injection of funds, it continues to struggle.
The coronavirus, which was first detected in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year, spread over the Lunar New Year holiday and has now killed more than 600 people in the country, with at least 31,000 infected.
The crisis has seen a number of governments around the world and in Asia block flights to and from Hong Kong, including popular destinations Taiwan and the Philippines.

,Feb 07 2020,nCov,Pangolin identified as potential link for new coronavirus spread,ABS-CBN News,"


 


BEIJING - The endangered pangolin may be the link that facilitated the spread of the novel coronavirus across China, Chinese scientists said Friday.
At least 31,000 people have been infected and 630 killed by the virus, which has spread to 2 dozen countries.
Researchers at the South China Agricultural University have identified the scaly mammal as a ""potential intermediate host,"" the university said in a statement, without providing further details.
The new virus, which emerged at a live animal market in central China's Wuhan city late last year, is believed to have originated in bats, but researchers have suggested there could have been an ""intermediate host"" in the transmission to humans.
After testing more than 1,000 samples from wild animals, scientists from the university found the genome sequences of viruses found on pangolins to be 99 percent identical to those on coronavirus patients, the official Xinhua news agency reported Friday.
The pangolin is considered the most trafficked animal on the planet and over 1 million have been snatched from Asian and African forests in the past decade, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).
They are destined for markets in China and Vietnam, where their scales are used in traditional medicine -- despite having no medical benefits -- and their meat is bought on the black market.
China in January ordered a temporary ban on the trade in wild animals until the epidemic is under control.
The country has long been accused by conservationists of tolerating a shadowy trade in endangered animals for food or as ingredients in traditional medicine.
The SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) virus that killed hundreds of people in China and Hong Kong in 2002 and 2003 also has been traced to wild animals, with scientists saying it likely originated in bats, later reaching humans via civets.

MANILA - Want to welcome or send off your loved ones at the airport? Avoid coming in groups for now amid the spread of the new coronavirus.
The Manila International Airport Authority (MIAA) on Friday urged the public to refrain from visiting airport terminals in groups amid growing fears over the spread of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV).
""This call is being made not to alarm the public. This is our simple way of supporting inter-agency efforts to prevent and contain the spread of the virus,” MIAA General Manager Ed Monreal said in a statement.
""Let us say our goodbyes at home and not go to the airport in groups when meeting a passenger. It is very hard to fight tradition, but in times like this, everyone should look out for their own safety,"" the airport chief added.
It has been a custom in the Philippines, a country with at least 10 million migrant workers, for families and friends to welcome or say goodbye to their loved ones at the airport in big groups.
Issuance of visitors' passes in 4 terminals of the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) will be limited, the MIAA said.
Exception will be given to those assisting medical patients, the elderly, children and pregnant women.
The MIAA will also regulate passes to VIP rooms for official guests of the government and foreign embassies.
Monreal said they would also suspend tours and filming in the facilities.
The 2019 Novel Coronavirus acute respiratory disease (2019-nCoV ARD), which health experts said spreads through close contact, has been confirmed to have infected 3 Chinese nationals in the Philippines.
They all came from Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the outbreak, which appeared from a market that sells exotic animals, such as bats and snakes, as delicacies.
As of Friday, the Philippines said it was monitoring 212 patients suspected of carrying the strain, which manifests as fever, cough, shortness of breath, and breathing difficulties.
Of the number, 184 are currently admitted in hospitals, 9 have refused admission, 17 were discharged but under strict monitoring and 2 had died of other causes, the Department of Health (DOH) said.
The Philippines has implemented a ban on travelers to and from China to contain the virus. Several airlines have also suspended flights to and from Chinese destinations.
More than 600 people have died and some 30,000 have contracted the virus, mostly in China, as of Friday.

MANILA - The Philippine tourism industry has lost at least P10 billion pesos as government continues to impose a travel ban to and from China, the country's second largest tourism market and epicenter of the deadly 2019 novel coronavirus, an official from a tour operators' group said Friday.
About 50 percent of reservations in Boracay, Bohol, Cebu, and Palawan have been canceled, Philippine Tour Operators Association President Cesar Cruz told reporters.
""Both for inbound and outbound [travel], it would really have a very big effect,"" he said.
""It hit us during the peakest of the peak, which is the Chinese New Year,"" he said.
The tourism industry may continue to feel the effects of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Acute Respiratory Disease (2019-nCoV ARD) until August, he said.
The Department of Tourism (DOT) is eyeing to boost promotions in South Korea and the United States, the Philippines' top and 3rd largest tourist markets, respectively, Tourism Secretary Bernadette Romulo-Puyat said.
The DOT is also coordinating with hotels and airline companies to give discounts to attract more visitors, she said.
Stopping the spread of the virus is the government's primary concern, she said.
The 2019-nCoV has killed at least 600 people and infected 30,000 others, mostly in China since the origin of the pathogen was traced to the Chinese city of Wuhan in late December 2019.
The Philippines has recorded 3 cases, all Chinese travelers from Wuhan, among whom 1 has died.

MANILA - The 2019 Novel Coronavirus acute respiratory disease (2019-nCoV ARD) may become less infective when the weather gets warmer, a former health secretary said Friday.
""It will probably be affected by the season. As the weather gets better, warmer, then the virus is probably going to be a little less infective,"" Dr. Esperanza Cabral told ANC's ""Early Edition.""
An international health expert, in a report on US website Vox, described coronaviruses as ""winter viruses.""
""When the weather is warm and moist, these viruses don’t spread as well as when the weather is cold and dry,"" said Dr. Tony Fauci, head of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.
Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV), according to the World Health Organization.
The 2019-nCoV ARD, which originated from a market in the Chinese city of Wuhan that sells exotic animals, is a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans. 
As coronavirus infections continue to rise, Cabral, who served as health chief during the term of then President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, said the outbreak may last for a few months.
""As a matter of fact, the number of cases reported doubles every week. So if this continues by the end of February, we will be looking at 400,000 [infection] cases and 800 deaths from coronavirus in China,"" she said.
As of Friday, the novel coronavirus has claimed at least 636 lives and infected more than 30,000 others in China as of Friday.

China virus death toll hits 636, more than 30,000 infections 

The Philippines, which experiences a ""hot dry season"" that starts from March to May, has also recorded 3 confirmed cases, including 1 death, all Chinese travelers from Wuhan. The health department is also monitoring 178 people for possible infection, including 147 who were admitted in hospitals.

Wearing face mask to ward off the illness is not required, except the sick, health workers and those exposed to crowded places, Cabral said.
Cloth masks, she added, don't work against viral illnesses.
""For viruses, the cloth masks don't work. Cloth masks are okay for dust coming from the Taal Volcano ashfall, but not for preventing viral illness,"" Cabral said.

""It's not really necessary. It's an overreaction... What's the use of going to school for 3 days and not going to school for 2 days. On the days when they go to school, they are equally exposed to whatever it is they fear they're going to be exposed [to],"" Cabral said.
Asked about the government's response to the outbreak, she admitted that the Department of Health is ""always playing catch-up"" as the agency is swamped with work.
""They are doing their best. I think we should help them by heeding their advice, by staying calm, because there's no good can come out in panicking... Right now, they need all the help they can get,"" Cabral said.

SEOUL - The most productive car factory in the world fell quiet on Friday as South Korea's Hyundai suspended operations at its giant Ulsan complex, hamstrung by a lack of parts with the coronavirus outbreak crippling China's industrial output.
The 5-plant network can make 1.4 million vehicles annually, in a coastal location facilitating importing components and exporting cars globally.
But supply lines are crucial in an ever more interconnected worldwide economy and the coronavirus outbreak in China has seen Beijing order factories closed in several areas as it seeks to contain the epidemic.
As a result, Hyundai -- which with its affiliate Kia ranks as the world's fifth-largest auto manufacturer -- has run out of the wiring harnesses that connect vehicles' complex electronics.
It is having to suspend production at its factories across South Korea, putting 25,000 workers on forced leave and partial wages, healthy victims of the disease outbreak across the Yellow Sea.
""It's a shame that I can't come to work and have to accept a pay cut,"" said an Ulsan production line staffer surnamed Park. ""It's a very uncomfortable feeling.""
The closures could be the first example of a phenomenon that rolls out around the world, analysts say.
The impact on Hyundai will be eye-watering, with analysts estimating a five-day South Korean shutdown to cost the firm at least 6 hundred billion won ($500 million).
Hyundai is not the only corporate casualty: Kia will suspend three plants for a day on Monday, the South Korean unit of French automaker Renault is considering stopping its factory in Busan next week, and Fiat Chrysler CEO Mike Manley told the FT his firm could be forced to halt one of its European factories.
Analysts warn of broader troubles if Beijing extends the Lunar New Year holiday further as the coronavirus -- which according to official figures has infected more than 31,000 people in China and killed 636 -- continues to spread.
""The biggest problem is that we don't know how the outbreak in China will unfold,"" said Cheong In-kyo, an economics professor at Korea's Inha University.
""South Korean companies rely heavily on China for parts and components. The problem is even if just one part is missing, you can't do anything.""
The disruption was only just beginning, he added, and warned it would spread beyond the auto sector.
""There is not a single category that is not manufactured in China.""
'EVERYONE IS IMPACTED'
The People's Republic is the world's biggest exporter of goods, with the US by far its largest trading partner.
Exports to the US from China and Hong Kong combined -- many goods are shipped via the financial hub -- totaled more than $450 billion last year, followed by Japan with more than $150 billion. South Korea and Vietnam also both imported goods worth more than $100 billion from the pair.
""China has become an integral part of the global manufacturing supply chain, accounting for about one-fifth of global manufacturing output,"" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics.

Toyota extends China plant closure over virus

Its neighbors will be hit by supply chain effects first, he said, naming Taiwan and Vietnam, followed by Malaysia and Korea.
The effects in the US would be delayed by the length of the supply lines, said Kristin Dziczek of the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Michigan, but there would be secondary impacts on parts from other overseas markets built with Chinese items.
Automakers and suppliers were ""evaluating and planning how to navigate the disruptions"", she said. ""But there is no capacity the size of China sitting idle waiting to fill in the gaps and it's difficult to move quickly in this environment when everyone is impacted.""
'SO DEPENDENT'
The global car industry was plunged into turmoil when a single Renesas Electronics factory in Japan -- making a vital and widely-used microcontroller -- was put out of action by the 2011 Fukushima earthquake.
Supply lines have since become much more diversified, analysts say.
""Car manufacturers have a system of multiple sourcing because the risk would be too big to have only one supplier in one place for a particular part,"" said Ferdinand Dudenhoeffer, director of Germany's Center Automotive Research.
It was standard for parts to be provided by ""at least two different suppliers"", he said, adding that as part providers tended to be in the same region as the vehicle assembly line, ""the car industry in Europe or America is much less exposed to a Chinese risk than Asian countries like Korea or India"".
But sourcing wiring harnesses from three different companies failed to protect Hyundai's South Korean plants.
""We should have more diversified suppliers,"" said production worker Park. ""It's a shame that there is nothing we can do at this point because we are so reliant on one country.""

Denis Balibouse, Reuters


MANILA — Despite the rapid rise in new coronavirus infections at the Chinese province where the outbreak began, there is no similar acceleration elsewhere, a World Health Organization (WHO) official said Thursday. 
“There has been a constant increase in cases in Hubei province but we haven’t seen that acceleration in provinces outside of Hubei,” said Dr. Michael Ryan, head of the WHO Health Emergencies Programme, during a press briefing in Geneva on Thursday.
“And equally we haven’t seen that acceleration in Hong Kong, Macau, in Taiwanese people either. I think again we are seeing a relatively stable situation outside of Hubei,” he added.
However, Ryan said there are also “cycles of transmission” and that it is possible that there will again be an increase in the coming days. 
As of Thursday morning in Geneva, there was a slight dip in the rate of rise in cases of the 2019 novel coronavirus acute respiratory disease (2019-nCoV ARD).
“The cumulative number, it looks like the daily numbers are rising but the number reported today compared to the number reported yesterday is actually down today. It doesn’t mean anything but it’s enough going in the right direction,” Ryan said.

READ: WHO: Too early to say new coronavirus peaking in China

“Nearly 3,700 cases of coronavirus confirmed on a single day is nothing to celebrate,” he said when asked if the dip meant that the transmission of the new strain of the new coronavirus was peaking. 
“I think it’s right now too early to make predictions,” he explained. “Although we are pleased that the numbers from today are the first day in which the overall numbers of confirmed cases reported from China have dropped, and so we are thankful, and I’m sure our colleagues on the frontline in China are thankful too.”
“But it is very difficult to make any prediction relating to that. We are still in the middle of an intense outbreak and we need to be very careful on making any predictions,” he added.
As of Friday morning (Manila time), the death toll in the novel coronavirus outbreak has risen to 636, with more than 30,000 people infected.

READ: China virus death toll hits 636, more than 30,000 infections

A Reuters report said that the new coronavirus took 48 days to infect the first 1,000 people. This is relatively fast compared to two other human coronaviruses: the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which took 130 days to infect 1,000 people, and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which took 2.5 years to infect 1,000 people.

READ: What we know and do not know about the new coronavirus

This even while the 2019-nCoV ARD has a lower reproduction number of two to three. A reproduction number is the average number of people that can be infected by one patient. 
This number helps health organizations determine if an outbreak will spread or if it is being eliminated. SARS had a reproduction number of two to four compared to measles, which has a reproduction number of 12 to 18.
In the Philippines, there are now three confirmed cases of the 2019-nCoV ARD. One of them died - a 44-year-old man who had come to the Philippines from Wuhan, the origin of the virus in Hubei - while two no longer show symptoms of the disease.
Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, technical lead of the WHO’s Health Emergencies Programme, said international experts have been regularly holding teleconferences to share information on the disease, which was said to have started spreading from a market selling wild animals as delicacies in Wuhan in December last year.

Van Kerkhove said the new strain has so far resulted in a “full spectrum of disease.”
“We have mild cases, which look like the common cold, which have respiratory symptoms - sore throat, common cold, runny nose, fever- all the way to pneumonia,” she said during the briefing, which was made available online. 
”And there can be varying levels of severity of pneumonia. All the way to multi-organ failure and death.”
Asked what the demographics of the patients looked like, Van Kerkhove said “underlying conditions (such as diabetes and hypertension) and advance age make an individual more at risk for developing severe disease and death.”
“Individuals who are over 60 years old have a higher risk of death,” she said. “We have seen a breakdown and it appears over (the age of) 80 is the highest risk factor. Increasing age increases the risk for death.”
The WHO has declared a global health emergency because of the epidemic, which has had spillover effects in other countries in the Asia-Pacific and North America.

MANILA- A Filipino who tried to seek medical attention in a clinic at Festival Mall in Muntinlupa City was brought to the hospital after showing flu-like symptoms as malls guard against the spread of the 2019 novel coronavirus.
The patient showed flu-like symptoms during a checkup at the Healthway Medical clinic on Thursday, Festival Mall said in a statement, and was immediately brought to the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine in Muntinlupa.
""Rest assured that Festival Mall has been taking precautionary measures to assure the safety of our shoppers, business partners, and its employees,"" the mall said.

 
Festival Mall added that it also coordinated with the Muntinlupa City Health Office over the incident.
The mall remains fully operational, it clarified.
Malls and business establishments have set up alcohol stations and purifiers, and other measures against the spread of the novel coronavirus which was first confirmed in the Philippines last week.
The novel coronavirus has killed at least 630 people and infected more than 30,000 worldwide in a matter of weeks, authorities said Friday.

MANILA - Residents of Capas will be ""kept safe and protected"" from the quarantine zone for repatriated Filipinos from the epicenter of the 2019 novel coronavirus, the agency that manages the Tarlac facility said Friday.
""Preventive and precautionary measures are being put in place"" in the New Clark City before it serves as the quarantine area for Filipinos from Wuhan, China, the Bases Conversion and Development Authority said in a statement.
""We would like to assure the municipality of Capas and its officials that the national government will address all the issues and concerns raised following the decision of the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases to use New Clark City as a quarantine site for our repatriated kababayans,"" it said.
""All preventive and precautionary measures are being put in place by the Task Force not only for our repatriated kababayans, but to also ensure that the adjacent communities of New Clark City and all Capaseños are kept safe and protected,"" it said.
The statement was released hours after Capas town Mayor Reynaldo Catacutan urged the national government to reconsider the decision, saying the local government was not consulted in the ""last-minute"" decision.
The mayor did not cite further reasons for his appeal and apprehension.
Some 50 overseas Filipino workers from Wuhan, where the pathogen originated, availed of the government's repatriation program and is expected to arrive in the country over the weekend.
The new coronavirus strand has killed at least 600 people and infected 30,000 others worldwide.
The local health department earlier said n-cOV was not a death sentence and that most of those afflicted eventually recover. Data from China showed that most of the fatalities were over 60 years old and had pre-existing medical conditions.

MANILA — Authorities have identified more than 500 people who came in close contact with the Philippines' 3 confirmed cases of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV), with some now being monitored for possible infection, the health department said Friday. 
The group that interacted with the first 2 patients -- a man and a woman from the epicenter of the disease in Wuhan, China -- included 379 passengers and crew members from flights that the pair took. 
Another 62 people were from hotels, resorts, a hospital, public vehicles and other areas they visited, said Health Undersecretary Eric Domingo. 
Some 106 people, meanwhile, were traced as those who had contact with the third patient.
Domingo said that while the DOH Epidemiology Bureau has now identified all 441 people that came into contact with the first two patients, 206 have yet to be interviewed because of “erroneous contact information.” 
“Of the contacts reached, 203 were placed on home quarantine, while the 32 contacts exhibiting symptoms were categorized as PUIs (patients under investigation),” he said. 
With 22 people already interviewed and placed on home quarantine, another four people showing symptoms were also categorized as PUIs.
Domingo said they were already working with police and local authorities to find people who interacted with the couple during their visits to Cebu, Dumaguete and Manila.
While the 38-year-old Chinese woman is already recovering from the novel coronavirus, her 44-year-old partner has died.

A third patient, a 60-year-old Chinese woman, had already recovered and left the Philippines by the time the DOH learned that she contracted the virus. Because of this, the Epidemiology Bureau were reaching out to people in Cebu and Bohol who possibly interacted with her. 
“To date, 106 contacts were traced, this includes 90 co-passengers and 16 individuals from hotels and hospitals in contact with the 3rd confirmed case,” Domingo said.
As of Friday, the Philippines has recorded 215 patients probed for possible novel coronavirus infection, including the three confirmed cases so far: the first 2 patients and another 60-year-old woman from Wuhan who tested positive for the virus, said Domingo.

MANILA- Filipino tourists bound for Jeju Island in South Korea will no longer be allowed to visit the tourist spot without a visa, the Bureau of Immigration said Friday as the East Asian country guards against the spread of the 2019 novel coronavirus.
The new travel protocol was implemented after the Korean Embassy in Manila told the Bureau of Immigration of the temporary suspension of visa-free entry of Filipino tourists to Jeju.
""We have already instructed our immigration officers not to allow the departure of any Filipino bound for Jeju unless the passenger was issued a visa by the Korean embassy,"" BI port operations division chief Grifton Medina said in a statement.
There are no direct flights from Manila to Jeju, except for chartered flights.
The suspension of visa-free entry privileges to Jeju is not limited to Filipinos but to all foreign tourists as well, Medina added.
The virus, which originated from Wuhan City in China, has prompted governments worldwide to step up precautionary measures against the pathogen which is rapidly spreading.
The Philippines confirmed its first case of the novel coronavirus, which causes flu-like symptoms last week, prompting the government to bar travel to China and its territories.

BEIJING, China – The official Chinese death toll from the coronavirus outbreak rose on Friday to 636, with the government saying total infections had climbed past 30,000.
The toll was raised by 73 new deaths from the epidemic, the National Health Commission said in its daily update.
Another 3,143 new cases of infection were confirmed, bringing total infections in the country thus far to 31,161, it said.

Immigration spokesperson Dana Sandoval said 177 Chinese, mostly tourists, left the Ninoy Aquino International Airport Terminal 1 at 9:06 p.m. Wednesday on board a chartered flight arranged by the Chinese Embassy in Manila.
“Nahihirapan sila mag-book ng ticket kasi wala outbound flights dahil nag-cancel na ang mga airlines,” she said.

“Parang mga OFWs natin na gusto nila umuwi kasi nahihirapan na din sila mag-book ng flights to go home,” she added.
(They’re like our overseas Filipino workers who want to go home but find it difficult to book flights.)
Philippine carriers Philippine Airlines (PAL), Cebu Pacific and Air Asia have cancelled flights to mainland China after the Philippine government imposed a travel ban on February 2.
The ban prohibits foreigners who travelled to China in the past 14 days from entering the Philippines and bars Filipinos from travelling to China, except in certain circumstances.
PAL has announced it would mount special flights on Feb. 10 from Manila to Xiamen and back to service stranded Filipinos.
The travel ban came amid the quick spread of the 2019-nCoV, the outbreak of which began in Wuhan, China. The Philippines has confirmed three cases of the virus here- all Chinese citizens who had come from Wuhan. One of the patients died on Saturday, becoming the first death from the virus outside China.
Sandoval said the Chinese nationals who left Wednesday make up the first group to leave the country. Many more stranded Chinese citizens are expected to follow suit but Immigration authorities are still waiting for information from the Chinese Embassy on the next scheduled flights.
Sandoval earlier said around 300 Chinese travelers were stranded at the Manila airport because of the cancellation of flights due to the travel ban.

TOKYO—Tokyo 2020 Olympics organizers said Thursday the Games would ""go ahead as planned,"" slamming misinformation over the new coronavirus for triggering panic.
Chief executive officer Toshiro Muto revealed that organizers had set up a task force to combat the fast-spreading disease that has killed over 560 people and infected at least 28,000 -- the vast majority in mainland China -- but promised that the Games would be not derailed.
""The Olympics will go ahead as planned,"" he told reporters after a Paralympic project review.
""It is important to remain objective and cool-headed. We don't want to alarm the public. The infection is still limited and there is no problem staging the Olympics based on the current situation.""
International Paralympic Committee (IPC) spokesman Craig Spence complained that scaremongering had created an ""info-demic"" that could skew public perception in the run-up to the Olympics and Paralympics.
""Fear is spreading quicker than the virus,"" he said. ""It's important we quell that fear. Only 191 of the total cases are outside mainland China, so let's put things into perspective.
""If you compare those rates with the common flu, they are still relatively small numbers,"" added Spence.
""The World Health Organization (WHO) has not declared this a pandemic. We dealt with the Zika virus in Rio and in these matters we need to rely on the experts.
""We will follow the advice of the World Health Organization. Every organizing committee looks into countermeasures, and we have measures in place from previous Olympics and Paralympics here in Tokyo. It is standard practice, it's business as usual.""
More than 20 countries have confirmed cases of the flu-like coronavirus.
GLOBAL PANIC
Japan has had no reported deaths so far, but 45 cases have been detected, including at least 20 people on a cruise ship carrying more than 3,700 passengers and crew quarantined off Yokohama.
The WHO has declared the outbreak a global health emergency.
Japan has warned citizens against non-essential travel to China and fast-tracked new rules including limits on entering the country as it tries to contain the spread of the virus.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Thursday pledged that preparations for the Olympics would proceed as normal.
""The coronavirus is beginning to have an impact on tourism,"" he said. ""But the government will continue to steadily prepare for the Games in close cooperation with the IOC (International Olympic Committee), the local organizing committee and the Tokyo Metropolitan Government.""
The Japanese government has chartered 3 flights to repatriate 565 Japanese nationals from Wuhan, the central Chinese city hardest hit by the virus.
Tokyo governor Yuriko Koike promised at the weekend to implement ""thorough measures"" to protect people from the virus.
The health scare has led to the cancellation of Olympic qualifying events in China such as boxing and badminton.
The Tokyo Olympics begin on July 24 with the Paralympics starting on Aug. 25.

MANILA - The Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth) has warned its member-hospitals to accept all patients with suspected infection of the new coronavirus.
Should accredited medical institutions refuse to provide care to patients, the state health insurance agency said they will be dealt with by the corporation accordingly.
""Refusal to provide care to said patients shall be considered a violation of the signed Performance Commitment and shall be dealt with by the Corporation accordingly,"" PhilHealth president and chief executive officer Ricardo Morales said in a statement released Wednesday.
All accredited level 2 and 3 hospitals, which have the capacity to perform quarantine and manage infectious diseases, are directed to accept suspected cases of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus acute respiratory disease (2019-nCoV ARD) for assessment and appropriate management, Morales added.
PhilHealth also reiterated that the World Health Organization (WHO) had already declared the outbreak a global health emergency.
""PhilHealth is working hand in hand with the Department of Health and other concerned agencies to ensure that all Filipinos are protected from risks brought about by this emerging disease,"" Morales said.

Duque: PhilHealth to offer coverage for suspected new coronavirus cases 

Health Secretary Francisco Duque III earlier said PhilHealth would offer a special package for its members with symptoms of the new strain of coronavirus.
The package includes a P1,000 per day for each hospital taking care of a suspected nCoV patient, he had said.

Philippines confirms 3rd new coronavirus case

As of Wednesday, the number of confirmed coronavirus infection in the country was 3, including a Chinese man who died from severe pneumonia on Feb. 1. It was the first recorded nCoV-related death outside China.

China virus death tolls rises to 560: govt 

Philippine health authorities are also monitoring 178 patients for possible infection of the virus, which has killed nearly 600 in China.

The Philippine Sports Commission on Thursday said that a number of national events has been postponed, as the country deals with the 2019 novel coronavirus. 
The PSC has also proposed moving the 10th ASEAN Paragames at a later date.
In a press conference, PSC chairman William Ramirez said the National Sports Summit 2020, the Philippine National Games, Batang Pinoy, and Children’s Games will be rescheduled, although no dates were mentioned.
Seminars and other gatherings with 40 or more participants have also been shelved indefinitely.
Ramirez said that his office also recommended the postponement of the 10th ASEAN Paragames, which is penciled for March 20 to 28.
“We have a board resolution advising the Paralympics to possibly postpone the games,” he said.
The decision comes down to the Philippine Paralympic Committee.
PPC president Mike Barredo said he will fly to Thailand on Friday to discuss the issue with the ASEAN Para Sports Federation.
Amid the global spread of the 2019 nCoV acute respiratory disease, the PSC is focused on the welfare of the athletes and coaches bound for the Tokyo Olympics later this year.
“In terms of preventive measures, we have put out information materials for our national athletes and coaches,” said Marc Velasco, the PSC chief of staff and the national training director.
“The PSC Board will not approve any foreign trips and exposures to China. Caution will be exercised on allowing athletes and coaches traveling to other countries for international competitions

SPECIAL FLIGHT PA-CHINA
Samantala, dahil sa laki ng demand ng mga banyagang pasahero sa Pilipinas na papuntang China, magsasagawa ng special flight ang Philippine Airlines (PAL) sa Lunes, Pebrero 10, ayon sa tagapagsalita ng airline.
Ito ay sa kabila ng ibinabang ban ng Pilipinas sa pagbiyahe papunta at pabalik ng Mainland China, Hong Kong at Macau bilang pag-iingat sa pagkalat ng novel coronavirus.
Lilipad nang balikan mula Ninoy Aquino International Airport at Xiamen, China ang eroplano.
Hindi bababa ng eroplano ang flight crew at piloto, pero pagbalik ng Pilipinas ay sasailalim ang mga ito sa 2 linggong quarantine, ayon kay PAL Spokesperson Cielo Villaluna.
Nasa 27,300 na ang nahawahan ng novel coronavirus, karamihan ay galing sa China, habang hindi bababa sa 560 ang namatay.
Sa Pilipinas, 3 na ang kumpirmadong kaso ng novel coronavirus, kabilang ang isang lalaking Chinese na pumanaw dito at isang babaeng pasyenteng nakabalik na ng China bago pa nakumpirmang positibo siya sa virus.
Samantala, isang Pinay household worker naman sa Dubai ang naiulat na nasawi dahil sa hindi pa natutukoy na strain ng coronavirus, ayon kay Labor Secretary Silvestre Bello III.
Hindi malinaw kung alin sa mga uri ng coronavirus ang ikinamatay ng 58 anyos na overseas worker, na galing General Santos City at 28 taon nang nagtatrabaho doon, ani Bello.

MANILA (UPDATE) - Malacañang has started requiring Palace visitors to fill up a health declaration form in light of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus outbreak.
Reporters covering President Rodrigo Duterte’s event on Thursday afternoon were asked to answer the form, which contains questions on one’s travel history for the past 14 days, as well as recent interactions with animals.
All visitors of Malacañang, including their respective security detail, are required to fill up the form as part of precautionary measures against the virus, Presidential Security Group (PSG) commander Brig. Gen. Jose Niembra told ABS-CBN News.
The forms will be distributed until the Department of Health (DOH) lifts the protocol on the virus, he added.

The PSG began implementing stricter security measures against the virus this week after the Philippines confirmed the entry of the pathogen in the country.
All persons entering the Malacañang complex undergo a temperature check and are also asked to rub their hands with alcohol.
A member of the PSG said those with a body temperature of 38 degrees Celsius or higher will be refused entry. All PSG personnel were also required to wear face masks.

Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles on Wednesday said Cabinet officials also underwent a temperature check before their meeting with the President on Tuesday night.
The President, who earlier said that the virus outbreak was “nothing really to be extra-scared of,” also rejected calls of his staff to limit his public engagements for the meantime, Nograles said.
“He (Duterte) just wants to keep on doing the things he’s doing without imposing limitations sa kaniyang (on his) movement,” the Cabinet secretary said. “He doesn’t want to change the way he conducts his business.”

YOKOHAMA - Thousands of people were stranded aboard 2 cruise ships in Asia on Thursday, quarantined by officials desperate to stem the spread of a deadly virus that has killed hundreds in China and spread panic worldwide.
At least 20 people on board 1 ocean liner off the Japanese coast have tested positive for the new coronavirus, with thousands more staring at a 2-week seaborne isolation. 
The outbreak on the vessel, whose 3,700 passengers and crew hail from over 50 countries, is the latest development in a snowballing global health emergency that has left more than 560 people dead, most of them in China.
Tens of thousands of people have been infected, including a few hundred in around 2 dozen countries.
The World Health Organization, which has declared the outbreak a global health emergency, on Wednesday appealed for $675 million to fight the virus.
In Japan, more than 3,700 people were stuck on board the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which has been held off the port city of Yokohama since Monday night.
Authorities decided to quarantine the ship and test hundreds on board after a former passenger who disembarked in Hong Kong last month tested positive for the virus.
Health Minister Katsunobu Kato told parliament on Thursday that results for 102 people had now come in, with 20 testing positive for the new strain.
In all, 273 people on board were tested, including those who had close contact with the former passenger and others displaying potential symptoms.
The first 10 people diagnosed with the new virus have already been removed from the ship, which on Thursday docked in Yokohama to resupply for a quarantine that could last until Feb. 19.
Ambulances arrived at the port, where officials could be seen dressed in white full-body protective suits, complete with face masks and helmets, to remove the additional 10 people who have tested positive.
An extendable white-tented passageway was wheeled to a door on the side of the massive cruise ship, apparently to protect the identity of people being evacuated from the boat.
'FLOATING PRISON'
""We are confined here full time,"" British passenger David Abel said in a Facebook Live video.
""The meals have completely changed. We are definitely not on a luxury cruise!... It's going to be like a floating prison.""
In Hong Kong, 3,600 passengers and crew spent the night marooned on board the cruise ship World Dream as authorities conducted health checks after 3 former passengers tested positive for the virus.
City health officials said passengers would only be allowed off after tests were completed, with crew checked first and passengers to be screened on Thursday.
Two dozen countries now have confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus that emerged from a Wuhan market selling exotic animals at the end of last year.
China is struggling with a shortage of hospital beds, equipment and materials to treat those infected, despite building 2 hospitals from scratch and converting public buildings to house patients.
'DON'T GO OUT!'
Tens of millions of people, from the eastern industrial heartlands to near the northern border with Russia, have been told to stay indoors as authorities battle to curb the outbreak.
In parts of Hangzhou, 175 kilometers (110 miles) from Shanghai, new restrictions allow only 1 person per household to go outside every 2 days.
""Please don't go out. Don't go out. Don't go out!"" blared a message on a loudspeaker urging people to wear masks, wash their hands regularly and report any people from Hubei -- reflecting a common fear that people from the province might infect others.
Several governments have imposed travel restrictions over the virus, while major airlines have suspended flights to and from China.
Italy announced that passengers on every international flight would be scanned for fever and on Thursday Taiwan banned all international cruise ships from docking.
China has reacted angrily to the travel bans, noting that the WHO does not advise imposing them.
Health experts note that the mortality rate of the new virus, at around 2 percent, is well below that of SARS, which killed 800 people in 2002-2003, around 10 percent of those infected.
Two fatalities have been reported outside the mainland, in Hong Kong and the Philippines.

BEIJING - Students blocked from returning to their universities; tourists forced to extend expensive holidays; a scientist cut off from her lab in the United States: coronavirus entry bans are wreaking havoc on the plans of thousands of Chinese travelers.
From the US to Australia and Israel, several countries have banned entry to foreigners who have recently been in China, while major airlines have suspended flights to and from the country.
AFP spoke to 4 Chinese people in limbo:
EXTENDED VACATION
After traveling to Japan from the Chinese city of Chongqing for a skiing holiday in the mountains of Hokkaido, Wang Bili was supposed to return to Washington, where he works for an international organization, on Feb. 10.
""The American decision was a total shock,"" he said.
""I had to change my tickets for a later date to comply with the incubation period.""
Now he will not be able to return to Washington until mid-February, but he said he doubted whether the US decision would be effective.
""They can't know when a Chinese person left China,"" he said, noting that China does not stamp the passports of its citizens when they leave.
But the main thing bugging the 32-year old is the cost of extending his stay in Japan.
""This will cost me another $1,000,"" he said. ""I'm annoyed but what can I do?""
SYDNEY STUDENT
Like other Chinese students who were back at home when Australia announced its restrictions, Chloe has not been able to return to her university Down Under.
""Some Chinese students didn't even find out about it until they got off the plane in Australia. Then they had to pay out of their own pockets for a flight back to China,"" she said.
She is worried about paying her rent in Sydney, and being evicted if she cannot.
""Will we be able to graduate? It's really a hassle. All of this is upsetting the plans we had for the next 2 or 3 years.""
Her plans to take a holiday in New Zealand before term started again were also ruined, when the country announced similar restrictions.
""I've lost a lot of money in canceled hotel bookings.""
RESEARCH HALTED
When Sherry Huang first heard about the US travel ban, she felt shocked.
""How could such a strict measure come out so suddenly?"" said the 36-year-old, who is staying at her parents' home in Xiamen, in the southeastern province of Fujian.
Huang, who does biomedical research in the United States, had last visited China in 2016. This year was a rare chance to gather with family over the Lunar New Year holiday.
But the Chinese researcher is now stuck on the mainland after Washington banned all foreign nationals who have traveled to China in the last 2 weeks.
That means her lab experiments -– which she cannot conduct remotely –- have been suspended until she returns.
""This is a key time period,"" Huang emphasized. ""I have made some very interesting findings and we can make some new discoveries soon.""
If research is suspended now, she said, the impact will be ""pretty large.""
""China is so big -– implementing a travel ban on an entire country is not reasonable,"" said Huang. ""Such a large-scale travel ban will impact many people's lives.""
NO INFORMATION
A second-year student at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology, Xiao Shen said he has not heard anything from his university or Australian authorities since the ban. 
""Everything I know has come from the news,"" he fumed.
""Australia hasn't told us anything, nothing on whether term has been postponed or if we'll be able to take our classes over the internet... it's really irresponsible. I'm angry."" 
As Chinese students are forced to defer studies, top Australian universities stand to lose around $2 billion in fees alone, according to preliminary estimates from analysts at Standard & Poor's.
Xiao thinks Australia should only have banned entry to tourists, or those coming from Hubei province at the epicenter of the virus. 
""I understand it's for safety reasons but it's too much. They haven't thought about how it will impact foreign students at all.""

SYDNEY - The coronavirus outbreak could deliver a painful multi-billion-dollar hit to Australian universities, as high-paying Chinese students are forced to defer their studies, economists warned Thursday.
Top universities stand to lose around US$2 billion (Aus$3 billion) in fees alone, according to preliminary estimates from analysts at Standard & Poor's.
Under open-ended travel restrictions imposed by the government in a bid to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, non-Australian citizens or permanent residents who have been in China since Feb. 1 are not allowed into Australia.
The virus's outbreak came in between Australia's academic years -- which begin in February -- and as many of the country's roughly 165,000 Chinese university students had returned home for the Lunar New Year.
""Our calculation is one of higher-education fee revenues only, and excludes the broader economic contribution from students to accommodation, tourism, and domestic consumption of goods and services,"" S&P said in a report.
Foreign students are a vital income stream for Australian universities and one that has grown exponentially in recent years.
Australia is now 1 of the top 3 destinations for foreign students worldwide.
Student representatives told AFP that many of those students have not been able to return in time to start this semester and fear missing the whole year because of the way courses are constructed.
Universities have offered to defer placements and reimburse tuition fees, but many are also trying to buy time.
The University of Sydney has extended the last date students have to be on campus to March 30 -- more than a month after classes were due to begin -- and is trying to arrange for remote teaching.
Australia's top universities are expected to be disproportionately hit, but they should be able to absorb the blow, at least temporarily.
""We believe they have some buffer in free cash, leverage, and operating margin ratios to absorb a temporary shock to revenues,"" S&P said.

HONG KONG - Panic buyers in Hong Kong have descended on supermarkets to snap up toilet rolls as the government warned that online rumors of shortages were hampering the city's fight against a deadly coronavirus outbreak.
Videos obtained by AFP showed long queues of frantic shoppers packing trolleys with multiple packets of toilet rolls, with some arguments breaking out.
Rice and pasta have also become a popular target for panic buying.
The footage -- and photos of shelves emptied of toilet rolls -- sparked a call from the government for the public to halt panic buying. 
""In response to various rumors recently that there are shortages of goods such as rice and toilet papers, leading to panic buying and even chaos, a government spokesman today expresses regret over the malicious act of spreading rumors when the city is fighting against the disease, and condemns those rumor mongers with evil intentions,"" the statement said. 
While Hong Kong has closed most of its land borders to mainland China, where the coronavirus outbreak began, freight services have not been affected, the government said.
""There are sufficient stocks of staple food including rice and pastas. There is no need for the public to worry,"" the statement said.
Harold Yip, founder of Mil Mill, a Hong Kong-based waste paper recycling company, told AFP they received over 100 inquiries from members of the public about toilet paper on Wednesday alone.
RTHK news reported that toilet paper and rice at one supermarket in the district of Wanchai -- which had been fully restocked overnight -- were cleared within 30 minutes of the store opening on Thursday morning.
The supermarket chain Wellcome said rumors of shortages were unfounded. 
The coronavirus has killed more than 550 people in China since spreading from the central city of Wuhan late last year. 
Hong Kong now has 21 confirmed infections, including 1 patient who died.
The majority of those infected came from mainland China. 
But in recent days there has been a spike in carriers with no history of travel to the mainland sparking fears local transmissions were growing.
The city's pro-Beijing leader Carrie Lam has faced growing calls to close the border with China, a step she has been reluctant to take saying it would be economically damaging and discriminatory. 
Her administration has gradually cut the number of land border crossings to just 2.
On Wednesday, she announced anyone arriving from the Chinese mainland from Saturday would face a mandatory 2-week quarantine. 
While Hong Kong maintains close economic and cultural links to the Chinese mainland, as seething distrust of the authorities in Beijing permeates the city.
The 2003 outbreak of the SARS virus, which Beijing initially covered up, killed 299 people in Hong Kong and left lasting psychological scars on the densely populated city.
Lam already boasts record-low approval ratings after using riot police to quell 7 months of huge and often violent pro-democracy protests.

SINGAPORE - At least 3 employees of a multinational company that held a meeting of more than 100 international staff in Singapore have contracted the new coronavirus, sparking a World Health Organization investigation of the case.
Malaysia and South Korea have confirmed 3 cases of the virus related to the mid-January company meeting held with 94 overseas staff at the Grand Hyatt hotel, and Singapore said late on Wednesday 4 other attendees were showing symptoms.
Authorities have not revealed the name of the company that held the meeting or said what business it is involved in.
Malaysian health authorities have said people from China including 1 from the city of Wuhan, where the virus emerged in December, attended.
""WHO is coordinating with relevant ministries of health in relation to it,"" Olivia Lawe-Davies, a spokeswoman for the WHO, said in response to questions from Reuters.
""As countries are stepping up surveillance, the detection of more cases of local transmission can be expected.""
Singapore has reported 28 cases of the coronavirus, including some involving person-to-person transmission.
The cases linked to the Singapore business meeting provide more evidence the virus is spreading through human-to-human contact outside China, which the WHO has said is deeply concerning and could signal a much larger outbreak.
China reported its biggest daily jump in fatalities from the virus on Thursday, up 73 to 563, although there have been only 2 reported deaths outside mainland China.
Malaysian health authorities first revealed the link to the Singapore business meeting when they confirmed the case of a 41-year-old Malaysian who had attended it, along with colleagues from China.
South Korea subsequently confirmed 2 cases involving South Korean who attended the conference. The Koreans and the Malaysian shared a buffet meal during the conference, South Korean media reported.
Of the 15 Singapore attendees, 4 have been referred to its National Center for Infectious Diseases, Singapore's health ministry said. All the overseas attendees have left Singapore, the ministry added.
A spokesman for the Grand Hyatt, Gerald Kheng, said the hotel had been deep cleaned after it was first informed of the incident by the health ministry on Tuesday and it was not aware of any other cases among guests or staff.
The city-state says no evidence has emerged of widespread community spread but it announced new precautionary measures on Tuesday including halting group activities such as school assemblies.
Several firms in Singapore have suspended business and media events, including a big travel fair, but the Singapore Airshow is set to go ahead next week albeit on a smaller scale.

TAIPEI - Workers making iPhones at tech giant Foxconn's plant in central China will be quarantined for up to 2 weeks, the company said Thursday, as cities on the mainland tighten their defenses against the deadly coronavirus outbreak.
Also known by its official name Hon Hai Precision Industry, Foxconn is the world's biggest contract electronics maker and assembles Apple's iPhones, as well as gadgets for other international brands.
Foxconn's vast network of factories in China, including one of its largest in Zhengzhou in central Henan province, are set to resume operations on Feb. 10 after an extended Lunar New Year holiday caused by the outbreak. 
But the company said it has advised instate and out-of-state employees at the Zhengzhou plant to be quarantined for 7 and 14 days, respectively, in accordance with local government policies.
China's industrial base has been buffeted by the outbreak of the virus, which began in the manufacturing hub of Wuhan in central China but has since spread to more than 20 countries. 
The number of confirmed infections has hit more than 28,000 in China while death toll passed 560 in an outbreak that has spiraled into a global health emergency.
The virus is also set to have an impact on international supply chains and manufacturing given China's lynchpin role in the global economy. 
Foxconn now projects a sales increase of 1 to 3 percent this year, down from a January forecast of 3 to 5 percent, chairman Young Liu told Bloomberg News.
Foxconn has tried to allay fears of production shortfalls, saying it had previous experience of viral outbreaks following the SARS epidemic in 2003. 
It is China's biggest private-sector employer with more than 30 factories and research facilities -- including 1 in Wuhan.
Taiwan has reported 11 confirmed cases so far, mostly people returning from Wuhan.
The government announced Thursday that all foreigners who resided or visited China, Hong Kong or Macau in the past 14 days will be temporarily barred from entering the island. 
Foreigners with residency permits in Taiwan returning from these areas must undergo a 14-day stay-home quarantine.

MANILA—Getting vaccinated against flu and pneumonia may help protect people against the new coronavirus, a health expert said Wednesday.
""Magpabakuna kayo because it might save your life. Kahit wala pa tayong nCoV na vaccine, meron naman tayong vaccine sa trangkaso at sa iba't ibang bagay, sa pneumonia,"" Dr. Edsel Maurice Salvana of the National Institute of Health (NIH) said during the Kapihan sa Manila Bay press forum.

""Kasi nga 'yong mga namatay sa nCoV... karamihan do'n, 70 percent, meron silang preexisting illness, or matandang-matanda or batang-bata... Mas mabubuhay ka kung healthy ka,"" added Salvana, director of the NIH's Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology.

The second confirmed case in the Philippines, a 44-year-old man from Wuhan, China, died of severe pneumonia.
""Kung nabakunahan sana siya, baka hindi siya namatay,"" Salvana said.
Meanwhile, another medical doctor urged the elderly to get vaccinated because they are more at risk in getting infections. 
""Anybody above 50 to 55 years old, basta meron underlying disease—mahina ang baga, chronic asthma, may diabetes na uncontrolled, cardiovascular conditions—[it would be] best magpabakuna na kayo against pneumonia because that would really help protect or reduce your chances of infection,"" said Dr. Beaver Tamesis, president of the Philippine Pharmaceutical & Healthcare Association of the Philippines.
(Anybody who is 50 to 55 years old, has underlying disease— weakened lungs, chronic asthma, uncontrolled diabetes, cardiovascular conditions—it is best for you to get vaccinated against pneumonia because that would really help protect or reduce your chances of infection.)
Flu vaccines, for example, must be taken annually, especially between May to August, Tamesis said.
""It can shorten your illness—from 10 days to as short as 1, 2 days or even just hours or totally protect you against the infection,"" he said.
To date, there is no medicine to prevent or treat those infected with the new coronavirus, but health authorities are racing to develop a treatment.

The Philippines on Wednesday confirmed its third case of the 2019-nCoV ARD—a 60-year-old woman from Wuhan, the epicenter of the respiratory contagion. She has since gone back to China after overcoming the disease.

An event in Manila that was supposed to be attended by K-pop boy band EXO has been cancelled amid concerns over the 2019 novel coronavirus.
The band was set to hold an event in February 22 to mark the 8th anniversary of South Korean cosmetics brand Nature Republic in the Philippines.
But fears over the 2019 novel coronavirus, which has infected over 24,000 worldwide and killed nearly 500, prompted organizers to cancel the event.

 
“We regret to inform all of you that the ‘Journey to the Nature Republic in Manila’ on Feb. 22, 2020 will be cancelled,” Nature Republic Philippines announced in a Facebook post on Wednesday.
EXO debuted in 2012 under SM Entertainment, one of the major players in the K-pop industry.

MANILA - Baguio City is not on lockdown amid the threat of the new coronavirus, its mayor clarified on Wednesday.
""Wala pong lockdown sa Baguio (There's no lockdown in Baguio.) We are still open to visitors and tourists,"" city mayor Benjamin Magalong told radio DZMM.
He made the announcement after Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana earlier said the Philippine Military Academy (PMA) homecoming may be rescheduled due to a supposed city-wide lockdown for tourists and visitors.
""Gusto ko lang pong klaruhin dahil honest mistake ko naman po 'yong nabanggit niya (I just wanted to clarify because what he mentioned was my mistake),"" Magalong said.
Due to the growing spread of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus acute respiratory disease (2019-nCoV ARD), the city had also postponed several crowd-drawing activities, such as the Cordillera Administrative Region Athletic (CARAA) Meet and International Jazz Festival.

""Everyday tinitingnan ang kanilang condition, mini-measure ang kanilang temperature (They are checking their conditions and measuring their temperatures everyday),"" he said, adding the schools have also temporarily refused accepting students.
As temperature in Baguio continues to drop, Magalong also allayed fears that flu may be common in the city because of the colder weather.
""Marami po kaming respiratory problems, cases dito dahil malamig... kaya may flu-like symptoms kami rito at tinututukan po ng Department of Health (DOH) (We have many respiratory cases here because of the cold weather... that's why some are exhibiting flu-like symptoms and the DOH is on top of it),"" he said.
On Wednesday, the city's temperature is expected to drop to 11 degree Celsius due to amihan or northeast monsoon, which brings cold air from the northern hemisphere, according to state weather bureau PAGASA.

MANILA - The number of patients being observed for possible infection of the new coronavirus has increased to 133, the Department of Health (DOH) said Wednesday.

READ: Patients checked for new coronavirus in PH rise to 105

“We have a cumulative total since the beginning of 133 PUIs [patients under investigation]. Of the 133 PUIs, 115 are admitted and isolated while 16 have been discharged under strict monitoring,” Health Undersecretary Eric Domingo said in a press conference.
PUIs are those who recently traveled to China, where the 2019 Novel Coronavirus acute respiratory disease (2019-nCoV ARD) originated, and show signs of illness such as fever, colds and cough.
Of those being checked, 63 are Filipinos, 54 are Chinese and 16 are of other nationalities. Thirty-two of them had traveled to Wuhan City in China, where the first cases of the new coronavirus were reported.
Bacolod City, meanwhile, said two men are under quarantine in a hospital for having history of travel to areas where cases of the new coronavirus have been recorded.
Dr. Grace Tan, spokesperson of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Acute Respiratory Disease Inter-Agency Task Force, said one of the patients under investigation is a 67-year-old foreigner who had a layover in Taiwan prior to his flight back to the Philippines and Negros Occidental on Jan. 21.
The other PUI is a 40-year-old Filipino who traveled to Hong Kong and returned home on Jan. 27.
Medical Center Chief II Dr. Julius Drilon said they are still waiting for results of the test conducted on two other PUIs who have been quarantined since Feb. 1 and 3.
In Tarlac, 6 PUIs tested negative for the virus, the Tarlac provincial government said in a Facebook post. Gov. Susan Yap said the capitol is undertaking all measures to prevent the spread of the virus 
As of Wednesday, the Philippines has 3 confirmed cases of the virus. The first 2 are a Chinese couple from Wuhan, China. The 44-year-old man died but the 38-year-old woman is recovering and no longer showing signs of illness but remains in hospital. 
Meanwhile, the third case is a 60-year-old woman who was belatedly diagnosed. She was already cured and cleared to return to China when test results arrived confirming that she was infected with the disease.

READ: Philippines confirms 3rd new coronavirus case

Contact tracing for the Chinese couple yielded 203 contacts so far. Of that number, 188 are quarantined at home but 15 are showing symptoms of illness. 
While the 14 are already in isolation, DOH is seeking local government and police assistance to bring the last person to the hospital. “He initially refused to be admitted,” Domingo explained.
The DOH is still calling on other passengers of Cebu Pacific flight 5J 241 from Hong Kong to Cebu on Jan. 20 and 21, 2020; Cebgo flight DG6519 from Cebu to Dumaguete on Jan. 21, 2020; and Philippine Airlines flight PR 2542 from Dumaguete to Manila on Jan. 25, 2020 to cooperate with authorities.
The DOH Epidemiology Bureau has also started contact tracing those who interacted with the 3rd confirmed case. These will be those from her Hong Kong to Cebu flight on Jan. 20 and her subsequent flight to Bohol. 
As far as the DOH is concerned, she was no longer infectious during her flight from Bohol to Cebu and then back to China.
As of Wednesday, at least 490 people have died because of the disease while 20,000 are infected, most of them from China.

HANOI - Vietnam is setting up field hospitals with thousands of beds to handle a potential influx of coronavirus cases, health officials said, as it prepares to receive its nationals from China.
Vietnam shares a long porous border with China and the communist neighbors have close trade and tourism ties. 
So far Vietnam has 10 confirmed cases of coronavirus -- including 3 people with no recent travel history to China.
The virus, declared a global health emergency by the World Health Organization, has so far killed nearly 500 people and infected more than 24,000, mostly in mainland China. 
Travel restrictions, flight bans and quarantines have been imposed as countries ramp up efforts to control the fast-spreading pathogen.
In Vietnam's southern business hub of Ho Chi Minh city -- where 3 cases of coronavirus have been confirmed -- 2 existing facilities are being converted into field hospitals with a total capacity of 500 beds. 
They will ""receive, monitor and treat"" all suspected patients of coronavirus if the epidemic spreads further, according to the director of the city's health department, Nguyen Tan Binh.
In Hanoi, 2 military facilities have been turned into quarantine centers for up to 1,500 people as the country prepares to receive 950 people from China to be isolated at the sites. 
Two provinces in northern Vietnam near the China border have also set up beds for close to 3,000 patients. Central Vietnam has centers ready for as many as 3,700. 
Vietnam has not announced plans to repatriate it citizens from China en masse, though 21 Vietnamese students in Wuhan -- the center of the epidemic -- could be brought back on a chartered flight, the government said.
Vietnam has banned all flights to and from mainland China and suspended new tourist visas for Chinese nationals or foreigners who have been there in the past 2 weeks.
All passenger trains to and from China have also been halted.

HONG KONG - Hong Kong was testing over 1,800 passengers and crew on a cruise ship for a coronavirus that originated in Wuhan, after some crew members reported having fever and other symptoms.
Authorities were not letting anyone leave the ship without permission.
The Chinese-ruled city's health department said Wednesday 90 percent of the passengers were Hong Kongers and no mainland Chinese were on board. 
Previously, 3 mainland Chinese that had been on the ship between Jan. 19 and 24 were found to have contracted the virus.
The World Dream ship, operated by Dream Cruises, was denied entry in the southern Taiwan port of Kaohsiung on Tuesday. On Monday, the ship visited Taiwan's northern Keelung port.
It was not clear how long passengers and crew would be kept on the ship.

MANILA - Justice Secretary Menardo Guevarra on Wednesday stood by his earlier directive ordering the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) to investigate peddlers of ""fake news"" about the 2019 Novel Coronavirus acute respiratory disease (2019-nCoV ARD).
In a message to reporters, Guevarra said crimes under the Revised Penal Code in relation to the Cybercrime Prevention Act may be filed against those responsible.
‪""If the intent in causing the publication of false information is to create or aggravate public disorder, or undermine government efforts during a state of public emergency, and such publication is effected by means of information technology, appropriate charges under the Revised Penal Code in relation to the Cybercrime Prevention Law may be filed against perpetrators,"" he said.
No Philippine law, however, defines or punishes ""fake news."" 
Asked for guidelines on how to determine ""fake news,"" Guevarra said he would leave it to the cybercrime experts of the DOJ and the NBI.
""The DOJ and the NBI have their own cybercrime experts. I suppose they’ll scope the field muna and see if there’s a malicious scheme or pattern somewhere,"" he said.
GUEVARRA: PROBE MY IDEA
Guevarra insisted investigating peddlers of ""fake news"" about the new coronavirus was his idea.
""I have personally observed a slew of internet/social media communications that tend to sow panic and confusion regarding this public health issue, and it was also raised during the Senate hearing yesterday. Malacañang had nothing to do with it,"" he said.
He added: ""There are limitations to this constitutional right, including the greater interest of the public.""
The Supreme Court had previously struck down the government's attempt to prevent the airing of ""Hello Garci"" tapes, which purportedly showed then-President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo instructing a Comelec official to rig the 2004 polls.
In the 2008 case of Chavez vs. Gonzales, the high court considered a form of prior restraint the statement of then-Justice Secretary Raul Gonzales and a press release from the National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) warning radio and broadcast media that the airing of “Hello Garci” tapes will result in the cancellation of their certificates of authority.
 
SC said the warning regulated the content of the speech and prior restraint could only be justified if there was a clear and present danger sought to be avoided.
Guevarra said the clear and present danger the government seeks to avoid in this case is ""causing undue panic and alarm in part, but also undermining government efforts for a unified and coordinated approach to a common threat that affects us all.""
""The nCoV threat is a very serious public concern and no distraction of government efforts to overcome it will be tolerated,"" he said.

MANILA - President Rodrigo Duterte wants to personally welcome Filipinos coming from China, the origin of the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak, a Palace official claimed Wednesday, as the Philippines prepares for the arrival of the first batch of repatriates on Saturday.
Duterte wants to see the arrival of the repatriates but there are still ongoing discussions with the Presidential Security Group (PSG) and Presidential Management Staff (PMS) over his security, Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles told reporters in Malacañang.
“The President wants to be there. He’d like to be there on Saturday pero tingnan na muna natin sa (let’s see with the) PMS and PSG,” Nograles said.
The President had ordered Health Secretary Francisco Duque III to welcome the repatriates and to ensure that protective measures are in place, Nograles added.
Malacañang on Wednesday said the repatriates would arrive at the Clark International Airport and transported to Fort Magsaysay in Nueva Ecija for a 14-day mandatory quarantine.
As of Wednesday, 42 Filipinos have expressed their desire to come home, according to Foreign Affairs Assistant Secretary Eduardo Menez.

The President, who earlier said that the virus outbreak was “nothing really to be extra-scared of,” also rejected calls of his staff to limit his public engagements for the meantime, Nograles said.
“He (Duterte) just wants to keep on doing the things he’s doing without imposing limitations sa kaniyang (on his) movement,” the Cabinet secretary said. “He doesn’t want to change the way he conducts his business.”

,Feb 05 2020,nCov,Philippines confirms 3rd new coronavirus case,"Kristine Sabillo, ABS-CBN News","
MANILA (4th UPDATE) - A third Chinese patient tested positive for the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in the Philippines but has been discharged and returned to China, the country's health ministry said Wednesday.
The announcement came three days after the Philippine government said Manila's second confirmed case led to the patient's death, marking the first novel coronavirus-related fatality outside China amid the outbreak that has spread to more than 20 countries across continents.
Philippine Health Undersecretary Eric Domingo said the patient is a 60-year old woman from Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the virus. She arrived in Cebu City in the central region, via Hong Kong, on Jan. 20, and then traveled to the neighboring resort island province of Bohol.
""She is the third confirmed 2019-nCoV Acute Respiratory Disease case in the country,"" the health department said in a statement. 
Domingo said the woman, who was traveling with other people, fell ill on her first day in Bohol on Jan. 22. She first stayed in her hotel, but was immediately admitted to a hospital the same day.
Two sets of samples were taken from the patient - one on Jan. 23 and another on Jan. 24. Since the Philippines at the time relied only on Australia's Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory for nCoV infection confirmatory tests, and it can only send limited samples, only the Jan. 24 sample was submitted there.
Results of the tests on the Jan. 24 sample, both by RITM and the VIDRL, ""came back (as) negative,"" Domingo said. They were received on Jan. 29 and 30.
""Upon recovery of the patient, she was discharged and was allowed to return to China via Cebu last Jan. 31,"" the health department said.
Meanwhile, when the RITM acquired the capability to test for 2019-nCoV infection beginning last week, it included the woman's Jan. 23 sample in its examination. This one tested positive for the new virus strain, and the RITM notified the health department on Feb. 3 about the finding.
Domingo said the Department of Health's Epidemiology Bureau has started tracking people who may have interacted or were in close proximity to the patient, especially those in her hotel. The woman’s companions did not exhibit symptoms, he said.
The health department does not consider the woman infectious by Jan. 31 when she was discharged and traveled back to China. But since the positive result came out, efforts to reach her have been made so she can be informed about it.
The passenger traveled to Shenzhen from Cebu on Jan. 31 via flight number Z2 7800, AirAsia said in a statement. 
AirAsia is willing to provide relevant documents to the DOH such as flight manifest and contact details of guests on board the affected flight “given the urgency of the situation,” it said. 
The operating flight crew have been quarantined, while the aircraft will undergo disinfection procedures based on prescribed protocol, the airline said.
“We advise passengers on-board this flight to seek medical help if they have been feeling unwell,” AirAsia said.

Earlier, two Chinese travelers, who also came from Wuhan, tested positive as well for the 2019-nCoV while in the Philippines, although both are classified as ""imported cases."" They arrived, also in Cebu via Hong Kong, last Jan. 21.
The first confirmed case involved a 38-year-old woman, while the second was her companion, a 44-year-old man. The latter, who was also found positive for pneumonia-causing bacteria, died last Saturday, Feb. 1, the first recorded nCoV-related death outside China.
The spread of the outbreak in the Philippines prompted government to ban foreign travelers from all of mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau. Domestically, the public has been scrambling for limited stocks of masks for their protection. 
On Monday, President Rodrigo Duterte called for calm, saying the public should not be scared as the disease would ""die a natural death.""
As of Wednesday, nearly 500 deaths have been recorded in China, while infections have reached over 24,000 in Chinese cities and other Asia-Pacific countries, North America, and Europe. The World Health Organization has declared the outbreak a global health emergency.
The Philippines has so far reported 133 ""patients under investigation"" (PUIs) for the new coronavirus, including the three confirmed cases and another fatality who was later found negative. Thirty-two of them have reportedly traveled to Wuhan, where the virus was known to have spread from a market that sold wild animals as delicacies.
The PUIs include 63 Filipinos, 54 Chinese, and 16 of other different nationalities.
Of the 133, there are 115 who are currently admitted and isolated.

The 43-year-old male patient will be released from the hospital Wednesday after confirmatory test results from the Research Institute of Tropical Medicine (RITM) in Muntinlupa City showed he was cleared of the strain, said CLMMRH chief Dr. Julius Drilon.
The foreigner was quarantined due to his history of travel in Taiwan, where positive cases of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus acute respiratory disease (2019-nCoV ARD) were recorded, said Dr. Jane Juanico of the Department of Health (DOH) Western Visayas.
""The patient can be discharged as soon as he is able and his specialists have issued the necessary clearance,” she added.
The CLMMRH is still monitoring 2 patient under investigation (PUIs) confined at the emerging infection disease facility while waiting for laboratory results from RITM.
""CLMMRH is assuring the public that the hospital is implementing strict infection control measures and protocols in providing treatment to these patients,"" Drilon said in a statement.



Amid growing concern of the possible spread of the virus, the DOH-Western Visayas urged the public to remain calm and vigilant.
“The strengthened surveillance against 2019-nCoV ARD should not cause paranoia. We encourage the public to remain vigilant. We do not want to discriminate. It does not mean that when someone has visited a place where a positive case of nCoV has been recorded, he is already infected,"" said Juanico, head of DOH-Western Visayas' infectious disease section.
As of Wednesday, Feb. 5, the DOH-Western Visayas has recorded 9 PUIs in the region.
Aklan has the most number of recorded PUIs at 6. Two PUIs were recorded in IloIlo and 1 in Negros Occidental.

MANILA - Washing hands frequently is a more effective way to avoid contracting the new coronavirus than using a face mask, a health official said Tuesday.
""Factually, it shows that non-symptomatic people using masks, it will give them a false sense of confidence and put them at more risk because they tend to wash hands less,"" World Health Organization (WHO) Philippines Representative Rabindra Abeyasinghe said during a Senate hearing. 
""Just because you wear a mask, you should not neglect keeping your hands clean. Because if you touch the mask and you have droplets on the outer surface of the mask that somebody else cough on, you could still get infected. What's actually more important is hand hygiene,"" he added.
Face masks, Abeyasinghe reiterated, should be used by people who are exhibiting respiratory symptoms. It should be reserved for high-risk individuals such as health workers and those who are exposed to crowds. 
""We don’t see a benefit of masks to be used by the general public... This is important now if we have to prevent secondary transmission, especially from PUIs [patients under investigation] and outpatient departments of hospitals,"" he said.

 
Evidence indicates that the 2019-Novel Coronavirus acute respiratory disease (2019-nCoV ARD) is transmitted between humans through close contact and mostly by people with symptoms. 
""The evidence today is that more than 90 percent of the transmission is attributed to symptomatic people,"" Abeyasinghe said.
To arrest the spread of the virus, he said those with respiratory symptoms must practice proper cough etiquette and hand hygiene.
""Because if you are coughing and your droplets contain this coronavirus, the virus would be present on utensils, on home items, where an infected person has cough,"" Abeyasinghe said, adding pathogens could survive on surfaces for between 8 to 10 hours.
""Make sure that you make an effort to clean surfaces that are handled by those people. This is a infection prevention measure,"" he added.
The 2019-nCoV ARD, which originated from a market that sells illegal wildlife in the Chinese city of Wuhan, has killed at least 425 people and infected nearly 20,000 others in China.

MANILA - Concerts and other entertainment shows that will gather crowds should be suspended, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said Tuesday, amid concerns over the spread of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV). 
The Department of Health (DOH) has yet to issue an official advisory on concerts, but it will ""certainly be advising"" on suspending such public events, Duque told senators in a Senate inquiry.

Concern about the spread of the virus is growing in South Korea, where 16 cases have been identified so far.

The 2 items were added to a list of designated products, it said.
From Wednesday, sellers who hoard more than one and a half times their average monthly sales volume will face a maximum sentence of 2 years in prison or a fine of up to 50 million won ($42,000).
South Korea has so far seen at least 4 cases of human-to-human transmission of the virus, while a hospitalized Chinese tour guide is believed to have caught the illness while working in Japan.

""Ang panawagan ko lang kay President Duterte na please look into it. Bigyan ng consideration ang OFW, ang HK residents. Please look into it na kailangan namin mag-work,"" said Camaya as he turned teary, adding he was starting to miss his family.
(My appeal to President Duterte is to please look into it. Give consideration for overseas Filipino workers and Hong Kong residents. Please look into because we also need to work.)

Camaya's wife and three children are based in Hong Kong. He said his employer has already told him that they ""need to find a way to get back home"". He said it's not true that just because he is a permanent resident in Hong Kong, he can easily find a job anytime.
""Ang problema yung bills [to pay] ngayong buwan na to, yung month na babayaran namin ngayon. Sinong magbibigay nun? Gobyerno ba? Gobyerno ng HK? Ang hirap e,"" said Camaya.
(The problem is the bill this month. Who will pay for that? Is it the government? Government of Hong Kong? It's so difficult.)

Jona Paredes, a domestic worker in Hong Kong, travelled all the way from La Union to Manila from 12 a.m. to 9 a.m. only to find out several hours later that her international flight to the former British colony would not push through after the ban. Paredes said she had spent 15 hours at the airport and left Manila at around 2 a.m. on February 3. 
She said she met somebody from Laoag who offered her some money so she could go home upon learning about her ordeal.
""Yung pera ko, maigi na lang may nagbigay ng pamasahe sa akin. Yung pera ko konti na lang yung deperensiya kaso kailangan ng dagdag. Maigi may nakasabay ako pinamasahian niya ako ng pandagdag pamasahe dito,"" said Paredes.
(My money...it's good that someone gave me money for my fare.) 
She said they were at the boarding gate when 10 minutes before their flight, they were told that their check-in had been put on hold. Then they were told there was a flight delay and announced it three times and would update at 5 p.m. Finally, they were reportedly told there had been some problems with the Philippine government.
They were then told to head back to the immigration area where they were told their flight had finally been cancelled. So, their record at the immigration was ""void"". 
They were told to approach the Cebu Pacific office to see whether they could rebook or refund their flights.

""Pero sa kalaunan din na naghintay na kami after 5 hours nang paghihintay, isa lang naman pala ang option. Refund din, walang rebook kasi hindi nila alam kung kailan daw mag-o-open ulit yung flight ng papunta diyan sa HK,"" said Paredes.
(But after waiting for 5 hours, there was really only one option. It was to refund. No rebooking because they don't know when the flights will be opened going back to Hong Kong.)
Paredes said she is grateful that her employers have been very understanding and would always remind her that her health and safety were most important. She said they discussed options to get her back to Hong Kong and even Singapore was on the table, but it was after she told them that she might encounter problems should she decide to go to Singapore and it may make matters worse. 
They all agreed and were willing to wait for her return without any conditions and because she was told they love her like a family. She will have to look for some ways to make ends meet while she is in the Philippines. 
""Yung wish ko sana assistance kahit magkano ...pero ang pinaka-wish ko talaga is makabalik ng HK kasi dun talaga ang aking trabaho,"" said Paredes.
(My wish is that there would be some kind of assistance, but my utmost wish is to really come back to Hong Kong because that is where my work is)
For ""Linda"", a Filipino expat based in Hong Kong for five years, the situation is already a double whammy. She said, if nothing changes in a week, she would be forced to stay in Manila and would need to spend a lot of her own money to buy equipment just to keep up with her work in Hong Kong from Manila. 
She is fortunate that she didn't end up going to the airport after receiving a cancellation email from Philippine Airlines.
""I work as a designer for the tourism industry. I've been working in Hong Kong for five years and my work has been impacted by the protests. So, I am anxious to do what I can for our ongoing projects even if business is shut down for now and everyone is working from home,"" said Linda.
The designer said they should have been allowed to travel outbound and been made to sign a waiver knowing the risks, for example, saying they understand how Filipino airplane staff are exposed to danger if flights continue, then give them the option of doing a transfer.
""Because other countries are still ok operating with the risk. We all have to make our choices for the life we ended up making,' said Linda. ""My life is not over but it's still painful and it's a terrible vulnerable feeling to be in a precarious situation where I am not given a choice. I worked really hard to be worthy of my job. I don't want to be in this situation where I am in danger of losing it,"" she added.
Mrs. Smith, a Filipino and Hong Kong resident who works for a furniture solutions company, said she and her British husband were supposed to fly out via Cathay Pacific on February 2 when they were told at the check in counter that she won't be able to fly with her husband because of the ban. 
She said she is lucky she is able to work from home, but if it takes longer than a few days, she'll be more concerned how she can get back to work.
""I find this very frustrating and extremely inconvenient. I feel this travel ban for outgoing Filipinos was careless and not thought out carefully,"" said Mrs. Smith. ""We should at least have a choice to sign a waiver that we choose to go back to where we reside despite the 'risks'.""

The situation was equally frustrating for ""Jane"", a Hong Kong-based regional marketing executive for a global company handling the Asia Pacific market. Jane was in Manila to spend her Chinese New Year holidays when she was among the hundreds who were also caught off guard by the President Duterte's announcement.
""They should have announced it and have a grace period so we wouldn't have had to go to the airport and process everything and we could have planned ahead,"" said Jane. 
""The immediate effectivity was to just cause chaos. I was in the airport for 10 hours. I'm just quite disappointed that no one is speaking on our behalf, on behalf of the OFWs and they're just basically...oh we'll give you P10,000. That won't solve it.""
What made matters worse was around 34 people, who were her co-passengers whom she had spoken with, were unable to locate their baggage after having spent 10 hours waiting at the airport. They were supposed to leave for Hong Kong at around 3pm on February 2 when they were also told their flight was cancelled.
They were told that their baggages had been sent to Hong Kong. She said Cebu Pacific personnel had asked them to leave their contact details and promised to update them as soon as their baggage arrived from Hong Kong.
In a text message to ABS-CBN News, Cebu Pacific Spokesperson Charo Logarta said that because of the confusion from the government's directives, some of the luggage were mistakenly not removed from the plane. She said that passengers would be getting back their baggage on February 4.
For another special administrative region affected, Macau-based hotel housekeeper Jayson Ocenar, an OFW there of four years, said his baby of 1 year and five months, along with his in-laws and relatives were supposed to stay with them for two months after arriving in Macau on January 12. 
But when things got worse in China, he decided to book their flight on February 2, but it got cancelled. He tried to rebook it on February 4, but got cancelled. 
He said they visited the Philippine Consulate in Macau on February 3 and met Filipinos with the same concern. He said some were tourists and visiting their families in Macau. He estimated that around 100 Filipinos were there, including children. And one Filipino had been given a visa extension for one month as the visa was supposed to expire yesterday. He said they have written a request letter for repatriation for the stranded tourists, which include his relatives.

Meanwhile, Hong Kong-based OFWs who are affected by the 2019 n-CoV travel ban with visas expiring soon or those who have been terminated, are encouraged to report to the Hong Kong immigration department about their status.
""There were instances that their flights are cancelled...ma-OS (overstay) sila. (Ang) Advice namin, they should go to immigration for extension of their visa and coordinate with their airline,"" said Assistant Labour Attache and Officer-In-Charge Antonio Villafuerte in a phone interview with ABS-CBN News on February 4.
""Ngayon, kung may problema po sa immigration, that's the time na punta sila ng Assistance to Nationals (sa Consulate) because it will become an immigration case already,"" he added.
Villafuerte said they are scheduled to meet with the Hong Kong Labor Department and the Immigration Department, together with the Philippine Consulate, on Tuesday (February 4) to discuss issues affecting Filipino workers over the current situation on affected Filipino workers in Hong Kong and those in the Philippines.
Filipinos with emergency concerns are advised to call the Consulate's hotline at +852 9155 4023. For matters concerning the Philippine Overseas Labor Office (POLO) and Overseas Workers Welfare Administration (OWWA), nationals are advised to call +852 5529 1880 and +852 6323 9324, respectively.

SEOUL - A South Korean woman has tested positive for coronavirus after visiting Thailand, South Korean officials said Tuesday, the first foreign tourist reported to have been infected after a visit to the southeast Asian nation.
The 42-year-old, identified only as Patient 16, flew back to South Korea on Jan. 19 after traveling in Thailand, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) said in a statement.
Treated since developing chills and other symptoms from Jan. 25, she did not improve until Sunday, the KCDC added, and was confirmed positive on Tuesday, following checks at Chonnam National University Hospital.
The statement did not explicitly rule out a visit to China, however.

MANILA (UPDATE) -- Roughly a fifth of 300 co-passengers of the Philippines' confirmed coronavirus cases have been contacted, Health Secretary Francisco Duque said Tuesday, as he accused airlines of failure to provide contact information. 
Only 17 percent of the passengers on board the Philippine Airlines and Cebu Pacific flights taken by the coronavirus patients in the country have been contacted, Duque told a Senate inquiry. 
Duque earlier said contact tracing was on ""full blast,"" but during the Senate hearing, he said his subordinates failed to inform him beforehand that only 17 percent of passengers have been contacted. 
""In all our meetings there has been no issue that this is a problem. This is an issue on the lack of transparency on the people on my part,"" he said. 
""'Yung mga ganung operational details, hindi nalalaman ng Secretary yan,"" he said, noting that his focus was on the ""big picture"" of the novel coronavirus outbreak. 
Duque said airlines invoked ""confidentiality"" when asked for the contact details of some of their passengers.
""Airlines are not sharing contact details of passengers. They are invoking confidentiality.""
“Ito ang kailangan nating harapin... Meron [list] pero no contact details, redacted,"" Duque said. 
In a separate statement to ABS-CBN News, Philippine Airlines spokesperson Cielo Villaluna said the flag carrier shared passengers' contact details. 
""We shared it to enable DOH to carry out the callouts and on top of that, PAL carried out callouts,"" Viillaluna said in a text message. 
In a statement, Cebu Pacific said it had already provided the DOH and the Bureau of Quarantine with a list of passengers aboard the questioned flights. 
The airline had also reached out to passengers aboard the flight taken by the coronavirus patient, Cebu Pacific director for Corporate Communications Corporate Affairs Charo Logarta Lagamon said. 
“There is no impediment whatsoever for CEB to provide any and all information that the BOQ nd DOH would need from us for their purposes,” she said. 
'SUPER SLOW'
Senator Ronald Dela Rosa described the Health department's contact tracing operations as ""super slow.""
""Once you have the list already, bigay niyo sa PNP. Tapos na yan in 3 days. Wag ninyo solohin ang problema,"" Dela Rosa said, referring to the Philippine National Police which he once headed.
Senator Francis Pangilinan said the ""dismally and incrediblly"" slow performance of the DOH showed a ""failure of leadership"" on Duque's part. 
""Seventeen percent is completely unacceptable at this day, 15 days after [the flight],"" the Pangilinan said.
""How when we stay on top of the situation when the fundamental information is not even in our fingertips?"" he said.
The government has been trying to monitor passengers who came in contact with a Chinese couple who tested positive for the novel coronavirus to curb to check if they are also carriers of the communicable virus.
The new coronavirus strain has killed 327 people and infected some 20,000 other globally since it was first reported in Wuhan, China in late December 2019.
Earlier this week, the Philippines banned travel to and from mainland China and its special administrative regions Hong Kong and Macau as health experts have yet to find a cure to the deadly virus.

MANILA - The National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) can help trace persons who may have been exposed to 2 Chinese nationals confirmed to have contracted the novel coronavirus, Justice Secretary Menardo Guevarra said Tuesday.
Guevarra's statement came a day after Monday's emergency meeting in Malacañang convened by the President with several Cabinet officials.
While the NBI was ""not being called to action yet,"" the agency will be ""on standby to support"" trace those who came in contact with coronavirus patients, the justice chief said.
""The [Department of Health] says they can still handle the contact tracing but the NBI will be on standby to support,"" he told reporters through an exchange of messages.
Guevarra clarified that there were no further instructions for the justice department except for the Bureau of Immigration (BI) ""to implement the travel ban strictly until further orders.""

First novel coronavirus death outside China recorded in PH - WHO official 

Two Chinese from Wuhan, China are the only confirmed 2019-nCoV cases in the Philippines so far. One of them, a 44-year-old, died on Saturday due to severe pneumonia -- the first recorded nCoV death outside China.
Authorities are now tracing the people who may have been exposed to the couple, who arrived in Cebu from Hong Kong on Jan. 21 and who went to Dumaguete before flying to Manila. 
Both were admitted to the San Lazaro Hospital on Jan. 25.
The female companion became the first confirmed nCoV case in the country but is now asymptomatic, according to health authorities.
No cure nor vaccine has so far been developed to combat the virus.

BEIJING - Coronavirus patients arrived Tuesday at a Chinese field hospital built from scratch in under 2 weeks at the front-line of the outbreak, state media said, following a round-the-clock construction marathon that became a national social media sensation.
The 1,000-bed facility was built to relieve hospitals swamped with patients in Wuhan, the city in Hubei province at the epicenter of the national health emergency that has killed more in China than the 2003 SARS outbreak.
Fifty patients arrived at the military-run facility, the state-backed China Daily reported, with images showing workers in protective suits pushing people in wheelchairs up a ramp and into the pre-fabricated structure.
The virus has killed more than 400 people and infected a further 20,000, nearly all of them in Hubei, and spread to 2 dozen countries since it emerged in December at a market that sold wild animals in the city.

The World Health Organization has declared the crisis a global health emergency, and the first death outside China was confirmed in the Philippines on Sunday. 

First novel coronavirus death outside China recorded in PH - WHO official

As reports surfaced of bed shortages in hospitals in Wuhan, construction began on Huoshenshan -- ""Fire God Mountain"" in Chinese -- on Friday, Jan. 24. 
Workers toiled day and night amid a forest of earthmovers and trucks carting materials around the site, southwest of the center of the city of 11 million.
On the side of 1 of the trucks, the isolated city's new rallying cry -- ""Let's go Wuhan!""
FIRE, THUNDER
All workers wore masks, as mandated by the authorities for the entire population of Wuhan, and were checked for fevers during their breaks.
By the following Friday, they had laid 400 prefabricated shipping-container-like rooms, after setting concrete foundations and routing the power supply to the complex.
The 2-floor facility was handed over to the army on Sunday and will be staffed with 1,400 military medics, including some with experience dealing with SARS and Ebola.
State media had initially reported that patients would begin arriving Monday -- inside the 10-day time frame authorities had set out when construction began.
Leishenshan (""Thunder God Mountain""), another hospital on an adjacent site, is set to start admitting patients on Thursday, with 1,600 beds.
Fire and thunder are traditionally associated in China with protection against illnesses.
Authorities said the Wuhan facilities were modeled on the Xiaotangshan hospital in Beijing, which was built from prefabricated structures in barely a week to treat patients infected by SARS in 2003. 
That pathogen killed 349 people in China and hundreds more in Hong Kong and abroad.
However, with the death toll surging in Wuhan and elsewhere in Hubei province, it was not immediately clear what overall impact the hospitals would have on the virus spreading elsewhere.
The city also plans to convert 3 existing venues, including a gymnasium and an exhibition center, into hospitals, the Wuhan government said.
The 3 buildings will be turned into healthcare facilities with a total of 3,400 beds to take in patients with mild symptoms.
 LIVESTREAMED
Footage of the mammoth construction effort was livestreamed continuously on social media and watched tens of millions of times.
It has also been feted endlessly in state media as an example of the decisive response to the public health crisis after authorities in Hubei faced a torrent of public anger for perceived incompetence, including delays in announcing the public health emergency.
Local Communist Party secretary Ma Guoqiang acknowledged Friday that officials had worsened the spread of the virus by failing to restrict travel earlier.
When a lockdown and blanket travel ban were finally introduced, they swept up more than 50 million people in Wuhan and nearby cities.

BEIJING/SHANGHAI - Police in China have detained a woman for ""deliberately concealing"" her contact with someone from an area stricken by the coronavirus and jeopardizing efforts to stop its spread, the Xinhua news agency reported on Tuesday.
China has imposed sweeping measures to try to halt the virus including virtually locking down the central province of Hubei, where the virus emerged in December, and asking anyone who has visited there to isolate themselves for 14 days.
The death toll in China from the newly identified virus has risen to 425 with more than 20,000 cases of infection, authorities reported.

The detained woman, a 36-year-old identified by her surname, Liu, had hurt virus prevention and control work through her action and public security authorities in the northern municipality of Tianjin took her into custody for ""administrative detention.""
The state news agency gave no details of what she had done or say if or when she would be released.
Authorities in some places have threatened dire punishment for anyone violating the law in connection with efforts to battle the virus.
A high court in the northeastern province of Heilongjiang said people who intentionally spread the virus could face the death penalty, according to a Jan. 31 court notice.
Police in Qinghai province in the northwest were investigating a man infected with the virus who ""severely disrupted virus containment and harmed public health,"" Xinhua reported, without elaborating.

HONG KONG (2nd UPDATE) - Hong Kong reported its first coronavirus death on Tuesday, a 39-year-old male who had been suffering from an underlying illness and had visited China's Wuhan city in January, hospital staff said, marking the second death outside mainland China.
The first death outside of China was reported on Sunday - a 44-year-old Chinese man who died in the Philippines after traveling there from Wuhan, the epicenter of the virus.

The death toll in China rose on Tuesday by a new daily record to more than 420 and total infections in China rose by 3,235 to 20,438. There were at least 151 cases in 23 other countries and regions, including the United States, Japan, Thailand, Hong Kong and Britain.

China virus death toll rises to 425: gov't

The Hong Kong death comes as hundreds of medical workers in the Asian financial hub began a second day of strikes on Tuesday to force the government to completely close the city's borders with mainland China, a day after embattled leader Carrie Lam left 3 remaining checkpoints open.
""As Carrie Lam refused to close the border, more (deaths) might come... We are not threatening the government, we just want to prevent the outbreak,"" said Cheng, a 26-year-old nurse attending the strike.
The latest coronavirus epidemic has rekindled memories of the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which killed nearly 300 people in the city.
The former British colony so far has had 15 confirmed cases of the newly discovered coronavirus, including 1 that was transmitted locally.
The Hong Kong resident who died on Tuesday had been kept in an isolation ward after the coronavirus was confirmed last week. His 72-year-old mother, who contracted the virus locally and had no travel history, was staying at home during the incubation period, authorities said.
The United States, Australia, Singapore, New Zealand and Vietnam are among countries that have denied entry to foreign nationals who have recently been in China.
Lam has rejected calls to shut the entire border, saying such a move would be ""inappropriate and impractical"" as well as ""discriminatory"".
On Monday, authorities announced the closure of 4 more border crossings with mainland China, leaving open the international airport, the bridge connecting the city to Macau and the southern Chinese city of Zhuhai as well as Shenzhen Bay Port in the north.
Around 2,700 workers from the newly formed Hospital Authority Employees Alliance (HAEA) went on strike on Monday calling for a sealing off of Hong Kong's border and for better protection for hospital staff.

Holding red and white placards reading ""Save HK now. I am a Hospital Authority staff on strike,"" masked workers on Tuesday spilled out from inside the Authority's Kowloon located headquarters, and onto the main road outside.
Around 9,000 members out of the alliance's roughly 18,000 members are expected to join the strike on Tuesday, HAEA chairwoman Winnie Yu said. 
""Our demands are not something the Hospital Authority can solve so we urge Carrie Lam to negotiate with us directly,"" Yu said.
A spokesman for the city's hospital authority said that due to the large absence of medical staff in public hospitals today, some emergency services have been ""severely"" affected.
In a notice released on Monday, one of Hong Kong's voluntary ambulance brigades - St John Ambulance - announced they would suspend all first aid and ambulance duties due to the recent spread of the coronavirus.

MANILA - The Labor department on Monday directed concerned offices to extend cash and transport assistance as well as accommodations to overseas Filipino workers affected by travel bans due to the outbreak of the novel coronavirus.
Labor Secretary Silvestre Bello III instructed Overseas Workers Welfare Administration's acting secretary Renato Ebarle to provide P10,000 cash assistance, accommodation and transport to stranded departing OFWs, OWWA said in a statement. 
The OWWA halfway house will serve as their shelter while travel arrangements back to the provinces are being made, Ebarle said. 
""The move will help ease the burden on would-be departing workers, and assist them in their transport back to their places of origin,"" Ebarle said in a memorandum.
Select countries and airports worldwide banned travel to and from parts of China to prevent the spread of the 2019 novel corona virus (nCov). 
Hundreds of OFWs bound for Hong Kong and Macau were stranded at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport on Monday, following the travel ban imposed by President Rodrigo Duterte to prevent the spread of the 2019 novel corona virus (nCov) that originated in Wuhan, China.

FRANKFURT, Germany - Cruise lines worldwide will deny boarding to passengers and crew who have recently travelled to China, a global industry body said Monday, as fears grow over the deadly new coronavirus.
In a statement, the Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA) said its members were taking extra precautions to prevent an outbreak of the virus on board cruise ships, where infections can spread rapidly.
""CLIA Members have suspended crew movements from mainland China and will deny boarding to any individual, whether guest or crew, who has travelled from or through mainland China within the previous 14 days,"" the body's Hamburg office said.
CLIA represents some of the world's largest and best-known cruise lines, including TUI, AIDA, MSC, Costa, Royal Caribbean and Carnival Cruises.
The cruise companies were also carrying out careful screening of passengers and crew before boarding, and changing itineraries where necessary, CLIA said.
The industry body added that cruise ships were well equipped to deal with health emergencies.
""The cruise industry is one of the most well-equipped and experienced when it comes to managing and monitoring health conditions of passengers and crew,"" the statement said.
All ships are fitted with medical facilities and have medical professionals ""available around the clock"", it added.
The SARS-like virus that first emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan last month has infected more than 17,000 people and killed over 360 so far.
It has spread to more than 24 countries, including Australia, Germany and Japan.
In a sign of growing anxiety, more than 6,000 tourists were temporarily confined to their cruise ship at an Italian port last week after two Chinese passengers fell ill.
They later tested negative for the coronavirus.

Pero bukod sa novel coronavirus, ayon kay Duque, nagpositibo rin ang lalaki sa Streptococcus pneumoniae at Haemophilus influenza type B.
""We would say that the severe pneumonia must have been caused by the [novel coronavirus],"" ani Duque.
Ayon kay Edmundo Lopez, medical director ng San Lazaro Hospital, may mga hinihintay silang papeles at nakikipag-ugnayan na sa Chinese embassy bago i-cremate ang labi ng lalaki.
Labis pa rin ang pag-iingat sa pangangasiwa sa bangkay ng pasyente dahil baka makahawa pa rin ito.
CONTACT TRACING
Ayon naman kay Chito Avelino, direktor ng DOH Epidemiology Bureau, 74 na tao na ang kanilang na-contact sa contact tracing ng mga posibleng nakasalamuha ng 2 Chinese na nagpositibo sa novel coronavirus.
Ang ilan daw sa mga ito ay nakitaan ng mga sintomas ng flu o trangkaso.
""They were given advice on home quarantine. This will involve isolation inside their house. They are not allowed to interact with their families,"" ani Avelino.
PULISYA TUTULONG SA LOCAL GOVERNMENTS
Inatasan naman ng Department of the Interior and Local Government ang Philippine National Police na tulungan ang mga pamahalaang lokal sakaling ayaw magpa-check up ng isang pinaghihinalaang may novel coronavirus.
Sakop din ng direktiba ang pag-check sa mga condominium unit na may mga residenteng Chinese national.
Nagpahayag naman ng kahandaan ang disaster at health officials ng mga pamahalaang lokal sa Metro Manila.
Ang mga local government ng Pasig, Parañaque at Quezon City ay nagtayo na ng isolation tent para sa mga posibleng kaso ng bagong coronavirus.
Paulit-ulit namang paalala ng mga awtoridad na iwasan ang pagpapakalat ng mga hindi kumpirmadong impormasyon kaugnay ng novel coronavirus, at sa DOH at mga local government na lang makinig.
Ang 2019 novel coronavirus ang pinakabagong strain mula sa pamilya ng mga virus na nagdudulot ng impeksiyon at sakit sa paghinga.
Bukod sa China at iba pang bahagi ng Asya, kumalat na rin ang sakit sa ibang malalayong bansa gaya ng Australia, Germany, France, Finland.

MAYNILA — Sa gitna ng mga pangamba sa bagong uri ng coronavirus, iginiit ng isang doktor na hindi naman kailangan laging magsuot ng publiko ng face mask. 
Ang face mask ay nagsisilbing proteksiyon ng isang tao para hindi mahawa sa sakit ng iba o para hindi makahawa ng iba sakaling siya ang may sakit, ayon sa infectious disease specialist na si Rey Salinel.

Pero mainam lang umano ang paggamit ng face mask kapag pumupunta ang isang tao sa mga masisikip at matataong lugar.
“Doon (congested areas) ka may reason para mag-face mask ka, sa palengke, LRT, MRT, jeep, eroplano. Pero kung walang senyales na kayo ay may ubo, sipon, trangkaso, puwede na kayong hindi mag-face mask,” sabi ni Salinel sa panayam ng “Salamat Dok.”
Bukod sa pagsusuot ng face mask, binigyang-diin din ni Salinel ang paghuhugas ng kamay at pagpapanatili ng malinis na katawan para makaiwas sa novel coronavirus at iba pang mga sakit.

Mga face mask sa Pilipinas, nagkakaubusan dahil sa banta ng 2019-nCoV

Nauna na ring sinabi ng mga health official na sa mga piling pagkakataon lang dapat magsuot ng face mask.
Umapela rin si Health Undersecretary Eric Domingo sa publiko na huwag ubusin ang stock ng N95 face mask dahil mas kailangan ito ng mga health worker na nakatutuok sa paggamot sa mga kumpirmadong kaso ng at hinihinalang may novel coronavirus.

Face masks proteksiyon ba talaga vs bagong coronavirus? DOH nagpaliwanag

Ang 2019 novel coronavirus ang pinakabagong strain mula sa pamilya ng mga virus na nagdudulot ng mga impeksiyon at sakit sa paghinga. Kabilang din sa pamilyang ito ang mga coronavirus na nagdudulot ng severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) at Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).
Sa Pilipinas, may 2 nang kumpirmadong kaso ng novel coronavirus.
Sa bansa rin naitala ang unang pagkamatay ng novel coronavirus patient sa labas ng China, kung saan nagmula ang naturang sakit.

MAYNILA (UPDATE) — Naitala sa Pilipinas ang unang pagkamatay ng isang pasyenteng may novel coronavirus sa labas ng China, sabi ngayong Linggo ng kinatawan ng World Health Organization (WHO) sa bansa, kasabay ng pagpapalawig ng travel ban sa mga biyaherong galing China.
Isang 44 anyos na lalaking Chinese, ang pangalawang kumpirmadong kaso ng 2019 Novel Coronavirus acute respiratory disease (2019-nCoV ARD) sa Pilipinas, ang pumanaw noong Sabado, ayon kay Health Secretary Francisco Duque III.
""This is the first reported death outside China,"" ani Rabindra Abeyasinghe, WHO representative sa Pilipinas, sa isang conference kasama si Duque.
Ang nasabing lalaki ay kasamahan ng 38 anyos na babaeng Chinese na unang kaso ng bagong coronavirus sa bansa.

PH naitala ang unang kaso ng bagong coronavirus

Na-admit sa isang government hospital sa Maynila ang dalawang pasyente noong Enero 25, ayon kay Duque. Nakaranas ng pulmonya, lagnat, ubo, at pamamaga ng lalamunan ang lalaki.
""Over the course of the patient's admission, he developed severe pneumonia,"" ani Duque.
""In his last few days, the patient was stable and showed signs of improvement. However, the condition of the patient deteriorated within the last 24 hours, resulting in his demise,"" dagdag ng kalihim.
Asymptomatic naman ang babaeng pasyente o wala nang pinapakitang sintomas ng virus.
Nagpaalala naman si Abeyasinghe na hindi ""locally acquired"" ang sakit ng lalaki kundi nakuha niya mismo sa Wuhan, na sinasabing pinagmulan ng virus.
""This patient came from the epicenter of this outbreak, Wuhan, China, where there have been very large number of deaths,"" sabi naman ni Abeyasinghe.
Sinabi naman ng Cebu Paficic na nakikipagtulungan sila sa Bureau of Quarantine at National Epidemiology Center para kontakin ang lahat ng mga pasaherong nakasabay ng 2 Chinese national na nagpositibo sa novel coronavirus sa Pilipinas.
Inanunsiyo rin ng Department of Health at Research Institute for Tropical Medicine na 23 patients under investigation (PUI) ang nag-negatibo sa novel coornavirus.
Hinihintay pa ang resulta ng confirmatory test ng apat na PUI.
TRAVEL BAN
Samantala, pinalawig na ng gobyerno ang ban o pagbabawal sa mga biyaherong galing China bilang pag-iingat sa bagong coronavirus.

Bago nito, mga biyahero galing Hubei — ang Chinese province na nakakasakop sa Wuhan — lamang ang naka-ban.
Pero ngayon, inutos ni Pangulong Rodrigo Duterte na isama sa ban ang lahat ng mga biyahero galing China, Hong Kong, at Macau, ayon kay Sen. Bong Go, chairperson ng Senate Committee on Health and Demography.
""The order covers all travelers from China to the Philippines, regardless of nationality,"" sabi ni Go sa radyo DZMM.
Kailangan namang sumailalim sa 14-day quarantine ang mga uuwing Filipino citizen at iyong mga may permanent resident visa, ayon kay Go, ang dating aide ni Pangulong Rodrigo Duterte.
Inabisuhan naman ni Manila International Airport Authority General Manager Ed Monreal ang mga pasahero na may nakatakdang flights papunta at galing China na tingnan ang mga airline website para sa mga advisory at update.
Inabisuhan na rin ng Department of Tourism ang kanilang mga opisina sa China na tiyaking susunod ang lahat sa utos na travel ban.
Pumalo na sa 304 ang bilang ng mga namatay na nahawahan ng novel coronavirus sa China. May 13,700 naman ang bilang ng mga kumpirmadong kaso.

Thousands of Hong Kong medical workers voted Saturday to strike as they urge the government to close its border with the mainland to contain the coronavirus epidemic that has killed 259 people.
The financial hub has 13 confirmed cases of the disease as of Saturday, with 112 patients isolated. 
More than three thousand public hospital staff including doctors and nurses voted to strike if the government fails to meet their demands
""If we do not curb the source (of the virus), the resources of epidemic prevention and manpower will never be enough,"" said Winnie Yu, chairwoman of the Hospital Authority Employees Alliance (HAEA).
""We don't want to go on strike, but the government has been ignoring the demands of the frontline medical workers. We have no choice,"" Yu added.
The HAEA will meet with representatives from their employer -- the city's hospital authority -- on Sunday to negotiate.
The newly formed alliance said 9,000 of its members back the strike, making up 10 percent of the workforce of the city's workforce.
If no deal is reached, around 30 percent of the 9,000 -- those who work in non-essential positions -- would first go on strike next Monday. The rest, who provide emergency services, would afterwards join a four-day strike.
Hong Kong's hospital authority on Saturday said it would come up with a contingency plan.
The city's pro-Beijing administration has resisted public pressure to completely close its border although it has slashed several lesser-used crossings, with the city's chief executive saying on Friday a full closure is not feasible.
The United States has temporarily barred entry to foreigners who had been in China within the past two weeks and Australia said it was barring entry to non-citizens arriving from China.
Italy, Singapore and Mongolia have also taken similar sweeping precautions.

MANILA—Adamson University on Saturday apologized after it received backlash for ordering all its Chinese students to quarantine themselves amid the new coronavirus outbreak.
The school earlier released an advisory, requiring Chinese students, both graduate and undergraduate, to observe a 2-week self-quarantine ""to ensure a healthy and virus-free environment.""
It also urged Chinese nationals ""to postpone all transactions inside the university until Feb. 14, 2020.""

 
""We apologized for the misimpression it may have created,"" said the university, which has revised the advisory, expanding the scope of those who should be covered by the order.
""All students, staff and stakeholders who have traveled to and from countries with confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV, including China and/or Hong Kong, within the last month, or who may have in close contact or had direct exposure to a potential source of infection during their travel abroad,"" part of the memorandum read.
Chinese students and guests who are not limited by the above conditions, Adamson said, are allowed to come to school.

""Urgent appeal to Adamson University to review this advisory!"" she said.
Some online users also slammed the school, describing the memorandum as ""racist.""

HANOI - Vietnam has suspended all China flights as part of ""strengthening measures"" against the coronavirus outbreak, its civil aviation authority said in a statement on Saturday.
The directive applies to all airlines ""which have routes between Vietnam and China"" and is effective from Saturday, it added.
Vietnam Airlines, the country's national carrier, and budget airline Jetstar Pacific said they would stop flying to mainland China along with Hong Kong and Taiwan.
An AFP correspondent on a flight from Taiwan to Vietnam was among 98 passengers told to disembark just as the announcement went public.
""The decision is ridiculous and unacceptable,"" Vietnamese tourist Doan Thi Ngoc Diep told AFP after leaving the plane.
Vietnam is the latest country to impose extraordinary travel barriers after the virus spread to two dozen nations and killed 259 people in China where it originated in the city of Wuhan.
The United States temporarily barred entry to foreigners who had been in China within the past two weeks and Australia said it was barring entry to non-citizens arriving from China.
Italy, Singapore and Mongolia have also taken similar sweeping precautions.
The World Health Organization declared the coronavirus outbreak a global health emergency on Thursday but did not advise international trade of travel restrictions.
Vietnam's announcement came after the country confirmed its sixth case of the coronavirus.
A 25-year-old hotel receptionist working in Nha Trang contracted the SARS-like pathogen after coming into contact with Chinese tourists who were later diagnosed with coronavirus.
She was also the first domestic infection for a Vietnamese national with no known history of travel to China.
Three of the country's six cases were Vietnamese nationals who had traveled to Wuhan.
The receptionist's health is ""stable, no fever or cough"", a hospital staffer told AFP on condition of anonymity, adding she had ""no history of travel to China recently"".
Vietnam has joined Thailand, China, Germany, Japan, South Korea, France and the United States as the only countries with confirmed domestic coronavirus infections.

SHANGHAI - Apple Inc on Saturday said it would shut all of its official stores and corporate offices in mainland China until Feb 9. as fears over the coronavirus outbreak mounted and the death toll more than doubled to over 250 from a week ago.
""Out of an abundance of caution and based on the latest advice from leading health experts, we're closing all our corporate offices, stores, and contact centers in mainland China through February 9,"" Apple said in a statement. 
The company said it looked forward to re-opening stores ""as soon as possible.""
Earlier this week, Apple closed 3 stores in China due to concerns about the spread of the virus.
It is joining a handful of overseas retailers, including Starbucks Corp and McDonald's Corp, in temporarily shutting storefronts as a precautionary measure.

Many other companies, meanwhile, have called for employees in China to work from home and cease non-essential business travel in the first week of February.
Normally, businesses in China would be preparing to return to normal operations following the end of the week-long Lunar New Year Holiday.
Apple remains heavily reliant on China both for smartphone sales as well as for its supply chain and manufacturing. Many factories in Hubei province, including plants run by AB InBev and General Motors Co, have temporarily suspended production due to the virus.
In a recent earnings call, Apple CEO Tim Cook said the company was working out mitigation plans to deal with possible production loss from its suppliers in Wuhan. The city where the virus outbreak originated is home to several Apple suppliers.

""The arrangements are being put in place through our border authorities to ensure that that can be actioned,"" he added. ""Those that do return will be required to go into self isolation for 14 days.""
Australia's foreign ministry also updated its travel advice for China to ""do not travel.""

PHUKET, Thailand - The narrow laneways and pastel-colored shophouses of Phuket Old Town are usually bustling with Chinese tourists during the Lunar New Year holiday, but travel bans and local fears about coronavirus have largely emptied the streets this year.
Just a handful of tourists, many wearing face masks, strolled through the area during daylight hours this week. In the evening, foot traffic increased a little under the glow of the red lanterns strung across the thoroughfare, but remained far below normal levels.
""The impact is tremendous,"" 45-year old Ausana Akaradachakul told Reuters as she waited behind the counter for shoppers in her store selling postcards, straw bags, clothing and jewelry.
""Only a few days after the news broke about the virus, the Chinese tourists were visibly few,"" Akaradachakul said. ""I think about 70 percent of them are gone.""
The beach resort of Phuket is Thailand's second most visited destination after Bangkok and is usually a big draw for visitors from China, who accounted for 11 million visitors last year, particularly around the Lunar New Year holiday.
But China this week imposed restrictions on all overseas tour groups because of the coronavirus that originated in the city of Wuhan and which has infected more than 11,000 people and killed more than 250.

China virus death toll rises to 259, infections surge 

Reduced travel from China alone could result in 50 billion baht ($1.52 billion) of lost tourism revenue, the Thai Tourism Ministry estimated.
The spread of coronavirus beyond China has also affected domestic tourism in Thailand, which has recorded more infections than anywhere but China with 19 cases. Thailand announced its first case of human-to-human transmission on Friday.
Shopkeepers in Phuket said that had left Thai tourists wary of venturing out to join what should have been an annual festival on Walking Street at the heart of the town.
""There are barely any tourists around here. The people we are seeing now are just the locals,"" clothes store vendor Parichart Chaengmanee told Reuters as she sat on a stool outside her empty clothing stall, wearing a black face mask. ""Even the number of Thai tourists is low.""
Shopkeepers are hoping the impact is short-lived, with one sign in a store window reading: ""The Thai people pray for China and hope China will recover soon. China and Thailand are family!""

MANILA (UPDATE) - Communications Secretary Martin Andanar on Saturday called on the public to remain calm and avoid discriminating against anyone amid the rapid spread of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus.
""As the issue of a viral outbreak affects everyone, let us not engage in discriminatory behavior, nor act with any bias towards our fellowmen. The reality is everyone is susceptible to the virus,"" he said in a statement.
Andanar called on Filipinos to empathize with those at their most vulnerable, instead of stigmatizing them.
""We should not let fear turn us against one another, especially if these fears are unfounded,"" he said, adding that the Philippine government is working with foreign authorities to contain the outbreak.
The Philippines on Thursday confirmed its first case of the new coronavirus - a 38-year-old woman from Wuhan, China, epicenter of the respiratory contagion, who arrived in the Philippines on Jan. 21.
Philippine health authorities also continue to monitor 31 people suspected of carrying the strain, wherein 25 of them are admitted in hospitals around the country.

Amid stricter port controls in the Philippines and public vigilance against sickness, some members of the Filipino-Chinese community have expressed lament at how the health scare has fueled xenophobia towards the Chinese. 
“It’s very sad. Instead that we stand as one against this virus, it's becoming divisive,” anti-crime crusader and Chinese-Filipino figure Teresita Ang-See told ABS-CBN News on Friday.
She added: ""There should be no division between the Tsinoy from new immigrants and old immigrants.""

The Federation of Filipino Chinese Chambers of Commerce and Industry Inc (FFCCCII) president Henry Lim Bon Liong also urged the public to avoid expressing outright anti-Chinese sentiment.
""Spreading fake news and racist, xenophobic messages can be more dangerous than the virus itself due to their negative effects of causing confusion, fears, rancor and instability,"" he said in a statement released Friday.
China is the Philippines' traditional ally and long-standing trade partner, Liong said.
""Instead of racist attacks by some quarters, we should commend the China government’s transparency, for their remarkable political will and their immense sacrifices of imposing a lockdown on Wuhan City and its neighbors which involve millions of people,"" he added.
Andanar, meanwhile, appealed to the public not to hoard face masks, saying this ""creates unnecessary scarcity"" and that the limited supply should be reserved for health workers. 
""Let us not resort to panic, sow fear-mongering or spread misinformation. Solidarity, empathy, and cooperation are what we need to successfully take actions that will overcome this health concern,"" Andanar said.

WASHINGTON - While insisting the risk to Americans from coronavirus is low, the Trump administration declared a public health emergency on Friday and announced the extraordinary step of barring entry to the United States of foreign nationals who have recently visited China.

US declares virus 'emergency,' bans travelers from China

In addition, US citizens who have traveled within the past 2 weeks to China's Hubei Province - epicenter of the coronavirus epidemic - will be subject to a mandatory quarantine of 14 days, the incubation period of the virus, officials said.
Americans who visited other parts of mainland China will undergo special health screening upon their return, followed by up to 14 days of ""monitored self-quarantine"" under the temporary restrictions.
The emergency measures were unveiled by US Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar at a White House briefing, shortly before the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and local health authorities announced that a seventh US coronavirus case had been confirmed in Northern California.

WHO declares global emergency as 2019-nCoV spreads quickly 

The latest US patient was identified only as a man in Santa Clara County, south of San Francisco, who became ill after traveling to China and has ""self-isolated"" at home, Sara Cody, director of public health for the county, told reporters.
She said the CDC was seeking to determine whether the man was infectious while flying home.
The US entry ban on foreign travelers to China and the quarantine for Americans returning from Hubei go into effect on Sunday at 5 p.m. EST (6 a.m. Sunday in Manila), Azar said.
At the same time all commercial flights from China would be restricted to international US airports in 1 of 7 cities - New York, Chicago, Atlanta, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle and Honolulu.
KEEPING RISK LOW
CDC Director Robert Redfield told reporters the US government acted after the World Health Organization declared a global health emergency on Thursday over the spread of the respiratory disease.
""I want to emphasize that this is a serious health situation in China, but I want to emphasize that the risk to the American public is currently low,"" Redfield said. ""Our goal is to do all we can do to keep it that way.""
The US State Department warned Americans on Thursday not to travel to China because of the epidemic.
The ban on US entry of foreign nationals who have traveled to China during the past 14 days would exempt immediate family of US citizens and permanent US residents, Azar said. It was not immediately clear how long the ban would be in effect.

China's Hubei reports 45 new coronavirus deaths, total at 249 

The flu-like coronavirus, which is believed to have originated in a seafood and animal market in Wuhan, the provincial capital of Hubei, and was first identified earlier this month, has resulted in 259 deaths in China.
More than 11,700 people have been infected in China, and more than 130 cases reported in at least 25 other countries and regions, with Russia, Britain, Sweden and Italy all reporting their first cases on Thursday or Friday.
None of the US cases has been fatal, and all but one of the patients in the United States was believed to have contracted the disease while they were traveling in the Wuhan area of China.
FIRST US QUARANTINES
The first quarantines of US citizens potentially exposed to coronavirus in China began hours before the White House announcement.
Nearly 200 Americans evacuated earlier this week from Wuhan and voluntarily confined to a California military air base for 72 hours of health screenings were placed under a mandatory 14-day quarantine on Friday. It marked the CDC's first quarantine order in 50 years.
The State Department said Friday it was working with Chinese agencies to arrange additional flights of Americans out of Wuhan. Washington also plans to evacuate non-essential government employees and family members from the US Embassy in Beijing and consulates in Chengdu, Guangzhou, Shanghai and Shenyang due to the outbreak, a State Department official said on Thursday.
The 2-week quarantine of the 195 Americans at March Air Reserve Base, near Los Angeles, runs from the time the evacuees left China on Tuesday.
The original plan was to release the passengers after 72 hours of evaluation and tests, absent any indication of illness, and permit them to take public transportation home. Local health authorities would then continue monitoring the evacuees through the remainder of the incubation period.

US evacuees from China placed on 72-hour 'hold' at California military base for medical evaluation 

CDC officials said then that such a plan posed little or no risk of spreading the virus because individuals incubating the infection before symptoms appear are generally not contagious.
But Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, told reporters on Friday that experts' understanding of the virus was still evolving.
She cited emerging evidence the virus can be spread by someone who is infected but not yet showing signs of being ill, such as fever, cough and other respiratory symptoms.
The CDC also pointed to a limitation of its screening test for the virus - a negative result is merely a ""point-in-time"" snapshot that cannot conclusively rule out the risk of a person developing the disease during the 14-day incubation period.
The blanket quarantine at March air base was instituted after 1 passenger sought to leave the base without permission on Wednesday night, and was immediately slapped with an individual quarantine order by local health officials.
As of Thursday, none of the group at the base had exhibited signs of the disease, local health officials said.

The National Health Commission said in its daily update that 46 more people had succumbed to the respiratory disease.
All but one of the new deaths came in hardest-hit Hubei province, the epicenter of an outbreak that has spread around the world. 
The virus emerged in December in Hubei's provincial capital Wuhan, and has been traced to a meat market that sold wild game.
The number of infections in China also rose by 2,102, bringing the nationwide total to 11,791.
That's despite unprecedented quarantine measures imposed last week on millions of people in Hubei and aggressive preventive steps elsewhere in the country.
The number of new deaths and newly confirmed cases have both spiraled higher on a daily basis since China sounded the nationwide alarm a week ago.
The epidemic has spread far and wide as huge numbers of Chinese traveled within and outside the country for the Lunar New Year holiday that started last week.
It has since ballooned into a global health emergency with cases in more than 2 dozen countries.
The top Communist Party official in Wuhan expressed ""remorse"" on Friday, saying local authorities acted too slowly in containing the virus.

MANILA — With most of the new coronavirus cases coming from China, attention has again focused on the influx of Chinese tourists and workers in the Philippines.
Even in other countries where the 2019 novel coronavirus acute respiratory disease (2019-nCoV ARD) has spread, media has reported a rising anti-Chinese sentiment and even racism. For instance, there have been reports of children of Chinese descent being bullied by schoolmates in the United States and Europe.

READ: Anti-Chinese sentiment brews as world contains new coronavirus

In the Philippines, this has prompted younger members of the Chinese-Filipino community to post about how they are different from the new Chinese arrivals.
One circulating message mentions not only the fact that they were born and raised in the Philippines, but also how they do not eat exotic animals like bats and snakes -- two of the animals being investigated as the source of the new strain of coronavirus, which has killed at least 200 people.
Anti-crime crusader and Chinese-Filipino figure Teresita Ang-See told ABS-CBN News on Friday that she is saddened by how some younger members of their community and Filipinos in general have resorted to distancing themselves from the Chinese on the basis of race.
“It’s very sad. I feel so sad na imbes na sa panahong ito (that instead at this time) we stand as one against this fight, this virus, nagiging divise tuloy (it's becoming divisive),” she said.
“Hindi naman dapat na magkaroon ng division ang Tsinoy sa new immigrants and old immigrants.”
(There should be no division between the Tsinoy from new immigrants and old immigrants.)
The Philippines has seen an influx of Chinese arrivals, with improving ties between Manila and Beijing giving way to more Chinese investments in the country, particularly in offshore gaming, and greater inbound tourism.
Ang-See said Filipinos should respond in a way that is befitting a Christian country.
“Why is this happening? It’s narrow-minded thinking at a time of crisis,” she said in Filipino.
Ang-See was at the Manila City Hall on Friday with her group Kaisa Para sa Kaunlaran and another group the Filipino Chinese Amity Club to turn over 4,000 face masks to Manila Mayor Isko Moreno. On Friday morning, they also handed over 2,000 face masks to the Intramuros Administration.

Ang-See said they decided to donate the face masks to help prevent the spread of the new strain of coronavirus and to support public servants, especially traffic enforcers who also need face masks to protect themselves against pollution.
But she said people should practice proper hygiene as face masks are not enough to protect them.
Ang-See said there are also other Chinese-Filipinos giving out face masks in the Ongpin area in Manila.
This coincides with social media posts of Chinese nationals who were seen distributing free face masks in Makati.
BORDERLESS
Ang-See said people should remember that the virus “knows no boundaries.”
“During these times, we can’t have a you-against-me attitude,” she explained. “We are lucky because the virus did not originate from our country.”
The fast-spreading 2019-nCoV originated from Wuhan, capital of the eastern Chinese province of Hubei, and has killed more than 200 people and infected at least 10,000 as of Friday.
The disease, which manifests as fever, cough and difficulty breathing, has reached beyond Chinese borders, with confirmed cases in other parts of Asia, North America and Europe.
On Thursday, the Philippines confirmed its first case- a Chinese woman from Wuhan who arrived in the country on Jan. 21. She is now asymptomatic yet still confined at an undisclosed Metro Manila hospital.

Philippines confirms first case of new coronavirus

Malacañang on Friday announced a ban on travelers coming from Hubei province, while other countries have completely shut out those coming from all of mainland China.
A RECURRING PROBLEM
Ang-See said there were also instances of racism when the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) spread globally almost a decade ago.
“We haven’t learned from our experiences that viruses have nothing to do with race,” she said.
Newspaper columnist Wilson Lee Flores said: “The recent coronavirus problem seems to have brought out some unspoken misunderstandings, age-old negative stereotypes or some latent anti-Chinese racism in our society and even in other parts of the world.”
The 7th generation ethnic Chinese, who has lived in the Philippines his whole life, called it “unfortunate” and said it goes against the country’s democracy “which protects the equal rights and dignity of all people regardless of ethnic, religious or socio-economic background.”
He said the old stereotypes against the Chinese could be attributed to the Spanish colonial era.
He said that while Filipinos were also victims of discrimination by Spaniards, the colonizers “committed double or triple discriminations against the Muslim or Moro and Chinese minorities based on race, different religion and also fears of Chinese entrepreneurial success.”
VIRUS OF RACISM
“Racism doesn't only victimize certain minorities or communities in our society, it morally diminishes all of us, it threatens social peace, national unity and national progress,” the columnist said.
He said the only positive thing that can be said now is that racism “can be recognized as a real social problem that needs to be condemned as evil (and) that the phenomenon of social media has magnified and amplified this virus of racism which we should fight to stop.”
Health Undersecretary Eric Domingo also said the issue of racism should be addressed, adding that he has heard of how some Chinese-Filipinos now make sure to speak in Filipino in public so people won’t avoid them.
“What we are avoiding is an illness. It’s a virus. It can affect anybody,” he said.
“At this time, unfortunately, cases are coming mostly from China. But since last week there are no more flights from Wuhan and now we have a total ban,” Domingo pointed out.
“I hope we can all just work together. Bullying and being judgmental won’t help us,” he said.

PANGLAO, Bohol—Alona Beach here used to be packed with tourists, but amid fears of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) this popular travel destination is nearly deserted.
Visitors of this white-sand public beach that boasts crystal-clear waters know that, even on weekdays, Alona is usually filled with holidaymakers both local and international. Today is different, though, because the threat of being sick looms.
""We are very affected because there are no group tours anymore,"" said James Cumba, who offers island-hopping services.
He said his business has suffered because of travel cancellations, including from China, where the new coronavirus originated.
Eriko, a Japanese citizen who has been working as a local dive instructor for more than 15 years, said this is her first time to experience such a drop in the number of dive students.
""This is worse than the SARS outbreak,"" she said.
The local government (LGU) of Bohol acknowledged that the tourism industry is struggling.
Bohol, which is putting public-health measures in place, is now thinking of temporarily banning arrivals of Chinese tourists in the province until the 2019-nCoV outbreak ends.
""There is a big implication with the ban, but we are studying it. One thing is for sure, we are not a main gateway,"" said Bohol acting governor Rene Relampagos.
The death toll in China from the new coronavirus reached more than 200 on Friday, with overall cases worldwide rising rapidly in an outbreak that the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a global health emergency.
The death toll in Hubei province -- the virus' epicenter -- has risen to 204 and there were nearly 9,700 cases of infection nationally as of Thursday, Chinese health authorities said. About 100 cases have been reported in at least 18 other countries, with no deaths outside China.

BEIJING - China sent two planes to Malaysia and Thailand on Friday to bring ""stranded"" Hubei province residents back to the virus-stricken city of Wuhan, authorities said.
The Xiamen Airlines flights will pick up the Chinese nationals from Kota Kinabalu in Malaysia and the Thai capital Bangkok, according to the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC).
There are 117 nationals from Hubei province in Bangkok and 100 in Kota Kinabalu who are ""willing to take the chartered flights back to Wuhan as soon as possible"", the CAAC said in a statement.
This is in spite of the fact that Wuhan, capital of Hubei province, is the epicenter of a new virus outbreak that is believed to have originated in a market that sold wild animals.
The city of 11 million has since experienced an unprecedented lockdown, preventing residents from leaving in a bid to stop the deadly virus from spreading further.
The charter flights are expected to arrive in Wuhan at 1200 and 1300 GMT on the same day.
""The charter flights adopt the principle of voluntary ticket purchase,"" the CAAC added.
China's foreign affairs ministry said earlier on Friday that the country would bring Wuhan residents back from overseas ""as soon as possible"" due to the ""the practical difficulties that Chinese citizens from Hubei, especially Wuhan, have faced overseas"".
This comes after a number of airlines announced they were halting or reducing flights to China as the country struggles to contain the spread of a deadly new virus.
On Monday, Malaysia banned visitors from Wuhan and its surrounding Hubei province as well.
The topic was trending online on Friday, with over 67 million views and 21,000 discussion posts on China's Twitter-like platform Weibo.
""These people probably don't want to go back (to Wuhan),"" said one.
Another questioned if residents should be brought back if they were not infected.
When asked about the suspension of international flights at a press conference on Thursday, Zhu Tao of the CAAC said authorities were coordinating arrangements to bring travelers home.
Hospitals have been overwhelmed in Wuhan. AFP reporters saw long queues, with some patients saying they lined up for two days to see a doctor.
As fears of the outbreak have spread overseas, prominent figures in Chinese communities in Italy have warned of episodes of ""latent racism"" against their compatriots by Italians fearful of catching the virus.
China has advised its citizens to postpone trips abroad and cancelled overseas group tours, while several countries including the United States, Germany, Britain and Japan have urged their citizens to avoid travel to China.

MANILA - The Presidential Security Group recommended Friday the “indefinite” suspension of museum tours in Malacañang as the country confirmed its first case of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Acute Respiratory Disease.
All PSG personnel on duty at the Malacañang Complex will also be required to wear face masks as a precautionary measure against the spread of the virus, their commander, Brig. Gen. Jose Niembra said.
“This is a preemptive measure to ensure that the seat of government is secured from this biological threat,” Niembra said.
The recommendation will be submitted to the Palace’s Internal House Affairs Office for approval.
Tours in the Presidential Museum and Library in Malacañang are free but subject to the approval of the PSG.
The PSG recommendation came a day after the Philippines confirmed its first case of the virus—a 38-year-old Chinese woman from Wuhan, where the pathogen is believed to have originated.

Singapore on Friday announced a sweeping ban on arrivals from mainland China as authorities toughened measures to prevent the spread of the fast-spreading 2019 Novel Coronavirus. 
The move was a dramatic expansion of earlier measures that affected only arrivals from central Hubei province and came after the World Health Organization declared the new coronavirus an international emergency.
The virus, which originated from Wuhan, capital of Hubei, has killed at least 200 people and infected some 10,000 mostly in China as of Friday, with several cases confirmed in other parts of Asia, Europe, and North America.

LONDON - A plane chartered by Britain to evacuate its citizens and other foreign nationals on Friday departed the Chinese city at the epicenter of a deadly virus outbreak with 110 people aboard.
The civilian aircraft left Wuhan in central China at around 9:45 am local time (9:45 a.m. in Manila) carrying 83 Britons and 27 foreign citizens, according to the Foreign Office.
A small number of medics were on the plane to provide support to passengers, it said.
The jet will land at Brize Norton Royal Air Force base in central England at around 1:00 pm local time, then head to Spain where the remaining EU nationals will disembark. 
The returning Britons will be isolated for 14 days at a medical facility in the northwest of England.

The Wuhan metropolis is at the heart of the SARS-like virus epidemic that has so far killed 213 people and led the World Health Organization (WHO) on Thursday to declare it an international public health emergency.
The city of 11 million has been subject to an unprecedented lockdown, preventing residents from leaving in a bid to stop the deadly virus from spreading further.
Thousands of foreigners were among millions of people confined in Wuhan, and numerous countries have begun airlifting their citizens out.
'VERY EMPTY'
London had hoped its flight would leave earlier but was forced to delay due to issues getting approval for the departure from Chinese officials. 
British officials had originally planned to repatriate around 200 people, and it was unclear why the eventual number was markedly lower.
Passenger Joe Armitt told Sky News television the plane was ""very empty"" because people were not given enough notice to get to the airport in time.
Armitt added he was only given 3 hours' notice the flight was leaving and that UK officials had warned the Chinese government potentially may not allow his wife to leave.
On arrival, the British evacuees will be taken by bus to Arrowe Park Hospital in northwest England for a 2-week quarantine period.
They will be housed in an accommodation block usually used by health service staff, with access to the internet.
Anyone with suspicious symptoms will be taken to the Royal Liverpool and Broadgreen Hospital, which has a high-level infectious diseases unit.

MANILA - Baguio City has canceled the opening parade of the Panagbenga Festival over the weekend, its mayor said Friday, a day after the Philippines confirmed its first case of the 2019 novel coronavirus acute respiratory disease.
The month-long Panagbenga Festival usually draws in thousands of tourists to the streets of Baguio as it celebrates the ""season of blooming.""
""After due deliberation, I am canceling the Panagbenga street parade tomorrow,"" Baguio City Mayor Benjamin Magalong said in a press conference.
The Cordillera Regional Athletic Association (CARAA) added that ""all events that will draw crowds and visitors in the next three weeks"" are also canceled, he said.

HONG KONG - Markets rose in Asia on Friday after the World Health Organization declared a global health emergency over the new coronavirus sweeping China.
After saying last week they needed more information, the WHO invoked the rarely used designation that experts hope will lead to better international coordination to combat a disease that has already killed 200 people, and sickened thousands more.
But the Geneva-based body stopped short of recommending trade and travel restrictions that could have had a bruising effect on China -- a key growth engine for the world economy.
""This is not a vote of no confidence in China,"" WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesushe said, praising Beijing for its swift action to tackle the outbreak.
China has locked down a swathe of its center, effectively quarantining millions of people in their cities and halting travel around the country.
""We must all act together now to limit further spread... We can only stop it together,"" said Tedros, who traveled to China this week and met with President Xi Jinping.
Foreign airlines -- including British Airways -- have begun cancelling or curtailing flights to and from China, and a number of governments are recommending citizens do not visit the country.
But Tedros said there was ""no reason"" for any of the international travel or trade restrictions announced in recent days.
Investors applauded the WHO's move, plunging back into markets that have lost altitude over recent days as the 2019-nCoV crisis has worsened.
""Sure the WHO raised the alert, but they didn't ring the apocalypse bell so it could be time for risk-takers to come out of hibernation,"" said Stephen Innes, chief market strategist at AxiCorp.
The WHO move ""eased some mushrooming fears by suggesting the number of outbreaks is relatively small"", he said.
Tokyo led the way on Asian equity markets, with the Nikkei 225 up 1.3 percent by the break, Hong Kong rose 0.3 percent, while Seoul and Sydney added 0.4 percent.

WUHAN - A gray-haired man wearing a face mask lay dead on the pavement at ground zero of China's virus epidemic, a plastic shopping bag in one hand.
On what would typically be a crowded street in Wuhan, an industrial city of 11 million under quarantine, there are only a few passersby and they dare not go near him.
AFP journalists saw the body on Thursday morning, not long before an emergency vehicle arrived carrying police and medical staff in full-body protective suits.
The man lay straight on his back in front of a closed furniture store. Medical staff in blue overalls gently shrouded his body with a blue blanket.
The ambulance left, and police stacked supermarket cardboard boxes to hide the scene.
AFP could not determine how the man, who appeared to be in his 60s, had died. AFP contacted police and local health officials afterwards but could not get details on his case.
But the reaction of the police and medical staff in hazmat suits, as well as some of the bystanders, highlighted the fear pervading the city.
A woman standing near the man, wearing pink pajamas and a Mao cap, said she believed he had died from the virus.
""It's terrible,"" she said. ""These days many people have died.""
Wuhan is the epicenter of the outbreak of the new coronavirus, which is believed to have jumped from wild animals at a city market into humans.
The virus, which emerged late last year, has claimed at least 213 lives and infected thousands in China, with at least 159 deaths in Wuhan alone.
With the virus spreading to other countries, the World Health Organization has declared the crisis a global health emergency.

TORMENT
Authorities have imposed an unprecedented lockdown of Wuhan, blocking off roads out of the city and banning flights, in a bid to stop the virus spreading.
Those who are trapped are enduring a tormenting wait for the lockdown to end, for a cure to be found, or even just for check-ups at overwhelmed hospitals. 
AFP reporters in Wuhan have seen long queues at hospitals, with some patients saying they had lined up for 2 days to see a doctor.
Many brought their own chairs for the wait.
With most traffic banned, people who venture outside have to walk or bike everywhere in the huge city.
The dead man on the street on Thursday lay one block from the Wuhan Number Six Hospital, one of the main medical centers for treating those with virus symptoms.
A team of forensic experts who examined him were immediately sprayed with disinfectant by colleagues after removing their hazardous material suits.
One man smoking near the scene was told sharply by police to put out his cigarette and don a face mask.
He quickly followed their orders.
In the 2 hours that AFP observed the scene, at least 15 ambulances passed by, attending other calls.
Finally, a white van with blacked-out windows arrived to take away the man.
The body was zipped into a yellow surgical bag, and carried into the van on a stretcher.
Staff immediately began to clean the ground as the van drove away, disinfecting the streets where the body had laid.

MANILA - Filipinos who may seek medical attention with symptoms of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) will get health coverage from the state health insurance agency, the country's top health official said on Friday.
Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth) convened on Thursday and decided to offer the new coronavirus package.
""The package is about a thousand per day for the hospital that takes care of a patient, even not confirmed, basta (as long as) suspected with novel coronavirus,"" said Duque on ANC's Headstart.
He said if the patient develops pneumonia, there is another PhilHealth package that may apply. 
""If pneumonia sets in then there's pneumonia package of mild, P16,000; severe P32,000,"" he said.
The Philippines on Thursday confirmed its first case of the 2019-nCoV, a 38-year-old Chinese woman from Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the outbreak. She is now in an undisclosed government hospital in Metro Manila and currently asymptomatic. 
Some 31 others are under investigation for the acute respiratory disease. 
At least 200 people have died, while close to 10,000 people have been infected in several parts of China and countries in Europe, Asia and North America. 
Its symptoms include fever, cough, shortness of breath, and breathing difficulties, according to the World Health Organization.

MANILA - There is no present evidence that pets, such as dogs and cats, can be infected with the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV), the World Health Organization said. 
""However, it is always a good idea to wash your hands with soap and water after contact with pets. This protects you against various common bacteria such as E.coli and Salmonella that can pass between pets and humans,"" the WHO said.
The WHO said the spread of the new coronavirus is a global emergency, saying 2019-nCoV can affect ""people of all ages.""

""Older people, and people with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease) appear to be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virus,"" it said.
Are antibiotics effective in preventing and treating the 2019-nCoV? Certainly not, according to the WHO.
""Antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria. The new coronavirus is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment,"" it said.
WHO, however, stressed, ""However, if you are hospitalized for the 2019-nCoV, you may receive antibiotics because bacterial co-infection is possible.""
To date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the virus, according to the WHO.
""However, those infected with the virus should receive appropriate care to relieve and treat symptoms, and those with severe illness should receive optimized supportive care. Some specific treatments are under investigation, and will be tested through clinical trials,"" it said.

BEIJING - China announced Thursday the suspension of all domestic football and postponed indefinitely the top-flight Chinese Super League (CSL) season in response to the deadly viral outbreak sweeping the country. 
The CSL 2020 campaign had been due to kick off on Feb. 22, but was shelved along with ""all types of football matches"" in order to ""carry out prevention and control of the pneumonia epidemic,"" said a Chinese Football Association statement.
The announcement comes just a few hours after the World Indoor Athletics Championships, scheduled to take place in the Chinese city of Nanjing in March, were postponed until 2021 after advice from the World Health Organization.
Football is fanatically followed in the world's most populous nation with cash-rich clubs importing expensive foreign signings such as Brazilians Hulk and Oscar, and Argentina's Carlos Tevez in recent years.
It becomes the latest sport to be hit by the virus which by Thursday had seen more than 7,700 cases confirmed in China with at least 170 fatalities.

WUHAN - China reported its biggest single-day jump in novel coronavirus deaths on Thursday, as confirmation that 3 Japanese evacuated from the outbreak's epicenter were infected deepened fears about a global contagion.
The World Health Organization (WHO), which initially downplayed the severity of a disease that has now killed 170 nationwide, warned all governments to be ""on alert"" as it weighed whether to declare a global health emergency.
As foreign countries evacuated their citizens from Wuhan, the locked-down city where the virus was first detected, concern over the economic impact has steadily intensified.
Airlines have suspended services to China and companies from Starbucks to Tesla have shuttered stores and production lines.

China virus death toll rises to 170, more than 1,700 new cases

Chinese authorities have taken extraordinary steps to arrest the virus's spread, including effectively locking down more than 50 million people in Wuhan and surrounding Hubei province.
But that was yet to pay dividends, with the government reporting 38 new deaths in the 24 hours to Thursday, the highest 1-day total. All but one were in Hubei.
The number of confirmed new cases also grew steadily to 7,711, the National Health Commission said. Another 81,000 people were under observation for possible infection.
The pathogen is believed to have been spawned in a market that sold wild game, spreading far and wide by a Lunar New Year holiday season in which hundreds of millions of Chinese travel domestically or abroad.
'TOTALLY NEW SITUATION'
Japan's infection rate grew to 11 after 3 Japanese citizens among more than 200 on an evacuation flight Wednesday tested positive.
Officials had already confirmed 2 cases in which patients tested positive without having traveled to China, adding to anxiety over human-to-human transmission of the respiratory disease.
""We are in a truly new situation,"" Health Minister Katsunobu Kato told parliament.
The fact that 2 of the 3 new confirmed Japanese cases showed no symptoms underscored the scale of the challenge for health workers.

SAIPAN - The Northern Mariana Islands banned all travelers from China and declared a ""state of significant emergency"" Thursday, as Pacific island states stepped up measures to protect against the coronavirus outbreak. 
Although Chinese tourist traffic is a pillar of the economy in the US Pacific commonwealth, Northern Mariana governor Ralph Torres said the new coronavirus ""poses a significant and imminent threat.""
In China, where the epidemic originated, 170 have died with thousands more infected.
Although no suspected cases of the virus have been recorded in the Northern Marianas, Torres said the risk remained ""substantial"" due to incubation times.
""I find that the public health threat of a traveler from mainland China carrying the coronavirus is significant and cannot be understated,"" he said.
""The Commonwealth Ports Authority shall communicate with all airlines with travelers directly and indirectly from mainland China to suspend the arrival of travelers for the period of this emergency declaration.""

SEOUL - South Korean President Moon Jae-in urged residents not to give in to fear as the country prepared to evacuate the first of around 700 citizens from the epicenter of the new coronavirus epidemic in China on Thursday.
The first of up to 4 planned flights to Wuhan had been due to depart South Korea on Thursday morning, but were delayed for unspecified reasons, Yonhap news agency reported. The flights were still expected to depart by later in the day.
""The weapons that will protect us from the new coronavirus are not fear and aversion but trust and cooperation,"" Moon said in a speech on Thursday, decrying ""fake news"" as creating excessive anxiety.
Protesters used tractors to block access to facilities earmarked as quarantine centers in the cities of Asan and Jincheon, about 80 km (50 miles) south of Seoul, on Wednesday.
The government has proposed to keep the evacuated citizens in isolation at the facilities, usually used as training centers for public servants, for at least 2 weeks to ensure they do not develop symptoms.
Moon tried to reassure residents, saying the initial evacuees would only be those with no symptoms, and they will be held in isolation.
""The government will be taking air-tight steps to ensure the residents of areas where the facilities are do not need to be concerned,"" he said.
South Korea has reported 4 cases of the newly identified virus, all of whom arrived after visiting the central Chinese city of Wuhan where the pathogen appeared in humans late last year.
The new strain of coronavirus has an incubation of between 1 and 14 days and can spread before symptoms show, complicating efforts to screen people at international borders.
It has created widespread alarm because it is spreading quickly and there are still important unknowns surrounding it, but it is still too early to know what its death rate will be, because there are likely to be many cases of milder infections going undetected.
South Korea said the inter-Korean liaison office in Kaesong, North Korea, would be closed until the outbreak eased. North Korea would not allow South Korean officials to enter the office when they arrived on Thursday, Yonhap reported, citing South Korea's unification ministry.

Mike Blake, Reuters


MARCH AIR RESERVE BASE, California - Nearly 200 Americans airlifted from China in the midst of the coronavirus outbreak arrived on Wednesday at a US military base in California, where they will remain isolated for at least 72 hours of medical evaluation, public health officials said.
The group, mostly US diplomats and their families, were evacuated from Wuhan at the epicenter of the outbreak aboard a US government-chartered cargo jet that stopped to refuel in Alaska on Tuesday night before flying on to March Air Reserve Base, about 60 miles (97 km) east of Los Angeles.
Foreign governments have begun flying their citizens out of Wuhan as the death toll has risen and the city has entered into a virtual quarantine, with Chinese authorities trying to contain the virus.

China virus death toll rises to 170, more than 1,700 new cases

The 195 passengers at March air base were medically screened by Chinese government and US State Department officials before boarding the plane in Wuhan, and again during the refueling stop by a team from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC officials said.
All the passengers have agreed to remain voluntarily in special housing at the military base, cordoned off from base personnel, for 72 hours.
""These people are not under federal quarantine orders,"" said Dr. Christopher Braden, deputy director of the CDC's National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases.
""I personally talked to them when they were disembarking and going through their first screening checks. They were happy to be here. They were very cooperative with the questions,"" Braden told a news conference at the Riverside University Health System Medical Center, near the base. ""They want to protect themselves. They want to protect others.""
NO ONE SHOWED SYMPTOMS
The US evacuees, who underwent another round of screening on arrival in California, will be given further medical evaluations, including a blood test for exposure to the virus, over the next 3 days, the officials said.
None of the arriving passengers has so far exhibited any signs of illness such as fever, cough or other respiratory symptoms, the officials said.
The screening in Alaska included a questionnaire to check for factors that would deem them to have been at high risk of infection, including exposure to someone diagnosed with coronavirus or close contact to someone living with a person who was sick.
""There were no individuals who responded to the questions indicating they were high-risk,"" said Dr. Nancy Knight, director of the CDC's Division of Global Health Protection. ""We are reassessing that now.""
One individual on the original evacuation manifest was barred from boarding the plane in China because the person had a fever.

New coronavirus study places incubation period at around 5 days

The State Department ordered its personnel evacuated from the US Consulate in Wuhan and welcomed other American citizens onto the flight because there was excess room on the plane, CDC officials said. The group included an unspecified number of children, ranging from a month-old infant to teenagers, they said.
The plan is to allow the evacuees to return to their homes once the initial evaluation period is over, provided there is no indication of exposure or illness, the officials said.
At that point, absent any symptoms or a positive test result, an individual would be considered non-infectious and be permitted to travel on public transportation without putting others at risk, Braden said.
FREE TO LEAVE?
People who may be incubating the infection before any symptoms appear are not believed to be contagious, Braden said.
Health authorities will continue ""active monitoring"" of all the passengers through the end of a 14-day incubation period, and plans are in place to isolate any individual who shows signs of illness after going home.
If any evacuees test positive or fall ill in the next 3 days, they would be transferred to the Riverside Medical Center for isolation and treatment, and authorities would decide what measures need to be taken for the rest of the group, Braden said.

The global spread of the coronavirus: Where is it?

Asked if someone in the group who tested negative before the 72-hour hold was over would be free to leave the base early, Knight said that would lead to a conversation that ""would be discussed up to the highest levels within the US government.""
""If we think a person is a danger to the community, we can institute an individual quarantine for that person, and we will,"" Braden added. ""If we think it's risky, then we have the tools to protect the public and we will use them.""
So far, 5 cases of coronavirus have been diagnosed in the United States, none of them fatal, Braden said. A further 165, other than the plane passengers, are under evaluation.
""There's no indication we have any transmission from those cases, and therefore the risk for people in the United States, we believe, is low,"" Braden said.

,Jan 30 2020,nCov,Public urged to trust gov’t info as fake news spreads faster than Wuhan virus,"Christian V. Esguerra, ABS-CBN News","
MANILA—At a time when misinformation can spread faster than diseases, Philippine health officials have adopted a stronger social media campaign to combat fake news about the deadly Wuhan coronavirus.
A new Department of Health website is dedicated solely to updates on the disease, formally known as the 2019 Novel Coronavirus, which has killed more than 130 people in China and sickened nearly 6,000 others as of Wednesday.
As officials work to prevent the disease from entering the Philippines, managing what Health Secretary Francisco Duque III described as an “epidemic of misinformation” also poses a challenge.
Groups of fact-checkers from 30 countries have also been working to correct false information being spread on social media.
In the Philippines, Duque cited questionable videos circulating online showing coronavirus patients supposedly dropping dead while awaiting treatment at a Chinese hospital.
The public should be “discriminating and at least verify” the source of such videos, he said.
TRUST GOV’T
The health department’s website “urges the public to source information only from official DOH channels and social media accounts.”
Among the common victims of fake information during a public health crisis situation are hospitals, said Dr. Lulu Bravo, a former official of the Manila-based National Insitutes of Health at the University of the Philippines.
Word can easily spread around that a patient of the Wuhan coronavirus is admitted and prompt others to seek discharge even if they’re still unwell, she said.
While existing health protocols have so far successfully kept the disease out, she said “fake news spreads quickly here in the Philippines” so the public should turn only to official information from the DOH.

False virus news can drag 'better prepared' Philippines: ex-SARS fighter

“Let’s trust the government,” she told ABS-CBN, recalling systems put in place during previous outbreaks such as that of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).
“Beterano na ang DOH dyan.”
SURGICAL MASKS
A World Health Organization official on Tuesday took the opportunity during a press briefing in Manila to reassure those worried about catching the disease.
Dr. Rabindra Abeyasinghe, the WHO respresentative in the Philippines, pointed to several journalists wearing surgical masks.
People should do so only if they have “signs and symptoms of a respiratory infection” or if going to places where there is a “concentration of people that can trigger infections,” he said.
“Normal people going about their normal work don’t need to wear surgical masks or N95 masks,” he told reporters.
“You don’t need to wear a mask from morning till evening.”
INFORMATION SYSTEM
Like the DOH, the WHO has also been dealing with false information being spread around, which makes it more difficult for authorities to contain the new coronavirus.
Abeyasinghe urged the public to get information from the WHO website.
“People are free to access social media and sometimes access incorrect information,” he told ABS-CBN News. “That’s what we’re trying to manage.”
One way to combat the spread misinformation is building “resilient health systems that are well-resourced and prepared to stop outbreaks before they begin,” according to a study by the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies.
“Rather than engaging in censorship to counter actors or ideas individually,” it said, “policymakers and industry should focus on building a resilient information system that is ready to mitigate the effectiveness of misinformation without restricting the free marketplace of ideas.”

MANILA - The Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines issued Wednesday an ""Oratio Imperata"" or a special prayer imploring protection from the novel coronavirus outbreak.
In a statement, the CBCP enjoined all parishes in the country of at least 80 million Roman Catholics to recite the prayer beginning Sunday, Feb. 2, the Feast of the Presentation of the Lord.
The ""oratio"" is expected to be offered in Masses during weekdays and Sundays, after the Holy Communion. 
""In praying, we invite ourselves with all our brothers and sisters suffering with the disease brought by the virus, bring up to God our longing for them to be restored to full health and humbly pray that we may be spared form infection of this virus,"" said Rev. Fr. Marvin Mejia, the CBCP's secretary general. 
The CBCP is also recommending the following:
1. Communion in the hand be practiced ordinarily to help prevent further fear from people who are reasonably cautious about this matter;
2. Regularly check and change the Holy Water in the Holy Water fonts in churches;
3. Provide/install protective cloth on the grills of confessionals; and,
4. Discourage hand-holding during the singing or praying of the ""Our Father"" and the shaking of hand during the Sign of Peace. 
""Let it also be our pastoral duty to remind our faithful to heed the health recommendation of medical experts and officials so that we prevent the acquisition and spread of the disease,"" Mejia added. 
The CBCP is advising parishes, churches, and chapels dedicated to St. Raphael the Archangel and St. Roch (Roche or Roque) to make special prayers and penitential processions. The two are considered patrons in times of pestilence and spread of incurable illnesses.
Below is the full text of the prayer:
ORATIO IMPERATA
God our Father
we come to You in our need
to ask Your protection against the 2019 N-coronavirus
that has claimed lives
and has affected many.
We pray for Your grace
for the people tasked with studying the nature and cause
of this virus and its disease
and of stemming the tide of its transmission.
Guide the hands and minds of medical experts
that they may minister to the sick
with competence and compassion
and of those governments and private agencies
that must find cure and solution to this epidemic.
We pray for those afflicted.
May they be restored to health soon. 
Grant us the grace
to work for the good of all
and to help those in need. 
Grant this through our Lord Jesus Christ, Your Son
who lives and reigns with You, in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God forever and ever. Amen. 
The new strain of the coronavirus, which originated in Wuhan, China, has already killed more than 100 people, and infected nearly 6,000 others.

Measles is more contagious than 2019-nCoV, says DOH
MANILA (UPDATE) - The Philippines on Wednesday is monitoring 23 suspected cases of the 2019 novel coronavirus as 4 others have already tested negative, health officials said.
Four patients were discharged from the hospital after being cleared of the new respiratory virus that is plaguing China, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said in a press briefing.
The Philippines remains free from the 2019-nCoV that has already claimed at least 132 lives in China and infected nearly 6,000 others.
""Confirmed cases, zero,"" Duque said.

China confirms 5,974 virus cases, exceeding nation's SARS total

Health authorities are keeping a watchful eye on 17 cases in the National Capital Region (NCR), 1 in Western Visayas, 1 in Mimaropa, 1 in Eastern Visayas, 2 in Central Visayas and 1 in Davao Region.
Most are foreigners who had traveled to the Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicenter of the respiratory contagion that started from a market selling illegal wildlife.
As infections have been confirmed in other countries, such as the United States, France and many Asian countries, Duque called on the public to remain calm, but vigilant.
To limit the possible transmission of the flu-like virus, he said the public should practice hand hygiene, observe cough etiquette, avoid contact with farm and wild animals, and cook food properly, among others.
""It's better to be proactive and prepared,"" he said.
Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), according to the World Health Organization. 
CONTACT RATE
Dr. Chito Avelino, DOH's epidemiology bureau director, said the infection rate for 2019-nCoV ranged from 2 to 4.
""That means that for 1 individual infected, there's a possibility for him to transmit [the virus] to 2 to 3 or 4 uninfected individuals, at close range. The basic principle is close contact,"" he said.
Compared with other diseases, the new strain of coronavirus is not as contagious, Avelino said.
""Mas nakakahawa ang tigdas (Measles is more infectious),"" he said.
According to Duque, the infectiousness rate of measles is 1 person to 18.
TEST KITS
At the press briefing, Health Undersecretary Eric Domingo said confirmatory test kits or ""primers"" ordered by the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) have arrived in the country Wednesday.
""They are now setting up the laboratory for this. Once the laboratory is set up within 48 hours, they will be able to start running the test for the 2019 novel coronavirus here in the Philippines,"" he said.
The RITM sends specimen samples to the Victorian Infectious Disease Reference in Australia to confirm if the patient is infected with 2019-nCoV. The process usually takes 24 hours.
""The subsequent tests will now be done by RITM,"" Domingo said.
The RITM has 6 pending confirmatory tests in Australia, the results of which are expected Thursday or Friday.

HONG KONG - Migrant support group Mission for Migrant Workers (MFMW) on Tuesday called on the Hong Kong government to provide clear labor guidelines and health precautionary measures for the city's estimated 300,000 foreign domestic workers, after a Filipino domestic helper was quarantined for coming into close contact with 2 people who later tested positive for the novel coronavirus.
Cynthia Abdon, the group's manager, expressed concern on the plight of foreign household helpers who, as mandated by a law in effect since 2003, live with their employers.

""Iyan ba ay ire-recognize ng employer na official sa Labor Department? Nililinaw ba nila... halimbawa connected sa official hospital or health department policy...na i-quarantine ang mga nasa ganitong kalagayan? Ang kanila bang mga trabaho o ang mga sahod nila sa mga araw na sila ay naka-quarantine ay official pa rin ba na dapat nilang matanggap? Dapat. Kasi hindi naman sila ang may cause ng pangyayaring 'yon,"" Abdon told ABS-CBN News.
(Will this case be officially recognized by her employer to be in line with the Labor Department? They want to clarify, for example, with those connected with the official hospital or health department policy, whether those in that kind of condition need to be quarantined? Will they continue to receive salary for the days they are on quarantine? Well, they should, because they didn't cause the situation they are in.)
Abdon said they also received reports domestic workers who spend time outside are told to hurry home, including on their rest days, amid fears of the 2019-nCoV spread. 
""Kaya 'pag nasa loob ka ng bahay (ng employer mo), alangan naman... sabi nila doon ka lang sa loob ng kuwarto mo kung may kuwarto ka man. Paano na 'yong sa mga wala rin kuwarto. Hindi puwede. Mahihiya ka rin kahit paano na hindi ka mag trabaho... kahit day-off mo, kahit holiday,"" said Abdon.
(When you are at your employer's home, they could tell you to just stay inside your room. That is if you have your own room. But what about those without their own room? ... Somehow, you feel ashamed if you do not do some chores, even if it's your rest day, or it's a holiday.)
Abdon urged consulates of migrants-sending countries to coordinate with the host government in disseminating proper and similar information, ""in a language friendly to migrants,"" saying that migrant domestic workers ""are part of the Hong Kong community.""
""Meaning, of course 'yong language ng migrant domestic workers in Bahasa Indonesia, Tagalog, Sri Lankan, ano man 'yan. At the very least, dapat may English. Kasi ngayon, halimbawa, meron kaming Chinese staff. So, nakukuha namin 'yong mga information sa mga Chinese newspapers o Chinese information na pinapakalat nila sa kaniya lang. Pa'no po 'yong mga walang access?"" said Abdon.
(Meaning, of course, such languages of migrant domestic workers as Bahasa Indonesia, Tagalog, Sri Lankan, or whatever it is. At the very least, there should be English. Because right now, we have a Chinese staff. So, we get information from Chinese newspapers or information in Chinese that they are sharing. But how about the rest who do not have access?)
The MFMW complained about confusing instructions on the proper wearing and use of face masks, say, if one is in a closed building.
""Dapat ka bang mag-mask? Hindi ka ba dapat mag-mask? Gaano mo kalimit papalitan ang mask? Pati yan issue 'yan, 'di ba? So ang mahalaga lang, 'wag ma-curtail 'yong right ng ating migrant domestic workers na sa panahon na ganito, pati ang employers ay nagpa-panic na rin, sapagkat hindi malinaw ang mga opisyal na directives ng government,"" said Abdon.
(Should you wear a mask? Should you not wear a mask? How often should you change masks? It's important that our domestic workers' rights will not be curtailed in times like this, because even employers are already panicking because official directives from the government are not clear.)

Pinay in HK quarantined after exposure to new coronavirus: consulate

The Filipino domestic worker in quarantine had been exposed to an elderly couple who tested positive for the novel coronavirus after arriving in Hong Kong from Wuhan by high-speed rail on Jan. 22. They developed fever and were admitted to Prince of Wales Hospital in Shatin on January 23.
The couple had been staying with their daughter and the domestic helper at Lake Silver Estate in Ma On Shan.
The helper showed no symptoms, but has to be quarantined for 14 days from Jan. 23. Health officials stressed she was not a patient, but a confinee.

At a press conference by the Department of Health and Hospital Authority on Monday, Dr. Chuang Shuk-kwan, head of the communicable disease branch of the Center for Health Protection of the Department of Health, confirmed that the Filipino remained asymptomatic, adding she had been quarantined ""just like other local residents"" who are quarantined in the camp.
""All asymptomatic confinees will not be tested because, even if you test, it is negative; it won't be positive usually. So... they are checking the symptoms, they are checking their temperatures and symptoms daily. We have a 24-hour medical post in the camp... Whenever they have symptoms, they will be checked. And then, they will be sent to the hospital for testing and isolation. So, if they are asymptomatic, there is no point to test them,"" Dr. Chuang told ABS-CBN News.
Most offices and businesses in Hong Kong remain closed in observance of the Lunar New Year holidays. In November last year, announcements were made to scrap the annual Lunar New Year parade and the New Year's Eve fireworks display over fears of protest.
A 4-day carnival for the Chinese New Year celebrations was supposed to take place instead, but had been dropped as well in light of the spread of the 2019-nCoV.
As of noontime Tuesday, most government facilities are closed, while others are on special working arrangements. The closures are stretching up to the first week of February, and even the week after for some.
As of Jan. 27, the Center for Health Protection of Hong Kong's Department of Health is monitoring eight imported cases.
The Hospital Authority said 110 patients are under isolation, of whom, 104 are in stable condition.
The public is continuously reminded to strictly maintain personal, food and environmental hygiene.

BEIJING - The World Health Organization's (WHO) director-general said on Tuesday he is confident in China's ability to control and contain the spread of a new coronavirus, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said.
At a meeting with authorities in Beijing, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said he approved of the Chinese government's measures to curb the outbreak so far, according to a statement posted on the foreign affairs ministry's website.
The death toll from the virus has climbed to 106 in China and cases are being reported in a growing number of other countries.

The global spread of the coronavirus: Where is it?

The WHO called the epidemic ""an emergency in China"" on Jan. 23, but stopped short of declaring it a global public health emergency.
Tedros said he does not advocate the evacuation of foreign nationals currently in China, and urged people to stay calm.
Several countries including the United States, France, Japan, South Korea and Morocco have said they will evacuate some citizens from Wuhan, a city of 11 million in central China and the epicenter of the outbreak.
Wuhan, where the virus emerged late last year, apparently in a market illegally selling wildlife, has been put on a virtual lockdown with bans on almost all transport and public gatherings.
Tens of millions of others in Hubei province, where Wuhan is located, live under some form of travel curbs in a bid to contain the spread of the virus.

The coronavirus can cause pneumonia, but it is too early to know just how dangerous it is and how easily it spreads.
Some health experts have questioned whether China can contain it.
Chinese health officials say the incubation period could range from 1 to 14 days, and the virus is infectious during that time. The WHO estimated an incubation period of 2 to 10 days.

MANILA - The Philippine government is studying the possible repatriation of Filipinos from the Chinese city of Wuhan, the global epicenter of a new coronavirus outbreak, as migrant workers there expressed desire to come home.
Malacañang will wait for the recommendation of the Department of Health (DOH) and Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) on the return of some 150 Filipinos from Wuhan, Presidential spokesman Salvador Panelo said, noting that the government has to be “cautious” to ensure that the Philippines remains free of the virus.
“We must consider the health issue on the spread [of the virus]. Ano ba mas makakabuti? That they’ll stay there for a while until the crisis is over or we’ll get them and bring them here and open the possibility of spreading it here?” he told reporters.
Filipinos working in Wuhan, where the virus outbreak started in December, have expressed worries over their condition as the Chinese city sought to control the spread of the virus.

Panelo added that the government would also review the possible repatriation of Filipinos in other countries where there are confirmed cases of coronavirus.

International SOS, a medical and travel security services firm that advises companies on travel, said its guidance for now was that business travel to China outside Hubei province could continue.
But this could be updated if there were major flight cancellations throughout China and more disruptions to ground transport, including rail, International SOS Regional Security Director James Robertson said.
""Many of our clients have chosen to defer or cancel upcoming travel based on their own individual assessments,"" Robertson said. ""If people do choose to travel they need flexible itineraries accounting for extra time for temperature and health screenings.""

WUHAN - The United States and other nations raced to get their citizens out of the locked-down Chinese city at ground-zero of a virus epidemic on Tuesday, as the death toll surged to 106 and the number of confirmed infections doubled to over 4,500.
The deadly virus, which experts believe emanated from a wild animal market in the city of Wuhan last month, has triggered a desperate Chinese containment effort after spreading nationwide and to more than a dozen other countries. 
The government has sealed off Wuhan and other cities in central Hubei province, effectively trapping more than 50 million people, including thousands of foreigners, in a bid to contain the virus as the high-travel Lunar New Year holiday unfolds.
As those trapped in Wuhan have become increasingly anxious, governments have scrambled to devise ways to safely get their citizens out of the city of 11 million.

The global spread of the coronavirus: Where is it? 

The United States, France and Japan are among those to have announced plans for airlifts, but nearly a week after the lockdown the evacuations have yet to happen.
A chartered US-bound flight had been scheduled to leave Wuhan on Tuesday with consular staff and some American citizens.
But the State Department said that had been postponed to Wednesday, without giving a reason.
France has also said it intends to fly its citizens out of the city in the middle of this week, and Japan has similar plans.

Several other countries also were working to repatriate their people, while Germany said it was considering doing so.
The virus can be transmitted between people, although scientists have yet to determine how contagious it is and exactly the way it is spread.
In bids to stop huge numbers of people coming into close contact with each other, China has imposed tight transport restrictions in other parts of the country.
It has extended the Lunar New Year national holiday into next week.
The education ministry on Tuesday also said the spring semester for schools and universities nationwide would be postponed, without giving a resumption date.
DEATH TOLL CLIMBS
Despite the unprecedented measures, the virus has showed little sign of slowing down.
The national health commission on Tuesday said 26 new deaths occurred in the preceding 24 hours, bringing the nationwide total to 106. 
Confirmed infections in China also jumped to 4,515, it said, up from 2,744 on Monday.
There were nearly 7,000 more cases suspected and awaiting confirmation, according to the commission.
The virus has also continued to spread around the world.

On Monday, the first infections were confirmed in Germany, Canada and Sri Lanka.
Fears over containment were heightened on Sunday when Wuhan's mayor, wearing a medical mask, revealed at a press conference that 5 million people had left the city for other parts of the country during the massive travel rush that precedes the New Year holiday.
President Donald Trump said the United States has offered Beijing ""any help that is necessary"" in combating the virus.
But the United States, Turkey, and Germany were among nations urging their citizens to ""reconsider"" all travel to China.
Malaysia on Monday banned visitors arriving from Hubei.
Landlocked Mongolia -- which is heavily dependent on trade with China -- took the drastic step of closing the border with its huge neighbor to cars.
Mongolia also cancelled classes until March 2 and suspended large public gatherings.
DESPERATE EFFORTS
Medical facilities have been overwhelmed in Wuhan, which has become a near ghost-town.
China has deployed hundreds of military medics to ease the pressure, and started building2 hospitals with the aim of finishing them in just 10 days.
AFP reporters saw hundreds of mask-wearing workers toiling around the clock to assemble one of the pre-fab field hospitals.

Construction began just days ago but the outline of a floor was already taking shape and electrical switchboards were up on Monday.
""We have to work fast to combat the epidemic,"" a worker in his 30s, who refused to give his name, told AFP.
Stressed Wuhan residents living under the quarantine expressed fears for the health and dwindling supplies at home.
""I'm getting more concerned every day,"" Do Quang Duy, a 32-year-old Vietnamese masters student in Wuhan, told AFP.
FIGHTING SPIRIT
But Wuhan's people, who have a reputation in China for resilience, sought to project a fighting spirit.
Quarantined residents shouted ""Go Wuhan"" from their windows, according to videos posted online. 
A building lit up the night sky late on Monday with those words in red.

WHO says still probing if Chinese virus can spread before symptoms

The World Health Organization last week stopped short of declaring the outbreak a global emergency, which could have prompted a more aggressive international response such as travel restrictions.
But the WHO on Monday admitted making an error in originally assessing the virus' worldwide threat as ""moderate,"" issuing an update late on Sunday to say the risk was actually ""high at the global level.""
WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus traveled to Beijing this week for discussions with Chinese officials to coordinate on the crisis.

BEIJING - China on Tuesday postponed the start of the spring semester for schools and universities across the country over concerns about a novel virus outbreak.
The decision came as the death toll from the new coronavirus soared to 106 and the total number of cases surpassed 4,000 nationwide.
Students are currently on holiday for the Lunar New Year and the education ministry did not provide a date for teaching to resume.

But a statement from the ministry said teaching institutions would reopen on a case-by-case basis.
School administrators had been instructed to ""require students not to go out, not to gather and not to hold or participate in centralized activities"", the statement added. 
Authorities on Monday decided to extend China's Lunar New Year holiday, originally due to end on Jan. 30, for 3 days to limit population flows and control the epidemic.

MANILA (UPDATE) - The Philippines stopped issuing visas on arrival to Chinese nationals on Tuesday, in a bid to keep the southeast Asian nation free of a new virus that has killed 106 and infected more than 4,500 since emerging in China in December.
There have been no confirmed cases in the Philippines since the coronavirus outbreak began in China's central city of Wuhan, but infections have been confirmed in Japan, Nepal, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, the United States and Vietnam.
""We are taking this proactive measure to slow down travel, and possibly help prevent the entry of the 2019-nCoV,"" Jaime Morente, the commissioner of the Philippines' Bureau of Immigration, said in a statement, referring to the virus.
There is no order barring Chinese nationals from entering the Philippines, however, Morente said.
He did not say when the facility would be resumed. Chinese nationals can still apply for visas at any Philippine embassy or consulate at their places of residence.
Health authorities are monitoring more than 11 suspected cases of the new coronavirus, they said on Tuesday.
The ""visa upon arrival"" facility has been offered to Chinese nationals since 2017, in an effort to boost tourism. Those eligible included investors and businessmen, athletes, delegates to international conventions and tour groups.
Chinese tourists accounted for 22 percent of the 7.5 million visitors to the Philippines between January and November last year, making China the second top nation of origin for international travelers to the country.

TORONTO/BENGALURU, Jan 25 (Reuters) - Canada on Saturday declared the first ""presumptive"" confirmed case of the deadly coronavirus in a resident who had returned from the central Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak of the viral disease.
Ontario health officials told a news conference the patient is a male in his 50s, who arrived in Toronto on Jan. 22 and was hospitalized the next day after developing symptoms of respiratory illness.
Barbara Yaffe, Ontario's associate chief medical officer of health, told reporters that the man is being treated in a public hospital and is in a stable condition.
Ontario health officials are investigating the details of the man's contact with others since arriving in Toronto. Early indications are that he took private transportation home after arriving at Toronto airport and then paramedics brought him to the hospital, they added.
The health officials said it is a relatively small family situation, though they declined to give a number, and there is very little by way of contact. They said his family members have been put into self isolation.
Officials said the results from the provincial laboratory confirming the positive case arrived earlier on Saturday. Once the results from the local laboratory are confirmed by Canada's National Microbiology Laboratory, the case will be declared the country's first confirmed case of coronavirus.
Canada is on high alert to prevent the spread of coronavirus and avoid the repeat of SARS, or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, that killed 44 people in Canada, the only country outside Asia to report deaths from that virus in 2002-2003. Government health officials say Canada is better prepared this time.
The deadly coronavirus has infected more than 1,975 people and killed at least 56 in China. The virus has spread to several countries including the United States, Thailand, South Korea, Japan, Australia and France.

WUHAN (2nd UPDATE) - China on Sunday expanded drastic travel restrictions to contain a viral contagion that has killed 56 people and infected nearly 2,000, as the United States and France prepared to evacuate their citizens from a quarantined city at the outbreak's epicenter.
China has locked down the hard-hit province of Hubei in the country's center in an unprecedented operation affecting tens of millions of people to slow the spread of a respiratory illness that President Xi Jinping said posed a ""grave"" threat.
Outside the epicenter, three cities, including Beijing, and an eastern province announced bans on long-distance buses from entering or leaving their borders.
Originating in Hubei's capital of Wuhan, the virus has spread throughout China and around the world, with cases confirmed in around a dozen countries as distant as France, Australia and the United States.
The US State Department said on Sunday it was arranging a flight to repatriate staff at its Wuhan consulate and other American citizens trapped in the city.
The flight departs Wuhan on Tuesday for San Francisco, it said in an email to Americans in China, while warning of ""extremely limited"" capacity for private citizens.
France's government and the French carmaker PSA -- which has a sizable presence in Wuhan -- also said they were formulating plans to evacuate staff and relatives, who would be taken to a city in a neighboring province for a quarantine period.
Sri Lanka said its Beijing embassy was considering action regarding its nationals in Wuhan.
TRAVEL BANS
China would normally be celebrating the Lunar New Year holiday this week, but Wuhan's eerie quarantine calm deepened on Sunday as new restrictions banned most road traffic in the metropolis of 11 million.
Loudspeakers offered tips slathered with bravado.
""Do not believe in rumors. Do not spread rumors. If you feel unwell, go to the hospital in time,"" the message said.
""Wuhan is a city that dares to face difficulties and keeps overcoming them,"" the female voice added, mentioning the deadly 2002-03 SARS epidemic and 1998 Yangtze River flooding.
Israt Zahan, a Bangladeshi doctoral candidate living in Wuhan said she and other students were staying in their homes as it was ""too risky"" to go outside.
""The bustling city looks like a ghost town from my window. The shops are all shut down. I am rationing the food at my home. It will last for two days. Then I don't know what I would do,"" she told AFP by phone.
Despite anxious scenes at crowded hospitals in recent days, there were no signs of panic in the city. 
But defenses were bolstered elsewhere in the country.
Beijing suspended long-distance bus services into and out of the capital beginning Sunday. Similar suspensions are planned for the entire eastern province of Shandong -- home to 100 million people -- plus the northern cities of Tianjin and Xi'an.
The southern city of Shantou had announced a ban on vehicles entering its jurisdiction after detecting two cases, but authorities later reversed the decision.
Overseas Chinese tour groups will be suspended from Monday while domestic trips have already been halted since Friday.
In the semi-autonomous southern city of Hong Kong, Disneyland announced Sunday it had closed as a precaution following the government's declaration of an emergency to combat the crisis. Shanghai's Disneyland park had already closed Saturday.
VIRUS SPREAD 'ACCELERATING'
The nationwide death toll rose to 56 after 15 new deaths, most of them in Hubei.
Shanghai on Sunday reported its first death -- an 88-year-old man who had pre-existing health problems.
It was the first death reported in an internationally connected major Chinese city outside of Wuhan, where the outbreak is believed to have originated in a market where animals like rats, snakes and hedgehogs were sold as food.
The government says most deaths involved the elderly or people already weakened by pre-existing health conditions.
Fearing a repeat of SARS, China has dramatically scaled back celebrations and travel associated with the New Year holiday, which began Friday, while tourist sites like Beijing's Forbidden City and a section of the Great Wall have closed as a precaution. 
Xi said at a Communist Party leadership meeting on the crisis that China was ""faced with the grave situation of an accelerating spread"" of the virus, calling for stepped-up prevention.
Measures have been ordered nationwide to detect and isolate people carrying the virus on planes, trains and buses.
In Wuhan, China's military has dispatched 450 medics, many with experience combating infectious diseases, to help treat patients in the city, many of whom reported hours-long waits at overwhelmed hospitals.
Wuhan is racing to build two makeshift virus-focused field hospitals within a fortnight to ease the pressure. The first could be ready in just over a week.

WUHAN - The Chinese army deployed medical specialists Saturday to the epicenter of a spiraling viral outbreak that has killed 41 people and spread around the world, as millions spent their normally festive Lunar New Year holiday under lockdown.
The country's most important celebration has been all but canceled for some 56 million people as authorities expanded travel bans in central Hubei province, now affecting 18 cities.
On Saturday, when they should have been celebrating, citizens of Wuhan stood in line at a pharmacy to buy masks from employees in full-body protective suits and surgical gloves.
On the eastern outskirts of Wuhan -- Hubei's capital and the source of the previously unknown 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) -- police manning a roadblock turned away a handful of vehicles trying to exit the city. 
""Nobody can leave,"" an officer told AFP.
But the police allowed some medical workers who had gone home for the holidays to re-enter the city to help at overwhelmed hospitals.
""They need us to go there, otherwise they will be too exhausted,"" said one of the women, pulling a suitcase.
But the respiratory contagion continues to spread.
The nationwide death toll has jumped to 41, the government said Saturday, after 15 more people died in Wuhan.

China virus death toll jumps to 41, cases soar to nearly 1,300

Confirmed infections also surged to 1,287, up from 830 reported 24 hours earlier. Most of the deaths and overall cases have been in Hubei.
In a dramatic escalation of the central government's involvement, China deployed 450 military medical staff to Wuhan, state media said.
The medics, who arrived on military aircraft late Friday, include doctors with experience combating SARS or Ebola and will be dispatched to hospitals that are reportedly short on beds due to a crush of infected patients and worried locals.
The National Health Commission also ordered nationwide measures to detect people carrying the virus on planes, trains and buses across the country.
PROTECT YOURSELF
""Everyone is just trying to protect themselves,"" said a man in a surgical mask at a Wuhan pharmacy where customers were stocking up on masks, gloves and disinfectant.
But the man, who declined to give his name, expressed confidence in Chinese authorities.
""The government is handling this. It's not a problem.""
The virus has caused global concern because of its similarity to SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), which killed hundreds across mainland China and Hong Kong in 2002 to 2003 and spread to a number of other countries.
It has now spread nationwide and to a dozen other countries, with France saying 3 cases had been confirmed there -- the first known European infections.

France confirms first three cases of coronavirus in Europe 

Australia and Malaysia on Saturday became the latest countries to confirm infections.
Beijing's Forbidden City, Shanghai Disneyland, and a section of the Great Wall are among many attractions that have closed as a precaution.
The New Year is usually a joyous occasion for family reunions, but not for many in Wuhan.
""Usually we celebrate as a family. Now, because of the virus I'm not even visiting my parents,"" said Wang Fang, a 49-year-old Wuhan native.
""It'll be great just to be able to make it through (the outbreak).""
TRUMP PRAISE
China's aggressive response has won praise, especially compared to its handling of SARS, when it was accused of reacting sluggishly and stonewalling the international community.
""China has been working very hard to contain the Coronavirus,"" US President Donald Trump tweeted, hours after the United States confirmed its second case.
""The United States greatly appreciates their efforts and transparency,"" he added.
""It will all work out well.""
The virus emerged at a bad time for containment, with hundreds of millions of Chinese rushing home for the holiday.
The timing could limit the economic impact, however, since much of China normally shuts down during the roughly week-long break.
The outbreak emerged in late December, traced to a Wuhan seafood and live animal market that sold a vast range of exotic animals and other bushmeat.

'This time I'm scared': Experts fear too late for China virus lockdown 

The World Health Organization on Thursday stopped short of declaring a global emergency, which would have prompted greater international cooperation, including possible trade and travel restrictions.
Wuhan resembles a ghost town due to the clampdown, but hospitals bustled with worried patients being screened by staff wearing full-body protective suits.
The city's Guiyuan Temple is normally thronged for the Lunar New Year with tens of thousands of devotees paying respects to a deity associated with wealth.
But police manning a roadblock on Saturday turned away AFP journalists, saying the temple was closed to prevent the virus spread.
Authorities began building a new field hospital in Wuhan to deal with the outbreak, which state media said could be ready in 10 days.

HONG KONG - Hong Kong on Saturday declared a mystery virus outbreak as an ""emergency"" -- the city's highest warning tier -- as authorities ramped up measures aimed at reducing the risk of further infections spreading.
""Today I declare the lifting of the response level to emergency,"" chief executive Carrie Lam told reporters.
Lam held emergency meetings with health officials on Saturday morning after returning from Davos as criticism of her administration's response had risen in some quarters.
Of the 5 people who have tested positive for the virus in Hong Kong so far, 4 arrived via a newly built high-speed train terminal, which connects with the mainland.
That has led to calls from some to limit, or even halt, arrivals from the Chinese mainland, which remains the epicenter of the outbreak with 41 people dead so far.

China virus death toll jumps to 41, cases soar to nearly 1,300 

At a press conference on Saturday, Lam said all flights and trains from Wuhan would be canceled until further notice.
There were no restrictions on transport from other Chinese cities, but all mainland arrivals will now need to sign a health declaration form. 
Schools and universities, which are currently on a Lunar New Year break, would remain closed until Feb. 17, she added.
A string of public events, including a new year gala and next month's marathon, would also be called off. 
""We haven't seen serious and widespread infections (in Hong Kong), but we are taking this seriously and we hope to be ahead of the epidemic,"" Lam said.
Lam currently boasts record low approval ratings after 7 months of pro-democracy protests that have left the city ideologically torn apart and helped tip it into recession.
""We must stand united so that we can prevent and control the disease,"" she said, in a nod to the political unrest.

SYDNEY - Australia confirmed on Saturday its first 4 cases of the new coronavirus that has claimed 41 lives in China, becoming the latest country in a growing list to be affected by the illness.
One man was being treated in isolation after arriving in Melbourne a week ago from the Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak.
He has pneumonia but is in a stable condition, health officials said.
Three other men in Sydney who also arrived recently from China had tested positive for the disease and were in isolation in local hospitals.
""They are not particularly unwell,"" New South Wales state chief health officer Kerry Chant told a press conference.
She said public health officials had managed to track most of the people who had been with 2 of the men on their flights from China and none were showing symptoms of the illness.
Officials were still trying to trace the travel of the other man and are waiting on test results from several other people suspected of contracting the disease.
NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard praised the 3 men in Sydney for approaching doctors once their symptoms arose. 
Authorities in Queensland state said 5 other people had been cleared after they were suspected of infection.
The previously unknown 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is thought to have originated in a market in Wuhan where exotic animals and bushmeat were sold.
It has infected around 1,300 people in China and spread to almost a dozen other countries, including France and the United States.

The global spread of the coronavirus: Where is it?

The virus has caused global concern because of its similarity to SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), which killed hundreds across mainland China and Hong Kong in 2002 to 2003.
Health experts say some human-to-human transmission has been recorded, particularly in Wuhan, a city of 11 million now under lockdown in a bid to limit the spread of the disease.
Australian health minister Greg Hunt said passengers who traveled on the same Melbourne-bound plane as the infected man were being contacted ""to provide them with information and advice.""

Officials say 24 deaths have occurred in Hubei, the central province that is home to Wuhan, the city identified as the center of the outbreak.
The death was in the northeastern province of Heilongjiang, which borders Russia and is some 2,000 kilometers (1,200 miles) from Wuhan, the local government said.
It follows confirmation Thursday of the first death outside the epicenter -- an 80-year-old man diagnosed with the new virus in northern Hebei province, who died on Jan. 22.

TAIPEI—Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen called on China on Wednesday to share ""correct"" information about a new coronavirus and for the World Health Organization (WHO) not to exclude Taiwan from collaboration on the outbreak for political reasons.
Authorities have confirmed more than 400 cases of the virus in China, most of them in the central city of Wuhan where the virus first appeared at the end of 2019. Nine people have died.
The virus, which health officials have said can be passed from person to person, has spread to cities including Beijing and Shanghai, with cases have been confirmed in Thailand, South Korea, Japan, as well as Taiwan.

China warns virus could mutate and spread as death toll rises 

Taiwan is not a member of the WHO due to the objection of China, which considers the island a Chinese province with no right to participate in international organizations unless it accepts it is part of China.
Tsai, speaking to reporters after Taiwan's Tuesday confirmation of its first case of the coronavirus, a woman returning to Taiwan from Wuhan, said China had to live up to its international obligations.
Tsai said she hoped for transparency and that China would ""share with Taiwan correct information about the virus.""
""This is also beneficial for China's people. We believe that political considerations should not come before safeguarding people,"" she said.
Taiwan was a part of the international community and faced the same health challenges and risks as everyone, Tsai said.
""I again call on the WHO not to exclude Taiwan due to political factors. Taiwan is at the forefront of global epidemic prevention. There needs to be room at the WHO for Taiwan's participation.""

Taiwan reports first case of new SARS-like virus 

Relations between Taipei and Beijing have nosedived since Tsai took office in 2016, with China suspecting her of pushing for the island's formal independence. She says Taiwan is already an independent country called the Republic of China, it's formal name.
The WHO office in Beijing did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic said in an email to Reuters on Tuesday that Taiwan was being kept informed.
""Taiwanese authorities, including health experts, are being informed through cross-strait channels as well as channels connected with the International Health Regulations. WHO is informed that there is cross-strait contact on this matter.""
The deputy head of China's National Health Commission, Li Bin, told reporters in Beijing earlier that experts from Taiwan had been invited to visit Wuhan and the island was being provided with information.
Taiwan has advised people not to visit Wuhan unless they absolutely have to and has suspended tourist groups from the city from visiting the island.

Taiwan tells people not to go to Wuhan amid China virus outbreak 

Despite political tension, Taiwan and China have close business ties, with billions invested in China by Taiwanese businesses such as Foxconn, a key supplier to Apple .
Foxconn, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, has asked employees from its Wuhan plant in China who are in Taiwan for the Lunar New Year holidays to stay at home given the coronavirus outbreak in the city.
Since the outbreak, Foxconn workers in Wuhan have been wearing face masks and getting their temperature checked, the world's largest contract electronics manufacturer said.
Terry Gou, the billionaire founder of Foxconn, advised employees not to visit China over the holiday.
""The speed of contagion will be no less than SARS,"" he said at a party for the Lunar New Year in Taipei, referring to a Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak that started in China and killed nearly 800 people globally in 2002 to 2003.

The 124th Boston Marathon, scheduled for April 20, has been postponed to September 14 due to the ongoing coronavirus outbreak, the Boston Athletic Association (BAA) announced on Friday.
The historic race, first contested in 1897, is the world's oldest annual marathon and typically takes place on the Patriots Day holiday celebrated in Boston and the entire state of Massachusetts.
After Massachusetts governor Charlie Baker declared a state of emergency on Tuesday, Boston Mayor Martin Walsh decided the race could not proceed as scheduled in April and the BAA said in a statement it ""understands the city's decision.""
""On matters of public health and safety we take our guidance from the officials entrusted with protecting the public in this area,"" said association chief executive Tom Grilk.
""We understand our role, along with our partners, in ensuring a safe environment for all participants, volunteers, spectators, and supporters that meets the standards set by those officials.""
BAA officials have worked with municipal leaders across eight cities and towns where the course for the 26.2-mile event takes place to coordinate plans for September 14 as a new date.
""The BAA's mission of promoting health through sports, especially running, has guided our organization for more than a century,"" Grilk said. ""In collaboration with our many partners, we look forward to welcoming the world to Boston in September.""
The delay means it will be an extra five months before Kenya's Lawrence Cherono will have a chance to defend his 2019 men's crown and Worknesh Degefa of Ethiopia could bid for a repeat in the women's race.
Cherono probably will have to choose between marathon titles to defend because he also won last year's Chicago Marathon and that race is scheduled for October 11.

Vietnam postponed its debut Formula One Grand Prix on Friday, as fears over the spread of the deadly coronavirus decimated the start of the track season.
Scheduled for April 5, the Grand Prix in Hanoi was set to be the third race of the season and the first-ever to be held by the communist country.
Instead it has become the third event of the 2020 championship to be nixed as the virus throws global sport into disarray.
China has already postponed its Grand Prix to an unspecified date, while Australia on Friday cancelled the Melbourne race hours before practice sessions were due to begin.
The Bahrain race was initially due to be held behind closed doors, but it was also shelved soon after the announcement from Vietnam.
Forumla One, the most prestigious competition in motorsport faces unprecedented disruption as fears over the virus cause rip through the global sporting calendar.
""The organizer of Formula 1 . . . Vietnam Grand Prix 2020 officially announces the delay of F1 Hanoi race due to complicated development of Covid-19,"" the Vietnam Grand Prix Company (VGPC) said in a statement.
""The decision to delay the race was made after several discussions and thorough consideration between FIA, Formula One World Championship Ltd, the People's committee of Hanoi and VMA in the consensus of VGPC.""
It added: ""This was a very hard decision as 2020 is the first year Vietnam became (an) official member among the 22 countries hosting the world's most professional and attractive motor race.""

- 10-year race contract -
Last year Vietnam signed a 10-year deal with Formula One to host an event state media said would cost the country $60 million per year.
Just a few weeks ago the country's communist authorities remained bullish over the prospects for the country's debut race around the 5.565 kilometer street track in Hanoi.
They insisted the Hanoi track was ready ahead of schedule and said the race would proceed as planned, making it the third street race on the calendar.
Hosts Vietnam were keen for the glamour of motorsport to reflect the country's economic lift-off and help reshape Hanoi's image as a staid communist capital.
But Hanoi residents were understanding of another disruption to their city with a global health crisis still billowing out.
""My kids were very excited to be able to go to the track to watch a real race,"" said Le Nguyet, a Hanoi resident, who bought four tickets for $190.
""But I support the delay of the race until the situation gets better. It is a correct move. It's not safe for that many people to gather.""
Vietnam on Friday raised the country's total detected cases to 45, among them foreigners.
The Southeast Asian nation shares a porous border with China, where the virus first emerged, but for weeks said it had found only 16 cases of the sickness. 
Districts and townships where cases have been detected have faced swift lockdown as daily life in Vietnam - like most of Asia - has been upended.
This year Lewis Hamilton is aiming to retain the F1 championship in his all-conquering Mercedes.

Greece's Olympic Committee on Friday said it was cancelling the rest of the torch relay for the Tokyo 2020 Games on Greek soil, as large crowds had turned out despite coronavirus warnings.
""The rest of the torch relay on Greek soil has been cancelled,"" the committee said, adding that the Olympic flame would be handed over to Tokyo organizers on March 19 as scheduled, but without spectators.
It noted that crowds had ignored ""repeated warnings"" not to gather in force at stopovers in the torch relay.
Greece has so far declared 117 cases of the coronavirus, one of whom died on Thursday after 10 days in hospital.
The move was announced after a large crowd mobbed Hollywood actor Gerard Butler as he lit a cauldron in the city of Sparta.
Butler had starred as the ancient Spartan King Leonidas in the 2007 epic '300', and repeated his famous line from the movie -- 'This is Sparta' -- for gathered media.
The flame for the 2020 Tokyo Games was lit in ancient Olympia on Thursday amid an unprecedented health lockdown as Greece registered its first death from coronavirus.
The ceremony was held without spectators after dozens of people tested positive for COVID-19 in the broader western Peloponnese. Up to 12,000 had been expected to make their way to Olympia, where the ancient Games were held.
Only 100 accredited guests from the International Olympic Committee and the Tokyo 2020 Organising Committee, compared to 700 originally, were allowed to attend Thursday's ceremony.

,Mar 13 2020,nCov,Conflicting claims: San Juan gov't denies police report of escaping COVID-19 patient,ABS-CBN News,"
MANILA - San Juan City Mayor Francis Zamora on Friday dismissed reports that a woman who tested positive of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) attempted to evade hospital admission.
The patient went to her preferred private hospital after finding out on Wednesday, March 11 she had contracted the disease, he said.
However, the hospital could not accommodate the patient so she was instead escorted by local authorities to a different hospital for immediate treatment, Zamora added.
""She is now in stable condition and receiving proper care and treatment,"" the city mayor said in a statement.
Earlier Friday, National Capital Region Police Office Regional Director Debold Sinas said a patient escaped her police escorts as she wanted to go to a hospital of her choice.
He added the negotiation between the policeman, the woman and her husband took about 3 hours.
“Na-test na siya na positive kaya dadalin na siya sa Quirino hospital. Ayaw niya, gusto niya sa St. Luke's hospital kasi pangit yung doon. Tinanggihan siya sa St. Luke's,” Sinas said.
Sinas said negotiation between the woman and her husband took about 3 hours.
""DOH ang nag inform sa kaniya kasi nga may protocol. Now sinabi niya gusto niya hospital niya. Ang point pa doon may provision tayo kung saan lang hospital na dapat dalin yung mga nag-positive ng COVID-9.""
He pointed out that the woman should not have escaped just because she didn't like the hospital she was brought to.
""Kung tingin niya di maganda yung accommodation 'di kausapin niya yung management, hindi siya tatakas spreading the virus,"" he said.
By escaping, Sinas said the woman had exposed other people to potential infection.
 
He said all those in the couple's home, as well as police personnel who negotiated with them, are now persons under monitoring.
""Panigurado namin na yung tao namin hindi makapag-spread kaya kinausap namin San Juan, pwede ba gawin na silang persons under monitoring, 14 days lang naman yun. They will still function,"" he said.
Sinas said they will not let the incident slide and would file charges against the couple.
""Kung sinabi niyang hindi siya tumakas, nasa kanya yun 'di ba? She'll just answer later on kung anong kaso ipa-file namin...the mere fact that you already threatened the community natin by spreading the virus,"" he said.
Meanwhile, San Juan has recorded another case of COVID-19, bringing the number of infection in the city to 9.
All patients are recuperating in hospitals and currently in stable condition, Zamora said.
It was not yet clear if the new patient is part of the country's 52 confirmed COVID-19 cases. The city government also didn't give further details about the new positive case.
The new strain of coronavirus has infected more than 125,000 people and killed 4,600 others in 117 countries and territories, latest data from the World Health Organization (WHO) showed.

Pope Francis expressed his displeasure Friday with the move by the Italian authorities to close all Catholic houses of worship across Rome until April 3.
""Drastic measures are not always good,"" the Argentine-born pontiff was quoted by the ANSA news agency as saying in his introduction to mass, in uncharacteristically blunt language for the head of the Church.
He nevertheless urged the faithful to show ""responsibility"" and ""cooperate with the appropriate authorities,"" ANSA reported.
Italy has imposed Europe's toughest response to a pandemic that has killed 1,016 people and infected more than 15,000 in the peninsula in less than three weeks.
The government has shut all shops except for pharmacies and groceries in the hope of stemming contagion and easing the burden on Italy's overstretched hospitals.
The Holy See initially resisted the drastic measure of closing places of worship in a country that is overwhelmingly Catholic.
But the papal vicar for Rome said he was finally forced to take the step by ""the even more binding restrictions placed on the ordinary movement of people"" by the government.
""This provision is for the common good,"" Rome vicar Angelo De Donatis conceded.
Catholics have been exempted from the obligation to attend mass as a result.
- 'See the sick' -
The draconian measures only allow Italians to go outside for work or in special circumstances -- such as visiting sick relatives.
Everyone must carry with them a signed form to say they are aware of the risks of being outdoors.
Trains are still running but travellers must show documents to security guards at stations well as airports.
Streets in central Rome are almost completely empty and patrolled by soldiers armed with machine guns.
In video clips from the Tuscan city of Sienna and the southern city of Naples -- reminiscent of similar ones from the Chinese city of Wuhan during its quarantine -- people can be heard singing from their windows over the empty streets.
The pope nevertheless called for priests ""to have the courage to go out and see the sick, bringing the strength of the word of God"".
""We continue to pray together for the sick, for health workers and for the many people suffering from this epidemic"" Pope Francis said.

The English Premier League suspended all fixtures until April 4 on Friday after a spate of coronavirus cases, including Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta and Chelsea winger Callum Hudson-Odoi.
""Following a meeting of shareholders today, it was unanimously decided to suspend the Premier League with the intention of returning on 4 April, subject to medical advice and conditions at the time,"" the Premier League said in a statement.
Everton also announced their entire first-team squad and coaching staff have been told to self-isolate after a player reported symptoms consistent with COVID-19.
Leicester City had three players go into self-isolation on Thursday and Bournemouth said goalkeeper Artur Boruc and four staff members were also self-isolating.
""Above all, we wish Mikel Arteta and Callum Hudson-Odoi speedy recoveries, and everyone else affected by COVID-19,"" said Premier League Chief Executive Richard Masters.
""In this unprecedented situation, we are working closely with our clubs, Government, The FA and EFL and can reassure everyone the health and welfare of players, staff and supporters are our priority.""
The English Football League, which heads up the three divisions below the Premier League, and Women's Super League will also be suspended until April 3.
England's two friendly matches at home to Italy and Denmark later this month have been postponed.
However, the authorities still hope to be able to resume and complete the season at a later date.
""Despite the challenges, it is the Premier League’s aim is to reschedule the displaced fixtures, including those played by Academy sides, when it is safe to do so,"" added the Premier League statement.

NAGOYA - Police in central Japan said Friday they have launched a probe into a man who was infected with the novel coronavirus on suspicion of interfering with business activities, after he went to local eateries expressing his desire to ""spread the virus.""
The investigation came a day after a woman in her 30s tested positive for the virus after coming into contact earlier this month with the man at a drinking establishment in Aichi Prefecture.
The woman who is living with her family in Toyota, Aichi Prefecture, worked at the Filipino pub which the man in his 50s from Gamagori, also in Aichi, visited on March 4 despite authorities' instructions to stay indoors, Toyota city officials said Thursday.
The woman developed a fever on March 8 and currently has a sore throat. She is in stable condition but is scheduled to be hospitalized, according to the Toyota city officials.
The man tested positive for the virus on March 4, a day after his parents, with whom he lived, were found to be infected.
He told them he was going to ""spread the virus"" and went to a bar and the Filipino pub in Gamagori that same night, Gamagori city officials said.
The man stayed at the bar for 15 minutes but did not speak about his infection.
He then went to the Filipino pub and stayed there for around 40 minutes, singing karaoke, and putting his arm around a female employee who was seated next to him, a source familiar with the matter said.
The man told an employee at the pub that he had tested positive for the virus, leading the outlet to report him to the police and a health center. 
Following the report, police officers clad in protective gear hurried to the pub, which had to be disinfected by health officials.
The health center also sought those who came into contact with the man.
Including the woman's case, the number of infections confirmed in Aichi rose to 111, the second largest after Hokkaido among Japan's 47 prefectures.
COVID-19 is a highly contagious pneumonia caused by the new coronavirus, which has infected more than 120,000 people worldwide and claimed over 4,000 lives.

MILAN, Italy—Majority of the Filipinos in this country work in the household service sector. Domestic workers, babysitters and non-cohabiting carers are affected by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Italy has climbed to the second spot with the most number of positive cases at 15,113 and the death toll reached 1,016.
Italy is home to 168,292 Filipinos, according to the Italian National Institute of Statistics.
Marielle (not her real name) works as a cleaner and has to travel for more than an hour every day to reach her workplace outside Milan. She chooses her job over health risks just to earn for her family in the Philippines. Alcantara, uncertain of the government provisions, continue to report to work.
“Gusto ng amo ko na mag-stay pa ako sa trabaho pero sabi ko natatakot na ako, kinailangan ko pa gumawa ng dahilan para makauwi ng maaga,” Alcantara says.
(My employer wanted me to stay longer but I told her I’m scared, I had to make an alibi so I can go home early.)
According to Lorenzo Gasparrini, general secretary of the National Association of Domestic Employer Families, household service workers and non-cohabiting carers can file a leave from work and just recoup the hours lost once the emergency is over.
If the housekeeper wants to continue working and the family wants to suspend work, both parties can find an agreement, possibly written, with the commitment to recouping the lost hours. If the housekeeper insists on coming, the family could grant the worker a vacation leave.
Absence from work can be treated as a holiday period. If the worker is not entitled to a vacation leave, the employer should guarantee compensation in advance without having to terminate the employment relationship. If the housekeeper hired under a contract cannot go to work in the face of the new decree, she may take leave.
Household service workers are excluded from unemployment insurance or from other social safety nets. Families who continue to pay a housekeeper who does not work because of the emergency cannot ask for a refund.
“We are asking families not to lay off workers to avoid leaving them in a situation of absolute poverty in this moment of national emergency. However, employer families should have the same attention as other companies,” Gasparrini said.
Currently, the terms of payment of social security and welfare contributions are suspended, only for the 11 municipalities of the previous declared red zones, until May 1. Given the general lockout of all activities on the national territory, an extension of the moratorium is possible.
Filipino domestic helpers without regular employment contracts and legal documents are also at risk. With the lockdown and stricter movement regulations, a self-declaration document is needed.

This will be the third time in the last decade that Everest's summit will remain empty. Navesh Chitrakar, Reuters/file


Nepal on Friday barred climbers from all mountains -- including Everest -- over the coronavirus pandemic, in a major blow to its tourism industry.
The Himalayan country, which has so far confirmed one coronavirus case, earns 4.4 million dollars a year from climbing permits while the losses to expedition organizers will be even higher.
As well as suspending all climbing permits, Nepal stopped issuing tourist visas on arrival, Yogesh Bhattarai, Minister for Culture Tourism and Civil Aviation told AFP.
""The government has decided to suspend all spring expeditions and scrap permits for the time being. The decision can be reviewed after analyzing the global scenario over the coming month,"" tourism minister Yogesh Bhattara told AFP. 
Expedition organizers and Nepal tourism professionals said the move, which came a day after China barred access from its side, was justified but would cause a financial disaster.
Nepal, still recovering from a devastating 2015 earthquake, was also hoping to attract two million tourists for the first time in 2020, celebrating it as a visit Nepal year. 
US-based Furtenbach Adventures cancelled a move to shift its operations to Nepal after China closed the mountain on Thursday. 
""This is disappointing news for both our expedition leaders and our clients who have trained for months for this year’s climb,"" expedition organizer Lukas Furtenbach said in a statement.
Every spring a tented city of hundreds of foreign climbers and support staff grows at the foot of Everest and other peaks. All have to live in close quarters.
As the air thins, breathing is already difficult at higher altitude -- adding to medical risks if there is an outbreak of any kind among climbers. 
""We understand the dire consequences a COVID-19 outbreak at base camp would have. Sadly, we have to agree that this is a responsible call to make right now,"" Furtenbach said.
Nepal has issued only five permits for the season but none for Everest so far.
Everest attracts hundreds of mountaineers from all over the world each spring, when a window of good weather opens up between late April and the end of May, prompting a rush for the summit.
Last year's spring window saw a record 885 people summit Everest, 644 of them from Nepal and 241 from the northern flank in Tibet.
The traffic-clogged season saw 11 deaths on the mountain, with at least four blamed on overcrowding.

- 'Devastating consequence'-
But the expedition is not cheap. An Everest permit costs $11,000 and the total cost of the climb can be anything between $30,000 and $80,000.
This will be the third time in the last decade that Everest's summit will remain empty.
Climbers abandoned the mountain after the 2015 earthquake triggered an avalanche which killed 18 people at Everest base camp before the season began.
Only one climber reached the summit in 2014, when an avalanche claimed the lives of 16 Nepali guides on the notorious Khumbu icefall that sits above base camp, forcing organizers to cancel their expeditions. 
Santa Bir Lama, president of Nepal's mountaineering association, said the cancellation will have serious repercussion on the tourism industry of the country.
""It would have a devastating impact on our tourism and economy. The companies will suffer and workers even more. But it is a responsible thing to do considering the risks,"" Lama said.
Many guides and support staff depend on the short climbing season for the bulk of their annual earnings. 
""It will be very difficult this year. Not only Everest, we might not get work on other mountains either. All of us have families and children to send to school. This is when we earn the most,"" said Temba Bhote, a guide on Everest.

As he watches his troops firing rockets and artillery shells, one of the many things that marks North Korean leader Kim Jong Un out from the officers alongside him is his coronavirus mask: it isn't there.
Kim has overseen multiple military drills in recent weeks as Pyongyang mounts an all-out drive to prevent an outbreak of the disease that has swept around the world from neighboring China.
Thousands have been quarantined and hundreds of foreigners, including diplomats, confined to their residences.
State media constantly exhort citizens to obey health directives and publish images showing universal facemask use -- except by the supreme leader.
The Rodong Sinmun newspaper, mouthpiece of the ruling party, and official news agency KCNA have shown Kim supervising firing exercises from a trench, tent or shelter four times in the last two weeks.
Every time he has had his face uncovered under a black fur hat, while all the officers next to him have worn black masks.
The North carefully controls and calibrates imagery of Kim, and analysts said his uncovered features send an intended message.
""He may want to show people that he is not afraid of the virus, that he is above infection,"" said Rachel Minyoung Lee, senior analyst with specialist site NK News.
""It is consistent with the crux of North Korea's leadership propaganda: that the Kim leadership is exceptional in every way.""
There would be no sense he was contradicting the official virus guidance, she added: ""North Koreans know that he is in an altogether different league.""
Koh Yu-hwan, a professor of North Korean studies at Dongguk University, said an image of Kim wearing a mask could risk ""undermining his charisma... as if he is some sort of a coward, afraid of catching the virus for his own sake. 
""They aimed to project an image of Kim impervious to the coronavirus as the leader of the Paektu bloodline.""
The ""Paektu bloodline"" is a term for the Kim family who have ruled the North for three generations.
It references the sacred mountain seen as the spiritual birthplace of the Korean people, where the North's founder Kim Il Sung is said to have fought Japanese occupiers during World War II.
Kim was twice last year pictured riding a white horse up Mount Paektu in what was seen as a symbolic appropriation of his grandfather's leadership image.
The North often plays up physical and other similarities between the two men, and the fur hat Kim has been wearing in recent photos recalls old images of Kim Il Sung, including one reproduced on a stamp in 2013.
""It looks like he is going for his grandpa's fashion again,"" said Lee.

A senior Australian politician tested positive for the new coronavirus and entered hospital quarantine Friday, days after returning from Washington where he met Ivanka Trump and US Attorney General William Barr. 
Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton was in the United States last week for a meeting with members of the FiveEyes intelligence alliance -- Australia, the United States, Britain, Canada and New Zealand -- that included Barr. 
He also met with US President Donald Trump's daughter Ivanka on March 6, according to a photo posted by the Australian embassy in Washington, which shows the pair standing close together. 
It is not yet known when Dutton contracted the virus.
""This morning I woke up with a temperature and sore throat,"" said Dutton, an influential member of the government and a key architect of Australia's controversial immigration laws.
""It is the policy of Queensland Health that anyone who tests positive is to be admitted into hospital and I have complied with their advice.""
Dutton said he feels ""fine"" but his diagnosis will raise concerns about whether other members of the cabinet and Prime Minister Scott Morrison may have been infected.
The prime minister's office confirmed Friday that Dutton attended a cabinet meeting on Tuesday, but other participants would not be quarantined.
""Only people who had close contact with the minister in the preceding 24 hours before he became symptomatic need to self-isolate,"" a spokesman said.
""That does not include the Prime Minister or any other members of the Cabinet.""
In contrast, New Zealand Internal Affairs Minister Tracey Martin -- who also met Dutton in Washington -- has self-isolated and will get tested for the virus on Saturday, local media reported.
Morrison will no longer attend a rugby match on Saturday night after earlier saying he would even as he announced a bar on gatherings of more than 500 people.
Dutton is among 184 people in Australia who have been confirmed as having COVID-19.
He is just the latest in a string of political figures around the world to suffer a scare.
Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro has been tested for the virus after a top aide was diagnosed with the disease following a trip to the US during which both met with Trump. 
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is in quarantine for two weeks after his wife tested positive for the virus. 
British MP Nadine Dorries, a junior health minister who helped craft legislation to fight the contagion, is also infected.
Several US lawmakers have isolated themselves after attending a conservative conference in late February.
The White House has insisted Trump does not need testing, despite interactions with several people who have been exposed to the virus, saying ""only people with prolonged close exposure to confirmed positive cases should self-quarantine.""

MANILA - The Philippine government on Friday urged couples to consider postponing their weddings for at least a month as Metro Manila is set to undergo ""community quarantine"" to arrest the spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
This, after the government prohibited large gatherings, including social events such as weddings, and imposed stringent social distancing protocols in an effort to prevent new infections.
Though the Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF) on COVID-19 response has yet to release particular guidelines for weddings, Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles and Trade Secretary Ramon Lopez said couples should look at moving their event after April 15 or at least reduce the number of guests.
“Hindi ho mapipigilan ang pag-ibig. Bawasan na lang nila ‘yong guests… makakatipid pa sila,” Lopez said. 
(Love can't be stopped. They should reduce the number of guests... they could even save money.)
“An informal estimate would be 50 guests, but it really depends on the size of the room,” Nograles, meanwhile, said.
“Siyempre sa wedding, paano magki-kiss ang couple? Paano ang distansya ng couple? Ang daming adjustments na kailangang gawin,” the official continued.
(During the wedding, how will the couple kiss? What about their distance? There are a lot of adjustments that need to be done.) 
Lopez said that couples should expect to be refunded if they have already paid for their reservations at hotels and restaurants. 
If not, couples may file consumer complaints with the Department of Trade and Industry (DIT) through its hotline 1384. 
“Dapat ho may refund, kasi force majeure po ‘yon,” Lopez said.
(There should be a refund because this is force majeure.)

Brownlee had been announced to suit up for Alab as early as February 19, but missed two games due to personal reasons.
Since then, the regional league has rescheduled its play dates, and now ordered a pause in play because of the continued spread of the coronavirus.
With that, Jason Brickman, Lo Domingo, Miah Gray, and Jordan Heading are also flying out with Alab management wishing them a safe flight.

,Mar 13 2020,nCov,Athletes' Village in Tarlac disinfected after repatriates finish quarantine,ABS-CBN News,"



MANILA - Health workers on Friday deep-cleaned and sanitized the Athletes' Village in New Clark City in Tarlac province after hundreds of Filipino sailors from a coronavirus-afflicted cruise ship have completed their quarantine.
Clad in full protective gears, personnel from the Department of Health (DOH) in Central Luzon disinfected the rooms used by the 445 repatriates from MV Diamond Princess to stop the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
""We would like to assure everyone, especially those residing in the adjacent communities of New Clark City, that the Athletes’ Village has been thoroughly sanitized by the DOH,” Bases Conversion and Development Authority (BCDA) president and CEO Vince Dizon said in a statement.

2 repatriates at New Clark City test positive for COVID-19

The rooms of the 2 repatriates who tested positive for COVID-19 were also thoroughly disinfected. Tagged as patients 25 and 26 in the health department's tally of coronavirus cases, they have since been transferred to the hospital.
Amid reports of local transmissions in the country, the New Clark City will also remain on lockdown as a precautionary measure, Dizon added.

 
The Filipino sailors were flown out of Japan on Feb. 25, and were sent straight to the New Clark City for quarantine.
They already underwent a 14-day quarantine on the ship but were required to undergo another quarantine procedure.

Health Secretary Francisco Duque III had commended all health workers who took care of the repatriates.
""We commend the health workers who have been tirelessly caring for our repatriates for the past month. First, those from Wuhan, and now those from Japan. Their dedication to their work and their countrymen is truly inspiring,” he said in a statement.

NEXU Science Communication/Reuters


BEIJING - A Chinese government campaign to cast doubt on the origin of the coronavirus pandemic is fueling a row with the United States, with a Beijing official promoting conspiracy theories and Washington calling it the ""Wuhan virus.""
The spat comes as China tries to deflect blame for the contagion and reframe itself as a country that took decisive steps to buy the world time by placing huge swathes of its population under quarantine.
With cases falling in China and soaring abroad, Beijing is now rejecting the widely held assessment that the city of Wuhan is the birthplace of the outbreak.
Foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian went a step further on Thursday, saying on Twitter that ""it might be US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan"" -- without providing evidence.
He doubled down on his claim on Friday by posting a link to an article from a website known for publishing conspiracy theories about the 9/11 attacks.
Censors usually vigilant against rumors have also allowed Chinese social media users to spread similar claims about the US being behind the virus.
A video showing a US health official saying some flu victims were posthumously diagnosed as having had COVID-19 was among the top searched items on China's Twitter-like Weibo this week, with some users saying it was evidence the virus originated in the US.
Zhao posted the clip on Twitter.
Dali Yang, a political science professor at the University of Chicago, said he believes Zhao was ""tweeting in his official capacity.""
China's intention in promoting the conspiracy theory is ""to divert from domestic discontent"" over the handling of the outbreak, which has killed more than 3,100 people in the country.
SEAFOOD MARKET
The push to question the origin of the disease contradicts China's own initial assessment about the source of the virus, which has now killed nearly 5,000 people worldwide.
Gao Fu, head of China's Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said in January ""we now know the source of the virus is wild animals sold at the seafood market"" in Wuhan.
Chinese authorities themselves saw Wuhan and the rest of Hubei province as a threat as they placed the region of 56 million people under strict quarantine to contain the epidemic.
But Beijing began sowing doubts in late February, when Zhong Nanshan, a respected expert affiliated with the National Health Commission, told reporters ""the epidemic first appeared in China, but didn't necessarily originate in China.""
Scientists, however, have long suspected that the virus jumped from an animal at the Wuhan market to a human before spreading globally.
The World Health Organization has said that while the exact path the virus took between its animal source and humans is still unclear, COVID-19 was ""unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019"".
Christl Donnelly, a professor of statistical epidemiology at Imperial College London, said genetic analysis of coronavirus samples collected from around the world shows a common ancestor in China.
""This is not in any way blaming a particular country,"" she told AFP.
'WUHAN VIRUS'
The United States, meanwhile, has angered China by using language to directly link the virus to the country.
US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has called it the ""Wuhan virus,"" prompting China's foreign ministry to reject the term as ""despicable"" and ""disrespecting science.""
Despite the protests, US President Donald Trump started a televised address to his nation on Wednesday by speaking about the outbreak ""that started in China.""
The WHO warns against naming infectious diseases in a way that encourages discrimination against ethnic groups.
The Trump administration's emphasis on the virus' origin in China is ""part of his dog-whistling politics,"" said Australian National University researcher Yun Jiang.
Robert O'Brien, the US national security adviser, on Wednesday insisted that the virus originated in Wuhan.
Blaming the pandemic on an initial lack of cooperation from Chinese officials and a cover-up when the outbreak first emerged, O'Brien said this had ""cost the world community 2 months to respond"" to the threat.
Beijing called his remarks ""extremely immoral and also irresponsible.""
China's objections have extended to criticizing anyone suggesting the virus originated in the country.
Zhao said last week that journalists using the term ""China virus"" were ""suggesting its origin without any supporting facts or evidence"" and had ""ulterior motives.""
Jiang, the researcher, said that ""by sowing doubts into people's mind about where the virus originated, they're trying to deflect part of the blame for the outbreak.""

BEIJING - China's Wuhan city, ground zero of the new coronavirus outbreak, reported 5 new cases on Friday, the second day in a row the tally has been less than 10, while no locally transmitted infections were reported in the rest of the country.
Wuhan, capital of central Hubei province, recorded the 5 new confirmed cases on Thursday, the National Health Commission said, down from 8 cases the previous day.
The commission said on Thursday China's coronavirus epidemic had passed its peak, even as alarm over the virus intensified elsewhere with global markets suffering record falls and governments unveiling measures to try to slow the spread of a disease that has infected more than 127,000 people worldwide.
As China's new infections have tailed off, its concern has turned to imported cases.
Shanghai reported 2 new cases, while Beijing saw 1, all imported by people traveling to China from affected areas abroad, the health authority said.
Those cases brought the total number of new infections in mainland China to 8 on Thursday, down from 15 the previous day, and the lowest since the healthy authority started publishing nationwide figures in January.
To date, the total accumulated number of cases in mainland China is 80,813.
The death toll from the outbreak in mainland China reached 3,176 as of the end of Thursday, up by 7 from the previous day.
In Hubei province, there were 6 new deaths, with Wuhan accounting for all of them.

SEOUL - South Korea reported more recoveries from the coronavirus than new infections on Friday for the first time since its outbreak emerged in January, as a downward trend in daily cases raised hopes that Asia's biggest epidemic outside China may be slowing.
The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) recorded 110 new coronavirus cases on Friday compared with 114 a day earlier, taking the national tally to 7,979. In contrast, 177 patients were released from hospitals where they had been isolated for treatment.
This marks the first time that the daily number of recovered people exceeded that of new infections since South Korea's first patient was confirmed on Jan. 20.
The latest figures are in line with a downward trend in new cases, which has raised hopes that the outbreak may be easing in Asia's fourth-largest economy.
But officials urged vigilance after new clusters of infections emerged at a call center in a crowded part of capital Seoul, and a government agency in the administrative city of Sejong.
""We've managed to turn the corner, but there are concerns about overseas inflows, as well as possible infections at home around such facilities as call centers, computer cafes and karaoke rooms,"" Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun said at a meeting in Daegu.
Of the latest 110 cases, 61 were from the hard-hit southeastern city of Daegu where a fringe Christian church at the center of the epidemic is located, while 17 and 13 were in Sejong and Seoul, respectively.
At least 109 cases so far have been linked to the call center, operated by an insurance company whose 800-strong workforce is being tested or in quarantine for monitoring.
Seoul City plans to carry out extensive checks on some 10,500 computer cafes and karaoke bars as part of efforts to prevent the spread of the virus in crowded workplaces, Mayor Park Won-soon told a briefing.
Global alarm over the coronavirus intensified, with governments from Europe to the United States unveiling new measures aimed at slowing the spread of a disease that has infected almost 135,000 people worldwide.
South Korea said it will subject visitors from France, Germany, Britain, Spain and the Netherlands to reinforced border checks starting Sunday, after imposing similar rules for China, Italy and Iran suffering a major outbreak.

HONG KONG - A dog held in quarantine in Hong Kong on suspicion of having the coronavirus has tested negative, the government said late on Thursday, easing fears over the possibility of human-to-animal transmission.
The dog, which belongs to a patient who tested positive for COVID-19, will still need to be retested before being released.
The negative result does not mean the dog has not been infected with the virus, Hong Kong's Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) said.
""It is also not uncommon in the earlier stages of infections to have negative result as it often takes 14 days or more for measurable levels of antibodies to be detected,"" it said.
The dog had repeatedly tested ""weak positive"" since late February with low levels of the virus found its its nasal and oral cavity samples, prompting further tests to confirm if it had been infected or if the samples were due to environmental contamination.
The World Health Organization says there is no evidence so far that companion pets can be infected with the coronavirus.
Animal health experts examining the Hong Kong case have said pet owners should not be overly concerned and should not abandon their pets.
Hong Kong has around 131 confirmed cases of coronavirus with 3 fatalities so far.

LONDON/NEW YORK—The coronavirus pandemic shredded the global sporting calendar on Thursday, with men's tennis shut down for six weeks, top European soccer leagues placed on hold, NHL suspended and Major League Baseball's opening day postponed.
Speculation over whether the world's premier sporting events could go forward under the specter of coronavirus culminated in a series of unprecedented postponements and cancellations across the globe, as the sporting world faced an uncertain future.
Major League Baseball said it would delay its season's opening day by at least two weeks, while motor racing's blue-riband Formula One season has also been stalled with the opening Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne called off, according to multiple media reports.

Chelsea's players and coaching staff were ordered into isolation as Callum Hudson-Odoi became the first Premier League player confirmed to have the new coronavirus late on Thursday.
The news casts the viability of this weekend's games further into doubt after Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta tested positive, also throwing their team into lockdown.

Japanese government officials insisted Friday they have no plans to alter the Olympics, including holding it without spectators, after US President Donald Trump proposed a delay over the coronavirus.
The fate of the 2020 Games, scheduled to open in Tokyo on July 24, has been thrown into doubt by the outbreak of the virus, now dubbed a pandemic.
But organizers, Japanese government officials and the International Olympic Committee have insisted preparation for the Games is on track, with no expectations of a postponement or cancellation.
""There is no change in the government policy in that we closely cooperate with the IOC, the organizing committee, and the Tokyo metropolitan government to steadily prepare for holding the Games as scheduled,"" government spokesman Yoshihide Suga told reporters.
He said Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Trump had held a phone call to discuss the outbreak as well as the Olympics.
""In the telephone talks with President Trump, the prime minister mentioned our efforts toward holding the Games, and the president said he highly values Japan's efforts on transparency,"" Suga said.
He did not say whether Trump had repeated his suggestion, made a day earlier, that the Games might need to be delayed.
""I would say maybe they postpone it for a year,"" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Thursday.
""You know, I like that better than I like having empty stadiums all over the place. I think if you cancel it, make it a year later, that's a better alternative than doing it with no crowd,"" he said.
The suggestion was roundly dismissed by Japan's Olympic minister Seiko Hashimoto.
""I'm aware of President Trump's remarks but neither the IOC nor the organizing committee is thinking about delaying or cancelling the Games at all,"" she said at a regular briefing Friday.
Asked about the possibility of scaling back the number of spectators, Hashimoto said: ""We are not thinking about that at all.""
Suga also said the government ""doesn't envisage"" either a Games without spectators or the prospect of athletes withdrawing from the event.
IOC chief Thomas Bach told German television ARD on Thursday that the body would follow recommendations by the World Health Organization, but for now continues to work for a ""successful"" Games.
He acknowledged however that cancellations of Olympic qualifiers are starting to pose ""serious problems"".

NEW YORK, March 12 (Reuters) - NCAA has cancelled its 'March Madness' Division I men's and women's basketball tournaments, citing concern over the coronavirus pandemic which has hit sporting events across the world.
""This decision is based on the evolving COVID-19 public health threat, our ability to ensure the events do not contribute to spread of the pandemic, and the impracticality of hosting such events,"" the National Collegiate Athletic Association said in a written statement.
The NCAA said it would also cancel all remaining winter and spring championships.
March Madness, which attracts millions of viewers and advertising dollars, is among the most popular annual sporting events in North America, bringing together 68 men's and 64 women's teams in venues across the U.S.
The cancellation came amid media reports that two powerhouse programs - Duke University and Kansas University - would not participate in the tournament.
Broadcasters Turner Sports and CBS Sports said they were ""fully supportive of the NCAA's decision"" and would work closely with the athletics organization ""as we prioritize the health and well-being of everyone involved."" (Reporting by Amy Tennery; Editing by Ken Ferris)

The Premier League could be forced into lockdown after Arsenal's match at Brighton was postponed when Gunners manager Mikel Arteta contracted the coronavirus on Thursday.
Arsenal's training ground has been closed and their players and staff have gone into self-isolation following Arteta's shock positive test.
Less than an hour after Arsenal revealed Arteta's illness, Brighton announced that their scheduled clash at the Amex Stadium had been cancelled.
""It's absolutely essential the health and wellbeing of individuals takes priority and with that in mind Saturday's match has been postponed,"" Brighton chief executive Paul Barber said in a statement.
""We apologise to all fans for any inconvenience but trust everyone will understand that we are all facing an unprecedented situation.
""First and foremost our thoughts are with Mikel Arteta and we wish him a speedy recovery.""
The Premier League, who had earlier insisted all games would go ahead this weekend, responded by revealing they will hold an emergency meeting on Friday to discuss how to deal with the global pandemic's effect on their fixtures.
""In light of Arsenal's announcement tonight confirming that their first-team coach Mikel Arteta has tested positive for COVID-19, the Premier League will convene an emergency club meeting tomorrow morning regarding future fixtures,"" the Premier League said.
Arteta said: ""This is really disappointing but I took the test after feeling poorly. I will be at work as soon as I'm allowed.""
There are over 590 confirmed cases of the virus in Britain and 10 people have died from it so far.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson had said the government was ""considering the question of banning major public events such as sporting fixtures"", but was not ready to do so yet.
Now Arteta's illness could force the Premier League's hand and lead to the cancellation of matches this weekend and possibly into the future.
In Italy, the European country worst hit by the virus, Serie A has suspended matches until at least April 3 and Juventus defender Daniele Rugani has been quarantined.
UEFA, European football's governing body, will consider whether to postpone the Champions League and Euro 2020 at a meeting next week.
All French Ligue 1 matches will be behind closed doors until April 15.
The next two La Liga match days have been suspended and this weekend's Bundesliga fixtures are behind closed doors.
Arsenal's league match at Manchester City last Wednesday was postponed and several Gunners players went into self-isolation after Olympiakos and Nottingham Forest owner Evangelos Marinakis contracted the virus.
Marinakis, 52, met a number of Arsenal's players and staff when the Gunners faced Olympiakos in a Europa League tie in February.
- Health crisis -
Arsenal are not the only top-flight club affected by the virus.
Leicester, scheduled to play at Watford on Saturday, said on Thursday that three of their players have shown symptoms of the virus and are self-isolating as a precaution.
The Foxes said the unnamed trio had ""presented with extremely mild illness"" in recent days.
""We've had a few players that have shown symptoms and signs,"" Leicester manager Brendan Rodgers said.
""We've followed procedure and they have been kept away at this moment from the rest of the squad and then we'll see how that develops.""
Chelsea have also been touched by the health crisis, with players told to stay away from training after a member of staff reportedly complained of virus symptoms.
Thursday's training session was cancelled while their Cobham base was deep cleaned before Frank Lampard's side are due to travel to Aston Villa on Saturday.
Manchester City said one unnamed member of their squad, reportedly France defender Benjamin Mendy, is in self-isolation after a family member suffered a respiratory illness.
The relative is being treated in hospital and has undergone tests for the coronavirus, which can cause shortness of breath.
City's Champions League last 16 second leg meeting with Real Madrid, set for Tuesday, has been postponed after one of the Spanish club's basketball players tested positive for the virus.
If the Premier League does decide to play on, Liverpool could be crowned champions on Monday.
If second placed City lose to Burnley, then Liverpool will win the title for the first time in 30 years if they beat Everton in the Merseyside derby at Goodison Park.
Liverpool have lost four of their last six games in all competitions and crashed out of the Champions League on Wednesday.
Now they must wait to discover if they will be allowed to return to action any time soon.

,Mar 13 2020,nCov,"NBA: Coronavirus shutdown likely to be 'at least 30 days,' commissioner says",Agence France-Presse,"

NBA commissioner Adam Silver said Thursday the league shut-down because of the coronavirus pandemic is likely to last ""at least 30 days"".
That would see the league shuttered through what would have been about the last month of its regular season.
""What we determined today is that this hiatus will be, most likely, at least 30 days,"" Silver said on TNT's “Inside The NBA"" program.
The NBA suspended play on Wednesday after Utah Jazz center Rudy Gobert tested positive for COVID-19.
A second Jazz player, Donovan Mitchell, has reportedly also tested positive.
The regular season was scheduled to end on April 15 with the playoffs to begin on April 18.
Silver offered no indication of whether the league was considering shortening either the regular season or the playoffs, and indeed said it was hard to know at this point what the options might be.
Once the 30 days is up, he said, ""the question becomes is there a protocol, frankly, with or without fans, where we can resume play.""
Silver discussed the talks league officials, teams and players union representatives were having before Gobert's positive test about contingency plans in the face of increased coronavirus incidence in the United States.
""Up to a few days ago or even yesterday, the experts were unclear as to whether, as a public health matter, NBA arenas should be emptied,"" he said.
On Wednesday league officials spoke with teams to get their views about the possibility of playing games with no fans in the stands or taking ""some kind of hiatus.""
The decision ended up coming in dramatic style after Utah's game against the Thunder in Oklahoma City was called off just as it was due to start and fans cleared from the arena.
Shortly thereafter the NBA announced that a Jazz player had tested positive for COVID-19 and that games would be suspended from Thursday.
For the time being NBA players have reportedly been told to remain in their team's cities at least through Monday.
Group workouts and practice are not allowed, but team medical staff are in touch with players.
- Economic impact -
Joe Lacob, the Golden State Warriors owner who has a masters degree from the University of California at Los Angeles in public health said in an interview with The Athletic that the eventual economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the league is ""monumental.""
""We just lost virtually all of our revenues for the foreseeable future,"" Lacob said. ""But we have huge expenses that aren't going away. I feel for these part-time employees and local restaurants and Uber drivers and all of the service people that make their living in and around events like ours.
""So many small businesses in the city of San Francisco will be impacted by this series of events.""
While that is undoubtedly true, Silver said that in further talks among owners on Thursday ""not one team raised (the issue of) money.
""The entire discussion was about the safety and health of the players, the community around the NBA and our fans.""
What the league is trying to determine now he said, is ""what makes sense here, without compromising anyone's safety.
""I think it's too early to tell.""

,Mar 12 2020,nCov,Duterte’s foreign trips suspended due to COVID-19 threat: PSG,"Arianne Merez, ABS-CBN News","



MANILA - President Rodrigo Duterte’s foreign trips have been suspended as precautionary measure against the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the Presidential Security Group announced Thursday.
The suspension was based on the recommendation of the Department of Health (DOH), the PSG said on its Facebook page.
“For now, all of [President Duterte’s] foreign travels, especially to those countries with confirmed cases of COVID-19, have been suspended as recommended by the DOH,” it said.
Among the trips that could be affected by the suspension is the President’s supposed participation in the ASEAN Summit in Vietnam next month. 
Vietnam has 35 confirmed cases of COVID-19, latest data from the World Health Organization (WHO) showed.
Earlier, PSG troopers along with personnel of the PSG Station Hospital conducted the disinfection and decontamination of the Presidential palace halls as precautionary measure against the virus.

,Mar 12 2020,nCov,Robredo pushes for work-from-home amid COVID-19 spread,ABS-CBN News,"



MANILA (2nd UPDATE) - Vice President Leni Robredo on Thursday called on government to adopt work-from-home arrangements as cases of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the Philippines continued to rise.
""Sinabi na ng World Health Organization: May mga katangian ng isang pandemic ang pandaigdigang sitwasyon. Ibig sabihin, kumalat na ang virus sa iba’t ibang bansa,"" she said in a video that aired on her official Facebook page.
(The World Health Organization has characterized the situation as a global pandemic. This means the virus has spread in different countries.)
""Sa pagkakataong ito, kailangan kong idiin: Panahon nang ipatupad ang areglong work-from-home. Huwag na nating ipilit pumasok pa sa opisina ang ating mga empleyado, maliban na lang ang mga nakatutok sa pagpapaabot ng kaukulang serbisyo na maaaring umampat sa pagkalat ng virus,"" she added.
(At this point, I have to emphasize: It's time to implement the work-from-home arrangement. Let us not force workers to go to offices, except for those in the front-lines of response to the outbreak.)
If business operations must continue, Robredo suggests skeletal staffing to minimize person-to-person contact.
To stop the spread of the deadly virus, which has so far claimed nearly 4,300 lives worldwide, ""social distancing"" or avoiding public places and staying several feet away from other people must be practiced.
In her public address, the Vice President also urged the government to fast-track the procurement of testing kits that would help diagnose COVID-19 cases.
Front-line agencies must also offer aid to those affected by the pandemic and implement preventive measures in case the infection worsens, she said.
Robredo also called for calm and cautioned against panic-buying and hoarding amid contagion fears. Those exhibiting flu-like symptoms must observe self-quarantine while those exposed to possible carriers of the strain must seek medical care.
PROTECT THE VULNERABLE
As the novel coronavirus continues to spread, the Vice President stressed that the poor would be the most vulnerable against COVID-19.
""Alam po natin: Marami sa ating mga kababayan ang walang sapat na salapi para magpatingin sa mga pribadong ospital. Sa harap nito, dapat na ring tukuyin, italaga, at ipaalam sa publiko ang mga pampublikong ospital na kakayaning tumanggap ng mga may malalang sintomas,"" she said.
(We know that many of our fellow Filipinos don't have the financial resources to go to private hospitals. The government must identify and inform the public on what hospitals are allowed to accept patients suffering from symptoms.)
After reports swirled that a planned lockdown is being proposed in Metro Manila, Robredo believed it would only be effective if there is enough provision in communities, especially for the poor.
The Vice President also said she believed the Philippines, which is prone to calamities and crises, would be able to overcome.
""Mas malakas pa rin ang Pilipino sa COVID-19; kayang daigin ng ating pagkakaisa ang suliraning ito. Pilipino tayo, at sama-sama nating malalagpasan ito,"" she said.
(The Filipino people are stronger than COVID-19. We can overcome this if we stand together as one. We are Filipinos and we will surpass this together.)
As of Thursday, the Philippines has recorded 52 cases of COVID-19, which include 2 deaths.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared a global pandemic as the disease has infected more than 118,000 and killed nearly 4,300 in 114 countries and territories.

SAN FRANCISCO - Twitter has ordered all staff globally to work from home in an effort to stop the spread of the deadly new coronavirus epidemic.
The outbreak has spread across the world since emerging in central China late last year, killing more than 4,600 people, infecting over 126,000 and prompting a wave of travel restrictions. 
The social media platform had already announced a mandatory work from home policy for its staff in South Korea, Hong Kong and Japan earlier this month and suspended ""non-critical"" business travel and events in February.
""We are moving beyond our earlier guidance... and have now informed all employees globally they must work from home,"" Twitter human resources chief Jennifer Christie said in a blog post late Wednesday.

BANGKOK - Thai officials played down the possibility of ""super spreading"" of the coronavirus on Thursday as they reported a group of friends were responsible for the biggest daily rise in the country's cases since the outbreak began.
Officials reported 11 new cases, taking the national tally to 70. One person has died.
The new patients are a group of friends who appeared to pass the virus to each other after one of their number was first infected by a tourist who has since returned to Hong Kong, officials said.
The male and female friends, all Thai nationals aged in their 20s and 30s, socialized and shared drinks and cigarettes on 2 occasions in late February.
""The first patient was infected from a tourist from a dangerous communicable disease area,"" Suwannachai Wattanayingcharoenchai, director-general of the Disease Control Department, told reporters. ""After that, the person had 2 social activities with close friends.""
Officials stressed the foreign source of the group infection and announced they were stepping up travel restrictions for visitors from a list of ""designated dangerous communicable disease areas"" announced last week. Those include South Korea, China, Macau, Hong Kong, Italy and Iran.
""Visitors from the 6 places will need to present medical certificates before they can obtain boarding passes. They must be prepared for a full state quarantine when they arrive,"" said Sukhum Kanchanapimai, the health ministry's permanent secretary.
It was not immediately clear where the state quarantine will take place or when it will begin.

Dr. Raul Destura presents a sample of the locally-developed COVID-19 test kit from the UP-National Institutes of Health during a press briefing on COVID-19 at the Philippine Genome Center in Quezon City on Thursday.


MANILA - A test kit developed by Filipino scientists for the detection of the new strain of coronavirus will have to undergo field validation first before it is allowed for commercial use, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said Thursday.
Around 500 tests using the SARS CoV-2 PCR detection kit developed by the University of the Philippines-National Institutes of Health (UP-NIH) will have to be conducted to ensure its safety and efficacy, said FDA director general Eric Domingo.
To monitor the quality of the results, a parallel test using the gene sequencing technology at the Philippine Genome Center will also be conducted, he added.

UP-developed coronavirus testing kit gets gov't green light

The state regulator earlier issued a certificate of exemption to the test kit, also funded by the Department of Science and Technology (DOST), for field testing due to the increasing cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
""Hindi pa aprubado for commercial use. Hindi pa po ito puwede ibenta sa mga private laboratories,"" Domingo told radio DZMM.
(It's not yet approved for commercial use. It's not yet allowed to be sold to private laboratories.)
If results from the test kit will be satisfactory, it can apply for a certificate of product registration for wide distribution, he said.
The World Health Organization (WHO) can validate the efficacy of the test kits, but it will take some 3 months.
But Domingo said, ""Hindi naman requirement ng ating bansa ang validation from the WHO... Kung 'yun ang hihintayin natin, walang makakapasok na test kit sa atin.""
(The WHO validation is not required in our country... If we will wait for it, no test kit can come in.)

Dr. Raul Destura of the UP-NHI's Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology said the test kit could release results in less than 2 hours using a ""multiplex technology,"" which simultaneously detects the strain of coronavirus and its specificity.
He said they developed the test kit for several few weeks after China, where the outbreak originated, released the full sequence of the novel coronavirus.
""It took us around 21 days to put the entire assay, and several weeks for revalidation sa laboratory performance as required by the WHO,"" the infectious disease specialist told radio DZMM in a separate interview.
Destura, also president and chief executive officer of private research firm Manila Healthtek, Inc., said the test kits could be rolled out to the public in the next few weeks if approved by FDA.
The analytical specificity of the test kit, which refers to its ability to identify specific substance, is 100 percent, he said.

PHILHEALTH COVID-19 PACKAGES
The state health insurance agency is also offering ""isolation package"" and ""referral package"" for its members and dependents with possible symptoms of the coronavirus.
Dr. Shirley Domingo, vice president of PhilHealth's Corporate Affairs Group, said patients placed under observation for suspected coronavirus or those under ""isolation package"" are entitled to P14,000.
Those referred to hospitals capable of performing quarantine procedures and manage infectious diseases or those under ""referral package"" are entitled to P4,000.
Meanwhile, patients exhibiting moderate pneumonia due to COVID-19 are entitled to P15,000 while those with severe pneumonia are entitled to P32,000, Domingo added.
Covered by the package are those admitted starting Jan. 31.
The No Balance Billing (NBB) policy, which enables the vulnerable sectors of the program such as the poor and the elderly to pay no more in excess of their PhilHealth coverage when confined in government facilities, will be applied to COVID-19 claims.
COVID-19 may be fatal for the elderly, the immunocompromised, and those with underlying medical condition but 80 percent of cases globally showed a high chance of recovery ""without needing special treatment,"" according to the World Health Organization. 
WHO said COVID-19 symptoms include fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. The new respiratory disease has left 3,800 dead and affected 110,000 worldwide. 
PhilHealth urged the public to exercise frequent handwashing and other hygienic measures.

MANILA (UPDATE) - Marikina City has 4 new confirmed cases of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), Mayor Marcelino Teodoro said Wednesday.
The patients are part of the country's 33 positive cases of the fast-spreading disease announced by health authorities on Tuesday.

Oops! DOH reports COVID-19 cases at 35, later corrects figure to 33

Teodoro said the patients were infected by an 86-year-old American citizen, the country's 9th case of COVID-19.
Among those sickened is the American's 82-year-old wife and his 2 relatives, both 69. They were diagnosed with the disease on March 10.
The American citizen, a Filipino who served in the US military, returned from San Diego, California on Feb. 19 but had a layover in South Korea.
He then exhibited symptoms of pneumonia, including cough and shortness of breath, and was hospitalized on March 6. He tested positive of COVID-19 on March 9.
He is currently in critical condition due to his advanced age, Teodoro said.
""We suspect he's already infected with the disease while returning to the Philippines,"" the mayor added.
Four other household members, who are asymptomatic, are currently quarantined in their home in Marikina.
As authorities scramble to arrest the spread of the virus, Marikina City is mulling creating a quarantine facility with the supervision of the Department of Health (DOH), Teodoro said.
Those suspected of carrying the new strain of the coronavirus can only be confined at the Amang Rodriguez Memorial Medical Center, the city's only medical facility with isolation area.
The city government also plans to procure testing kits and continue disinfecting public places, such as terminals and shopping malls, Teodoro added.

Palarong Pambansa postponed due to COVID-19 threat

Public activities, such as the Palarong Pambansa 2020, are also postponed due to the COVID-19 epidemic.
Government employees and residents are also restricted from traveling to coronavirus-affected countries, such as China, South Korea and Italy.

Major American universities -- including Harvard, Princeton and Columbia -- have been forced to cancel classes because of the coronavirus and move lessons online, affecting tens of thousands of students.
The US government has refrained from imposing an official ban so the often privately run institutions are each grappling with how best to deal with the fast-moving outbreak.
Ahead of the start of spring break at the end of this week, Harvard on Tuesday announced it would transition to having all classes online by Monday 23 March.
The university, located in Cambridge, Massachusetts, asked its 36,000 graduate and undergraduate students not to return to campus after the spring recess and to continue studying remotely ""until further notice.""
""The goal of these changes is to minimize the need to gather in large groups,"" Harvard president Lawrence Bacow said in a statement posted on the university's website.
Without going quite so far, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), also based in Cambridge, canceled all gatherings likely to attract at least 150 people until May 15.
Classes with 150 or more students will move online, starting this week, it added.
In New York, Columbia, New York University and Fordham have all announced that they are switching to remote learning.
Princeton University in New Jersey said it would move all lectures and seminars online from March 23 to at least April 5, as it cancelled events of more than 100 people.
On the other side of the country, in California, at least five universities, including Berkeley and Stanford, have suspended all or most of their in-person classes.
A spokesperson for the American Council of Education (ACE) said it was ""impossible to say"" how many schools and students had been affected because ""the situation changes all the time.""
ACE president Ted Mitchell told the Los Angeles Times the coronavirus was ""probably the greatest short-term challenge facing higher education in a generation.""

Medialdea said he will complete the quarantine period, while Tugade will ""take precautionary measures seriously while working for the benefit of the country,"" according to Transportation spokesperson Goddess Libiran.
Budget Secretary Wendel Avisado, who was not present at the March 5 event, also opted to go on self-quarantine following contact with Dominguez during an economic cluster development meeting of the Cabinet on March 10.

Armed Forces of the Philippines personnel who will be augmenting the Philippine National Police at quarantine checkpoints traveled along NLEX and Valenzuela as part of their deployment to key entry and exit points around Metro Manila on Sunday.
Some 2,500 military troops have been designated to help man the checkpoints, said Brig. Gen. Alex Luna, commander of the Joint Task Force National Capital Region (JTF-NCR). 
They, however, will not all go out together, as only about 1,000 will be initially deployed, with the rest poised to replace them after a full day’s work, and others as reserve forces. 
Before riding their vehicles, Luna spoke to the soldiers and reminded them how different this was from the conventional wars they are used to fighting. 
In battle, Luna said, sometimes troops who are slightly wounded but still want to fight are permitted to return to the frontlines. This time, any soldier that shows signs of infection or illness will be pulled from deployment, and his entire squad will be placed on quarantine.

The Philippine Navy will augment law enforcers along sea lanes and seaports, the Philippine Air Force will assist in manning airports and helipads, while the Philippine Army will help man major thoroughfares.
The AFP will be at checkpoints in the NLEX, the SLEX, the Cavitex, Ortigas leading to Cainta, and MacArthur Highway leading to CAMANAVA.
Luna said at any given inspection of buses, two inspectors with thermal scanners will board to make it faster to check for proper identification and temperatures. 
Security will stay outside the vehicle in case of untoward incidents. Frontliners will wear protective masks at all times. The fastest the AFP can clear a bus is 3 to 5 minutes, according to Luna.
Anyone found unauthorized to enter or exit Metro Manila will be asked to alight from the vehicle. The unauthorized person will be sent back, the sick will be picked up by ambulances on standby to take them to designated health facilities.
Luna clarified that unauthorized persons will not be arrested but merely restrained. Someone at the checkpoints will explain to them why they can no longer proceed, before they are sent back. 
These are AFP protocols, which they have sent to the PNP for reference.

MANILA - Justice Secretary Menardo Guevarra said Saturday no person could be arrested for simply trying to enter Metro Manila during the month-long quarantine after authorities warned it would arrest community quarantine violators.
“No, just being physically prevented from entering or exiting,” he told reporters in a message when asked if police can arrest anyone who defies the suspension of land, domestic sea and domestic air travel to and from the National Capital Region (NCR).
“But if the person assaults the law enforcement agent, or slanders him, or bribes him, then that's cause for a warrantless arrest,” he explained.

“Depende 'yan sa local ordinance of the city concerned. Kung walang ordinance, no arrests (as in detention) can be made,” he said.
(It depends on the local ordinance of the city concerned. If there’s no ordinance, no arrests (as in detention) can be made.)
Aside from imposing a curfew, the Metro Manila Council also suggested closing malls temporarily, except supermarkets, pharmacies and other establishments offering essential services.
Guevarra dispelled concerns that the country was under martial law.
“We are not in a state of martial law. We are fighting a common but relatively unknown enemy, a dangerous and lethal virus known as COVID-19. The PNP, assisted by the AFP, will be on the streets not to sow fear but to protect us,” he said.

SYDNEY - Australia's elderly were let in early to supermarkets on Tuesday but there were still scenes of coronavirus panic buying in some areas, with reports of empty shelves and large queues. 
After rushes on groceries, the country's biggest supermarket chain opened exclusively for elderly and disabled shoppers for an hour in an attempt to let them purchase essentials like toilet paper -- which has repeatedly sold out and sparked several violent incidents. 
But the move prompted long queues outside several stores in Sydney and Melbourne, with reports of shoppers leaving empty-handed.
""It's day 1 of our dedicated shopping hour and we know it wasn't perfect across all of our stores,"" Woolworths Supermarkets Managing Director Claire Peters said in a statement. 
Supermarkets would learn from today and continue the early hour shopping through the week, Peters said. 
Despite security guards blocking younger shoppers from entering stores, unprecedented demand still led to many items disappearing. 
At Woolworth's Neutral Bay store in Sydney's north shopper sentiment about the move was mixed. 
""It is important but I don't think it is the best way. The best way, I think must be delivery at home because you look at a 93-year-old coming shopping, it's better to do delivery,"" 71-year-old Irie Voico told AFP as he waited for the store to open. 
Another customer, who didn't want to be identified, said he was worried about bringing all the elderly together in a group where coronavirus could easily spread. 
But several welcomed the move, saying the mood was good among those older shoppers turning out early to avoid chaotic scenes. 
""This morning was well managed, full marks to Woolworths. Everyone was well mannered in there,"" 75-year-old Max Hill said. 
Robyn Swan, 73, said the mood at the store yesterday had been frantic when shelves were bare but today they had been restocked. 
""I've got what I wanted. I'm trying not to do the frantic shopping but I can see it's easy to do but I live on my own so I don't need to panic like my children with their grandchildren,"" Swan said. 
Australia has nearly 400 confirmed cases of coronavirus so far, with 5 fatalities.

""I know this is an abrupt move but I am appealing to the public to understand the drastic measures that we are implementing as of the moment,"" she said in a statement.
The city has yet to record a single positive novel coronavirus patient, but is taking a precautionary measure to prevent the spread of the virus.
Entry points will be temporarily closed until it is deemed safe to reopen, Guiani-Sayadi added.
The city on Monday also implemented a community quarantine to prevent possible carriers of COVID-19 from entering southwestern Mindanao's economic center.

MANILA - A city-wide community quarantine took effect Sunday in San Jose del Monte, Bulacan, city officials announced.
The quarantine was a response to a Department of Health confirmation on the same day that a second person from the city has contracted COVID-19.
According to the San Jose del Monte health office, the two patients are at hospitals in Metro Manila. Contact tracing and hygiene protocols were also activated to contain the spread of the virus.
During the quarantine, classes will be suspended and mass gatherings will not be allowed.
Quarantine checkpoints have been put up in the following areas:

MANILA - Coronavirus infections in the Philippines may subside in June, a health expert said Wednesday, as cases of local transmission continue to rise rapidly.
""In my estimate, it may only slow down by May or June,"" said Dr. Rontgene Solante, head of adult infectious diseases in San Lazaro Hospital.
As Luzon entered its third week of the enhanced community quarantine, where more than 50 million people have been ordered to stay home, coronavirus transmissions should have slowed down by now, he told radio DZMM.
""Why is it until now we're getting new cases? It's already [past] 14 days. The incubation period of the virus is 14 days. When the lockdown was imposed, there should be no transmission anymore,"" Solante said in Filipino.
""Is it a failure of the lockdown or we had inadequate lockdown procedures that we didn't foresee?"" he added.

Tracking COVID-19 cases in the Philippines

To date, the number of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infections in the Philippines has risen to 2,311. 
The total figure includes 29 deaths and 50 people who recovered from the disease, which originated last year in the Chinese metropolis of Wuhan.
The Philippines on Tuesday saw its biggest increase in coronavirus infections with 538 new cases, which health officials attributed to increased testing.
During the interview, Solante stressed the importance of the lockdown, saying it is an effective way to stem the virus spread.
""If we didn't have a lockdown, we could have become like the US. We might not only have more than 2,000 cases. It could have doubled or tripled right now,"" he said.
The highly contagious virus has sickened more than 163,000 people and killed 2,800 others in the US, latest data from the World Health Organization (WHO) showed.
As scientists scramble to develop a vaccine against the disease, Solante said they are treating some COVID-19 patients with a combination of anti-malarial drugs hydroxychloroquine and the antibiotic azithromycin.
""It's part of our standard treatment guidelines. But there are only specific patients who qualify for the criteria... Generally, the outcome has been good based on our assessment,"" he said.
And amid public clamor for mass testing to fast-track the screening of possible COVID-19 carriers, Solante said the government should focus instead of conducting selective tests.
""I don't totally agree with the mass testing. First, if we have to conduct mass testing, there should be an infrastructure in place,"" he said.
Solante added, ""Instead, we make selective tests and prioritize those highly vulnerable, including health care workers.""

MANILA (UPDATE) -- A furious President Duterte on Wednesday night issued a stern warning to leftist groups looking to stir public sentiment against the government during the COVID-19 crisis.
Duterte, in a surprise televised address, said that he would not hesitate to have these leftists arrested or even shot and killed by the military or police.
“Huwag ninyong gamitin ang pwersa. I am addressing the left na ‘yung pambabastos ninyo ‘yung slamming about the distribution. Remember kayong mga left: You are not the government. Naintindihan ninyo ‘yan? Hindi kayo nasa gobyerno and you cannot be a part of what we are planning to do for the nation,” Duterte said.
“Intindihin ninyo ‘yan. Kaya huwag kayong mag gawa ng kalokohan at mag-riot-riot diyan because I will order you detained at bibitawan ko kayo pagkatapos na wala na itong COVID.”
The President’s statements came just hours after a protest rally by a group of Quezon City residents from Sitio San Roque along EDSA was dispersed by authorities for violating the enhanced community quarantine.

Police said the leftist group Kadamay was responsible for instigating the protesters by spreading false information.

“Huwag ninyo akong takutin ng gulo-gulo kasi kung gusto talaga ninyo ng gulo, guguluhin natin ang bayan natin tutal wala pa namang pagkain. Kung gusto ninyo nung barilan, eh ‘di sige. Gusto ninyo ng pukpukan, sige. I will not hesitate,” Duterte said.
 
“My orders are sa pulis pati military, pati mga barangay na pagka ginulo at nagkaroon ng okasyon na lumaban at ang buhay ninyo ay nalagay sa alanganin, shoot them dead. Naintindihan ninyo? Patay. Eh kaysa mag-gulo kayo diyan, eh ‘di ilibing ko na kayo. Ah ‘yung libing, akin ‘yan. Huwag ninyo subukan ang gobyerno kasi itong gobyerno na ito hindi inutil,” he continued.
In his speech, Duterte urged the public to be patient and wait for government assistance.
“Ang pera, dadating. Ang pagkain dadating, huwag lang kayong magulo para smooth --- sa Bisaya pa, hapsay. Ayaw og hadloka ang gobyerno. Do not intimidate government. Do not challenge government. Matatalo kayo, sigurado,” he said.
 
“Magtiis na lang siguro kayo ng delayed delivery pero dadating ‘yan at hindi ka magugutom. Hindi ka mamamatay sa gutom.”
'TULONG HINDI KULONG'
Responding to Duterte's pronouncements, Bagong Alyansang Makabayan (Bayan) slammed the President, saying problems related to the lockdown and COVID-19 pandemic are not solved by force.
""The President should learn by now that problems are not solved by shooting people or ordering them arrested. There is a problem with hunger, delayed delivery of aid, and lack of health services,"" Bayan secretary-general Renato Reyes said in a statement.
He said the protesters arrested in Quezon City were not members of any leftist groups, but they took to the streets due to hunger.
""Rather than make threats, the President should just deliver the aid sought by the people. #TulongHindiKulong is the people's cry,"" Reyes added.
The wife of one those arrested earlier told ABS-CBN News they were asking for support after her husband lost her job because of the lockdown.
""Nakiusap po kami sir kasi itong asawa ko humihingi lang po ng pagkain. Eh may sakit anak ko so wala po kaming kapera-pera,"" she said.

MANILA - Negros Oriental will undergo an enhanced community quarantine starting April 3 to halt the spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the provincial government said Wednesday.
Negros Oriental Governor Roel Degamo on Tuesday signed an executive order placing the entire province, home to nearly a million people, under lockdown until April 18.
The provincial government ordered its residents to stay at home, will limit business operations of establishments, suspend public transit, and restrict land and sea travel, among others.
Essential services providers such as medical practitioners, authorized government workers, accredited press members, truck drivers and farmers, among others, are exempted from the lockdown. 
The province has so far recorded 4 coronavirus infections, with 2 deaths. Local health authorities are also keeping an eye on 309 patients under investigation (PUIs) and 6,342 persons under monitoring (PUMs). 
As of Wednesday, the number of COVID-19 cases in the Philippines has risen to 2,311. Of the number, 96 have died while 50 have recovered from the fast-spreading disease.

MADRID - The coronavirus pandemic has claimed more than 30,000 lives in Europe alone, a global tally showed Wednesday, in what the head of the United Nations has described as humanity's worst crisis since World War II.
Italy and Spain bore the brunt of the crisis, accounting for 3 in every 4 deaths on the continent, as the grim tally hit another milestone even though half of the planet's population is already under some form of lockdown in a battle to halt contagion.
Spain reported a record 864 deaths in 24 hours, pushing the country's number of fatalities past 9,000.
The toll is only dwarfed by Italy's, where the virus has killed nearly 12,500 people.

Spain death toll hits 9,053 as coronavirus cases pass 100,000

Since emerging in China in December, COVID-19 has spread across the globe, claiming over 43,000 lives and infecting more than 860,000 people, according to an AFP tally.
President Donald Trump has warned of a ""very, very painful 2 weeks"" as the United States registered its deadliest 24 hours of what he called a ""plague.""
In a scramble to halt the contagion, governments have shut schools, most shops, and ordered millions of people to work from home.
Cancellations of key events on the global calendar have swept both the sports and cultural worlds, with the Edinburgh arts festival the latest to be scrapped. 
For UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, the extraordinary upheaval spurred by the virus presents a real danger to the relative peace the world has seen over the last few decades.
The disease ""represents a threat to everybody in the world and... an economic impact that will bring a recession that probably has no parallel in the recent past,"" he said.
""The combination of the 2 facts and the risk that it contributes to enhanced instability, enhanced unrest, and enhanced conflict are things that make us believe that this is the most challenging crisis we have faced since the Second World War.""
ECONOMIC DESPERATION
With most business activity grinding to a halt for an undetermined period of time, scenes of economic desperation and unrest were emerging across the globe.
In Italy, queues were lengthening at soup kitchens while some supermarkets were reportedly pillaged.
Half a million more people now need help to afford meals, Italy's biggest union for the agriculture sector Coldiretti said, adding to the 2.7 million already in need last year.
""Usually we serve 152,525 people. But now we've 70,000 more requests,"" confirmed Roberto Tuorto, who runs a food aid association.
It was crucial to ""ensure that the economic crisis unleashed by the virus doesn't become a security crisis,"" he warned.
The economic pain of lockdowns is especially acute in poorer nations. 
In Tunisia, several hundred protested a week-old lockdown that has disproportionately hit the poor.
""Never mind coronavirus, we're going to die anyway! Let us work!"" shouted one protester in the demonstration on the outskirts of the capital Tunis.
Africa's biggest city Lagos was just into its second full day of lockdown on Wednesday -- but with some of the world's biggest slums, home to millions who live hand-to-mouth, containment will be a challenge.
SHARPENING TONE
Wary of a collapse of the world's economy, the globe's leading central bankers have pumped billions of liquidity into the system.
Last week, G20 leaders in turn said they were injecting $5 trillion into the global economy to head off a feared deep recession.
But with the spread of the virus far from abating, stock markets fell again in Asia and Europe on Wednesday.
In the European Union, the terms of a rescue plan threatened to divide the bloc.
Worst-hit Italy and Spain are leading a push for a shared debt instrument -- dubbed ""coronabonds,"" but talk of shared debt is a red line for Germany and other northern countries.
The tone sharpened this week, with some Italian politicians even taking out an advertisement in a major German newspaper to remind Europe's biggest economy of WWII debts to jolt it into action. 
ASYMPTOMATIC CASES
The economic cost of the crisis was still piling up as lockdowns remain at the forefront of official disease-stopping arsenals -- a strategy increasingly borne out by science.
Researchers said China's decision to shutter Wuhan, ground zero for the pandemic, may have prevented hundreds of thousands of new cases.
""Our analysis suggests that without the Wuhan travel ban and the national emergency response there would have been more than 700,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases outside of Wuhan"" by mid February, said Oxford University's Christopher Dye.
At the same time, focus is now turning to how asymptomatic cases may be fueling the spread.

China reports 1,300 asymptomatic virus cases after public concern

China on Wednesday said it has more than 1,300 asymptomatic coronavirus cases, the first time it has released such data following public concern over people who have tested positive but are not showing symptoms.
Experts agree that asymptomatic patients are likely to be infectious, but it remains unknown how responsible they are for spreading the deadly virus.
Chinese respiratory expert Zhong Nanshan said in a state media interview last week that asymptomatic carriers could potentially infect ""3 to 3.5 people each.""
Germany and France were also ramping up testing of the population to establish how many already have immunity. 
PAINFUL CHOICES
For now, the focus of the health sector in the hardest hit countries remains the scramble for available facilities to treat patients.
Emergency hospitals are popping up in event spaces while distressed medical staff make grim decisions about how to distribute limited protective gear, beds and life-saving respirators.

US virus deaths pass 4,000: Johns Hopkins

In scenes unimaginable in peacetime, around a dozen white tents were erected to serve as a field hospital in New York's Central Park. 
But even with the extended capacity, doctors say they are still having to make painful choices.
""If you get a surge of patients coming in, and you only have a limited number of ventilators, you can't necessarily ventilate patients,"" Shamit Patel of the Beth Israel hospital said. 
""And then you have to start picking and choosing.""

MANILA - The first case of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) in Eastern Visayas has been discharged from hospital after recovering from the disease, local authorities said Wednesday.
The 51-year-old woman who hails from Catarman, Northern Samar has been given a clean bill of health. 
As a precautionary measure, she was ordered to undergo a 14-day home-quarantine.
Local authorities said the patient was released from a referral hospital in Tacloban City on Wednesday.
The woman was confirmed to have contracted the virus on March 23 and was confined in the hospital for 20 days.
Doctors and nurses at the hospital made a banner for the patient congratulating her for surviving the disease.
""Godspeed to our 1st COVID-19 recovered patient in Region 8. Wishing you good health and a long life,"" the banner read.
As of April 1, the region has 1 admitted COVID-19 patient and 400 patients under investigation (PUIs). 
The Philippines has so far recorded 2,311 coronavirus infections, latest data from the health ministry showed. The total figure includes 96 fatalities and 50 people who recovered from the disease.

MADRID - The coronavirus death toll in Spain surged over 9,000 on Wednesday after a record 864 deaths in 24 hours, with the number of confirmed cases passing the 100,000 mark, the government said. 
Spain has the world's second-highest death toll after Italy, with the virus so far claiming 9,053 lives and the number of confirmed cases reaching 102,136.
But on a day-to-day basis, the rate of new infections continued its downward trend, showing an increase of just over 8 percent, compared with nearly 11 percent on Tuesday, health ministry figures showed. 
And the death rate has also slowed, from 27 percent a week ago to 10.5 percent on Wednesday, with officials saying the data appear to show the epidemic is reaching its peak. 
But officials have warned that even if the epidemic is peaking, the pressure on the intensive care system would be subject to a lag of at least a week or longer, with hospitals likely to reach crisis point by the end of this week or early next.
Madrid remains the worst-hit region, with 3,865 deaths and nearly 30,000 cases, leaving hospitals and mortuaries overwhelmed.

BEIJING - China on Wednesday said it has more than 1,300 asymptomatic coronavirus cases, the first time it has released such data following public concern over people who have tested positive but are not showing symptoms.
Health officials also reported the first imported case from abroad in Wuhan -- the epicenter where the virus first emerged late last year -- heightening fears of infections being brought into China from other countries.
Of 36 new cases reported Wednesday, 35 were imported from abroad.
The National Health Commission (NHC) said 1,367 asymptomatic patients were under medical observation, with 130 new cases newly added in the last day.
The NHC announced Tuesday that it would respond ""to public concerns"" by starting to publish daily data on asymptomatic cases, which it said were infectious.
There were mass online calls for the government to reveal the number of asymptomatic cases after authorities revealed over the weekend that an infected woman in Henan province had been in close contact with 3 asymptomatic cases. 
However, asymptomatic cases are not being added to the official tally unless they later show clinical symptoms.
Historical data on those infected without showing symptoms has not been published.
Beijing has announced a series of dramatic measures to curb arrivals into the country and control imported cases -- including a ban on foreigners entering China and testing those arriving from overseas -- making it easier to determine those who are infected but don't show symptoms.
China says all detected asymptomatic cases and their close contacts must undergo 14-day centralized quarantine.
Experts agree that asymptomatic patients are likely to be infectious, but it remains unknown how responsible they are for spreading the deadly virus.
Chinese respiratory expert Zhong Nanshan said in a state media interview last week that asymptomatic carriers could potentially infect ""3 to 3.5 people each.""
Many other countries including South Korea and Japan count asymptomatic cases in their national tallies of confirmed diagnoses.
There have now been 81,554 infections in China, with 3,312 deaths -- mostly concentrated in the epicenter of Wuhan and surrounding Hubei province.
The first imported case confirmed in Wuhan, a Chinese national studying in Britain, arrived in the city last week as it starts to gradually lift travel restrictions imposed to control the outbreak.

MANILA - The Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth) said Wednesday it will continue to cover the cost of treatment for all patients with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) until April 14, 2020.
In a statement, Philhealth explained they set a deadline for the shouldering of costs ""due to the novelty and the wide range of severity"" of COVID-19 case in the country for ""which no existing case rate or package based on accepted protocols hast yet been established.""
""Philhealth is confident that by the above-mentioned date, more about the behavior of the disease in the Philippine can be learned, a final protocol established and an appropriate case rate developed that will provide adequacy and sustainability to the anti-COVID-19 campaign,"" it said.
The state health insurance agency added it will issue a new set of guidelines ""which will include the appropriate case rate and protocol"" in addressing COVID-19.
""Philhealth wished to assure Filipinos that even under the period of this pandemic, it intends to fulfill its mandate under the Universal Health Care Law of providing adequate health service to all Filipinos when needed,"" it said.
Philhealth earlier said it was offering ""isolation package"" and ""referral package"" for its members and dependents with possible symptoms of the coronavirus.
Dr. Shirley Domingo, vice president of PhilHealth's Corporate Affairs Group, said patients under observation for the coronavirus or those under ""isolation package"" are entitled to P14,000.
Those referred to hospitals capable of performing isolation procedures and manage infectious diseases or those under ""referral package"" are entitled to P4,000.
Patients exhibiting moderate pneumonia due to COVID-19 are entitled to P15,000 while those with severe pneumonia are entitled to P32,000, Domingo said.
Covered by the package are those admitted starting Jan. 31.
The No Balance Billing (NBB) policy, which enables the vulnerable sectors of the program such as the poor and the elderly to pay no more in excess of their PhilHealth coverage when confined in government facilities, will be applied to COVID-19 claims.

Fear, stress and money worries: coronavirus lockdown is hard for anyone, but athletes are facing extra mental health risks as they go from highly active lifestyles to isolation and boredom, experts warn.
While some housebound athletes have posted upbeat videos of themselves training or attempting internet challenges such as juggling toilet rolls, the stress caused by the extreme adjustment and uncertain future looks likely to take its toll.
Long-term effects on athletes after the SARS and swine flu outbreaks included anxiety, obsessive hand-washing and fear of getting too close to people, Carolyn Broderick, Tennis Australia's chief medical officer, told AFP.
But the impact of the current pandemic is unprecedented, with athletes sidelined worldwide after COVID-19 forced most sports into hibernation and put billions of people in lockdown.
Those affected range from well-paid superstars such as tennis's Serena Williams, who has suffered from depression in the past, to journeyman pros and Olympic hopefuls whose lives have been thrown into turmoil.
Williams, 38, who only needs one more Grand Slam title to equal the all-time record of 24, admitted that social distancing because of coronavirus had left her feeling ""a ton of stress"".
""Every little thing makes me crazy. And by anxiety I mean I'm just on edge. Any time anyone sneezes around me or coughs I get crazy,"" she said on TikTok.
Even before the virus, a steady stream of people involved in sports -- often an insecure and high-stress profession -- have wrestled with depression, from Williams to Olympic swimming great Michael Phelps, MMA fighter Ronda Rousey, boxer Mike Tyson and All Blacks rugby player John Kirwan.
- 'I'm struggling' -
The athletes currently out of action include thousands of would-be Olympians, many of whom have put careers on hold to chase medal dreams but now face extra disruption after the Tokyo 2020 Games were postponed for a year.
""I would be lying if I said I was all right. Just like most people I'm struggling in my own ways,"" Olympics-bound American weightlifter Kate Nye, who has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, told America's WOODTV.com.
Concerns have also been raised about Australia's swimmers and cricketers, after athletes in both sports suffered well-documented psychological problems in the past.
""The mental health thing, we talked about it in a conference call this week,"" said Australian men's cricket coach Justin Langer.
""Particularly for any of our staff or players who are home alone basically. We have to keep an eye on those guys and girls to make sure they're OK.""
Broderick, who was deputy medical director for Australia's 2016 Olympics team, and sits on an advisory panel for the National Rugby League, said the effects of isolation can be felt more acutely by athletes.
""They have all the same psychological issues that everyone does but also the stress and anxiety about their futures that they cannot easily control,"" she said.
""They don't know what the next stage is going to be or how long they're going to have to quarantine or isolate for.""
Many sports bodies have reacted by offering support to athletes. However, some sports are making cuts to avoid going bust, reducing their ability to help.
Substance abuse, such as drinking or using drugs, is one tell-tale sign of problems, Broderick said.
""Stress and anxiety can manifest in substance abuse. That's what I'd look out for, if they're using alcohol as a support,"" she said.
""There has certainly been some anxiety,"" added Broderick, who said Australia's tennis players receive regular communications and can call on medical support.
""The high-level, high-profile professional athletes can handle this loss of income but there are a lot of athletes on the fringe,"" she said.
""If you have a few months of loss of activity there's a significant loss of income as well.""
She recommended athletes stick to routines, focus on what can be controlled and use their extra time for a hobby or online training to maintain their mental health.

MANILA - The Philippine government has so far conducted more than 15,300 tests for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the Department of Health (DOH) said Tuesday, amid criticism of the slow rollout of testing for the highly-infectious virus.
Of the number, some 2,388 tested positive, which include 300 repeat tests, Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said in a press briefing.
Some 11,129 tests turned out negative while 1,820 were found out equivocal or have to undergo repeat tests to ascertain their diagnosis.
Latest data from DOH showed that the Philippines is still capable of conducting 89,969 tests, wherein the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) accounts nearly half of it.
The RITM still has 42,000 remaining tests; Baguio General Hospital and Medical Center in Cordillera Administrative Region has 4,937; San Lazaro Hospital in National Capital Region (NCR) has 4,932; Vicente Sotto Memorial Medical Center in Central Visayas has 24,396; UP National Institutes of Health in NCR has 4,861; Western Visayas Medical Center in Western Visayas has 4,843; and Southern Philippines Medical Center in Davao Region has 4,000.

Philippines' COVID-19 cases climb past 2,000 mark

The Philippines on Tuesday confirmed 538 new coronavirus infections, its biggest one-day jump since the outbreak began, raising the country's total to 2,084.
The tally includes 88 people who died from the disease while 49 others have recovered.
To fast-track the screening of the COVID-19 cases, the health department said the RITM could now run up to a thousand tests a day and had shorten the turnaround time for the test results.
Other accredited laboratories can administer a total of 200 tests a day.

RITM can now run 1,000 tests daily; turnaround time shortened to 48-72 hours

As Luzon entered its third week of the enhanced community quarantine, a non-government organization slammed DOH's alleged slow response to the crisis.
""DOH should be taken to task for its failure to take charge of the fight against COVID-19,"" the Community Medicine Development Foundation said in a statement.
As COVID-19 cases continue to increase, the group said the DOH has only tested fewer than 3,000 individuals so far, which it said was ""extremely small"" for a country of 110 million people.
""Without testing, the current quarantine will be irrelevant and proper containment will be ineffective,"" the group said.
The Philippine capital region, home to about half of the country's 100 million people, is under lockdown until April 12.
The Community Medicine Development Foundation also said the DOH had failed to provide protective gears for frontline health workers fighting the COVID-19 pandemic.
""Simply put, the DOH is not doing enough,"" the group said.

MANILA - Frontline health workers who are experiencing mild symptoms will now be tested for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the Department of Health (DOH) said Tuesday.
The agency has amended its testing protocol to include healthcare workers, who are now considered part of the ""vulnerable population,"" Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said in a press briefing.
“Pangalagaan po natin ang ating healthcare workers. Kasama na po sila ngayon sa ating protocol kung sino ang puwedeng i-test,"" she said.
(Let's take care of our health care workers. They are now included in our testing protocol.)
This, after the DOH received calls from healthcare workers who were refused tests despite having symptoms and exposed to infected patients.
In its March 16 protocol, those eligible for testing were patients under investigation (PUIs) with mild symptoms who are elderly, with underlying condition, immuno-compromised, and admitted PUIs in severe and critical condition.

MANILA (UPDATE) - Interior Secretary Eduardo Año said Tuesday he tested positive for the novel coronavirus after being exposed to people infected with the disease.
So far, Año, 58, is the lone member of President Rodrigo Duterte's Cabinet who acquired the infectious disease.
Año said he received the result from the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) on Tuesday, 4 days after taking the test.
""Last March 26, 2020, after learning that 4 persons I had associated with tested positive for COVID-19, I started my 14 day self-quarantine,"" the retired military chief said in a statement.
""On March 27, I got tested. Today, March 31, I received the result from RITM informing me that I am positive for COVID-19,"" he added.
In announcing his condition to the public, Año called on ""all persons I had close contact with to go on self-quarantine and observe any symptoms, in accordance with DOH guidelines.""
The interior chief said he had not developed any symptoms and will continue to work from home.
""To all those concerned, I am doing fine,"" he said.
""The result of my test will not in any way dampen my spirit and energy to do my job.""
It was not immediately clear if Año is among the country's 2,084 confirmed COVID-19 cases, as of Tuesday.

Meanwhile, Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana, who was exposed to Año on March 21, said he has tested negative for COVID-19.
Both officials previously checked the arrival of medical supplies donated by China at the Villamor Air Base in Pasay City.
In a text message to ABS-CBN News, Lorenzana said he underwent a rapid test and a RITM-led test.
""Both negative. Thank God,"" he wrote, adding he will finish his self-quarantine until April 6.
Sought for comment, Sen. Christopher ""Bong"" Go, who was together with Año and Lorenzana on the same event, said he would also continue his self-quarantine.
The senator said he and President Rodrigo Duterte will not undergo a repeat test yet. Both earlier tested negative for the virus.
""'Di na muna,"" Go said.
Some Philippine senators also tested positive for the disease that originated in China.

MANILA - The Department of Health (DOH) said Tuesday nearly 1 million sets of personal protective equipment (PPEs) it procured for frontline health workers fighting the novel coronavirus would start arriving in April.
Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said the first batch of protective gears numbering to 200,000 would arrive in the country between April 1 to 6.
The remaining 700,000 PPEs will arrive between April 6 to 24, she said in an online press briefing.
Vergeire also said that the DOH had distributed medical supplies and PPEs to 14 hospitals in the country. 
Among the beneficiaries are the Philippine Orthopedic Center, East Avenue Medical Center, Philippine General Hospital and Lung Center of the Philippines.
During the press briefing, Vergeire explained that purchasing the PPEs amounting to P1.8 billion underwent a procurement process from the Department of Budget and Management (DBM).
Asked why the PPEs bought by DOH cost P1,800 while the Office of the Vice President got theirs for P400 per set, she had this to say.
""Ang sinasabi lang ho natin, hindi pare-pareho ang mga PPEs na binibili ng ibang grupo at binibili ng Kagawaran ng Kalusugan,"" Vergeire said.
(What we are saying is that the PPEs bought by other groups and DOH are different.)
""Ang set na prinocure namin ay pinakacompleto. Ibig sabihin, meron po tayong 8 na mga PPE types sa loob ng set na sinasabi natin,"" she added.
(The set we procured is the most complete. Meaning it has 8 types of PPEs inside the set.)
These include an N95 mask, overalls, gloves, head cover, shoe cover, googles, surgical mask and surgical gown.
Two health facilities tapped by DOH as dedicated hospitals to COVID-19 cases previously said they were running short of protective gears.

MANILA - Four elderly men from Quezon City are among those who succumbed to complications from the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the health department said Tuesday.
All of the victims had hypertension, the Department of Health (DOH) said in its latest bulletin, as research showed those with pre-existing medical conditions appeared to be at greater risk of comtracting the illness.
Among the new fatalities was a 78-year-old man who died on March 25. He was confirmed to be positive with the novel coronavirus a day after his death.
Meanwhile, a 60-year-old man died on March 26, a day after he was diagnosed with COVID-19. Both had unknown travel history.
The 2 other fatalities had no recent travel history that could have them exposed to the highly-infectious disease, which originated in the Chinese metropolis of Wuhan in Hubei province.
A 72-year-old man died on March 29 while a 69-year-old man died on March 30, the DOH said.

MANILA (2nd UPDATE) - The number of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases in the Philippines soared to 2,084, the health department said Tuesday, as the country entered the third week of its Luzon-wide lockdown in a bid to contain the virus.
Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said 538 new cases were recorded, the largest single-day spike which she attributes to the increased testing capacity of the country, the continuing contact tracing of those who are possibly infected, and the inclusion of health care workers in the vulnerable population who need to be tested.
""Ito po ay dulot ng mas marami pang paglabas ng test results mula sa (Research Institute for Tropical Medicine) at mga subnational laboratories na operational na po mula nung isang linggo... Simula last week, may 60 pang ibang laboratoryo na nakakatulong sa pagsasagawa ng tests,"" Vergeire said.
(This is due to the release of more test results from RITM and subnational laboratories that have been operational since last week... Since last week, 60 more labs have been helping in conducting tests.)
She also reported 10 new fatalities, bringing the death toll to 88.
Eight of them -- 7 men and 1 woman -- are senior citizens with such underlying conditions as hypertension and diabetes.
Four of the new fatalities are from Quezon City, 2 are from Rizal province, and there were one each from Parañaque City, Manila, Caloocan City and San Juan City.
A total of 49 patients have so far recovered from the infectious disease that originated from China late last year, as seven more patients were added in the list.
Among the new recoveries is a 68-year-old Filipino-American man from Mandaluyong City who had traveled to Dubai in the United Arab Emirates, Jordan, Israel and Egypt.
Another patient who recovered -- a 39-year-old man from Abra -- also had a travel history in the UAE and Thailand.
The five others, who were from Rizal province, Quezon City, Makati City and Pasig, had no travel history.
Vergeire urged the public to continue staying at home, practice physical distancing, and frequently wash their hands as their contribution in curbing the coronavirus pandemic.
FILIPINOS ABROAD WITH COVID-19
Meanwhile, the Department of Foreign Affairs said cases of Filipinos abroad with COVID-19 have reached 368. A total of 242 of them are under treatment, while 117 others have recovered.
The remaining 9 succumbed to the disease.
Countries around the globe have imposed strict travel measures to arrest the spread of COVID-19, which has infected more than 693,000 worldwide, with over 33,000 deaths as of March 30, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).

SANTIAGO - Survivors from 2 dramatic rescues that captivated the world, the 2010 Chilean mine collapse and the 1972 Andes plane crash, gave their advice for how to survive a lockdown as the number of Latin American coronavirus cases soared past 10,000 Friday.
""Don't give up guys! A sense of humor is very important,"" said Mario Sepulveda, 1 of 33 Chilean miners who spent more than 2 months trapped nearly half a mile underground at the San Jose mine in northern Chile.
""Organize your homes! Make and stick to routines so as not to get bored. There are many things you can do!"" the upbeat Sepulveda told AFP.
""Let's do what we are told, it is super important,"" Sepulveda said about social distancing and hand-washing requirements. ""It's no longer a political problem, today it is simply a health problem.""
The miners spent 69 days trapped in the depths of the mine, in the Atacama desert 800 kilometers north of Santiago, before being brought to the surface.
""We were in a pretty critical situation. We had no way out, there was no way out of that situation,"" said Luis Urzua, shift manager when a rockfall cut him off and his team from the outside world on Aug. 5, 2010.
During their close-quarters confinement, Urzua said ""there was a lot of fellowship, a lot of conversation. We got to know some of the work that various other colleagues did in their different roles.""
""The other thing that helped us was prayer,"" he said.
""Not asking God to help us, but that people would have the strength and the will to persist in trying to find us,"" said Urzua, the last man to be brought to the surface on Oct. 13, 2010.
'UNSEEN ENEMY'
Carlos Paez was 1 of 16 survivors from a plane that crashed in the snow-clad Andes on Oct. 12, 1972 as it was taking a Uruguayan rugby team to a match in Chile.
Twelve people died in the crash, while 17 others succumbed over the next few weeks. Infamously, 16 people managed to survive in the extreme conditions by eating the bodies of the dead which had been preserved in the snow.
""There's a big difference in these 2 quarantines, if I can call them that. In the first one I experienced, it was 70 days in the Andes mountains but without any resources -- 25 degrees below zero, without food, without communication. And I was 18 years old,"" Paez told AFP.
The current situation is somewhat easier than his 10 weeks spent sheltering in the plane's fuselage, he said.
""The only thing to do is nothing at all! They send you to stay at home and wash your hands. And you have all the comforts: television, internet, food. So nothing to complain about,"" said Paez, now 66.
""In the cordillera we were fighting against a tangible enemy which was the mountains, the snow and the cold, and now we are fighting against an enemy that we cannot see, which is what generates uncertainty. 
""But I am fighting against arrogance. I try to be humble and obey. The message is clear: stay at home and wash your hands. Look how simple that is,"" said Paez. ""I try to be obedient because I want to live."" 
Roberto Canessa, 67, another survivor of the Andes crash, advises people to ""look for something to do, start a project.""
""That's what I did in the mountains. I worked all day so as not to think and not have anxiety or anguish,"" he told AFP.
These days, Canessa -- a cardiologist -- is working on a project to provide emergency mechanical respirators to Uruguayan hospitals to help them cope with an expected flood of coronavirus cases.
""Throughout the world there are no respirators available. Just as in the Andes, we have to depend on ourselves. We are not going to wait for helicopters to come or for someone to bring us respirators to Uruguay,"" he said.
""You have to turn this problem into an opportunity. Crises are what causes inventions to come about.""

China has given the Philippines some 100,000 COVID-19 test kits, 100,000 surgical masks, 10,000 N95 masks and 10,000 sets of personal protective equipment (PPE).
The donation came just as the Philippine government sought to boost its medical supplies amid increasing cases of COVID-19, which originated in the Chinese metropolis of Wuhan.
To date, the number of coronavirus infections in the Philippines is 803.
The tally, which is expected to rise because of the increased testing capacity of the country’s laboratories, include 54 fatalities and 31 patients who recovered from the disease.

WASHINGTON - A US-based lab has unveiled a portable test that can tell if someone has COVID-19 in as little as 5 minutes, it said in a statement Friday.
Abbott Laboratories said the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had given it emergency authorization to begin making the test available to health care providers as early as next week.
The test, which is the size of a small toaster and uses molecular technology, also shows negative results within 13 minutes, the company said in a press statement.
""The COVID-19 pandemic will be fought on multiple fronts, and a portable molecular test that offers results in minutes adds to the broad range of diagnostic solutions needed to combat this virus,"" said Abbott president and chief operating officer Robert Ford.
The test's small size means it can be deployed outside the ""traditional 4 walls of a hospital in outbreak hotspots,"" Ford said, and Abbott is working with the FDA to send it to virus epicenters.
The test has not been cleared or approved by the FDA, and has only been authorized for emergency use by approved labs and health care providers, the company said.

Local government units are ordered to submit a database of beneficiaries to the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD), Interior Undersecretary Jonathan Malaya said during the ""Laging Handa"" public briefing.
The DSWD is also tasked to host the database for the COVID-19 social amelioration program of the government, he added.
""Hihingin naman ang tulong ng mga barangay. Ang listahan ng beneficiaries ay manggagaling sa barangay captains. Sana wala nang politika. Tapos na po ang eleksyon,"" Malaya said.
(We are asking the help of barangays. The list of beneficiaries will come from the barangay captains. I hope there's no more politicking. Elections have already ended.)

The social amelioration program is line with the ""Bayanihan to Heal as One Act,"" which grants the executive department with special powers ""to effectively respond to the challenges caused by the COVID-19 global pandemic.""
Under the program, some 18 million poor Filipino families will receive cash aid for 2 months. This as millions are expected to lose livelihood with lockdowns enforced in Luzon and other parts of the country as a disease control measure. 
Under the stimulus law, the monthly subsidies range from P5,000 to P8,000 per family and should be computed based on the prevailing regional minimum wage.

MANILA - A cafe in Quezon City that served as temporary shelter for the homeless amid the Luzon lockdown to prevent the spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has shifted to distributing aid after it was shut down over alleged quarantine violations, its management said Saturday.
Officials in Barangay East Kamias ordered the closure of Popburri as a homeless shelter due to violation of quarantine protocols, the cafe announced on its Facebook page.
""For the record, we at Popburri learned along the way to enforce the protocols required,"" the management said.
Popburri maintained it had applied precautionary measures when accepting street dwellers and stranded workers, such as fever checks, other hygiene practices and physical distancing.

 
On Friday, the cafe took in 72 people who have nowhere to go during the government-ordered lockdown.
""The Lord gives us leaders in our nation that see further than we can, and often are more knowledgeable in many aspects and therefore we respectfully honor the decision made by our barangay leaders,"" Popburri said.

The National Privacy Commission (NPC) earlier warned government agencies to follow data privacy guidelines when releasing information of COVID-19 cases.
NPC commissioner Raymund Liboro had said that the Data Privacy Act, which regulates the collection and release of personal data, is not meant to hamper government “from processing personal and sensitive personal information when necessary to fulfill their mandates during a public health emergency.”
Instead, he said proper handling of such information is “crucial in stopping the spread of the virus.”
Among the considerations the Department of Health (DOH) and other agencies should weigh, according to the NPC, are (1) the potential harm or distress to the patient arising from the disclosure, and (2) the potential damage to trust in doctors and health institutions in general, versus (1) the potential harm to the public if the information is not disclosed and (2) the potential benefits to individuals and society arising from the release of information.
As of Friday afternoon, the number of coronavirus infections in the Philippines has climbed to 803. Of the number, 54 have died while 31 have recovered.

MANILA (UPDATE) - The national government has ordered all local government units (LGU) to identify facilities that can be used to temporarily isolate coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients, a Cabinet official said late Friday.
The Department of Tourism (DOT) and other government agencies are also directed to help in identifying establishments that can be converted into quarantine facilities for patients under investigation (PUIs) and those experiencing mild symptoms of COVID-19, Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles said.
The Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) shall conduct site inspection and commence work on the identified facilities as approved by the National Task Force on COVID-19, added Nograles, spokesperson of the Inter-Agency Task Force on the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID).
Accredited construction workers who will work on the identified facilities shall be exempted from the strict home quarantine requirement.
Faced with the potential influx of coronavirus cases in medical facilities, some LGUs have already converted several facilities dedicated to COVID-19 cases.

To date, the Philippines has recorded 803 cases of the novel coronavirus.
The tally, which is expected to rise because of the increased testing capacity of the country’s laboratories, include 54 fatalities and 31 patients who recovered from the disease.
The Philippines has scrapped public events, closed schools and advised people to work from home in a bid to curtail the spread of the coronavirus.
The COVID-19 pandemic has so far infected 465,000 people and killed 21,000 others in 199 territories and countries, latest data from the World Health Organization (WHO) showed.

MANILA - A Makati City village on Friday ordered Sen. Manny Pacquiao and his family to undergo home quarantine due to exposure to persons diagnosed with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
The senator is considered a person under monitoring (PUM) after a photo of him partying with Sen. Aquilino ""Koko"" Pimentel III, who was recently diagnosed with the contagious infection, went viral, Rossana Hwang, barangay chairman of Dasmariñas Village, said in a letter dated March 27.
In a message to ABS-CBN News, Pacquiao said he will always follow the law.
His staff added that Pacquiao and his family have isolated themselves since after the Senate special session earlier this week.
Pimentel on Wednesday revealed he had been diagnosed with COVID-19 and drew heavy criticism for visiting a hospital even when he was already experiencing symptoms and while other senators had gone on quarantine for earlier exposure to a virus carrier at the Senate.

Criminal cases readied vs Koko Pimentel for breaching COVID-19 quarantine

""Many of your colleagues in Senate have been identified to be COVID positive. Therefore you have to be quarantined at your own house,"" Hwang wrote in the letter.
According to Jake Joson, Pacquiao's special assistant, Pacquiao and his family have already quarantined themselves prior to the village notice.
Joson said the party Hwang was referring to happened on March 4, while Pimentel said he could've contracted the virus afterward.
According to Joson, after Pacquiao attended a special Senate session on Monday, the lawmaker and world champion boxer hasn't left the house.
Sen. Juan Miguel Zubiri was the first senator diagnosed with the virus and said Friday he no longer had symptoms. Sen. Sonny Angara, meanwhile, said Thursday he had tested positive for the virus. 
Several other senators have tested negative for the virus but drew criticism for getting tested even without experiencing COVID-19 symptoms.
The village chief said nobody from the Pacquiao household should come outside. If they need anything, the village could help them procure things.
""This was the recommendation of doctors from Makati Medical Center who is also a resident here. And recommended by Makati Health Department,"" Hwang said.
""Please be a model example,"" she added.
In response to the letter, the senator said his family were already undergoing home quarantine.
""Sen. Manny says he will always follow the law,"" Pacquiao's camp said in a statement sent to ABS-CBN News.
Pacquiao's special assistant Jake Joson also said the senator's family was already in quarantine even before the village chief sent the letter. -- With reports from Sherrie Ann Torres and Dyan Castillejo, ABS-CBN News

MANILA - Western Visayas has recorded 9 new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases, raising the region's tally to 13, the health ministry said Friday.
Seven of the new patients are men while 2 are women, data from the Department of Health (DOH) in Western Visayas showed.
Five of them have a travel history in Metro Manila, which has become the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak in the Philippines.
Among the new patients is the 28-year-old son of the region's first COVID-19 case from Bacolod City, Negros Occidental.
So far, the region has tallied 3 coronavirus cases in Aklan province, 1 in Capiz province, 3 in Iloilo province, 2 in Iloilo City, 4 in Bacolod City, Negros Occidental.
Latest data from DOH-Western Visayas also showed there were 95 patients under investigation (PUIs) currently admitted in hospitals while 11,124 out of 41,915 persons under monitoring (PUMs) had already completed the 14-day quarantine.
Meanwhile, the first 4 recorded COVID-cases in the region are in stable condition. Some 250 people whom they had in contact with have been traced. Of the number, 88 were deemed asymptomatic.
To date, the Philippines has recorded 803 coronavirus infections, with 54 deaths and 31 recoveries.

,Mar 27 2020,nCov,"Rep. Yap negative for COVID-19, RITM clarifies; apologizes for 'clerical oversight'",ABS-CBN News,"



 
MANILA (2nd UPDATE) - ACT-CIS party-list Rep. Eric Go Yap is negative for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) said Friday as it apologized for making a ""clerical oversight"" on the release of a false positive diagnosis.
""We wish to publicly apologize to Cong. Eric Go Yap of ACT-CIS Partylist for forwarding a report of his COVID-19 results that displayed a clerical oversight,"" the state-run health research facility said in a statement.
""Rep. Yap remains negative of COVID-19,"" it added.
The mistake was due to an encoding error, the RITM said, and was discovered late Thursday night by its molecular biology laboratory.
Despite the incident, RITM maintained its testing process is compliant with the World Health Organization (WHO) protocol and that its results remain accurate.
The RITM uses the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing procedure, considered as the gold standard in detecting the genetic sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 - the virus that causes COVID-19.
""Again, we profusely and sincerely apologize to Hon. Eric Go Yap for the unnecessary discomfort this incident has caused,"" the health research facility said.
The individual responsible for the error was part of an augmentation staff and had been dealt with administratively following the incident, the RITM said.
""For the assurance of the public, we have reviewed all results we have previously forwarded and we affirm that this incident remains isolated. We have also added another layer of verification for all succeeding reports we will submit,"" it said.
RITM added: ""We promise that this, and other associated incidents, will never happen again.""
Yap accepts RITM apology, still vouches for test accuracy
In a statement, Yap said he had been having a hard time since his diagnosis but added that he understood the mistake and accepts RITM's apology.
""Inaamin ko, the past 48 hours has been very hard for me and to everyone around me. Hindi naging madali ito pero buong puso kong tinatanggap ang apology ng DOH-RITM,"" he said.
(I admit, the past 48 hours has been very hard for me and to everyone around me. It wasn't easy but I wholeheartedly accept the apology of DOH-RITM.)
He said it was RITM Director Dr. Celia Carlos who called him to explain.
""Naiintindihan ko, they are the busiest medical facility in the country right now. It's not an excuse pero normal na nagkakaroon ng pagkakamali sa dami at sa pressure na tinatanggap ng RITM ngayon,"" he said.
(I understand, they are the busiest medical facility in the country right now. It's not an excuse but it's normal to make mistakes with everything they're doing and the pressure they get.)
He said the release of his correct results is ""not a cause for celebration for me"" with millions affected by the COVID-19 crisis.
""I will not harbor hard feelings towards anybody and I urge everybody to stay home and keep safe from this virus,"" he said.
He still vouched for the accuracy of RITM testing, saying there was no mistake in processing his sample.
""This is just a clerical error and should not be taken against RITM, hindi sila nagkamali ng pagprocess ng samples ko, hindi sila nagkamali sa basa ng results ko. I thank God for this news but let us not keep our guards down. Sama-sama pa din natin sugpuin ang COVID!"" he said.
(This is just a clerical error and should not be taken against RITM, they did not err in processing my samples, they did not err in reading my result. I thank God for this news but let us not keep our guards down. Together, let us conquer COVID!)
Malacañang, meanwhile, called on RITM to be more careful in releasing test results as it welcomed Yap's revised diagnosis.
""We are pleased to hear about the the COVID-19 negative test of of Cong. Eric Yap. While the erroneous reporting of Cong Yap’s COVID-19 positive has caused alarm and anxiety to those who had close physical contact with him and made them undergo self- quarantine nevertheless such good news is welcome,"" said Presidential spokesperson Salvador Panelo.
""We appeal to the RITM to be more certain of the test results before releasing them to the patients or to their doctors to avoid such unfortunate incident,"" he said.
Yap's false diagnosis had prompted several lawmakers to go on self-quarantine as they were present in official functions he also attended, including a meeting at the Malacañang Palace on March 21.

MANILA - The Quezon City government said Friday it sought the help of tricycle drivers in distributing food packs to families in different villages.
Some 60 tricycle drivers were mobilized to assist the city government in distributing aid, said Assistant City Administrator for Operations Alberto Kimpo. The program, under the Tricycle Regulatory Division, started on Tuesday.
“Inatasan ng LGU ang tricycle drivers para sa paghahatid ng tulong sa ating mga mamamayan para magkaroon din sila ng kita para sa pangangailangan ng kanilang pamilya,” said Kimpo.
(The LGU (local government unit) ordered tricycle drivers in delivering assistance to its constituents so they would also earn money for their families.)
The drivers are from Tricycle Operators and Drivers Associations (TODA) in the city's 6 districts. They will earn P500 per shift, aside from getting free meals.
The city government is also working on other programs to help tricycle drivers whose livelihoods have been affected by the enhanced community quarantine due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.
To date, the number of coronavirus cases in the city is at 97.

NEW YORK - Schools across New York in the US have closed to prevent the spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but math classes continue online for a Filipino-American teacher and his students.
Using wooden yardsticks, cereal boxes, mobile phones, and a laptop, Fil-Am teacher Ram Buenaventura livestreams math classes to his students at the comfort and safety of their homes.
Between 8:30 a.m. to 3:10 p.m., seventh graders from the Renaissance Charter School in Queens logged on to their e-learning school through a teleconferencing app called Zoom.
For Buenaventura, no pandemic can stop them from holding classes.
His math lessons, posted on his YouTube channel, also came in handy in teaching the students.
""I present it in a lively, in a creative, in a different way,"" he told ABS-CBN News.
However, the shift to online learning poses some challenges, according to some of Buenaventura's students.
""I am able to focus, except like sometimes, I get distracted by my phone,"" said seventh grader Sebbe Gastra.
Another challenge for Buenaventura is merging 2 classes into one.
""In a class of 60 students, chatting [and] talking to you at the same time, while you’re teaching… that’s so difficult, but I learned how to mute everybody in Zoom,"" he said.
""They cannot unmute themselves. So masaya ang buhay ni teacher. Nakakapagturo ng walang disruption,"" he added.

NEW YORK - The United States was quickly becoming a new epicenter of the global coronavirus pandemic Thursday as new infections soared and unemployment claims skyrocketed to a historic high.
Hospitals increasingly have reported being overwhelmed with COVID-19 cases and 40 percent of Americans are under lockdown orders, although a buoyant Wall Street recouped more of this month's massive losses as Congress moved forward on a $2 trillion rescue package.
More than 100 people died in the past day in virus hotbed New York, where a long line of people, most in masks and standing 3 feet (a meter) apart, snaked outside the Elmhurst hospital in Jackson Heights under police watch as they waited to be tested.
Governor Andrew Cuomo said the top priority was to ""flatten the curve"" of new cases as the New York City area tries to more than double its available number of hospital beds to 140,000.
""This is all about getting that curve down and not overwhelming the hospital system,"" Cuomo told reporters.
""Almost any scenario that is realistic will overwhelm the capacity of the current health care system,"" he warned.
Mayor Bill de Blasio said city hospitals in recent days have seen in influx of badly needed supplies from both the state and federal governments.
""That is a ray of light for sure,"" De Blasio said Wednesday.
""But we know we're going to have giant challenges ahead in terms of producing enough hospital space or enough personnel who are trained to help us in this crisis.""
The number of deaths caused by the novel coronavirus reached the grim threshold of 1,000 by late Wednesday and on Thursday the country had 69,246 confirmed cases, according to a Johns Hopkins University database. New York accounts for 385 deaths.
The number of infections is just below hardest-affected Italy and China, where the virus was first detected last year in the metropolis of Wuhan.
While fatalities remain higher elsewhere, experts say new infection numbers show that more Americans will die -- and the true number of cases could be much higher than the official figure due to shortages of test kits.
UNEMPLOYMENT SKYROCKETS
The pandemic has already, and rapidly, been catastrophic to the world's largest economy, which looks to be heading into a recession.
The Labor Department reported that 3.3 million people applied for unemployment benefits last week, by far the highest number ever recorded.
Job losses have been widespread across sectors including food services, accommodation, entertainment and transportation, according to the normally routine report.
The US Congress, which is usually deeply polarized, has come together in the face of the crisis after negotiations between President Donald Trump's Republicans and rival Democrats.
The Senate overnight unanimously passed a $2 trillion package -- the largest stimulus in US history, which will provide cash payouts that average $3,400 for an average family of 4.
The bill heads Friday to the Democratic-led House of Representatives, where leaders of both parties have urged passage.
""It will pass and will pass with strong bipartisan support,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told reporters.
""We will have a victory tomorrow for America's workers.""
Wall Street's benchmark Dow Jones index had soared more than 5 percent in late-morning trade, although it was still far down from this year's highs.
Many market players hope COVID-19 will be a short-term challenge followed by a strong recovery -- a view avidly shared by Trump, who has banked on a strong economy as he seeks re-election in November.
Trump has voiced hope that normal life can resume by mid-April, a goal that many health experts say is unrealistic and jars with moves from Europe to India to keep people indoors to stem the virus, known formally as SARS-CoV-2.
But top US scientist Anthony Fauci warned that the virus could become a regular occurrence -- making the international race for a vaccine even more pressing.
He said that the disease was beginning to take root in countries in the southern hemisphere, where winter is on the way.
""And if, in fact, they have a substantial outbreak, it will be inevitable that we need to be prepared that we'll get a cycle around the second time,"" said Fauci, who leads research into infectious diseases at the National Institutes of Health.
""It totally emphasizes the need to do what we're doing in developing a vaccine, testing it quickly and trying to get it ready so that we'll have a vaccine available for that next cycle,"" he told reporters.

WASHINGTON - There is a strong chance the new coronavirus could return in seasonal cycles, a senior US scientist said Wednesday, underscoring the urgent need to find a vaccine and effective treatments. 
Anthony Fauci, who leads research into infectious diseases at the National Institutes of Health, told a briefing the virus was beginning to take root in the southern hemisphere, where winter is on its way.
""What we're starting to see now... in southern Africa and in the southern hemisphere countries, is that we're having cases that are appearing as they go into their winter season,"" he said.
""And if, in fact, they have a substantial outbreak, it will be inevitable that we need to be prepared that we'll get a cycle around the second time.
""It totally emphasizes the need to do what we're doing in developing a vaccine, testing it quickly and trying to get it ready so that we'll have a vaccine available for that next cycle.""
There are currently 2 vaccines that have entered human trials -- 1 in the US and 1 in China -- and they could be a year to a year-and-a-half away from deployment.
Treatments are also being investigated -- some new drugs and others that have been repurposed, including the antimalarials chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine.
""I know we'll be successful in putting this down now, but we really need to be prepared for another cycle,"" Fauci concluded.
Fauci's comments suggesting the virus does better in colder weather than it does in hot and humid conditions follows a recent Chinese research paper -- still preliminary and awaiting peer-review -- that reached the same conclusion. 
The reasons are thought to include that respiratory droplets remain airborne for longer in colder weather, and that cold weather weakens immunity.
Another potential reason is that viruses degrade more quickly on hotter surfaces, possibly because a protective layer of fat that envelops them dries out quicker. 
But reduced infection rate does not mean the virus gets eliminated -- Australia has had almost 2,500 confirmed cases and 8 deaths, for example.

MILAN - Italian researchers are looking at whether a higher than usual number of cases of severe pneumonia and flu in Lombardy in the last quarter of 2019 may be a signal that the new coronavirus might have spread beyond China earlier than previously thought.
Adriano Decarli, an epidemiologist and medical statistics professor at the University of Milan, said there had been a ""significant"" increase in the number of people hospitalized for pneumonia and flu in the areas of Milan and Lodi between October and December last year.
He told Reuters he could not give exact figures but ""hundreds"" more people than usual had been taken to hospital in the last 3 months of 2019 in those areas - 2 of Lombardy's worst hit cities - with pneumonia and flu-like symptoms, and some of those had died.
Decarli is reviewing the hospital records and other clinical details of those cases, including people who later died at home, to try to understand whether the new coronavirus epidemic had already spread to Italy back then.
""We want to know if the virus was already here in Italy at the end of 2019, and - if yes - why it remained undetected for a relatively long period so that we could have a clearer picture in case we have to face a second wave of the epidemic,"" he said.
The World Health Organization has said the new coronavirus and COVID-19, the respiratory disease it causes, were unknown before the outbreak was first reported in Wuhan in central China in December.
Decarli said once his research was concluded, local health authorities might decide to request authorization to exhume bodies of people with suspect symptoms.
Other experts cast doubt on the hypothesis that the new virus could have been circulating in Europe before the end of 2019.
""I think it extremely unlikely that the virus was present in Europe before January,"" said Paul Hunter, a professor in medicine at Britain's University of East Anglia who has been tracking the evolving pandemic.
Hunter said that unless Italian scientists get positive results from samples taken and stored at that time, then the suggestion should not be given credence.
He added that, given what we know about how infectious the virus is, and the ratio of patients showing no symptoms compared with those that get sick, ""it is inconceivable that we would not have had a pretty major epidemic in Europe much earlier if these cases had in fact been COVID-19"".
HIGHEST DEATH TOLL
Italy, which now has the highest number of COVID-19 deaths in the world, recorded its first case of infection on Feb. 21, though some scientists think the virus began circulating in the country at least a month earlier.
""The virus was already here in the second half of January,"" said Massimo Galli, head of the infectious disease unit at Milan's Sacco hospital and a professor at the department of biomedical and clinical sciences at the University of Milan.
He said, however, that the probability of the virus circulating in Italy before January was ""very low.""
Giuseppe Remuzzi, director of the Mario Negri Institute for Pharmacological Research in Milan, said some family doctors in Lombardy had reported unusual cases of pneumonia late last year that now looked potentially suspicious.
He said among those were several cases of bilateral pneumonia - which means both lungs are affected - in the areas of Gera D'Adda and Crema in late November and December, with high fever, cough, fatigue and difficulty breathing.
""None of these cases have been documented as COVID-19 because there was no evidence yet of the existence of COVID-19,"" he said.
Remuzzi said that if evidence of COVID-19 cases in Italy as far back as November was confirmed, this may signal that the virus can go undetected for months.
He said some reports in scientific journals had also led other scientists to question whether the virus may have emerged in China as early as October.

BERLIN - Germany is testing up to 500,000 people a week for the new coronavirus, a virologist said Thursday, adding that early detection has been key in keeping the country's death rate relatively low.
The country has more than 36,000 declared cases of the virus, among the highest in Europe, but has managed to avoid the high death rates seen in hard-hit Italy and Spain.
Experts say widespread testing and tracing of COVID-19 cases is key to limiting the spread of the disease, an approach adopted in South Korea and Singapore where the outbreak has largely been contained.
In Germany, virologist Christian Drosten said it had helped to keep the death rate under control.
""The reason why Germany has so few deaths compared to the number of infected people can be explained by the fact that we carry out an extremely large number of laboratory diagnostic tests,"" said Drosten, who heads the Institute of Virology at Berlin's Charite University Hospital.
""Estimates from the last days show that we are carrying out half a million tests a week,"" he said.
He added that a vast network of laboratories across the country had helped with the widespread testing.
Germany's health minister confirmed that between 300,000 and 500,000 tests were carried out in Germany last week alone, with about 10 percent coming back positive.
""That's likely to be the most tests of any country in the world, in both absolute and relative terms,"" Jens Spahn said.
Among Germany's population of 83 million people, 36,508 are confirmed infected, including 198 who have died from the disease, according to official data compiled by the disease control agency Robert Koch Institute.
SEARCH FOR TREATMENT
At 0.54 percent, Germany's death rate is far lower than Italy's rate of around 10 percent and Spain's fatality rate of 7.3 percent. France's death rate is about 5.2 percent.
Besides the large-scale testing, experts in Germany also said that the virus has largely affected a younger, healthier section of the population compared to elsewhere.
At the same time, experts have repeatedly warned that in the country where almost a quarter of the population is over 60, the number of deaths could still skyrocket if people do not stick to measures to help halt the contagion.
Lockdown measures are in place across Germany, preventing people from leaving their homes except for essential trips, while most shops, restaurants and bars are closed.
Berlin's research ministry said it would commit 150 million euros ($164 million) to improve communication between hospitals and laboratories about coronavirus patients' health data, hoping the information exchange could feed into development of a vaccine.
Drosten suggested that some rules on clinical research could be loosened in the search for a coronavirus treatment.
But he downplayed the use of anti-malarial drug chloroquine -- hyped by US President Donald Trump -- for infected patients.
""There are substances that are much more promising,"" he said, using the example of Favipiravir, a flu medication.

A medical worker attends to a patient at a screening booth at the Amang Rodriguez Memorial Medical Center in Marikina City on March 23, 2020. Jonathan Cellona, ABS-CBN News


MANILA - The Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) on Thursday urged local government units (LGUs) and private establishments to strictly comply with laboratory standards before facilities can perform diagnostic testing for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
“We greatly appreciate all parties who expressed their intention to establish their own COVID-19 testing centers. This is a step forward towards the achievement of our overall goal to create a large network of laboratories that can respond to public health emergencies,"" RITM director Celia Carlos said in a statement.
""However, in as much as we want to accelerate this effort, we should remain meticulous in observing good laboratory practices and biosafety protocols recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). Not all laboratories can be COVID-19 testing centers,"" she added.
The state-run health research facility said laboratories dealing with coronavirus samples must be capable of performing molecular diagnostics in terms of infrastructure, personnel, apparatus and quality assurance.
Molecular diagnostics through polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test requires a biosafety level 2 facility, fully-trained staff on test procedures and specialized equipment, among others, it added.
Inadequacy of the prerequisites, the RITM stressed, may lead to inaccurate results, possible infection and contamination of collected samples.
“The virus we look for in all samples we receive is highly contagious, hence, COVID-19 testing is done in laboratories with complex systems and strict biosafety measures. It is not as simple as a fingerprick examination or a self-administered pregnancy test,"" Carlos said.
""Each sample goes through multiple testing phases by detecting DNA/RNA of specific viruses, bacteria, or other pathogens. In the case of COVID-19, we check for the presence of genes of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in order to determine beyond all doubt that the sample is positive or negative for the disease,"" she added.
Those interested of setting up COVID-19 testing centers should write a letter of intent to Health Undersecretary Myrna Cabotaje, the RITM said.
The Department of Health (DOH) will send a self-assessment tool for the requesting parties to accomplish. 
A composite team made up of representatives from RITM, WHO and the Health Facilities and Services Bureau will evaluate the application based on the abovementioned prerequisites, and provide necessary recommendations to facilitate their application, the RITM added.
Once application deficiencies are addressed, technologists of the applicant laboratory must undergo a proficiency test. 

Once they pass the said test, the laboratory will then be authorized to operate as a testing laboratory for COVID-19. 
The newly-operational laboratory should submit to RITM the first 5 positive samples for confirmation. If there is good concordance between the newly-operational laboratory’s and RITM’s results, the newly-operational laboratory can commence COVID-19 testing independently of RITM.
Also on Thursday, the DOH rejected Marikina City's application for a COVID-19 testing center after it failed on standards for space and biosafety.

,Mar 26 2020,nCov,Nearly 300 UP students stranded in dorms amid Luzon lockdown,"Maan Macapagal, ABS-CBN News","



MANILA - Nearly 300 students from UP Diliman were left stranded in their dormitories following the government-ordered enhanced community quarantine in Luzon due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.
The students are unable to go home in their respective provinces in Visayas and Mindanao. Their allowances have also dwindled and are not expected to receive money from their parents due to lack of work. 
Some students in other universities in Metro Manila also have difficulties going home due to the transport shutdown. 
Second year FEU nursing student Aaron Carl Aranas posted on Twitter that he was stranded in his dorm in Sampaloc and needed to go home to his family in Commonwealth. 
“Hindi ko alam kung hanggang saan kaya ng paa ko pero ang alam ko lang, kailangan kong umuwi papunta sa pamilya ko,” his tweet read. 
He would need to walk 13 kilometers in order to get home. 
“Noong magkaroon ng lockdown, nag-stay po muna ako sa dorm kasi magkakaroon kami ng online classes, nagpaiwan na lang po ako kasi sa bahay namin walang signal since nasa tabi po siya ng sapa,” Aranas said. 
After a netizen’s posted his tweet on social media in #INEEDARIDE, Aranas was able to get a volunteer with a private car to bring him to his house for free. 
“Nagpapasalamat ako at makakauwi na, hindi ko na iisipin kung saan kakain, saan bibili,” he shared. 
Meanwhile, Lucky dela Rosa is busy preparing food for more than 50 students in their dormitories who were left stranded in Ipil Residence Hall in the University of the Philippines. 
Dela Rosa, a resident of Cagayan de Oro, said most of those who are unable to go home during the lockdown live in Visayas and Mindanao. 
“Dahil lockdown sa mga probinsiya nila, walang kapasidad ang mga magulang nila na magbigay ng allowance para sa kanila. Yung mga magulang namin, wala na pong trabaho, pangalawa, umaasa lang po kami sa scholarship,” Lucky said. 
A student named Iona decided to stay in her dorm at Ilang-Ilang Residence Hall during the lockdown because she thought people in her hometown would be safer if she didn’t go home. 
“Mas magiging ligtas ang mga tao sa hometown ko kung saan ako nanggaling na manatili na lang ako dito sa unibersidad,” she said. 
A few days into the lockdown, the students said they are now short of cash. 
According to the UP Student Council vice chairman Eser Jose, some 272 students are stranded in their dormitories. This number does not include those living in boarding houses outside the university. 
“A lot of them ay galing po sa mga probinsiya, marami po sa kanila ang di nakauwi, dahil una, biglaan din po yung lockdown sa Metro Manila. Hindi naman po ganun kabilis na makabili ng ticket pamasahe. Yung iba po sa kanila ay galing pa sa Visayas at Mindanao. Nag-re-require po yon ng mahal na airfare, hindi po iyon afford ng lahat ng estudyante na biglaan na makauwi,” Jose explained. 
The student council has begun asking for donations for food and toiletries. 
Paula Barredo, another student left stranded, decided not to go home out of fear of missing online classes. 
She is now helping repack donations for her fellow students. 
“Wala po kasi kaming wifi sa bahay so nag-stay po ako dito for online classes. Nong nag-enhanced quarantine, di na po kami nakauwi,” Barredo said. 
UP Chancellor Dr. Fidel Nemenzo said they are doing their best to provide for the students. 
“Sinisigurado naman namin ang kanilang mga daily necessities pagkain at groceries ay nabibigay sa kanila at patuloy ang aming university food service na nagluluto ng pagkain para sa kanila, sa mga estudyante. May university food service na rin na nagdedeliver na sa kanila dahil nga sabi namin habang nandito sila tayong lahat ay naka-quarantine,” Nemenzo said. 
Those who wish to help may leave their donations at the drop off point in Sampaguita residence hall lobby in UP Diliman.

VATICAN CITY - Pope Francis was reported Thursday to have tested negative for the novel coronavirus after a person in his residence was said to have contracted COVID-19.
Several Italian newspapers with reputable sources in the Vatican said the Italian clergyman who got sick had lived for years in the pope's Saint Martha's residence.
Il Messaggero said the person is ""one of the pope's closest collaborators, an official of the Secretariate of the State, who was found to have a slight temperature after going in for a routine check.""
The daily La Stampa said the unnamed person has been hospitalized in Rome and that his office has been disinfected.
Il Messaggero later reported that the pope himself was tested for the virus and came out clean.
The 83-year-old pontiff has remained largely secluded at his residence since coming down with a cold late last month.
La Stampa said he has been ""eating alone in his room for some time"" and has food brought to him on a tray by secretaries.
""He spends much of his time in his apartment, and when he moves inside the residence, he keeps the necessary safe distances,"" La Stampa wrote.
""The anti-contagion cordon has been tight around the pope for weeks.""
The official Vatican News site said the number of people infected in the city state has risen to 4.
The ANSA news agency said the Italian clergyman in the pope's residence was a fifth case not reported by official sources.
UNEXPECTED
Life in the Vatican has been shrouded in secrecy and little in known about how popes spend their days.
But the Argentine-born pontiff has tried to connect more with the people and do away with some the Vatican's more formal traditions.
He refused to move into the luxurious papal palace upon being elected to succeed pope Benedict XVI in March 2013.
His Saint Martha's residence is a simple building erected next to Saint Peter's Basilica in 1996.
It is also the place where cardinals stay when they gather for conclaves to elect new popes.
Francis stayed there for the 2013 election and then never moved out when he was picked.
Il Messaggero said only about 30 people live at the residence and ""no one would have expected"" for one of them would get sick because their circle of contacts was so small.
The Argentine-born pontiff has enjoyed a life of good health despite losing part of a lung as a young man and suffering from sciatica -- a nerve condition that causes pain in his hip.
Italian news reports said he was not currently considering moving to a more isolated location because of the 4 cases in the Vatican.
""In any case, the pope is constantly surrounded by a staff equipped with disinfectant products,"" La Stampa wrote.
The pope's daily prayer Thursday touched on people's fears in the face of the new disease.
""Each one knows what their own fears are,"" Francis said.

MADRID - The coronavirus death toll in Spain surged to 4,089 after 655 people died within 24 hours, the health ministry said on Thursday.
It was a 19-percent increase in figures released Wednesday by the authorities in Spain, which has the world's second highest death toll from the disease after Italy.
The number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 rose to 56,188, the ministry said.
Despite a national lockdown imposed on March 14, which parliament on Thursday agreed to extend until April 11, both deaths and infections have continued to mount, with officials warning this week would be particularly bad. 
But the rise in the number of new deaths was smaller than that recorded on Wednesday when the figure rose by 738 or 27 percent.
Health authorities are hoping it will soon become clear whether the lockdown is having the desired effect.
The Madrid region has suffered the brunt of the epidemic with 17,166 infections -- just under a third of the total -- and 2,090 deaths, or 51 percent of the national figure. 
Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, whose wife is infected with the virus, has said this is the country's most difficult moment since its 1936-39 civil war.
""Only the oldest, who knew the hardships of the civil war and its aftermath, can remember collective situations that were harsher than the current one. The other generations in Spain have never, ever had to face as a collective something so hard,” he said when he imposed the state of emergency on March 14.
Spain's demographics partly explain why it has been one of the worst-affected nations. 
The country has one of the longest life expectancies in Europe and the pandemic has taken a high toll on its large elderly population, who are especially vulnerable to the disease.

MANILA - The San Juan City government said Thursday it would convert the city's science high school into a quarantine facility for suspected coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases.
The new building of the San Juan City Science High School will be turned into a 100-bed isolation facility, which will be supervised by the city's health office and San Juan Medical Center.
It will also serve as a ""staging area"" before the city's confirmed COVID-19 cases are admitted in the hospital.
Through their ""Kalinga Kontra Korona"" initiative led by the Alumni Association of Xavier School, the Xavier School will provide hospital beds, mobile X-rays, medical supplies, medicines, medical and other front-line personnel, as well as food, water and other necessities.
""This offer by the Xavier community to help us out in creating a COVID-19 overflow facility is indeed Godsent. We are very thankful to Xavier School for the support that they will be giving the City of San Juan,"" city mayor Francis Zamora said in a statement.
The school was chosen by local authorities as a quarantine facility due to its central location, proximity to the San Juan Medical Center and city hall and having no immediate neighbors.
The San Juan Medical Center currently has a 17-bed isolation facility and is creating 2 more wards that can cater 25 COVID-19 patients.
To date, the city has 57 confirmed coronavirus cases, 102 patients under investigation (PUIs) and 222 persons under monitoring (PUMs).
""We all want to win this battle vs COVID-19, and we will if we all do what it takes — stay home and keep safe! Let's keep fighting,"" Zamora wrote on his official Facebook page.

MANILA - As the novel coronavirus continues to rage across the country, some areas in Luzon have sought best practices and adopted hi-tech ways to slow down the spread of the disease.
In northern Luzon, Baguio City is using an artificial-intelligence-powered CT scan analyzer to fast-track the screening of suspected coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases.
Baguio City Mayor Benjamin Magalong said the AI COVID-19 analyzer, which was developed by Chinese tech giant Huawei, could help diagnose highly-suspicious coronavirus cases in few minutes.
""In a matter of 7 minutes, we'll be able to determine the results,"" he told ANC.
The results are not conclusive, but it will aid health workers in diagnosing possible COVID-19 cases by determining their viral load, Magalong added.
The city has also set up some 20 sanitation tents in different medical facilities, and reduced foot traffic in markets, which are known sites with the highest incidence of transmission, the mayor said.
To expedite the city's contact tracing system, Magalong said he also asked the expertise of police, aside from developing a database of patients and their contacts.
""What we're doing now is that each contact tracer is being assisted by police investigators,"" he said.
Faced with the potential influx of coronavirus cases in medical facilities, the city has also converted an unused private hospital into a treatment facility dedicated to COVID-19 cases.
The Sto. Niño Hospital, a 36-bed capacity medical facility along P. Burgos St., will be used as an exclusive critical care unit for coronavirus patients to free other hospitals from possible contamination risks, Magalong said.
Baguio City has so far tallied 4 confirmed COVID-19 cases, 1 death and 2 presumptive cases.
The city also has 287 patients under investigation (PUIs) who are undergoing home quarantine while 22 PUIs are admitted in the hospitals.
Some 1,531 persons under monitoring (PUMs) are also currently undergoing a 14-day quarantine.
In the south of Luzon, Laguna province has converted a sports complex into a health facility dedicated to treating possible COVID-19 cases.
Laguna Governor Ramil Hernandez said he has also asked the help of barangay tanods to man checkpoints.
The province has also canceled its annual Anilag Festival as a precautionary measure. The festival, which celebrates Laguna's harvests, was scheduled from April 18 to 25.
The province has so far reported 15 coronavirus cases, 506 PUIs and 6,716 PUMs.

MANILA - Nine doctors have died in the Philippines from the coronavirus, the country's top medical association said Thursday, as hospitals were overwhelmed and medics complained about a lack of protection on the frontlines.
The announcement of the doctors' deaths heightened fears that the scale of the health crisis in the Philippines is much worse than is being officially reported, with the confirmed virus death toll at just 38.
The main island of Luzon, home to 55 million people, is in the second week of a lockdown to contain the spread of the disease, however medics are warning there is a surge in cases.
The Philippine Medical Association said Thursday a ninth doctor had died of the virus, and that health workers were not getting enough protection.
""If it were up to me, test the frontliners first and test them again after 7 days. Doctors could be carriers themselves,"" Benito Atienza, vice president of the Philippine Medical Association told AFP.
Among these deaths, as reported by the media, were Dr. Raul Jara, former president of Philippine Heart Association and ""one of the great pillars of cardiology; Dr. Henry Fernandez, a 77-year-old resident of Bayambang town, who caught the respiratory disease from visitors from the US; young doctor Israel Bactol, an incoming senior Adult Cardiology Fellow-in-training; and Dr. Sally Gatchalian, head of the Philippine Pediatric Society 
Three large Metro Manila hospitals announced Tuesday they had reached full capacity and would no longer accept new coronavirus cases.
Hundreds of medical staff are no longer accepting patients because they are undergoing 14-day self-quarantines after suspected exposure, the hospitals said.
Testing remains limited in the Philippines as of Tuesday, only for those with severe symptoms and those considered most vulnerable to COVID-19, such as the elderly, those with life-threatening ailments, and pregnant women.

PARIS - A French medical body urged pet owners on Wednesday to take precautions like washing hands after stroking dogs or cats, saying the risk of catching COVID-19 from animals ""cannot be ruled out.""
Even though there is no evidence yet that domestic animals can transmit the virus to humans or get sick from it, there could be a potential risk, said the French Academy of Medicine, which advises the government on epidemics and has set up a dedicated COVID-19 monitoring group.
The SARS outbreak of 2002-2003, caused by a coronavirus genetically close to COVID-19, was able to infect several animal species including racoons, cats and hamsters, the academy said.
And 2 dogs whose Hong Kong owner was infected with COVID-19 have also tested positive, it said.
One of the dogs had a very low virus count, the academy said, and later tested negative, while the second is still being monitored. 
Neither have displayed any signs of illness, but ""these scientific observations suggest that COVID-19 can be transmitted to dogs by a contaminated owner,"" it said.
But it noted that there is nothing to suggest so far that dogs can infect humans or other animals.
While reiterating that France's Anses health agency and the World Organization for Animal Health consider animal-to-human transmission unlikely, the academy nevertheless advised pet owners to ""reinforce"" their hygiene measures, including regular hand-washing after touching their pet and ""not allowing them to lick your face.""
It also recommended separating an infected owner from their animal companion ""during the period that the sick person may excrete the virus,"" for example when coughing.
But the academy emphasized that ""in a home where a sick person has COVID-19, the risk for people living under the same roof is much bigger from contact with the sick person than with the pet.""
""Particularly in periods of confinement, the pet is more a friend than a danger,"" it added.
The World Health Organization recently stated there was ""no evidence that a dog, cat or any pet can transmit COVID-19.""

Philippine Sports Commission (PSC) chairman William “Butch” Ramirez on Wednesday said he has directed government sports psychologists to aid athletes to cope with the postponement of the 2020 Summer Olympics.
Japan and the International Olympic Committee have agreed to push the games back until 2021, hoping that the threat of the coronavirus has waned by then.
However, the postponement could inflict a toll on the morale of local athletes, especially boxers Eumir Marcial and Irish Magno, pole vaulter EJ Obiena and gymnast Carlos Yulo, who have all endured heavy training to prepare for the Games.
“We have mobilized our sports psychology unit to actively check on our athletes and conduct guidance counselling (online or by phone for now) for our athletes who might need their support given the challenges which resulted from these developments,” Ramirez said.
Other Filipinos actively pursuing to get themselves qualified for the Tokyo Games include Olympic silver medalist Hidilyn Diaz, judoka Kyomi Watanabe, skateboarder Margielyn Didal and world champion amateur boxer Nesthy Petecio.
Ramirez said he supports the IOC’s decision to postpone the Games for everyone’s safety.
“I have always expressed that I favor its (Olympics) postponement, given the way this crisis seems to be taking,” he said.
“As I have mentioned before, safety and health of everyone is a top priority.”

BEIJING - China lifted tough restrictions on the province at the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak on Wednesday after a months-long lockdown as the country reported no new domestic cases.
But there were another 47 imported infections from overseas, the National Health Commission said, as the number of cases brought into the country continued to swell.
In total, 474 imported infections have been diagnosed in China -- mostly Chinese nationals returning home according to the foreign ministry.
Four more people died, health officials said Wednesday, 3 in central Hubei province where the virus first emerged late last year.
China announced Tuesday that the lockdown would be lifted on more than 50 million people in Hubei, with residents now allowed to leave if healthy, with some airports and train stations opening.
Hubei ordered the shutdown in January but had been gradually easing rules and permitting people to move about within the province and return to work over recent days.
Hubei transport official Wang Benju said in a press briefing on Wednesday that all transport restrictions in the province except Wuhan will end by Friday.
The city of Wuhan -- the initial epicenter of the outbreak -- will allow residents to leave from April 8, and allow incoming trains to the city from March 28.
Wuhan airport will resume domestic passenger flights starting the same day, authorities said Wednesday -- but will not operate flights to and from Beijing.
Trains will begin arriving into all Wuhan stations from March 28, said Bao Liqun, deputy CEO of China Railway Wuhan Group. 
Schools remain closed, however.
New cases have slowed dramatically over the last month.
But as nations globally struggle to contain the pandemic, surging numbers of imported cases in China are fueling anxiety about a possible second wave of infections just as the country seems to be bringing its outbreak under control.
Many cities have brought in tough rules to quarantine arrivals, and all Beijing-bound international flights are being diverted to other urban centers where passengers are screened for the virus.
There have been more than 81,200 cases of COVID-19 in China and 3,281 deaths from the virus.

MANILA - The Commission on Human Rights (CHR) on Wednesday urged the government to provide sufficient support for frontline workers battling the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.
""To truly honor their sacrifices, we reiterate our call for expedient provision of sufficient protection gears and supplies, transportation, and other support that all frontline workers need,"" CHR spokesperson Jacqueline Ann de Guia said in a statement.
The agency also urged the public to be truthful about their travel histories and conditions in order to protect front-liners ""who risk their lives to defend and protect the right to health and safety of everyone.""
""In the same vein, we call for transparency and respect for human rights during the quarantine period to prevent any abuses that can mar the efforts to contain COVID-19,"" De Guia added.
CHR made the call as the world observed the international day for the right to the truth concerning gross human rights violations and for the dignity of victims.
""As we commemorate this day, let us pay tribute to the victims of extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances, and torture by demanding for truth and accountability. We can only fully honor their dignity and the immense suffering of their families who are left behind by ensuring that full justice is attained and necessary reparation is given,"" De Guia said.
She added: ""Similarly, we honor and laud those who unrelentingly defend the victims of human rights abuses and denounce such violations even at the expense of risking their lives. Their sacrifice and courage fuel the promotion and protection of the human rights of all, particularly the vulnerable ones.""
To date, the Philippines has recorded 636 COVID-19 cases with 38 deaths, while 26 has recovered.

,Mar 25 2020,nCov,EXPLAINER: Why are malaria pills being used against coronavirus?,"Deena Beasley, Reuters","


Kylene Karnuth, a clinical lab scientist, works with coronavirus samples as researchers begin a trial to see whether malaria treatment hydroxychloroquine can prevent or reduce the severity of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, Minnesota, US, March 19, 2020. Craig Lassig, Reuters


Older malaria drugs are being studied, and in some cases used, to treat or try to prevent infection with the new coronavirus, even though there is no firm evidence to show they are effective.
Studies are underway in a number of countries, including China, France and the United States, to see whether the pills - chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine - may have a role to play in the rapidly spreading pandemic.
US President Donald Trump has touted the malaria drugs as ""a game changer."" But the Food and Drug Administration and other health experts said trials must first ensure the medicines are effective and safe for use in this patient population.
WHY ARE MALARIA DRUGS UNDER CONSIDERATION?
There are currently no vaccines or US-approved treatments for the highly contagious COVID-19 respiratory illness that has killed more than 18,000 worldwide, so even the most severely ill patients largely receive only supportive care such as breathing assistance.
On its website, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says some US clinicians have reported anecdotal use of hydroxychloroquine at different doses.
Chloroquine is a synthetic form of quinine, which is found on the bark of the cinchona plant. It has been used for hundreds of years in South America to treat fever.
Chloroquine was first synthesized in the 1930s. A version called hydroxychloroquine, in use since the 1950s, is considered to be less toxic, according to studies. Both drugs can cause serious side effects, including vision loss, heart problems or even death, if used incorrectly.
The drugs are used to combat malaria, which is caused by a parasite spread through mosquito bites, because they interrupt its ability to digest a host's blood cells.
Scientists have detailed biochemical proprieties of chloroquine that indicate it could be used against some viral infections. These include direct antiviral effects, such as blocking steps needed by certain viruses to replicate, and its ability to suppress production and release of proteins involved in inflammatory complications of several viral diseases.
In addition to malaria, hydroxychloroquine is also used to treat lupus and rheumatoid arthritis.
WHAT DOES THE DATA SAY?
Data has begun to emerge from some coronavirus trials, but most information so far is preliminary.
A French team last week said initial results from a 24-patient trial of hydroxychloroquine showed that 25 percent of patients given the drug still carried the coronavirus after 6 days, compared with 90 percent of patients given a placebo. But the trial is small and results on patient outcomes are still awaited.
Chinese researchers last month reported trial results showing that chloroquine treatment of COVID-19 patients had clinical and virologic benefit versus a comparison group. It has been added as a recommended treatment for the illness in China, where the virus first emerged in December.
This week, the Journal of Zhejiang University reported disappointing results from a 30-patient Shanghai study of hydroxychloroquine. It showed the drug worked no better than standard care for patients with COVID-19.
The University of Minnesota has launched a 1,500-person trial to see whether hydroxychloroquine can prevent or reduce the severity of COVID-19 in people exposed to the virus - including health-care workers and family members of infected people.
Other trials of the malaria drugs are ongoing or set to start in the United Kingdom, Norway and Thailand.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, whose state is the epicenter of the US outbreak with more than 25,000 cases, on Sunday said it had acquired hundreds of thousands of doses of the malaria drugs to use in a clinical trial.
IS THERE ENOUGH TO GO AROUND?
In the United States, prescriptions for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have already spiked and are in short supply, according to pharmacists.
Several makers of the generic medicines said they are increasing production of chloroquine pills. Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd, Mylan NV and Bayer AG have donated large quantities of the drugs to health authorities.
PRESCRIPTION ONLY!
Health officials caution that no one should be taking these drugs to treat or prevent coronavirus infection without medical supervision and a prescription.
In Arizona, a man died and his wife was hospitalized after taking a non-medical form of chloroquine used to fight parasites in aquariums.
""Given the uncertainty around COVID-19, we understand that people are trying to find new ways to prevent or treat this virus, but self-medicating is not the way to do so,” said Dr. Daniel Brooks, medical director of the poison and drug information center at Arizona-based Banner Health.

MADRID - Spain's coronavirus death toll overtook that of China on Wednesday, rising to 3,434 after 738 people died over the past 24 hours, the government said. 
Across the world, only Italy now has a higher death toll than that of Spain. In China, where the virus emerged late last year, 3,281 people have died. 
The spiraling number of deaths came as Spain entered the 11th day of an unprecedented lockdown to try and rein in the COVID-19 epidemic that has now infected 47,610 people, the health ministry said.
As the authorities stepped up testing, the number of cases showed a 20 percent increase on the figures for Tuesday, while the death toll showed a 27 percent rise over the same period.
Despite the national lockdown imposed on March 14, which is to be extended until April 11, both deaths and infections have continued to mount, with officials warning this week would be particularly bad. 
""We are approaching the peak,"" the ministry's emergencies coordinator Fernando Simon said in announcing the figures.
Health authorities are hoping it will soon become clear whether the lockdown is having the desired effect.
The Madrid region has suffered the brunt of the epidemic with 14,597 infections -- just under a third of the total -- and 1,825 deaths, or 53 percent of the national figure. 
With hospitals on the brink of collapse from the surge in patients, troops have set up a massive field hospital in Madrid's vast IFEMA exhibition center, which currently has 1,500 beds but which could be expanded to take in up to 5,500 people -- making it the largest hospital in Spain.
And with the city's funeral services overwhelmed, officials have commandeered the Palacio de Hielo ice skating rink to serve as a temporary morgue.

LONDON -- (UPDATE) Prince Charles, the eldest son and heir to Queen Elizabeth II, is showing mild symptoms of the new coronavirus but ""otherwise remains in good health,"" his office said Wednesday.
The 71-year-old and his wife Camilla -- who does not have coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) -- are currently self-isolating in Scotland, Clarence House said.
""The Prince of Wales has tested positive for coronavirus,"" it said in a statement, using his official title. 
""He has been displaying mild symptoms but otherwise remains in good health and has been working from home throughout the last few days as usual.
""The Duchess of Cornwall (Camilla) has also been tested but does not have the virus. 
""In accordance with government and medical advice, the prince and the duchess are now self-isolating at home in Scotland.""
The couple were tested by the state-run National Health Service (NHS) in Aberdeenshire in northeast Scotland, it said.
""It is not possible to ascertain from whom the prince caught the virus owing to the high number of engagements he carried out in his public role during recent weeks,"" it added.
Queen Elizabeth II, 93, and her husband Prince Philip, 98, retired to Windsor Castle, outside London, on March 19. 
They brought forward their Easter break by a week because of the coronavirus outbreak. Britain has more than 8,000 confirmed cases of the disease, and 422 people have died.

MANILA - The Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) said Wednesday it would provide a lump-sum cash aid amounting to P5,000 to private sector workers affected by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.
The financial assistance will be extended to workers employed in private establishments that have adopted flexible working arrangements or had to close temporarily because of the lockdown, Labor Secretary Silvestre Bello III told radio DZMM.
All workers nationwide, whether they are permanent, probationary or contractual, are entitled to the cash aid.
Bello said private companies should submit a revised establishment report form (ERF) and the company payroll for the month of February or earlier.
The financial assistance will be disbursed by DOLE's regional, provincial and field offices directly to the employees' payroll account through bank transfer at the soonest possible time upon receipt of complete documentary requirements.
For cash payroll, the financial assistance should be received through money remittance.
DOLE earlier said that about 250,000 workers are expected to benefit from its COVID-19 Adjustment Measures Program (CAMP) with a budget of P1.3 billion.

The Association of Boxing Alliances in the Philippines (ABAP) on Tuesday said it understands the decision to push back the date of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics given the COVID-19 pandemic.
Ed Picson, secretary general of the sport's national governing body, acknowledged that local boxers Eumir Marcial and Irish Magno will adjust.
“Obviously we have no choice but to follow the IOC's pronouncements on when it will happen. Some of us might not like it but these are extraordinary times which call for extraordinary measures,” Picson said hours before the International Olympic Committee and the Japanese Games organizers agreed on the postponement. 
Besides Marcial and Magno, pole-vaulter EJ Obiena and gymnast Carlos Yulo have qualified for the Games.
Hidilyn Diaz, who won silver in the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Games, is a favorite to join those four.
“As to the preparations, if indeed it is postponed, we’ll just need to make adjustments,” Picson said in the same interview prior to the IOC announcement.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and IOC president Thomas Bach agreed Tuesday to postpone this summer's Tokyo Olympics due to the coronavirus pandemic, the Japanese leader said.
After speaking with Bach on the phone, Abe told reporters that they will aim to hold the Olympics and Paralympics next year. It is the first time ever that the quadrennial sporting event has been postponed.
The unprecedented delay will be a major blow to host Japan and is certain to have a cascade of economic, political and social ramifications. It will also pose considerable logistical challenges to Olympic organizers.
The phone talks came amid mounting pressure from athletes and sports organizations to reschedule the Olympics due to the rapid spread of the virus, and just a day after Abe told parliament that the Summer Games cannot be held under the current circumstances, suggesting for the first time that they may have to be postponed.
Athletes have been struggling to train as gyms and other sports facilities have been closed since the virus that broke out in China late last year spread to all of the world's seven continents except Antarctica. -- With a report from Kyodo News

MANILA - The Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) on Tuesday declared a ceasefire with government forces amid the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic raging across the country.
The ceasefire will last from the midnight of March 26 to April 15, 2020 following the recommendation of the National Democratic Front of the Philippines (NDFP), which represents the communist rebels in peace negotiations with the Philippine government.
The CPP ordered its armed wing, the New People's Army (NPA), and its ""people's militias"" to ""cease and desist from carrying out offensive military operations against the armed units and personnel of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP), the Philippine National Police (PNP) and other paramilitary and armed groups attached to the GRP (Government of the Philippines).""
""The purpose of this unilateral ceasefire is to ensure and facilitate necessary, unhampered and immediate medical, health and economic assistance, support and movement of the people brought about by the exigencies of the current COVID-19 worldwide pandemic that has affected a growing number of Filipinos and non-Filipinos alike,"" CCP said in a statement.
However, the NDFP negotiating panel cautioned the NPA and the people's militia to remain on their toes against any hostile actions.
""As in the past, the Duterte government cannot be trusted in any mutual or unilateral ceasefire agreements, as the bombings of communities, harassment, abductions and killings perpetrated by its armed forces continue unabated,"" NDFP peace panel chairperson Fidel Agcaoili said in a statement.
The NDFP also criticized the Philippine government's response to the health crisis, saying many hospitals suffer from shortage of medical frontliners and supplies.
""Essential testing for COVID-19 is hijacked by a few politicians, their families and staff, and other so-called very important persons. Hundreds of thousands of workers and farmers, and those in the informal sector affected by the 'lockdowns' are still kept in the dark where to get their families’ next meals for many days already,"" it added.

Philippines declares ceasefire with communist rebels amid Luzon lockdown

Last week, President Rodrigo Duterte ordered a ceasefire with communist rebels as the Luzon island was placed under enhanced community quarantine to halt the spread of the novel coronavirus.
The President ordered the Department of National Defense (DND), the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG), AFP, and PNP to ""cease and desist from carrying out offensive military and police operations during the ceasefire period"" from March 19 to April 15, 2020.

MANILA - President Rodrigo Duterte on Tuesday night told the Filipino people not to be afraid after the country's coronavirus cases surged past 500, a week after declaring a public health emergency and sealing off Luzon island to contain the spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
""Huwag kayong matakot. Nandito ‘yong gobyerno ninyo para kayo pagsilbihan at totoong pagsilbihan,"" he said in an address to the nation.
(Don't be afraid. The government is here to serve you.)
The President, who has sought additional powers from Congress to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, said the government would provide basic essentials to the public.
Financial aid will also be provided, especially for the marginalized and vulnerable groups, he added.
""Halos lahat ho makatanggap. Eh hindi naman lahat, ‘yong kagaya ni Bong Go, hindi naman niya tanggapin ‘yan. Gagawin namin ang lahat. Hindi namin kayo pababayaan,"" he said.
(Almost everyone will receive [assistance]. But not everyone, like [Sen.] Bong Go, he will not accept it. We will do everything. We will not abandon you.)

""I repeat: Stay at home. Huwag matigas ang ulo. (Don't be stubborn.) The outcome of this war depends largely on you as well,"" he said.
With more than two weeks to go until the enhanced community quarantine ends for 57 million people, Duterte sees a silver lining.
""Yes, things will not be easy. [But] we Filipinos are tough. Mas malakas ang Pilipino sa anumang hamon (The Filipino people is stronger than any adversity). Now, we all must do what we can and must. Para sa ating bayan. (For our nation),"" he said.

Valerie Alvez and her team are creating PPE out of eco-friendly material taffeta, a water-repellent fabric.
The noted fashion designer said she and her husband Charles Calunod offered their services in response to the dwindling supplies of PPE.
""I don’t want to take sole credit, as this was, and still is, a team effort. We are actually a very small but determined team that started with making and donating masks. Everything actually just fell into place and now it has snowballed into this,"" Alvez told ABS-CBN News.
""I was hesitant about posting this publicly but I figured we needed all the support we can get, and in case others also wanted to help as well,"" she added.
The customized black suit PPE they made has been approved by the Department of Health (DOH), Alvez said.
""This is disposable and one-time use only,"" she clarified.

 
On her Facebook page, the designer is calling her friends in the industry to help create protective gears for healthcare workers.

MANILA - The Commission on Human Rights (CHR) on Tuesday cautioned the government in exercising additional powers granted by Congress to address the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.
""We note the eagerness of the government to address this health crisis once and for all by mustering its power and resources.

Conferring such exercise of authority to the President shall only be for a limited period, the agency said, citing Article 6, Section 23 of the 1987 Philippine Constitution.

US drugmaker Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc has said it had identified hundreds of antibodies that could treat or prevent the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and was preparing to begin clinical trials by early summer, sending the drugmaker's shares up 12 percent.
The company will select the top 2 antibodies to develop a ""cocktail"" treatment and scale up its manufacturing to produce 200,000 doses per month by the end of summer.
At least a dozen other drugmakers are currently working on vaccines, antivirals and other treatments to help those infected with the fast-spreading virus, with some antivirals already being used in trials.
Regeneron has a far more robust history of drug development for pandemics, said Oppenheimer analyst Hartaj Singh, noting that during the Ebola outbreak, the US drugmaker's antibody cocktail demonstrated the greatest effect.
""It seems acute treatments will be needed for hundreds of thousands of cases, and there could recurring outbreaks in the future... investors are now ascribing greater value to Regeneron stock for this,"" he added.
Pfizer Inc has agreed to co-develop a vaccine with German drugmaker BioNTech SE as well as develop antiviral treatments that could potentially be used with Gilead Sciences Inc's antiviral called remdesivir against the coronavirus.
Johnson & Johnson and Sanofi have also teamed up with a US government agency to develop virus vaccine candidates.
Drug developer Moderna Inc, which dosed its first patient with its experimental vaccine on Monday, has made the most headway among companies engaged in coronavirus vaccine development efforts.
""Regeneron is arguably the most efficient antibody developer in the biopharma industry and should deserve a higher valuation for its strong innovation capability,"" SVB Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said.
The company is also considering testing whether its antibody cocktail could be used along with the vaccines in development, spokeswoman Alexandra Bowie told Reuters.
""There's a lot of things racing towards the finish line, all at once. It's yet to be seen what the exact combination would be,"" Bowie added.
The efforts are a part of its partnership with the US Department of Health and Human Services. Regeneron also said it was working with the US Biomedical Advanced Research and Defense Authority to its increase manufacturing capacity.
In addition to the development of the antibody cocktail, the drugmaker is testing its rheumatoid arthritis drug, Kevzara, with partner Sanofi against the virus.
The company's shares were up at $494.99 in afternoon trading.
As of March 24, COVID-19, which first emerged in China in December last year, has infected some 378,000 people in 174 countries, among whom 16,500 have died.

BEIJING - China announced Tuesday an end to travel curbs at the epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic, as governments around the world tightened lockdowns affecting 1.7 billion people in a desperate effort to slow the spread of the deadly disease.
Hubei province, where the novel coronavirus emerged late last year, will allow healthy residents to travel from midnight, officials said, 2 months after they were ordered to stay indoors.
The relaxation of rules, which will not apply to the hardest-hit city of Wuhan until April 8, comes as Britain and New Zealand joined nations in Europe, the Middle East, North America and Asia in declaring countrywide lockdowns in a bid to staunch the flow of new infections.
The extraordinary measures around the world continued to throw up horrifying tales; soldiers in Spain tasked with fighting the outbreak reported finding abandoned elderly people -- some dead -- at retirement homes.
And on the deserted streets of New York, one psychologist who ventured out voiced fears over the long-term mental health of everyone affected.
""I'm scared for me and patients that this could go on for months,"" said Lauren, who declined to give her surname.
Anxiety and depression ""all gets heightened at a time like this,"" she added.
The financial impact of economies grinding to a halt continued to unnerve policymakers, who opened the spigots and flooded the markets with yet more cash -- their latest effort to keep the wheels turning.
In the United States, the Federal Reserve unveiled an unprecedented bond-buying program, in a move not seen since the global financial crisis more than a decade ago.
The Fed, which has already slashed interest rates to record lows, said it will buy unlimited amounts of Treasury debt and take steps to lend directly to small and medium-sized firms hammered by state lockdowns across the country.
Asian markets cheered the news, with Tokyo, Hong Kong and Seoul rocketing in their latest rollercoaster session.
That upswing came despite US politicians' failure to sign off on a nearly $2 trillion package that President Donald Trump says is aimed at supporting ailing enterprises, and helicoptering cash to American families.
His opponents say the bill is too heavily weighted to bailing out big business.
The British government, which has faced accusations it dithered over the health crisis and needlessly allowed schools to remain open far longer than European counterparts, came into line on Monday.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson ordered a 3-week shutdown of ""non-essential"" shops and services and banned gatherings of more than 2 people. 
""Stay at home,"" Johnson said in a televised address, as he unveiled unprecedented peacetime measures.
The announcement came after crowds of people were seen enjoying weekend sunshine in parks and countryside, prompting calls for tougher action.
World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned that the global pandemic was clearly accelerating.
The number of coronavirus deaths has topped 16,200, with more than 360,000 declared infections in 174 countries and territories, according to an AFP tally.
Tedros said it took 67 days from the beginning of the outbreak in China in December for the virus to infect the first 100,000 people worldwide.
In comparison, it required only 11 days for the second 100,000 cases and just 4 days for the third 100,000, he said.
Tedros acknowledged that many countries were struggling to take more aggressive measures because of a lack of resources but said ""we are not helpless bystanders.
""We can change the trajectory of this pandemic,"" he said.
There was a glimmer of hope Monday in figures from Italy, the European ground zero of COVID-19.
New infections in the continent's hardest-hit country dipped to just shy of 5,000, down from over 6,500 on Saturday.
Its daily death toll also fell slightly, although cumulatively the country has recorded more than 6,000 fatalities, far-exceeding even that of China.
In the United States, New York city was under lockdown, with its usual logjam commute now just a trickle of pharmacists, grocery store workers and medical staff.
But Trump -- who faces re-election in November and is keen to avoid extended economic damage in the US -- told reporters he would soon be ""opening up our country to business because our country was meant to be open.""
China's authoritarian government has trumpeted its response to the crisis since doctors began to get a handle on cases of COVID-19, and on Tuesday state media proudly reported that a popular section of the Great Wall would re-open.
Visitors have to wear a mask and stay a meter from everyone else, media said.
Overall, China had 78 new infections on Tuesday, the vast majority brought in from overseas.
Meanwhile pressure was growing on the International Olympic Committee to speed up its decision about postponing the Tokyo Games as athletes criticized the 4-week deadline and the United States joined calls to delay the competition.
A growing group of national Olympic committees and sports bodies including World Athletics have called for the Games, set to start on July 24, to be pushed back, an outcome that now appears inevitable.

,Mar 22 2020,nCov,Philippines' health chief tests negative for COVID-19: official,ABS-CBN News,"
MANILA (UPDATE) - Philippine Health Secretary Francisco Duque III tested negative for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), an official of his agency said Sunday.
""Negative ang COVID-19 result for Sec. Duque. He is okay,"" Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire told ABS-CBN News in a text message.
(The COVID-19 result for Sec. Duque is negative.)
""Si Secretary Duque po ay nasa maayos na kondisyon. Siya po ay nagtatrabaho pa rin. Kakakausap pa lang po namin sa kaniya,"" Vergeire said later in a televised press briefing.
(Secretary Duque is in good conidtion. He is still working, we had just talked to him.)
Duque, 63, was placed on home quarantine since Wednesday after he was exposed to a coronavirus-infected patient -- also a senior health official.
He suffers from underlying conditions such as asthma and hypertension, which makes him vulnerable to the fast-spreading disease that has so far claimed 25 lives in the Philippines.

Philippine health chief Duque says he's 'okay,' awaits coronavirus test result

Duque earlier told radio DZMM he and his wife, also a doctor, were monitoring each other. His wife also developed coughs.
Last Tuesday, the health department confirmed that one of its directors working in its central office had contracted COVID-19.

MANILA - Philippines is now conducting an average of 950 tests per day to fast-track the screening of the coronavirus disease (COVID-10) cases, the health department said Saturday, amid mounting criticisms of slow detection of the illness.
The Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) in Alabang, Muntinlupa CIty can run 600 tests per day, Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said in a press briefing.
To help process the samples, the health department also opened 3 sub-national laboratories that can conduct 100 tests each per day, she added.
The other sub-national lab can administer 50 tests. Senior citizens, pregnant women and those suffering from severe symptoms are currently prioritized for the testing.
""Hindi lahat ng PUIs ay kailangan i-test. Kung may mild symptoms, hindi na kailangan i-test,"" Vergeire added.
(Not all PUIs (patients under investigation) should be tested. If they only have mild symptoms, no need for test.)

 
Latest data from the health department's tracking website showed there were 570 PUIs while 6,321 were considered persons under monitoring (PUMs).
Earlier in the week, the DOH rejected calls for a mass testing since it was not yet needed, and there were insufficient testing kits.
But Vergeire assured the public that the country now has sufficient supply of test kits to diagnose COVID-19 cases.
China, South Korea and Brunei have recently donated more than 100,000 test kits to the Philippines, she said.
During the press briefing, Vergeire also said the health department does not currently recommend the use of chloroquine in treating COVID-19 patients.
The anti-malaria pills, she said, is an off-label drug and comes with side effects. It should not be taken as a prophylaxis or a drug used to prevent infection.
""Hindi po puwede uminom kayo nito at mape-prevent na nito na mahahawa kayo o magkakaroon kayo ng COVID-19,"" Vergeire warned.
(Drinking this will not prevent you from getting COVID-19.)
As of Saturday afternoon, the Philippines has recorded 307 cases of the novel coronavirus. Of the total tally, 19 had died while 13 had recovered.

MANILA (UPDATE) - Four Filipino senior citizens survived the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), bringing the country's total recoveries to 13.
""Ito po ay isang napakagandang balita para sa ating lahat amidst all of this fear, confusion and amidst this crisis,"" Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said in a press briefing.
(This is such a good news for us amid all the fear, confusion and crisis.)
Among those who recovered was an elderly couple from San Juan City. They were earlier tagged as PH16 and PH17 or patients 16 and 17.
The 70-year-old man and his 69-year-old wife were discharged from the hospital on March 19. Both had hypertension.
Another patient, a 75-year-old woman from Makati City, was meanwhile discharged from the hospital on March 17. She previously traveled to US and was exposed to a COVID-19 case.
The other recovery is a 72-year-old man from Batangas who had exposure to a known COVID-19 case.
The man, who also suffers from hypertension, was reported as a severe case and had recovered. He was discharged from the hospital on March 21.
The fifth recovery is a 35-year-old woman from Rizal who had no recent travel history or exposure to a COVID-19 patient. The woman, who had pre-existing asthma, was discharged from the hospital on March 15.

 
COVID-19 may be fatal for the elderly, the immunocompromised, and those with underlying medical condition but 80 percent of cases globally showed a high chance of recovery ""without needing special treatment,"" according to the World Health Organization.
WHO said COVID-19 symptoms include fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea.
Meanwhile, Vergeire said there had been no concrete proof of a recurring COVID-19.
""Merong nagsasabi that there is reinfection, merong nagsasabi that there is recurrence, pero hanggang sa ngayon dito sa atin, sa bansang ito, wala pang napapatunayan na ganiyan. At hanggang sa ngayon, all over the globe, wala pang hard evidence for this,"" she said.

As of Saturday, the Philippines has 307 confirmed cases of COVID-19, including 19 deaths.
To stop the pathogen's spread, President Rodrigo Duterte on Thursday placed all Luzon households under home quarantine until April 12.
The novel coronavirus, which has spread to 176 countries and territories, has infected more than 234,000 people and claimed 9,800 lives.

MANILA - A local manufacturer of disinfectants on Saturday assured daily production of alcohol amid the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.
""Every day we are delivering. Our production is 24/7,"" Philusa Corporation general manager Neogin Evangelista told radio DZMM.
Philusa Corp. is the distributor of RHEA Isopropyl Alcohol, Cleene Ethyl Alcohol, and other hygienic and medical products.
Evangelista said there has been a shortage of alcohol supply in supermarkets since February due to the surge in demand.
Contagion fears stoked panic-buying among consumers, he said.
""The orders we received from the retailers was almost more than a year's worth in 2019. That's how huge the surge in demand [is],"" Evangelista said.
Before the national government imposed an enhanced community quarantine in Luzon to curb the spread of COVID-19, alcohol products in supermarkets were also picked clean.
He said supermarkets would have ample supplies of disinfectants once consumer behavior normalizes.
""Once it's back to normal consumer behavior, eventually there will be stocks in the shelves of our retailers,"" he said.
To address panic buying and hoarding among consumers, the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) has set a limit for every household.
Consumers are only allowed to purchase up to 2 pieces of 70 percent solution anti-septic or disinfectant alcohol, 2 pieces of hand sanitizer, 2 pieces of disinfecting liquids, 5 pieces of bath soap, 10 pieces of toilet paper and 5 pieces of N-88 face mask or N-95 face mask.

MANILA (UPDATE) - The Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) on Saturday assured the free movement of cargo, whether food or non-food, amid the enhanced community quarantine in Luzon to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus.
This, after several manufacturers, distributors and retailers complained that trucks, including those carrying raw materials for food production, were reportedly being barred at checkpoints.
""All cargoes should be free to move... They should not be held or delayed, except if they are subjected to the usual precautionary measures,"" DTI Undersecretary Ruth Castelo said in radio DZMM.
The agency has released Memorandum Circular No. 20-06, guaranteeing the unhampered movement of cargo and permitting the transit of personnel of all establishments that are allowed to operate during the lockdown
The circular covers enterprises engaged in the manufacture of all food and essential products, medicine, and medical supplies such as, but not limited to, soap and detergents, diapers, feminine hygiene products, tissue, wipes, and toilet papers, disinfectants, medicine and vitamins; medical personal protective equipment, gloves, and masks.
This also includes businesses engaged in distribution and logistics to support manufacturing activities, including cargo handling, warehousing, trucking and port operations.
Retail establishments such as supermarkets, groceries, hypermarkets, convenience stores, and pharmacies and drug stores, and export and Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) companies are also allowed to continue to operate.
""While the MC ensures the smooth and unimpeded movement of all cargoes in the Luzon area, when stopped at any checkpoint for random inspection, the cargo manifest or delivery receipt indicating the destination, nature, and quantity of the loaded goods/cargoes must be presented for them not be delayed,"" the DTI said.
Transit of personnel of these establishments shall be allowed in all checkpoints upon presentation of a valid company-issued identification card, proof of residence or certificate of employment. 
To further facilitate this, an official inter-agency task force ID issued by the DTI shall be presented at checkpoints, instead of the usual identification requirements.
DTI Secretary Ramon Lopez said he considered these interruptions as birth pains to the implementation of the enhanced community quarantine guidelines.
""Right now we're seeing improvements,"" he said in a separate interview.
Lopez urged local government units (LGUs) to follow the guidelines set by the national government.
""Because we are in state of public health emergency, the policy made by the inter-agency task force must be followed,"" he added.
Lopez also assured the public there is sufficient supply of basic goods and necessities.
""We will not run short of supply if there's free movement of cargo. We are coordinating closely with the police on the checkpoints,"" he said.
In a separate briefing, PNP spokesman Police Brig. Gen. Bernard Banac urged employees and drivers to always bring their IDs and certificates of employment.
""Kahapon pa lang, naging maluwag na. Wala na pong congestion sa ating mga quarantine control stations. Tuloy-tuloy nang nakakaraan ang mga ito. Ipakita lang po ang inyong IDs at certificates,"" he said at the government-led Laging Handa briefing on state-run PTV4 .

Meat processors' group warns of shortage of their products by mid-April

Johnlu Koa, founder of the Philippine Baking Industry Group, an association of large-scale bakery operators in the Philippines, said some of their deliveries were held at checkpoints.
However, he assured that there is a stable supply of bread for Luzon as production continues.
""We would like to tell you that everybody has gone out of their way to make sure flour, sugar and other basic ingredients arrive in their factory, through hell and high water,"" said Koa, also founder and CEO of The French Baker and Lartizan.
Philippine Association of Meat Processors, Inc. (PAMPI) vice president Jerome Ong also complained the delay of deliveries of the materials due to the checkpoints.
However, he also assured the public that there is sufficient supply of canned goods and processed meat as millions of Filipinos are under lockdown.
""Hinding-hindi tayo mauubusan. Walang dahilan na mag-panic ang ating mga mamimili (We will never run out. Consumers need not panic). We assure everyone there's enough food to feed the country,"" said Ong, president and CEO of CDO Foodsphere, Inc.

MANILA - Batangas recorded its fifth case of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the provincial government said Friday.
Details about the patient have yet to be released. It was also not immediately clear if the patient is part of the country's current tally of infections, which is at 230.
The provincial government said it was keeping watch on 50 people considered as patients under investigation (PUIs). Of the number, 31 were in hospitals while 19 were under home-quarantine.
Some 1,189 people, tagged as persons under monitoring (PUMs), were also undergoing self-isolation.
Batangas Governor Hermilando ""Dodo"" Mandanas, in an interview on ANC, said the province lacked facilities to treat COVID-19 patients.
""It's still very inadequate but we have to deal with what we have. No need to panic. Handle the situation with what we have. We need to be creative,"" he said.
Instead, the province has designated isolation areas for possible carriers of the disease.
“We have already found a suitable place for quarantine for those confirmed with COVID-19 case,"" the governor said.
The province recorded its first 2 confirmed cases of COVID-19 on March 13 -- a 79-year-old woman who had a travel history to London, and her 72-year-old brother.

VATICAN CITY - The Catholic Church on Friday granted forgiveness -- under certain conditions -- for the sins of the faithful struck by the novel coronavirus.
A decree published by the Vatican also covers healthcare workers and those who pray for their well-being. Relatives who care for their sick family members are also forgiven.
The condition involves the sick saying a certain number of prayers.
Those who pray for the caregivers' well-being must also read the Bible ""for at least half an hour.""
The decree was issued a day after Italy overtook China for the most number of deaths from the new illness.
The pandemic has killed more than 3,400 people in the Mediterranean country.
Vatican City itself has confirmed 1 infection.
Pope Francis was reported to have been tested for the virus as a precaution after coming down with a cold last month.
The Vatican has never confirmed or denied the report, but has stressed repeatedly that the 83-year-old pontiff does not have COVID-19.

Fernando G. Sepe Jr., ABS-CBN News


MANILA - The Philippines is set to receive thousands in additional diagnostic kits, raising hopes for a wider testing of suspected new coronavirus cases, which will give authorities a clearer picture of the real extent of infections in the country.
A number of critically-ill patients classified as “under investigation” had died before test results arrived to determine if they were positive for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), said Dr. Rontgene Solante, citing reports sent to the Philippine Society for Microbiology and Infectious Diseases where he is a former president.
“Mortalities are reported but have not been confirmed because... the turnaround time is long,” he told ABS-CBN News.
“But they have been treated already as possible COVID-19 (case) based on the clinical manifestations.”
As of Friday night, several doctors had also been infected, some in “severe guarded conditions,” he said, highlighting the vulnerabilities of health workers dealing with the fast-spreading virus.
“We know what we are doing but there is still an element of fear because you don’t know those who have the virus roaming around, not necessarily in the hospital,” he said.
TEST MILD CASES
With some 125,000 test kits set to arrive from China and South Korea, and new testing centers opened, health officials are expecting results to come much sooner than the current waiting period that could reach 6 to 7 days.
Aside from the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine, testing facilities are now available at the San Lazaro Hospital, Lung Center of the Philippines, Baguio General Hospital and Medical Center, Vicente Sotto Memorial Medical Center in Cebu City, and Southern Philippines Medical Center in Davao City.

DOH announces 5 labs to speed up COVID-19 testing, says 100,000 test kits donated

Testing should now include patients even with mild symptoms “because they can still be a source of infection in the community without us knowing it,” said Solante, who heads the infectious diseases section of the government-run San Lazaro Hospital in Manila.
“We will have a good idea of how many are really infected with the virus,” he said, adding that positive cases with mild symptoms may be kept in home quarantine and isolated from the rest of the family.
Exposed family members should be placed under strict quarantine, he said.
Unless a confirmed COVID-19 patient with mild symptoms has underlying conditions such as diabetes, or if he or she is old, he or she is not likely to worsen into a moderate or severe case, which could happen in 3 to 4 days, the doctor said.
DEPLETED
The long wait for test results could also deplete the supply of personal protective equipment (PPE), which include goggles, face masks, gowns and disposable shoe cover, he said.
Once a patient under investigation is confined, he is kept in an isolation room where doctors, nurses, and other hospital attendants need to wear PPEs.
Assuming 7 people attend to such a patient in 3 shifts, the hospital needs 21 sets of protective equipment for a lone patient suspected of having COVID-19, said Solante.
“The longer you wait for those (COVID-19) tests, you’ll be using a lot of PPEs and that’s the reason why most hospitals are depleted of PPEs,” he said.
The entire island of Luzon is currently under strict community quarantine to contain the spread of the new coronavirus, which has killed 18 people out 230 confirmed cases as of March 20.

DOH announces 13 new COVID-19 cases, 1 death; total cases at 230

By keeping people at home and limiting movement outside to what’s essential, authorities were hoping to flatten the growth curve of the virus within a month.
“We risk our lives because of the call of duty and I sincerely call on those in the community to seriously comply with our community quarantine,” Solante said.
“It’s the one strategy that hopefully will eventually work.”

MANILA - The Commission on Human Rights (CHR) on Friday gave caution on arrests over violations of guidelines of the enhanced community quarantine in Luzon, saying this should be ""strictly done"" within the bounds of the law. 
In a statement, the agency said it received complaints about arrests of taxi drivers, a homeless senior citizen and minors who reportedly did not comply with the curfew at the onset of the lockdown.
Government enforced a strict home quarantine of more than 50 million people in the main northern island of Luzon on Tuesday midnight in a bid to arrest the spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). 
""In the first few days of the quarantine, many of these poor and homeless folks were arrested as many attempted to continue with their livelihood,"" CHR spokesperson Jacqueline Ann de Guia said in a statement.
She said Filipinos who flout the quarantine should not be automatically meted with arrest as human dignity should not be diminished or compromised.
""Arrests, including warrantless arrests, must be strictly done within the legal standards inscribed in the law,"" it said.
De Guia stressed that the enhanced community quarantine is a health and safety measure, not a peace and order solution.
""It is never meant as a peace and order solution as emphasized by the President himself when he said that the quarantine is not tantamount to martial law,"" she said.
She said the poor and homeless bear the brunt of the lockdown measure: the homeless lack proper dwelling while the poor are compelled to go to work to put food on the table, she said.
""CHR recognizes that the government recently instituted programs to address the socio-economic needs of the vulnerable sectors during the quarantine period. But it must be stressed that this urgent matter requires swiftness and due diligence to ensure that no person will be left behind,"" De Guia added.
Officials earlier said quarantine violators may be arrested.

BRUSSELS - The number of coronavirus disease cases recorded in Belgium surged past 2,000 on Friday and the number of deaths jumped by 16 to 37, authorities said.
According to the country's national crisis center, 462 new confirmed cases of the virus have been reported, bringing the total to 2,257 in a country of 11.4 million people.
Two-thirds of the new cases overnight were in Dutch-speaking Flanders, in northern Belgium.
Emmanuel Andre, a spokesman for the crisis center, said Belgium was better prepared than Italy had been when it became the focus of the European outbreak, but that hospitals would need more space for the most serious cases.
In the past 24 hours, another 203 people have been admitted to hospital in Belgium, and 164 of them will require intensive care, such as breathing assistance.
""The average age of those hospitalized is around 60,"" he said. ""In Belgium, we have 1,900 beds equipped with ventilators, and places are being set up today to increase this number.""
""We are expecting demand to increase in the coming days,"" Andre warned.
Europe is now the epicenter of the pandemic that emerged in China in December, with Italy now the hardest country.
Belgium is now one of several European countries to order a national lockdown, although one less sternly enforced than in neighboring France -- and with more exceptions.
Already, bars and restaurants are shut and many people have been asked to work from home and to avoid socializing and crowds, but officials expect the measures to tighten.
""Everyone should respect these measures, and in my opinion, exceptions to the rules will come to an end in the coming days,"" another crisis center spokesman Benoit Ramacker said.

To ensure a steady water supply in Metro Manila households, the National Water Resources Board (NWRB) has increased allocation for the Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System (MWSS) from 42 cubic meters per second (cms) to 46 cms.
""Sa ngayon, sa ganitong panahon na may pangamba ng COVID-19, wala tayong interruption. Kasi nga po gusto natin na kahit anong oras sana [meron], 24/7 po gusto natin ma-target sa ngayon,"" NWRB executive director Sevillo David Jr. told radio DZMM.
(Right now, in this time that we're facing the threat of COVID-19, there will be no water interruption. We want to provide water supply all the time, for 24/7.)
MWSS is the agency that splits water from the reservoir to concessionaires Maynilad and Manila Water. Maynilad distributes water to the capital's west zone, while Manila Water covers the east.
Water is critical in the face of the virus crisis as it is necessary to maintain personal hygiene, with handwashing a vital measure against the disease. Steady water supply is also needed in communities for boosted cleanup and disinfection efforts, and in hospitals amid the rising number of cases and persons under investigation. 
As of Friday, the water level at Angat Dam, where Metro Manila sources nearly all of its water supply, was at 199.3 meters, below its ideal mark of 212 meters.
In March last year, taps ran dry in nearly a million Metro Manila households as the Angat Dam breached its critical level due to lack of rains.
Metro Manila's water utility firms began rotational supply cuts in October last year to avoid a repeat of last summer's water shortage.

MANILA - The Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) on Friday urged garbage collectors to disinfect waste to stem the spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Garbage collectors must disinfect collected waste before they are sent to trash sites, Environment Secretary Roy Cimatu said.
Garbage trucks must also be sanitized before it can start its next round of waste collection, he added.
He also stressed that medical waste, including masks and gloves used by health workers against infectious diseases, needs proper disposal.
The agency will coordinate with local government units on how to properly dispose waste.
As more than 50 million people in Luzon are placed under lockdown, Cimatu said households should segregate and sanitize their trash bags before they are collected.
Households can make their own cleaning solution by mixing 10 to 15 percent of bleach with clean water, he said. - Report from Raya Capulong, ABS-CBN News

MANILA - Manila has waived the payment of rent in markets in the capital city until Luzon's enhanced community quarantine due to the coronavirus has been lifted, the City Council said in a resolution, Thursday.
City Resolution No. 85 grants a ""moratorium to all market stallholders within the City of Manila, whether public or privatized, from paying their rents for the duration of the enhanced community quarantine due to the coronavirus disease.""
This will ""help mitigate the impact of the declaration of enhanced community quarantine, which will greatly affect their liquidity,"" according to the resolution passed on March 19, 2020.
Manila Mayor Isko Moreno earlier wrote a letter urging malls and other establishments to suspend the collection of rent in the capital as most shops are expected to lose their income while Luzon is on a lockdown until April 14, 2020.
President Rodrigo Duterte earlier forced public transportation, malls, parlors, and other establishments not selling food and medicine to cease operations for a month to contain the spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
The global pandemic has infected 230 people in the Philippines as of March 20, 2020. Of those patients, 18 died, 8 recovered, while the rest are still battling the virus, which originated from Wuhan, China.
The Philippines is under a state of calamity as the government sought for more funds to support frontline workers manning hospitals and checkpoints, as well as provide aid for marginalized communities.

NEW YORK - Before coronavirus shut his office, Scott Ford worked with his phone in one hand and chatted with his dozens of co-workers as he paced around their desks at Techstars, a startup accelerator based in Boulder, Colorado.
Now he sits across a shared desk from his wife, a proofreader for a publishing company who demands total silence so she can focus on her job in their newly occupied home office in Superior, Colorado.
""I have no one to talk to, although she sits about 24 inches (61 cm) from me,"" Ford, 50, told Reuters in a phone interview.
""I'll read something and say 'Hey, can I tell you something?' and I'll break her concentration. It drives her crazy.""
Coronavirus is challenging not just health but also home life for an unprecedented number of 2-career American couples forced to work at home, at times in close quarters.
With more women in the US workforce, dual-income families have become the norm, according to Pew Research Center. In 2016, the latest year for which statistics are available, 66 percent of families with children under 18 brought home 2 paychecks, up from 49 percent in 1970.
With COVID-19 closing businesses nationwide, spouses sharing the home office are discovering unsuspected work habits of spouses they thought they knew well.
A meme making the rounds on social media has suggested couples working at home invent an invisible colleague, then blame that colleague for bad behavior such as leaving dirty coffee mugs around the house.
Marriage therapists say 2-career couples must show mutual respect for one another's work habits and set boundaries if they want marital harmony to survive in self-quarantined home offices.
""You have to find ways to build in some distance even if you're in a small space,"" said Alon Gratch, a New York psychologist. ""That could be by working with ear phones and with agreed-upon rules that you don't interrupt each other's work.""
Mark Berkley, 49, a software designer who needs quiet to concentrate, and his wife Susan Halper Berkley, 49, a loquacious executive at a medical communications agency, spent the entire weekend fixing up their attic home office in Maplewood, New Jersey, after their New York offices were shuttered by coronavirus. But their shared workweek had a rocky start.
""I came up at 8:30, facing a deadline at 12. I was storming around, trying to get stuff done. I was relying on other people so I was annoyed, huffing and puffing,"" Halper Berkley said.
""Mark came up at 9 and was like, 'I totally can't concentrate. This is not working.' And took all his stuff downstairs,"" said Halper Berkley, whose house also is now occupied by 2 college-aged sons sent home from their shuttered campuses.
In Arlington, Virginia, a kitchen table now serves as a home office for Sarah Title, 29, a software company manager who lives in a one-bedroom apartment with her fiance Gavin Hilburn, 29, an IT support contractor for the US Department of Veteran Affairs.
Hilburn has been relegated to a kitchen countertop a few feet away.
""I could throw something and hit him. We're getting close to that,"" said Title, adding Hilburn starts his work-at-home days by turning on a televised sports event, muting it but ""still, I can see it out of the corner of my eye.""
At the same time, he has impressed her with other work habits.
""He gets really focused on what he's doing so I'll say something to him and he won't respond real quick. I think it's endearing. It's cute,"" Title said.
Barbara Berger, a New York psychotherapist, said working couples must have ""a really high level of cooperation with time outs and communication"" to weather the coronavirus storm.
""A lot of this has to do with how they got along before this happened. You think you value your partner's work, but do you value theirs as much as you value yours? In a good relationship, that value exists to begin with,"" Berger said.

In early February, the tourism ministry reported P10 billion in losses. That was before COVID-19 began to spread quickly in countries other than China.
The World Travel and Tourism Council estimated that the deadly coronavirus outbreak would cost world tourism at least $22 billion owing to a drop in spending by Chinese tourists.

,Mar 19 2020,nCov,WHO backpedals: No scientific evidence ibuprofen worsens COVID-19,ABS-CBN News,"



MANILA - There is currently no scientific evidence that using ibuprofen can aggravate coronavirus symptoms, the World Health Organization (WHO) said Thursday.
""Based on currently available information, WHO does not recommend against the use of ibuprofen,"" the United Nation's health agency said in a statement.
""We are consulting with physicians treating the patients and are not aware of reports of any negative effects, beyond the usual ones that limit its use in certain populations,"" it added.

Avoid taking ibuprofen for COVID-19 symptoms: WHO

WHO backpedaled to its earlier recommendation cautioning the public on the use of the anti-inflammatory drugs.
WHO spokesman Christian Lindmeier earlier told reporters in Geneva that people suffering from symptoms of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) should avoid taking ibuprofen.
""In the meantime, we recommend using rather paracetamol, and do not use ibuprofen as a self-medication. That's important,"" he said.
Lindmeier added that if ibuprofen had been ""prescribed by the healthcare professionals, then, of course, that's up to them.""
The WHO official made the remark after French Health Minister Olivier Veran warned that the use of ibuprofen and similar anti-inflammatory drugs could be ""an aggravating factor"" in COVID-19 infections.
""In the case of fever, take paracetamol,"" he wrote.
The French minister stressed that patients already being treated with anti-inflammatory drugs should ask advice from their doctor.
Paracetamol must be taken strictly according to the recommended dose, because too much of it can damage the liver.
British pharmaceutical company Reckitt Benckiser, which makes ibuprofen under the brand Nurofen, also said there was no proven scientific evidence linking over-the-counter use of ibuprofen to the worsening of COVID-19 symptoms.

NEW YORK - The United States is to deploy military hospital ships to fight the coronavirus, Donald Trump said Wednesday, as he likened himself to a ""wartime president"" and invoked a Korean War-era law.
As America and Canada announced they were closing their border to non-essential travelers, New York governor Andrew Cuomo said Trump was dispatching the navy's 1,000-room USNS Comfort to the city's harbor.
The moves came as the number of deaths in the United States from COVID-19, the illness caused by the new coronavirus, reached 150, with confirmed cases soaring to more than 9,300, according to a Johns Hopkins University tally. 
US stocks suffered deep losses as Trump tried to downplay fears that the unemployment rate in the world's number one power could spike to 20 percent because of the fast-spreading epidemic.
Meanwhile, America's ""Big Three"" car makers -- General Motors, Fiat Chrysler and Ford -- announced that they would halt operations throughout North America through the end of the month.
Cuomo said Trump had told him that the 894-foot (270-meter) Comfort ship would be sent to New York ""immediately,"" although it was not clear when the military vessel would dock in the US financial capital.
""It's an extraordinary step,"" Cuomo told reporters, adding that it had around 1,000 rooms, including ""operating rooms.""
""It's literally a floating hospital, which will add capacity,"" he added at the press conference. 
Cuomo said he and Trump agreed on the approach to containing the pandemic, which has killed over 8,000 people worldwide and brought cities grinding to a halt.
'INVISIBLE ENEMY'
Trump meanwhile told reporters that he viewed himself as ""a wartime president. I mean, that's what we're fighting. I mean, it's a very tough situation here.""
He added that the United States would ""defeat the invisible enemy,"" and do it ""even faster than we thought.""
Later in the day, he also signed a $100-billion emergency aid package that ensures sick leave to Americans workers who fall ill from the new coronavirus, in a rare example of congressional Democrats, Republicans and the presidency working together.
Two lawmakers, Florida Republican Mario Diaz-Balart and Utah Democrat Ben McAdams, meanwhile became the first known members of Congress to have coronavirus, announcing on Twitter that they had tested positive.
As well as the Comfort, Trump said that the USNS Mercy hospital ship would also be deployed.
The governors of California and Washington state quickly called for it to be dispatched to their shores.
Jay Inslee, governor of Washington, which has been heavily hit by the coronavirus, urged authorities to send it to Puget Sound: ""We think that is the right deployment decision because we are the epicenter of this epidemic. And our medical system will be the first one that is stressed,"" he said.
Navy Spokesman Samuel Boyle said the boats would not treat COVID-19 patients directly but would assist the treatment of other patients in coastal locations where doctors and nurses are focused on the virus.
A defense department source told AFP that the Comfort's readiness to sail would be ""more like weeks than days.""
Trump also invoked the Defense Production Act, signed in 1950 during the Korean War, allowing the government to compel businesses to sign contracts and thus expand production.
It is expected to help speed up production of protective masks and other equipment for medical personnel.
Elsewhere, the Food and Drug Administration said it was investigating rolling out self-swab kits, where citizens test themselves, and Vice President Mike Pence called on hospitals to delay elective surgery.
Deborah Birx, the coronavirus taskforce administrator, warned of a dramatic increase in cases as testing ramps up in the coming days, and forecast that the number of cases will exceed Italy's.
""Our curves will not be stable until sometime next week,"" she said.
Earlier Wednesday, Trump announced the closure of the US-Canada border to non-essential traffic as the coronavirus epidemic intensified in both countries -- but said that trade would not be impacted.
He said he hoped it would open in 30 days, as Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced Can$27 billion (US$18.6 billion) in direct aid to help workers and businesses cope with the economic impact of the pandemic.
On Wall Street Wednesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was hit by another brutal loss to finish below the 20,000-point level for the first time since 2017 despite authorities in the US and elsewhere moving forward with more measures to prop up the economy.
Trump said warnings by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin that the jobless rate could reach 20 percent without a massive government stimulus program was ""an absolute total worst-case scenario.""
In New York, Cuomo announced that he was barring all non-essential businesses from having more than 50 percent of the workforce work outside of their home.

BEIJING - China on Thursday marked a major milestone in its battle against the coronavirus pandemic as it recorded zero domestic infections for the first time since the outbreak emerged, but a spike in imported cases threatened its progress.
The stark reversal comes as nations across the world have shut down in a desperate effort to contain the pandemic, with more people now infected and having died abroad than in China.
There were no new cases in Wuhan -- the central city where the virus first emerged in December -- for the first time since authorities started publishing figures in January, according to the National Health Commission.
Wuhan and its 11 million people were placed under strict quarantine on Jan. 23, with more than 40 million other people in the rest of Hubei province entering lockdown in the following days.
The rest of China also enacted tough measures to limit public gatherings.
There were 8 more deaths in China -- all in Hubei -- raising the nationwide total to 3,245, according to the commission.
There have been nearly 81,000 infections in China but only 7,263 people remain sick with the COVID-19 disease.
The global number has shot past 200,000, with more than 8,700 deaths.
On March 10, President Xi Jinping visited Wuhan for the first time since the outbreak began and declared that the spread of the disease was ""basically curbed.""
On the same day, Hubei officials allowed people to travel within the province for the first time since January, excluding Wuhan.
On Wednesday, Hubei authorities announced they were partially opening its borders to allow healthy people from low-risk areas to leave the province if they have jobs or residences elsewhere. This also excludes Wuhan.
Life has slowly started to return to normal in the rest of the country, with people back at work, factories up and running, and schools in some regions resuming or preparing to go back to class.
SECOND WAVE
But there is concern about a second wave of infections due to an influx of cases from abroad, with an average of 20,000 people flying into China every day.
Beijing and other regions are now requiring most international arrivals to go into 14-day quarantine in designated hotels.
The National Health Commission said there were 34 more cases brought in from abroad, the biggest daily increase in 2 weeks, with 189 in total now.
""We should never allow the hard-won and continuous positive trend to be reversed,"" Xi said at a Communist Party leadership meeting on Wednesday. 
The disease is believed to have jumped from an animal to humans at a market that illegally sold wild game in Wuhan late last year.
There have also been questions about China's official figures, as authorities changed its methodology to count infections, and the government has endured rare public criticism of its handling of the health emergency.
Local officials initially attempted to cover up the outbreak, with police silencing doctors who had raised the alarm about the emergence of the new virus as early as December.
One of the whistleblowers, Wuhan ophthalmologist Li Wenliang, died from the virus himself in February, sparking an outpouring of grief and anger on social media.
The first case emerged in Wuhan on December 1, according to Chinese researchers, but it was not until January 9 the country confirmed a ""new type of coronavirus.""
Between January 5 and 17, China reported no new cases of the virus, even as Japan and Thailand declared first infections -- a period that coincided with annual political meetings in Wuhan and Hubei province.

SEOUL - South Korea posted a jump in new coronavirus cases on Thursday, reversing days of slowing infections after a new outbreak emerged in a nursing home in the hardest-hit city of Daegu.
The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 152 new cases, taking the national tally to 8,565.
The country had recorded fewer than 100 new infections for 4 days in a row until Wednesday.
Among the new cases, 97 are from Daegu, southeast of Seoul, where the KCDC said at least 74 patients at a nursing home have tested positive for the virus this week.
The KCDC did not specify how many of the new cases were linked to the nursing home directly.
The fresh outbreak has prompted Daegu officials to launch extensive checks on all other nursing homes involving more than 33,000 people.
""The rise in new infections could be ascribed to the nursing home where the outbreak occurred and our across-the-board survey on similar facilities"", Daegu Mayor Kwon Young-jin told a briefing, without elaborating on the numbers.

TEHRAN - A 103-year-old woman in Iran has recovered after being infected with the new coronavirus, state media reported, despite overwhelming evidence the elderly are most at risk from the disease.
The unnamed woman had been hospitalized in the central city of Semnan for about a week, IRNA news agency said.
But she was ""discharged after making a complete recovery,"" Semnan University of Medical Sciences head Navid Danayi was quoted as saying by IRNA late Tuesday.
The woman was the second elderly patient in Iran to have survived the disease.
The other was a 91-year-old man from Kerman, in the southeast of Iran, the news agency said.
After being sick for 3 days, he recovered on Monday despite having pre-existing medical conditions including high blood pressure and asthma, it added.
The report did not say how the pair were treated.
Since Iran announced its first deaths on February 19, the novel coronavirus has spread to all of the country's 31 provinces and killed nearly 1,000 people.
The elderly are the most vulnerable to the disease, which first emerged in China late last year.
The World Health Organization this month estimated the novel coronavirus kills 3.4 percent of all those infected.

MANILA - There is no concrete proof that eating bananas is a deterrent against the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a high-ranking health official said Wednesday, debunking claims made by President Rodrigo Duterte's spokesman that the tropical fruit could prevent coronavirus transmission.
“Wala pa pong ebidensiya. Wala pang masusing pag-aaral na makapagbibigay ng hard science or ebidensiya para sabihin na talagang bananas will prevent the transmission or prevent a person from having COVID-19,” Health Assistant Secretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said during the Laging Handa briefing of the Presidential Communications Operations Office (PCOO).
(There is no evidence, no proper study that could provide hard science or evidence that bananas will prevent the transmission or prevent a person from having COVID-19.)
Vergerie, however, stressed that bananas are good for the body.
""Hindi naman natin ipagbabawal na 'wag nilang kainin. 'Wag lang nilang iisipin na hindi sila magkakaroon ng sakit na ito dahil kumakain sila ng saging,"" she said.
(We are not preventing people from eating them. They should not think that tney will not catch the disease if they are consuming bananas.)
During his regular press briefing on Monday, chief presidential legal counsel and presidential spokesperson Salvador Panelo claimed that bananas wold protect people from the infectious disease based on information he found on the internet.
“Marami kasi akong nabasa how to destroy or contain, to kill the virus. You know, even without me knowing it -- ako kasi mahilig sa saging ‘no, tapos may nakita ako sa internet iyong saging pala magandang panlaban daw, eh ako kain nang kain araw-araw ng saging,” Panelo said.
(I've read a lot of stuff on how to destroy or contain, to kill the virus. You know, even without me knowing it -- I've been fond of bananas. Then I saw on the Internet that bananas are a good way to fight the virus. Here I am, eating bananas every day.)
Panelo added that gargling salt water or mouthwash may also help prevent the infection.

MANILA - The Department of Education (DepEd) has transitioned online in response to a month-long class suspension due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.
The state education agency has launched an online platform called ""DepEd Commons"" to help students continue their lessons amid the Luzon-wide enhanced community quarantine.
""DepEd Commons is not complete nor perfect. It still has many limitations: contents are not yet that many, evaluation and ranking have not yet been included, separate channels for teachers, parents, students, and officials have not yet been established - but the times calls for its introduction,"" the agency said in a statement.
The online platform, which can be accessed by public school teachers to support remote learning, offers online review materials and Open Educational Resources (OERs).
""OERs in DepEd Commons are authored by public school teachers who are subject experts, properly cited and acknowledged. Teachers can retain, reuse, revise, remix, and redistribute the content by blending it with a learning management system to deliver a distance learning modality,"" DepEd said.
The agency stressed that online classes are given as an option for those who have access to the internet and equipment such as smartphones, tablets, laptops or desktop computers.
Those who do not have access to these requirements can opt for paper-based homework and are not required to visit internet cafés for health safety, DepEd added.
""We acknowledge the reality of the situation wherein DepEd Commons and its OERs are not accessible to all teachers and learners,"" it said.
DepEd added: ""Many of our schools still do not have connectivity and access to internet. But in this extraordinary situation we find ourselves in, we must walk before we run.""
Teachers needing assistance on ""DepEd Commons,"" which was made in response to the United Nations Declaration of 2012 in Paris to give access in harvesting instructional supplementary materials, can reach the DepEd Information and Communications Technology Service-Educational Technology Unit at [email protected]
Classes and all school activities in all levels in Luzon are suspended from March 15 to April 14 amid the lockdown that aims to restrict the movement of people to stop the COVID-19 outbreak.

SYDNEY - Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Wednesday declared a ""human biosecurity emergency"" and said the country's citizens should abandon all overseas travel because of the coronavirus epidemic that he warned could last at least 6 months.
The formal declaration gives the government the power to close off cities or regions, impose curfews and order people to quarantine, if deemed necessary to contain the spread of the virus.
The upgrade in official advice to an unprecedented ""Level 4: Do not travel"" to any country in the world, was accompanied by a ban on any non-essential indoor gatherings of more than 100 people.
""Life is changing in Australia, as it is changing all around the world,"" Morrison said during a televised news conference. ""Life is going to continue to change, as we deal with the global coronavirus. This is a once in a hundred year type event.""
Australia has recorded more than 500 coronavirus infections and 6 deaths, a relatively small number compared to other countries, but officials are growing increasingly concerned about the prospect of an exponential rise in cases.
New South Wales, the country's most populous state, reported its biggest 1-day surge in new cases on Wednesday, along with the country's latest death, an 86-year-old man who died in a Sydney hospital.
Morrison said the tighter ban on indoor social gatherings, down to 100 people from 500 people, did not include essential services like schools, public transport and shopping centers.
The Australian leader cited expert health guidance as the rationale for keeping schools open, a strategy that has been questioned by some experts. Several private schools have made the unilateral decision to close ahead of the upcoming Easter break.
Morrison reiterated the need for social distancing and good hand hygiene to curb the spread of the virus and announced restricted access to aged care homes.
Anybody who travels during a Level 4 ban is warned that the Australian government may not be able to assist if they get into trouble while abroad, according the government's official SmartTraveller website. It also recommends people already in a ""do not travel"" area consider leaving.
Shortly before Morrison's statement, the government unveiled a A$715 million ($430 million) aid package for airlines, including waivers on domestic air traffic control fees. Virgin Australia Holdings Ltd has suspended all international flights from March 30 to June 14, while Qantas Airways Ltd has cut its international capacity by 90 percent.
The widening restrictions on travel and domestic movement are expected to take a significant toll on Australia's tourism, retail and entertainment sectors.
Economists are predicting the country will slip into its first recession in nearly 3 decades in the first half of 2020, prompting a rapid jump in unemployment.
'IT'S UN-AUSTRALIAN'
The expectations have weighed on Australia's financial markets, with the local share market falling more than 6 percent on Wednesday. Earlier this week, the Australian share market posted its biggest 1-day loss since 1987.
Morrison has already flagged a stimulus package worth around A$17 billion and said on Wednesday the government was ""considering quite extensive further economic measures"" to dull the impact on the economy.
The Reserve Bank of Australia this week pumped liquidity into money markets and said it will make a monetary policy announce on Thursday at 0330 GMT.
However, while the epidemic is expected to crimp consumer spending in the long run, data from the official statistics agency released on Wednesday showed a 0.4 percent rise in retail sales in February as people bought up staples in preparation for shortages.
The country's major grocers, Coles Group Ltd and Woolworths Group Ltd, have increased sales restrictions in response to the panic buying on goods including toilet paper, milk, meat, flour, rice, hand sanitizer, eggs and frozen vegetables.
They have also introduced exclusive shopping sessions for the elderly and the disabled early in the day, when stores have been restocked.
Morrison issued blunt advice on Wednesday that the hoarding was unnecessary and counter-productive.
""Stop doing it. It’s ridiculous,"" he said. ""It’s un-Australian, and it must stop.""

SAITAMA, Japan - The coronavirus epidemic may be keeping people at home to avoid exposure to the disease, but Japan's senior citizens are still able to do their workouts, thanks to a YouTube video.
The video, ""Human Taiso"" (Human Exercise), was made available to the public via a YouTube link by elderly care-home operator Human Life Care this month.
Human Life Care had already been conducting exercise classes with the video at its care centers and wanted to do its part for others amid the coronavirus outbreak.
""I know there are people that take walks, but at a time like this, people tend to avoid going out,"" said Satoshi Matsuzaka, strategy department manager at Human Life Care.
""I hope people can exercise at home with this exercise.""
Japan has canceled public events, closed schools and urged people to work from home to help stop further transmission of the coronavirus. The elderly in particular are vulnerable to the serious effects of the virus.
Japan has the world's oldest population, with more than 28 percent aged 65 or over.
The video is about 5 minutes long, featuring exercises and stretches designed to boost blood flow and strengthen the feet and back muscles.
""I can have fun by watching while exercising. So I think it's good,"" said Rieko Kojima, 79, who got in her exercise at Human Life Care's center in Saitama, north of Tokyo.

ISTANBUL - Turkey has identified 93 suspects who have made ""unfounded and provocative"" postings on social media about the coronavirus outbreak and has detained 19 of them, the Turkish Interior Ministry said.
The move came as Turkey closed cafes, entertainment and sports venues, suspended mass prayers in mosques and extended a flight ban to 20 countries to contain the coronavirus spread, as the number of confirmed cases rose to 47.
The interior ministry statement said there were social media posts which were targeting officials and spreading panic and fear by suggesting that the virus had spread widely in Turkey and that officials had taken insufficient measures.
""Nineteen of these suspects have been detained and the process of detaining others who have been identified is continuing,"" said the statement, issued late on Monday.

MANILA - Authorities apprehended on Tuesday, the first day of the ""enhanced community quarantine"" in Luzon, some 600 public utility vehicles (PUVs) violating the suspension of public transit in a bid to contain the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Police Brig. Gen. Eliseo Cruz said the Philippine National Police - Highway Patrol Group (PNP-HPG), which he heads, conducted the operations on orders of PNP chief Gen. Archie Gamboa.
Taxi cab drivers were given warnings, while their operators would be informed of the suspension of mass public transportation, Cruz said.
They were eventually released, and told to adhere to the government's order.
Some drivers told ABS-CBN News that despite the threat of the novel coronavirus, they could not afford not to go to work because of their families.
Meanwhile, several passengers complained about the lack of transportation to make their way around the capital.
""Lahat ay binigyan ng habilin na dapat ang lahat ay makauwi na, at lahat ay maka-settle down na sa kani-kanilang mga tahanan, nang sa gayon ay, the following day, bukas ay inaasahan natin na talagang wala nang kikilos.

ZURICH - Swiss hospitals could collapse if the new coronavirus keeps spreading rapidly, a top health official warned on Tuesday, urging his compatriots to respect the government's emergency measures to curb the epidemic.
""The virus is among us, now we have do our utmost that it does not spread further. Too many are infected and if this goes on hospitals will collapse,"" Daniel Koch, head of infectious diseases at the federal health agency, told SRF radio.
Switzerland mobilized up to 8,000 members of the military on Monday and banned all public and private events after declaring the coronavirus outbreak an ""exceptional"" emergency that demanded more radical measures.
More than 2,330 people have tested positive for coronavirus so far in Switzerland, and at least 14 people have died.
Koch defended the government's policy to focus testing on people most at risk from the new virus and those who might need hospitalization.
Bottlenecks in processing test results were an issue, he said. Authorities were already running more than 2,000 tests a day.
""We will do more testing in Switzerland as soon as we can but the virus doesn't wait for it to be tested. Hospitals are seeing a leap in sick people and that is an alarm signal,"" Koch said.
Makers of ventilators needed to help people in respiratory distress breathe have said that even Switzerland may not have sufficient equipment, should hospitals become overloaded with a deluge of patients.
The World Health Organization called on all countries on Monday to ramp up their testing programs as the best way to slow the advance of the pandemic.

MANILA--The Philippine Red Cross (PRC) on Saturday said it has acquired laboratory machines that could help expand the country's testing capacity related to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
The non-profit organization is planning to begin its mass testing for persons with coronavirus symptoms in Quezon City this Wednesday, Sen. Richard Gordon said.
Using 2 reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) machines, the PRC can process nearly 3,000 tests per day, added the lawmaker, also the group's chairman.
""We are already ordering 5 more testing machines. So expect more machines to arrive,"" Gordon said in an interview with the Foreign Correspondents Association of the Philippines (Focap).
The RT-PCR machines are considered by health authorities as the gold standard in detecting the genetic sequence of the SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.
On March 28, the Department of Health (DOH) and World Health Organization (WHO) visited the COVID-19 testing center of the PRC to ensure it was at par with medical standards.
The Quezon City government will shoulder the cost of the mass testing, Gordon said. The city has so far recorded 476 COVID-19 cases, the most among Metro Manila local government units.
The PRC also acquired negative pressure ambulances, which are set to arrive on April 11, Gordon said.
This type of ambulance can safely transfer infected patients to health facilities, he added.
""I worry about Navotas, Tondo, Malabon. This is really a wake-up call to move people to Central or Southern Luzon and develop the countryside,"" he said.
""Once people are tested, it could possibly go by the tens of thousands.""
With infections showing no signs of tapering off, Gordon called on the national government to extend the Luzon-wide lockdown.
""I don't think we should be reckless. We have gains, but I don't think it's sufficient. Maybe for another 2 weeks,"" he said.
""Just take it slowly. Open certain companies that are essential to the community. Enforce distancing rules. Make sure everyone has mask when they go out.""

MANILA - Majority of Cabinet officials have pledged to donate part of their salaries to fund efforts to curb the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles said Saturday.
In a virtual press briefing, he said Cabinet members would set aside 75 percent of their pay to add to funds to help battle the coronavirus crisis, which has so far sickened more than 3,000 people in the country and brought economic activities to a halt.
""Nais din nating ipagbigay-alam na karamihan, majority ng mga miyembro ng Gabinete ni Pangulong Duterte ay boluntaryong ibibigay ang malaking bahagi-- 75 percent ng kanilang buwanang sahod-- upang ilaan sa mga programa ng gobyerno upang sugpuin ang COVID-19 sa loob ng panahong pinapatupad ang Bayanihan Law,"" said Nograles, spokesperson of the Inter-Agency Task Force for Emerging Infectious Diseases.
(We wish to inform everyone that majority of President [Rodrigo] Duterte's Cabinet members will voluntarily give 75 percent of their monthly salaries to help the government's programs in ending COVID-19 during the implementation of the Bayanihan Law.)
He was referring to the Bayanihan to Heal As One Law, a recently passed measure giving the President additional powers to address the unprecedented health crisis.
""Ilan sa ating mga kasamahan ay boluntaryong babawasan ang kanilang mga sahod hanggang Disyembre pa ngayong taon para sa mga programang ito,"" said Nograles.
(Some members will voluntarily take pay cuts until December for these programs.)

Duterte Cabinet still club of billionaires, multimillionaires in 2018

Based on their latest sworn Statements of Assets, Liabilities and Net Worth (SALNs) obtained by ABS-CBN News, 2 Duterte Cabinet members remained billionaires in 2018 while the rest are still multimillionaires.
The 2 richest Cabinet members -- Public Works Secretary Mark Villar and Energy Secretary Alfonso Cusi -- declared their net worth to be P1.408 billion and P1.39 billion, respectively, as of Dec. 31, 2018.
Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez was the third richest Cabinet member in 2018, with a declared net worth of P366.78 million.
Two-thirds of the Cabinet members, or 16 out of 25, saw an increase in their net worth in 2018 compared to the year prior, while the net worth of 3 Cabinet members declined.

MANILA - The national government's task force against the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on Saturday urged localities to pass a measure that would penalize discrimination against frontliners, migrant workers and confirmed or suspected coronavirus patients.
In a virtual press briefing, Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles, spokesperson of the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID), said they have received reports that health workers, overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) and coronavirus patients were being discriminated against, harassed and attacked.

""Kinokondena ito ng IATF at binabalaan po namin na kakasuhan po namin ang mga taong mapapatunayang gumagawa nito,"" he said.
(The IATF [Inter-Agency Task Force] condemns this and warned people proven to have committed these acts of appropriate charges.)
""Sana po tugunan ito ng LGU at sana po mag-issue sila ng ordinansa na magpapataw ng parusa sa ganitong mga gawain,"" added Nograles.
(I hope our LGUs [local government units] would address this and issue an ordinance that penalizes these acts.)
Some nurses were kicked out from their rented apartments while recovered coronavirus patients were refused entry to their villages, Nograles said.
Some OFWs were also refused to go home to their hometowns while an ambulance driver was shot and wounded after being suspected of ferrying COVID-19 patients, he added.

Acts of discrimination, not limited to coercion, libel, slander, physical injuries and the dishonor of contractual obligations such as contracts of lease or employment, shall be dealt with criminally and administratively, Nograles warned.
""We should not let our fear bring out the worst in us. Hindi po ito panahon para talikuran ang kapwa nating Pilipino -- ito ay panahon para magmalasakit, magtulungan, at magkaisa,"" he said.

MANILA - Government has yet to decide whether to lift or extend the Luzon-wide enhanced community quarantine to address the coronavirus pandemic, an official said Saturday.
President Rodrigo Duterte had placed Luzon under lockdown from March 17 until April 12, but there have been calls to extend the quarantine to ensure effective containment. 
""Hindi pa kami prepared na magbigay ng rekomendasyon tungkol sa partial lifting ba or extension, or ilang lugar na lang ba kasi hindi pa talaga conclusive ang data,"" Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles, spokesperson of the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID), said in an online press briefing Saturday. 
(We are not ready to give a recommendation if we will have a partial lifting or extension or just in specific places because data is not conclusive.)
To help authorities decide the lockdown period, the task force has approved several parameters, he said. 
""Inapprove na po ng IATF ang batayan na gagamitin nila para sa desisyong ito,"" Nograles said.
(The IATF has approved the basis to be used for this decision.)
Among the criteria being considered by the government's coronavirus task force are trends in the COVID-19 epidemic curve, which refers to the projected number of people expected to contract the disease over a period of time.
The government will also be examining the capacity of the health care system, which includes availability of quarantine and treatment facilities, protective gear for health care workers and testing capacity.
Social, economic and security factors in the Luzon island group, which is home to nearly half of the country's 100 million people, will also be evaluated, Nograles said.
Luzon has recorded the most number of COVID-19 cases since the global outbreak reached the country. 
""For this purpose, the Department of Health (DOH) is hereby directed to convene all concerned agencies and to finalize the aggregation and analysis of all relevant data applicable to the contained area, subject to the deliberation of the IATF and final determination by the President,"" he added.
The technical working group is also ordered to come up with recommendations on the possible implementation of a general or enhanced community quarantine in localities in the Visayas and Mindanao.
To date, the number of coronavirus infections in the Philippines is 3,018. The total figure includes 136 deaths and 52 people who recovered from the disease.

MANILA - Human rights lawyer Chel Diokno on Saturday urged President Rodrigo Duterte to instead focus on addressing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) crisis in response to the latter's tirade against him in a public address Friday night. 
In an interview on DZMM radio, Diokno, who ran but lost his senatorial bid under the opposition ticket in 2019, said the administration should concentrate on providing relief assistance to poor Filipino families affected by the crisis.
""Sanay naman tayo diyan sa mga ganiyan na salita ni Pangulo, pero sana hindi mawala focus niya do'n sa problema ng bayan,"" he said.
(I'm used to the disparaging remarks made by the President, but hopefully he won't lose focus on the country's problem.)
While he was surprised at Duterte's latest tirade against him, the Free Legal Assistance Group (FLAG) chair couldn't help but make light of the situation.
""Para akong pinatawag sa principal's office at hinahanap ngipin ko,"" he said.
(It was as if I was called to the principal's office and they're looking for my teeth.)
Asked what could have irked the President, Diokno said he was as well puzzled.
""Hindi ko rin alam. Ginagawa ko lang sa tingin ko ano ang tama,"" he said.
(I don't know. I was only doing what I think is right.)
Diokno had on Thursday revealed that the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) has summoned social media users who expressed sentiments on the government's response to the pandemic.

The bureau then explained the subpoenas were issued to those who spread fake news about the coronavirus crisis.
Putting differences aside, Diokno urged the Duterte administration to move forward and act as one to overcome the crisis.
""Gawin natin ang gusto ng Kongreso na bayanihan to heal as one. We want the government to act as one. Naghihintay ang taongbayan para makita ang ayuda na inaasahan nila,"" he said.
(We should do want Congress wants, which is to work together to heal as one. We want the government to act as one. The public is waiting for the relief assistance.)
Diokno also commended the President for firing a government official, who sought for an investigation on Vice President Leni Robredo's relief efforts to address the COVID-19 pandemic.
""Maganda itong leksiyon sa lahat ng nasa pamahalaan. Kung sila'y maglalabas ng public statement, dala-dala nila siyempre 'yong kanilang tanggapan. It's something we should all remember. Maayos ako doon sa ginawa ni Pangulo,"" he said.

MANILA - The novel coronavirus has so far infected 3,018 people in the Philippines.
It is a relatively small figure compared to other countries, but the health department has warned a rapid rise in cases after the Philippine government increased its testing capacity.
To help the public respond to the pandemic, Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire answers some questions on the highly-contagious disease.
Can you catch the coronavirus twice?
The health official said they do not have scientific evidence yet about possible reinfection of the disease, but reports in Japan said a recovered coronavirus patient tested positive again for COVID-19.
Can virgin coconut oil be used as treatment for coronavirus infection?
The Department of Science and Technology (DOST) is conducting tests on virgin coconut oil as potential treatment of the novel coronavirus, Vergerie said.
How can seniors strengthen their immune system?
The World Health Organization said the elderly and those suffering from underlying conditions appeared to develop serious illness of COVID-19 more often than others.
Vergerie said older people could boost their immune system by eating a variety of fruits and vegetables. They must have a regular physical activity and take supplements such as vitamin C and zinc.
Does Philippines have enough ventilators to cope with the coronavirus pandemic?
""Right now, it's still enough. It's sufficient,"" the health official told radio DZMM.
Ventilators are mechanical breathing devices used for patients with severe cases of the novel coronavirus.
How does the Department of Health (DOH) determine if a patient has recovered from the virus?
As of Friday, some 52 out of 3,018 cases have recovered from COVID-19 in the Philippines.
At the onset of the crisis, a patient must have 2 negative test results before health experts can say he or she has been cleared of the strain, Vergerie said.
The health ministry, however, changed its protocols. As long as the patient is not showing any symptoms, he or she can be given a clean bill of health.
However, the recovered patient will still have to undergo an additional 14-day quarantine as a precautionary measure, Vergerie added.
Should healthy people use a mask when going out?
Due to reports of sustained community transmission of COVID-19, everyone is encouraged to wear a mask in public, she said.
What is the treatment for the coronavirus disease?
The health department has issued a guideline on the use of off-label drugs such as chloroquine in treating COVID-19 patients.
Vergerie reiterated these drugs are used with the guidance of medical professionals.
The Philippines is also joining the World Health Organization’s multi-country clinical trials in search for an effective COVID-19 treatment.
Among the drugs that will be included in the trial are (1) remdesivir, (2) lopinavir and ritonavir combined, (3) two drugs plus interferon beta, and (4) chloroquine.
Can coronavirus be spread through talking?
An infected patient may also spread the novel coronavirus through talking, Vergerie said.
She reminded the public to observe physical distancing or keeping meters away from other people.
Can coronavirus be transmitted through grocery items?
Grocery shopping was the last thing that some COVID-19 patients did before they were confirmed to have contracted the disease, Vergerie said.
Since infected droplets may persist on surfaces, transmission via grocery items may be possible, she said.
She urged the public to wash their hands after unpacking groceries.

MANILA (UPDATE)- President Rodrigo Duterte on Friday night lashed out at human rights lawyer Chel Diokno for allegedly criticizing the government's response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and encouraging people to defy the lockdown.
In a public address, the President unleashed a torrent of insults against the former senatorial candidate.
""Letche ka, galit ako sa'yo, ulol ka,"" Duterte said.
In his rambling remarks, the President said Diokno was among ""lousy lawyers"" who are allegedly encouraging people to violate the law.
Duterte also mocked Diokno's loss in the 2019 midterm elections.
""Problema sa'yo, 'pag nagsalita ka, ang laki ng ngipin mo kaya na-discourage ang mga tao,"" he said.
(Your problem is, when you speak, your teeth are too big that's why people were discouraged.)
""Pag magkita tayo, patalsikin ko isang ngipin mo.""

On Thursday, Diokno revealed that the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) has summoned social media users who expressed sentiments on the government's response to the pandemic.
The human rights lawyer said NBI's actions will bring a chilling effect since his client, who was summoned to explain, did not post misinformation but ""fair commentary on matters of public interest.""
On his official social media accounts, Diokno has called for mass testing for the novel coronavirus and cautioned the public on the use of the P275-billion government budget to fight the crisis.

MANILA - A group representing some 600 private hospitals in the country on Friday denounced the shooting of a frontline worker against the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Candelaria town, Quezon province.
Dr. Rustico Jimenez, president of the Private Hospitals Association of the Philippines, said an ambulance driver was attacked after being accused of ferrying infected patients and parking the hospital ambulance inside a subdivision.
The driver, 51-year-old Sofronio Ramilo, was wounded on his right hand.

""We are condemning the act done to our frontliner. Tumutulong lang po siya. Bakit babarilin pa? (He's only helping. Why does he have to be shot?),"" he told radio DZMM.
Jimenez appealed to the public to not discriminate against health care workers and instead help them to get home safely.

""Sila ay nagsa-sacrifice. Huwag na po nating pagbintangan na magdadala ng infection,"" he said.
(They are sacrificing their lives. Let's not accuse them of bringing infection.)
In a statement released Friday, the Peter Paul Medical Center of Candelaria Inc said the suspect insisted the hospital ambulance should not be allowed to enter the subdivision because it was being used to transport COVID-19 patients.
The victim explained the vehicle was mainly used to transport hospital personnel and was also regularly cleaned and disinfected.
However, the suspect ignored the victim's explanation, shooting the ambulance driver in the hand. The victim injured one of his fingers, resulting in possible disarticulation or the separation of bones in the joint.
""Our ambulance driver is the breadwinner of his family, who in these trying times where we are at war with COVID-19, chose to bravely perform his duty beyond what is required for the sake of the community and his fellow frontliners,"" the hospital said.
""Our frontliners are the ones of the few obstacles to the spread and fatalities of COVID-19. It is not enough that we thank them. We need to protect them,"" the hospital added.
The suspect has been arrested and will face criminal complaints, police said.

MANILA - As Luzon entered its 3rd week of the enhanced community quarantine, private hospitals in Metro Manila are facing a shortage of health workers and medical supplies to battle the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, a group said Friday.
Dr. Rustico Jimenez, president of Private Hospitals Association of the Philippines (PHAP), appealed for government help as the crisis is stretching the private health care system to its limits.
""Dito sa Metro Manila, talagang kulang po tayo,"" he told radio DZMM.
(Here in Metro Manila, we are definitely lacking [manpower].)
""Kailangan na po talaga na humingi ng tulong kasi 'yong naka-handle ng COVID iqu-quarantine ng 14 days, nababawasan na po ang ating mga nurse at doctors,"" Jimenez added.
(It's time to ask for help because those handling COVID-19 cases have to be quarantined for 14 days, reducing our nurses and doctors.)
The PHAP, which has over 600 members throughout the country, said private hospitals are also running low on medical supplies and equipment.
Among the scarce supplies are mechanical breathing devices ventilators, which are used for patients with severe cases of the novel coronavirus, Jimenez said.
For one COVID-19 patient, health workers have to use at least 100 personal protective equipment (PPEs) for a day or two, he added.
Even before the outbreak of the coronavirus, which originated in Wuhan City in Hubei province, China, the Philippines has been facing a shortage of medical practitioners, Jimenez said.
""Even before the COVID-19, we have been lacking 23,000 nurses all over the Philippines. Some 3,500 pharmacists and 3,000 med techs,"" he added.

Tracking COVID-19 cases in the Philippines

As the virus continues to spread in the country, which has so far infected 3,018 people, dealing with an influx of coronavirus patients is straining hospital systems, Jimenez said.
The current doctor-to-patient ratio stands at 1 to 40,000, far from the ideal 1 to 10,000 as recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO), he added.
During the interview, Jimenez assured the public that private hospitals would still accept patients having other medical conditions.
He also urged patients possibly carrying the novel coronavirus strain to tell the truth.
""Huwag silang magsinungaling. Maraming doctor ang namatay dahil hindi nagsabi ng tama ang ilang pasyente,"" Jimenez said.
(Don't lie. Many doctors died because some patients didn't tell the truth.)

BERLIN - Germans risk being fined up to 500 euros (P27,000) for standing too close to each other starting Friday as officials crack down on people flouting rules brought in to control coronavirus.
Chancellor Angela Merkel's government has ordered people not leave their homes unless they have an exceptional reason such as grocery shopping, exercise or medical appointments.
Gatherings of more than 2 people are banned and a distance of at least 1.5 meters (5 feet) must be kept from others at all times.
Local governments have the power to set fines for transgressors, with city officials in Berlin saying their fines would be as high as 500 euros. 
Similar announcements have come from across Germany's 16 states.
Hesse, home to finance hub Frankfurt, and North Rhine-Westphalia both promised penalties of up to 200 euros for people who gather in groups of more than 2.
Bavaria, Germany's largest state, has been the worst affected by the coronavirus so far, with more than 18,000 cases.
There, people who stand less than 1.5 meters apart risk being fined 150 euros. 
Queues of people standing far apart have become a common sight outside German supermarkets and pharmacies, with many sticking down tape to mark where people should stand on the pavement.
However, German police have also reported numerous violations of the rules.
Germany has recorded over 79,000 cases of the novel coronavirus, according to the Robert Koch Institute for disease control.
A total of 1,017 people have died.

PARIS -- The coronavirus has shaken the world like nothing else. But beyond the terrible toll of death, economic devastation and fear, the virus is likely to leave another lasting mark.
It is going to make us all fatter.
""I don't know if we are going to come out of this experience stronger, but we will have gotten fatter,"" warned nutritionist Beatrice de Reynal, who said that was only one thing to do -- eat less.
""It is going to happen to us all, even if we try to exercise,"" said the similarly fatalistic Julian Mercier, a French sports, health and cooking coach.
With more than a quarter of humanity shut up at home or under lockdown, and with many worried they will get the virus next, the temptation to comfort eat was hard to resist.
""I am the first to turn to chocolate rather than to an apple,"" Mercier admitted. ""And that is what risks being our undoing.""
The arithmetic of the situation is hard to argue with.
By doing little or none of the physical activity we normally do, an adult is likely to burn off up to 400 fewer calories a day, said dietician Jennifer Aubert. 
Which is why we have to reduce our portions and move as much as we can -- as long as it is not to the fridge and back.
Other experts point to people who have panic-bought a cupboard full of fresh food, finding themselves duty-bound to eat their way through it.
SLIPPING INTO OVEREATING
Being alone and coping with the stress of the situation, as well as worries about whether they will have a job to go back to, can tip people into overeating, the British Nutrition Foundation warned.
""With concerns about the availability of food, eating well and staying healthy alongside all the other stresses of the coronavirus outbreak is a challenge,"" it admitted.
""Food can be a comfort and it's easy to overeat when spending so much time at home, especially if you like to cook in order to pass the time.""
But it is advising people to embrace the lockdown to learn to ""put together healthy meals"" which ""can be a source of enjoyment and help your well-being."" 
""Canned or frozen ingredients can be just as nutritious as fresh,"" it added.
Not everyone cooks, however, as Pascale Hebel, of the French CREDOC research institute said, and some may not have the wherewithal to cook.
Which can lead to a heavy reliance on fatty and salty ready-meals and tinned food.
Others warned against using food as a way of soothing children forbidden from going outside to play with their friends.
""To avoid problems it is easy to make spaghetti bolognese that everyone likes rather than to fight to make them eat spinach,"" Mercier said. But that would be a mistake. 
Experts were unanimous that cooking for yourself and structuring your day with regular meals and physical activity, were vital if we are to come out of this in decent shape.
STAY CALM AND COOK
It can even be possible to lose weight, said Aubert, because ""we actually have more time to do sport at home."" 
And with hashtags like #homemadefood proliferating on social media as users show off dishes and compare recipes, it could also be the chance to teach a whole new generation how to cook.
British celebrity chef Jamie Oliver certainly thinks so and has been doing his bit with a nightly show based on ""store cupboard and freezer faves"" called ""Keep Cooking And Carry On.""
It includes dishes fast but healthy dishes such as ""Cornershop Curry"" and ""Quick green pasta.""
""I understand that it is easy to fall into watching the television, or lying around reading and snacking. I am the first to do it,"" his French opposite number Cyril Lignac told AFP.
""But this period is a great chance to teach children and teenagers how to cook simple dishes. And when I am at home I tend to cook with less fat and sugar.""

THE HAGUE - A 101-year-old woman who contracted coronavirus in the Netherlands has recovered, offering what her hospital said was ""a spark of hope.""
The woman, whose name was not released, was admitted to the IJsselland Hospital near Rotterdam a week and a half ago with breathing difficulties and tested positive for coronavirus.
She was kept in isolation but has now recovered enough to leave hospital. The centenarian, who lives independently, will rest in a nursing home before returning to her home, the hospital said on its website.
""She is a tough lady, and it's great to see her following the medical advice, like sneezing in her elbow and even telling me to keep proper distance,"" pulmonologist Sunil Ramlal said.

PARIS - It's the key that opens to door from total lockdown: serologic testing, which will show definitively who has contracted COVID-19 and is in theory safe to return to work.
""Everyone's waiting for serologic testing, the whole world,"" said France's Health Minister Olivier Veran. 
He said that the global research community was focusing on ways of perfecting the tests, which measure viral antibodies in a person's blood that signal immunity.
Veran said that mass production of the tests could start within weeks. 
""It's a huge factor, especially when we're trying to reduce confinement,"" he said.
The World Health Organization said that serologic tests were still being developed but were yet to be properly evaluated. 
'GREAT INTEREST'
Current diagnostic tests, known as RT-PCR, are invasive and use genetic analysis to see if a person is actively infected.
Serologic testing, which only requires a drop of blood to conduct, focuses instead on finding virus antibodies, the presence of which indicates that an individual has had COVID-19 and is now likely immune.
""Antibodies are one of the key immune response components. They start to be detectable around a week after initial infection,"" said Andrew Preston, a reader in Microbial Pathogenesis at the University of Bath.
There are two types of antibodies associated with the COVID-19 immune response: IgM, which the body produces in the early stages of viral response, and IgG, which arrive later on during infection. 
The tests being developed can identify both antibodies, key hallmarks of a patient's auto-immune response to the virus.
""Thus there is great interest in the use of an antibody test to indicate immunity against disease for use in the lifting of lockdown restrictions,"" said Preston.
SUPPLY PROBLEM
Antibody testing is so crucial because of the large proportion of people with COVID-19 infections who may not show symptoms but can still pass the virus on to others.
Such tests already exist for other illnesses. And once they are perfected for the novel coronavirus the results can be analyzed in labs using existing hardware.
Once widely available, they could be used to determine who gets to return to work and exit the lockdown currently being experienced by billions around the world.
""The main question is how to ensure everyone can return to work,"" Francois Blanchecotte, president of the French Union of Biologists, told AFP.
In Italy, the president of the Venice region, Luca Zaia, has proposed that returning workers carry a document after testing to prove they aren't contagious.
Similar measures have been proposed in Germany.
""A GP told me yesterday that if I gave him a serologic test and it showed that he's immune, he would offer his services to a neighboring hospital's COVID-19 unit in an flash,"" said Philippe Herent, director of the Synlab Opale group of laboratories. 
He, however, cautioned that global demand for the tests is likely to significantly outstrip demand, and production remains limited.
CAVEATS
The tests aren't the perfect solution, however. 
""They have to be used carefully. Used too early, the convalescent patient may still be carrying and shedding the virus, they may still be a risk to others,"" said Michael Skinner, a reader in Virology at Imperial College London. 
It's due to this risk that countries are likely to continue producing and using RT-PCR tests and combine them with the serological versions.
""You might see a mix of the two: one diagnosis to see if you're still contagious and a serological test to know if you have antibodies,"" said Blanchecotte.
Another potential pitfall is that it is not yet known for certain whether people who have recovered from COVID-19 are immune to reinfection.
""In a vast majority of infectious diseases, recovery from disease and evidence of a strong immune response would lead to a period of immunity from re-occurrence,"" said Preston.
""(But) the caveat is that we don't know for sure that a positive antibody test does imply someone is immune (from COVID-19).""
Most countries in lockdown still lack testing capacity, so it is not at all clear when restrictions on movement could be lifted, even with a widely available antibody test.
But serologic tests are the only way to know for sure what percentage of humanity has been infected with COVID-19, which will help inform a variety of current unknowns, not least mortality rates.

Some 10 to 15 percent of cases detected in people under the age of 50 were a moderate to serious infection, according to the WHO.
However, Kluge noted that ""people who age healthily are less at risk.""
""There are reports of people over the age of 100 who were admitted to hospital for COVID-19 and have now since made a complete recovery.""
The WHO's Europe branch said there were 464,859 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 30,098 deaths in the 53 countries that make up its region.
Some 80 percent of those who died from the virus had at least one underlying illness, in particular cardiovascular disease and diabetes.
Kluge said it was of utmost importance ""for every age group"" to respect hygiene guidelines.
""It is not only an act of solidarity with others, in particular with those most likely to be severely affected, but also vital for your own health and safety.""

Endcov.ph’s map view has a color-coded “heat map” showing which localized areas have the most (darker areas) and the least (brighter areas) number of confirmed COVID-19 cases


MANILA - The University of the Philippines (UP) said Thursday it had created a website to provide the public with vital information for fighting the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.
The site, endcov.ph, tracks the spread of the novel coronavirus to also help authorities combat the disease, its team leader Dr. Mahar Lagmay said.
""We want to expose the invisible enemy through technology... When I say expose, we want to track the occurrences, see how it spreads and we can only do that if we have real-time information,"" he told ANC.
""In this war against COVID-19, we really have to be faster on how COVID-19 works,"" added Lagmay, executive director of UP Resilience Institute.
The website features a highly detailed map, wherein users can see street or satellite views of the general locations and numbers of COVID-19 cases, hospitals, quarantine checkpoints and other data.
The easy-to-use site also has a color-coded “heat map” showing which localized areas have the most and the least number of confirmed COVID-19 cases.
Other pages of the website show COVID-19-related policies, advisories, resources, statistical data, and profiles of patients who have been investigated, tested, admitted and treated in hospitals, including those who have died and those who have recovered from the disease.
Lagmay said the website was created in support of the government's ongoing efforts to address the COVID-19 pandemic.
Experts on public health, medicine, the arts and sciences, engineering, education, governance and related fields formed part of the team.
Since launching the site, Lagmay said they had been invited by the technical working group of the Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF) on making suggestions on how to tackle the crisis.
As of Thursday, the Philippines has recorded 2,633 coronavirus cases, with 107 deaths and 51 recoveries.

MANILA - Metro Manila, home to nearly 13 million people, remains the hardest-hit by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in the country, a government official said Thursday.
More than half of the country's coronavirus infections are in the Philippine capital region, which has 1,511 reported cases, said Carlito Galvez Jr., chief implementer of the government’s national policy against the COVID-19.
South of Metro Manila, Calabarzon has the second highest number of coronavirus cases with 178, said Galvez, who is also the president's peace adviser.
It is followed by Central Luzon with 65, Davao Region with 61, and Central Visayas with 36.
Bicol Region and Eastern Visayas, meanwhile, are the least affected by the crisis with each 1 reported coronavirus case.
In Metro Manila, Quezon City, the country's most populous city, reported the most number of coronavirus infections at 439, with 27 deaths.
It is followed by Manila with 180 cases, including 10 deaths; Makati City with 144 cases, including 4 deaths; San Juan City with 119 cases, including 8 deaths; and Pasig City with 112 cases, including 6 deaths.
The least affected localities in Metro Manila are Pateros and Navotas, recording 6 and 1 cases, respectively.
As of Thursday, April 2, the Philippines has recorded 2,633 COVID-19 cases. 
The total figure includes 107 deaths and 51 people who recovered from the virus, which originated last year in Wuhan City in Hubei province, China.

MANILA - The Commission on Human Rights (CHR) on Thursday called on the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) to focus on the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic instead of going after social media users who are criticizing the government's response to the crisis.
""During this time, it is more important for the government to focus on COVID-19 and not to go after such cases,"" CHR spokesperson Jacqueline Ann de Guia told ANC.
The agency reiterated that freedom of expression is a non-derogable right.
""As long as these opinions are expressed freely and not bordering to any crime, (like) any act of sedition, then these should not be curtailed at all by the government,"" De Guia said.
Dissent should not be taken as threats, but as an exercise of rights in a free society, the CHR reminded the government.
""The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has already taken so much lives. Let us work together to save more,"" the agency said in a statement.
The NBI earlier said it will help in contact tracing or locating people who may have come in contact with COVID-19 patients.

The CHR appeal comes after human rights lawyer Chel Diokno revealed that the NBI has summoned social media users who expressed sentiments on the government's response to the pandemic.
Diokno's client will be asked about the latter's ""publicly posted article concerning an alleged misuse of government funds.""
The NBI said that in issuing subpoenas, it is focused on acts allegedly in violation of Article 154 of the Revised Penal Code or the unlawful use of means of publication and unlawful utterances.
For Diokno, NBI's actions will bring a chilling effect since his client did not post misinformation but ""fair commentary on matters of public interest.""
“Tinanggap ko ang kasong ito dahil ‘di na makatao ang nangyayari. Ang dami nang namamatay, pati frontliners, pero imbes na COVID, kritiko ang gusto nilang puksain,” he said.

PARIS - Limited global stocks of 2 anti-malarial drugs could wreck plans to use the medicines, currently in clinical trials, to treat COVID-19, doctors cautioned on Thursday.
Around the world, countries are expanding access to chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), which are used to treat malaria and are known to have anti-viral properties.
The medicines have shown early promise against the COVID-19 illness in studies in France and China.
CQ, which is the less toxic of the 2, is also used as an anti-inflammatory to treat conditions like rheumatoid arthritis and lupus, purposes it is primarily known for outside the tropics.
Writing in the Annals of Rheumatic Diseases, doctors in Italy -- the country hardest hit by COVID-19 -- said that limited supply could scupper any widespread attempt to use the 2 drugs against the virus.
They also cautioned that it was vital that patients already taking chloroquine for other illnesses should not be deprived of their supply.
""In some European countries the availability of HCQ and CQ in the pharmacies (outside the hospitals) is already scarce,"" Francesca Romana Spinelli, assistant professor at the Sapienza University of Rome and letter author, told AFP.
""This is an emerging problem for many patients already treated with CQ/HCQ for their autoimmune rheumatic disease.""
Both medicines are known to have anti-viral properties and have shown some encouraging results in trials against COVID-19.
But they have a number of potentially serious side effects, and there are fears that treating COVID-19 patients, many of whom are on medication for underlying conditions, could court disaster.
On Wednesday the European Medicine Agency warned that CQ and HCQ should only be used on COVID-19 patients in clinical trials or in case of a ""national emergency.""
Iain McInnes, president of the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR), said that more research was needed before governments could consider rolling out the 2 drugs against the virus.
He said he was concerned ""that the diversion of drug supplies away from people with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases may compromise the health of this important and sizable group of patients in Europe and beyond.""
In the letter, Italian doctors said using CQ and HCQ as widespread COVID-19 treatments would raise ethical concerns, given their known side effects.
""If mass prophylaxis was accepted as an option worldwide, this would raise the question of whether there is enough supply of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine to support this approach,"" they added.

MANILA - The Commission on Human Rights (CHR) on Thursday criticized President Rodrigo Duterte's ""shoot them dead"" remark as he warned against unruly quarantine violators during the country's public health crisis caused by the new coronavirus outbreak.
""It's very dangerous during this time to incite violence or to use strong words, such as shooting people, when in fact, the primary purpose again of the enhanced community quarantine is to protect the right to life,"" CHR spokesperson Jacqueline Ann de Guia told ANC.
""It would be defeating the purpose if we were to encourage our security sector to put the law into their own hands and forget the primacy of human rights,"" she added.
While the commission found it reassuring that the Philippine National Police will not abide by Duterte's statement and will only ""exercise maximum tolerance and within the bounds of law,"" de Guia, in a separate statement, warned that the""shoot them dead"" order ""may be construed as an official policy from the government.""
She said the CHR is calling on the ""PNP to come up with clearer guidelines for its law enforcers on the ground to assure the public that there will be no abuse of power.""
""The primacy of human rights even in times of a national health emergency means that due process and the rule of law still apply,"" she said.
""Even stricter restrictions, such as the enhanced community quarantine seen to protect the people’s right to health, are guided by human rights standards and principles.""
Duterte issued the stern warning to violators of the lockdown, including Leftist groups, in a public address on Wednesday night.

'Ilibing ko na kayo': Duterte orders soldiers, cops to shoot dead 'troublemakers' amid lockdown

He ordered government forces to arrest or kill troublemakers when their lives are threatened.

Duterte's statement came after a group of Quezon City residents took to the streets to demand help from the government amid the lockdown.

MADRID - The coronavirus death toll in Spain surged past 10,000 on Thursday after a record 950 deaths in 24 hours, with the number of confirmed cases passing the 110,000 mark, the government said.
Spain has the world's second-highest death toll after Italy, with the virus so far claiming 10,003 lives although the rate of new infections and deaths continued its downward trend, the health ministry figures showed.
The number of new infections increased by 7.9 percent, compared with 8.2 percent on Wednesday and more than 25 percent at the start of last week.
The daily rise in deaths also slowed to 10.5 percent on Thursday, virtually unchanged from 10.6 percent on Wednesday and down from 27 percent a week ago.
""The data show the curve has stabilized"" and the epidemic has entered a ""slowdown"" phase, Health Minister Salvador Illa said.
Officials have warned that even if the epidemic is peaking, the pressure on the intensive care system would be subject to a lag of a week or longer, with hospitals likely to reach crisis point by the end of this week or early next.
Madrid remains the worst-hit region, with 4,175 deaths and more than 32,000 cases, leaving hospitals and mortuaries overwhelmed.

Earlier Thursday, PACC chief Manuelito Luna said the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) should probe Robredo's fund drive and relief operations for COVID-19 frontliners since these ""compete with"" or are ""calculated to undermine"" the Duterte administration's efforts.
Robredo's actions may be in violation of the government's policies in addressing the pandemic, he claimed.
Robredo's office earlier said it had raised over P40 million for the fight against the virus spread, and had donated medical supplies to over 100 hospitals and local government units nationwide.

Robredo's spokesman, Barry Gutierrez earlier called Luna's call for an investigation as ""ridiculous and inappropriate.""
""Anyone who insists that bringing much needed assistance to hospitals, health workers, and poor Filipinos is somehow a 'competition' has absolutely no understanding of the gravity of the crisis we are all facing,"" he said.
The Vice President mobilized relief drives for COVID-19 frontliners ""because it was the right and responsible thing to do,"" Gutierrez said.
""She has done all this without requesting additional public funds or seeking expanded powers. She did this because she saw a need, and she took action to meet it,"" he added.

Under the new system, the DOH classifies those with symptoms but remain untested as ""suspect,"" while those awaiting results as ""probable.""
Meanwhile, patients with positive results from official testing laboratories are considered ""confirmed"" cases.
Since emerging from Wuhan City in Hubei province, China, Philippine health authorities have so far tested more than 42,000 individuals for COVID-19.

Testing of 8,700 suspected COVID cases in Metro Manila to start Tuesday: Galvez

Of this number, some 900,000 are polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test kits and 2 million are rapid test kits.
PCR test kits include reagents and other chemicals used to check if a patient’s sample has the COVID-19 virus.
Such kits can only be used in laboratories with PCR machines. The PCR lab technique allows the detection and amplification of genetic material in body fluids or samples. It has long been widely used in molecular biology.
Like other PCR test kits, it requires nose and throat swab samples from a patient.
Meanwhile, rapid test kits or immunoassay testing uses blood samples.
Such kits are unable to detect the COVID-19 virus. Instead, it measures a patient’s antibodies through the blood sample.
Philippine health authorities have so far tested more than 42,000 individuals since the virus emerged in Wuhan City in Hubei province, China.
As of Friday, COVID-19 has sickened 5,878 people, including 387 deaths and 487 recoveries.

A health worker conducts a COVID-19 swab test on a fellow hospital employee at the Sta. Ana Hospital in Manila on April 14, 2020. George Calvelo, ABS-CBN News


For a couple of weeks two months ago, even as the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) rampaged across the globe, all seemed right in the Philippines. Today, easily more than 5,000 people have tested positive for the virus all over the country and at least 300 have lost their lives. The tallies are expected to worsen in the coming weeks.
As anxiety and frustration mount, widespread testing for COVID-19 has, almost overnight, become the common call of online political commentary, a bellwether of how well (or not) a government is dealing with the crisis.
After all, as Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreysus, director general of the World Health Organization, put it, “You cannot fight a fire blindfolded.”
Last March 22, people took to the internet to echo this sentiment. Under the banner of #MassTestingNowPH, the online rally called on the government to expand its testing capacity and to make the kits free. Mainstream media, too, is awash with an almost daily accounting of these kits: how many are coming in and from where, which is cheaper than which, and have we been duped into accepting substandard donations.
But testing for COVID-19 will need much more than the kits. The entire process involves so many other elements―reagents, machines, infrastructure, human resource―without which the test kits will be useless.
The clock starts ticking the moment the swabs are collected. Viruses can survive only for so long in open air before their genetic material starts to degrade. At refrigerator temperatures, shelf life can be stretched to about a week. Beyond that, however, the specimens will have to be stored at sub-zero conditions―at least –70 degrees C, to be precise.
And so, in a race against time, a technician collects the samples―one from the throat and another from deep inside the nose, at the farthest rear wall―and dunks them into sterile tubes of a liquid called the viral transport medium. Inside a cooler full of ice, and under layers of packaging, the virus is sustained for the rest of the trip.
Back at the lab, before anything else is done to the samples, the viruses will have to be inactivated to keep the technicians safe. Heat is one way to accomplish this, according to Dr. Neil Andrew Bascos, PhD, Assistant Professor at the University of the Philippines Diliman National Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology. Some chemicals, particularly those involved in the next step, work, too.
Viruses keep their genetic material (ribonucleic acid, in this case, instead of the typical deoxyribonucleic acid in humans and animals) sealed inside their protein-and-fat coats. These need to be cracked open before the SARS-CoV-2 testing kits can hope to detect anything.


VERA Files


The process of isolating RNA from the samples is itself facilitated by dedicated kits. Specific details vary from kit to kit, but, generally, the goal is to open up the cells and the viral particles they contain, shut down molecules that may destroy genetic material, and sequester the RNA, away from all the other intracellular gunk.
(Kits pertain to sets of reagents that have been calibrated to work analytically well with each other. They also include inserts with directions for use. Some RNA extraction kits, for example, will have five tubes of reagents. This is also the case with the homegrown SARS-CoV-2 test kits, which contain three tubes.)

FDA approves UP COVID-19 test kits for commercial use

Unfortunately, getting to this viral motherlode is arguably the toughest step of the entire testing flowchart, and is a major bottleneck in the process, Dr. Bascos says. Each batch of samples up for RNA extraction, some 20 tubes or so, can take hours of work and a bagful of supplies. Even before the actual testing for SARS-CoV-2 begins, the lab will have already dug deep into its inventories.
Up until this point, the testing facility has just been preparing the samples for the actual virus detection. What results is a solution that is, in a word, messy. It will contain RNA from the virus, if present, but also from cells, from bacteria, and from whatever else was in the subjects’ throats when the swabs were collected. This is where the SARS-CoV-2 test kits come in.
These kits are based on a mainstay technique in molecular biology called polymerase chain reaction (PCR, for short), which targets a specific stretch of DNA and puts it through 30 or so cycles of DNA replication, copying it over and over. If present in the sample, PCR will have amplified the target sequence, allowing for easy detection.
But not just any PCR machine will do. SARS-CoV-2’s genetic material is RNA, not the typical DNA that the regular PCR machines usually handle. Testing centers need to use kits and machines that first reverse-transcribe the virus’ RNA into DNA, and then measure the amount of copies produced in real time, after every PCR cycle.
This process is called quantitative, reverse transcription PCR, and while the basic PCR machines are a dime a dozen in labs across the country, the machines that can pull off this more advanced technique are scarce.
It should go without saying that, at every step of the way, handlers and technicians have to be extra careful―and extra liberal with their use of disinfectants. These are highly infective viruses, after all, and the threat of contamination will always be present.
Improper handling and opening of sample tubes after heat inactivation may lead to aerosol formation, risking the infection of lab technicians, Dr. Bascos points out. The risks persist throughout the entire process, which is why testing is done in labs that are of biosafety level 2+.
These facilities are built with the special purpose of containing threats inside. Air flow in labs, for instance, should be inward to keep aerosols and droplets from leaking out into adjacent hallways and non-lab rooms. Labs should also come fitted with sterilization equipment and biosafety cabinets, which allow technicians to safely handle potentially infectious samples.


VERA Files


As of even date, the Department of Health has cleared 16 labs as testing facilities. These labs have proven that they can reliably detect SARS-CoV-2 in patient samples without putting their own people at risk.
At present, while scope of testing remains limited, the threat of a broken pipeline remains far off. Labs still have their RNA extraction kits from before the health crisis, and the reserves of supplies (plates, pipettor tips, all the different kinds of tubes, among others) should still be fine.
But because demand is soaring all over the world, it may become more and more difficult for the country to maintain a secure supply chain for these essential, but often unseen, parts of the testing process. Proceeding thoughtlessly may suffocate efforts to contain the outbreak.
Dr. Bascos knows this. And so do a lot of other experts and authorities who understand COVID-19 testing holistically. On their own and in quiet collaborations, these people are trying to prepare what they can, helping the country contain a problem before it explodes into a disaster.

MANILA - The Department of Tourism (DOT) has launched an online training program to help the tourism sector cope with the fallout of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, a high-ranking government official said Saturday.
Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles, spokesperson of the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Disease (IATF-EID), said DOT's program was conducted through video conferencing, which would allow stakeholders to embrace the ""new normal"" in the industry.
The program will cover tourism enterprises, which involves monitoring, evaluating and learning from past and present situations to enable tourism stakeholders to prepare better for the future, he said.
The DOT will also discuss the ""Filipino brand of service,"" which applies 7 values that characterize Philippine hospitality, Nograles added.
""Namely may likha, makatao, makakalikasan, makabansa, masayahin, may–bayanihan and may–pag–asa,"" he said in a virtual press briefing.
(Creative, humane, environmental, patriotic, happy, cooperative, and hopeful.)
In a statement released Thursday, Tourism Secretary Bernadette Romulo-Puyat urged stakeholders to participate in the program in an effort to move towards recovery.
“We can turn the temporary inactivity during lockdown into an opportunity to enhance the quality of tourist services. We can objectively look back at our past and current performance and utilize the breathing space to plan how we can further upgrade our services in our respective areas in the industry with the values of Filipino hospitality,” she said.
The agency will also develop additional modules on other topics.
""The DOT will continue to develop other online courses to enhance skills, assist and encourage stakeholders to cope, transition and move towards recovery,"" she added.
The COVID-19 crisis has withered tourist arrivals in the country due to travel restrictions enforced to contain the outbreak.
In February alone, tourist arrivals in the Philippines dropped 41.4 percent compared to 2019, Romulo-Puyat earlier said.
""If you want to look at the occupancy rates, in Boracay it's 40 percent down, in Cebu, it's 27 percent down, and Bohol, it's 40 percent down,"" she said.
The DOT has allocated P6 billion for ""international and domestic promotions, infrastructure, and regional tourism development.""
Romulo-Puyat said the amount would be spent on a new campaign for domestic travel (P421 million), engaging content to resonate with emerging countries unaffected by COVID-19 (P467 million), conducting and participating in international events and marketing initiatives worldwide (P725 million), night rating of secondary airports (P1.6 billion), training for COVID-19 protocols for industry stakeholders (P85 million), aid for local governments' tourism master plan (P400 million), and infrastructure development and expansion (P2.2 billion), among others.

MANILA - The Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) has been tasked to lead the government's contact tracing efforts against the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles said Saturday.
“Kahapon po nadesisyunan po ng IATF [Inter-Agency Task Force] na ang DILG na po, sa tulong ng ating mga LGU [local government units], ang mangunguna sa contact-tracing efforts,"" he said in a virtual press briefing.
(The IATF decided yesterday that the DILG, with the help of LGUs, should lead the contact tracing efforts.)
Contact tracing is a containment measure that involves identifying people who may have been exposed to a COVID-19 patient.
The DILG is ordered to enter a data-sharing agreement with the Department of Health (DOH) in accordance with the Data Privacy Act, said Nograles, spokesperson of the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID).
The government's coronavirus task force amended IATF Resolution No. 22, which earlier assigned the task to the Office of Civil Defense (OCD).
Under IATF Resolution No. 25, Nograles said the task force ""adopts a national-government-enabled, LGU-led, and people-centered response to the COVID-19 health event.”
“In materializing the aforementioned general principles, all agencies are directed to recommend sector-specific plans, strategies, and targets to the IATF. The National Task Force (NTF) COVID-19 is likewise directed to develop the necessary operational plans. LGUs are enjoined to pursue regional cooperation in leading the fight against COVID-19,"" he said.

 
Nograles had said patients diagnosed with COVID-19 must disclose personal information to enhance the government's efforts in locating people who may have come in contact with carriers of the disease.
Those who will disobey the government's order may face charges and penalties, he said.
Republic Act No. 11332 or the Mandatory Reporting of Notifiable Diseases and Health Events of Public Health Concern Act makes it obligatory to report medical conditions that are of public health concern. 
As of Friday, the number of coronavirus infections in the Philippines was at 5,878. The tally includes 387 people who succumbed to the disease and 487 who have recovered.
The Philippine government has so far tested 42,215 individuals, latest data from the DOH showed.

MANILA - The Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID) on Saturday urged local government units (LGUs) to include sugar in their relief packs to help sugar farmers weather the coronavirus crisis.
Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles, who serves as the task force’s spokesperson, said the Department of Agriculture (DA) made the recommendation in an effort to offset the slump in the demand for sugar following business closures due to lockdowns in Luzon and other parts of the country because of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
""Aprubado po ang rekomendasyon ng DA na hikayatin ang mga LGU na isama ang asukal sa mga relief goods sa kani-kanilang lugar upang tulungan ang ating sugar industry,"" he said in a virtual press briefing.
(The DA has approved a recommendation to encourage LGUs to include sugar in their relief goods to help the sugar industry.)
According to the Sugar Regulatory Administration, the Philippines has a total sugarcane plantation area of 409,714 hectares as of September 2019.
Some 67 percent of the sugarcane plantation area in the country is located in the Visayas, 19 percent in Mindanao and the remaining 14 percent in Luzon.
Majority of sugarcane farmers- about 85 percent- are considered small farmers. They cultivate 5 hectares and below of sugarcane. Meanwhile, some 14 percent of farmers cultivate 5 to 50 hectares of sugarcane, while only 1 percent cultivate 50 hectares and above.
During the press briefing, Nograles revealed that the national sub-group on food security has also been reorganized into the national task group on food security.
This, after National Task Force (NTF) COVID-19 chief implementer Carlito Galvez Jr. was authorized to abolish and reorganize sub-task groups to carry out the government's response against the disease, he said.
Nograles said the DA would lead the new task group. Other members of the task group are the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA), Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD), Department of Budget and Management (DBM), Department of Education (DepEd), Department of Science and Technology (DOST), the National Security Council (NSC) and the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG).

MANILA - The Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) said Friday it has provided cash assistance to 237,000 out of 321,000 private sector workers affected by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.
Speaking to radio DZMM, Labor Assistant Secretary Dominique Tutay said the agency has disbursed P1.2 billion to the formal sector's micro, small, and medium enterprises.
DOLE aims to distribute the remaining one-time P5,000 cash assistance to 84,000 other beneficiaries by end of April, she said.
""We are winding up the COVID-19 Adjustment Measures Program (CAMP). Nagbigay na kami ng anunsiyo na sa April 15 tigil na kami sa pag-accept ng applications,"" Tutay said.
DOLE received 1.6 million applications from 61,000 establishments nationwide seeking financial aid due to the COVID-19 crisis, she revealed.
""Wala kaming additional funding para ma-cover lahat ang ating manggagawa sa programang ito,"" Tutay said, adding the agency pegged the beneficiaries at around 230,000, but the number surged following the lockdown.

Middle class cash aid targets 3.4 million small business workers: DOF

However, Tutay said private sector workers from small businesses may still receive financial assistance through the Department of Finance's wage subsidy program.
DOF's program aims to distribute P51 billion in cash aid to some 3.4 million employees in small businesses.
Beneficiaries qualify if their companies are not included in the Bureau of Internal Revenue's large taxpayers list, Finance Assistant Secretary Antonio Lambino earlier said.
Those who missed at least 2 weeks’ worth of payroll can also avail of cash aid, along with those who were forced to stop or go on partial operations, he said.

MANILA--Quezon City Mayor Joy Belmonte earlier this week signed a budget worth P2.8 billion for 2020 to supplement funding in the fight against the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
""Wala dapat ikabahala ang ating mga residente dahil may nakalaang pondo para patuloy ang pag-alalay natin sa kanila sa gitna ng krisis na ito,” Belmonte said in a statement Friday.
(Our residents have nothing to worry about, because we have earmarked funds to support them through this crisis.)
The bulk of the 2020 supplemental budget will be spent on additional food and economic relief to support families, especially those who lost their livelihood amid the enhanced community quarantine imposed in Luzon to halt the contagion.
Some P697 million has been allocated for the purchase of more welfare goods, while P750 million will be given to families not included in the national government's social amelioration program (SAP), city budget officer Marian Orayani said in a statement.
Another P753 million has been set aside for the ""Kalingang QC"" program for vulnerable sectors, and provision of wages and hazard pay to city government employees identified as essential workers.
“We also allotted P200 million for the continued adjustment of the wages of our contractual and job-order employees to a livable rate, or not below the minimum P13,000,” said Orayani, adding that hazard pay will be given to all workers on duty during the quarantine. 
Under the Kalingang QC program, single parents, persons with disability (PWDs), vendors and public utility drivers were given a P2,000 financial assistance. The program was expanded to also cover transportation network vehicle services (TNVS) drivers, senior citizens and parents of PWDs.

MANILA - The Philippine government has so far prepared 2,780 quarantine facilities across the country for suspected coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases and for those having mild symptoms of the illness, a government official said Friday.

(This means that the hospital can now receive and process specimen from patients.)
This brings the total number of accredited laboratories to 17.

The goal of 8,000 tests per day is part of the government’s push for enhanced COVID-19 testing, a response to the need for mass testing.
While the DOH said it is still unable to test everyone, it will process more tests and prioritize severe cases and high-risk patients.
Meanwhile, the protocols for the use of COVID-19 rapid test kits are being finalized. This, after President Rodrigo Duterte approved last Sunday the procurement of 2 million rapid test kits.
 
“Kasalukuyan pong fina-finalize ang protocols ngayon sa technical level ng NTF COVID-19 ng tamang pag-gamit ng rapid test kits para sa mga close contacts ng mga persons under quarantine at para sa ating in-bound OFWs,” Galvez said.
 
“Isa sa mga lungsod na magsu-sumite ng proposal sa paggamit ng rapid test kits ay ang Baguio City at ang mga private sector. Ang implementasyon nito ay nararapat na sumang-ayon sa guidelines ng DOH at aprubado ng IATF na protocols,” he added.
 
On quarantine facilities, the Philippines currently has 2,780 facilities for suspected and mild COVID-19 cases, which can accommodate close to 168,000 patients.
 
“Iba pa po ito sa mga 'quarantine ships' na pinagamit sa atin ng mga pribadong kompanya, kasama na ang barkong 'Ang Pangulo,'” Galvez said.
 
He also reiterated the reminder for the public to stay at home and observe social distancing when they have to leave the house, following reports of individuals violating the enhanced community quarantine.
""Kapag tayo po ay lumabas, napakataas ng tsansa na tayo ay mahawa ng sakit at kalaunan, ay makahawa din tayo ng iba pa. Kaya kung tunay nating mahal ang ating pamilya, manatili na lamang po tayo sa ating mga tahahan,"" Galvez said. - With a report from Vivienne Gulla, ABS-CBN News

The Philippine government will also allow the use of ships as quarantine facilities for Filipino crew members subject to certain guidelines.
The use of the cruise ship as a quarantine facility will be determined by its “suitability as a quarantine facility and the cruise ship owners' willingness and capability to financially sustain the operation of the quarantine program in their ship,"" the DFA said.

KUALA LUMPUR - Malaysia has denied entry to a boat carrying about 200 Rohingya due to coronavirus fears, the air force said, after news emerged this week that scores died on another crowded vessel.
Activists are now fearful that large numbers of Rohingya, a persecuted Muslim minority from mostly Buddhist Myanmar, may be trapped on boats at sea and unable to reach other countries.
The latest developments have sparked concerns of a repeat of a 2015 crisis when many Rohingya died at sea after Southeast Asian nations turned their boats back following the collapse of long-established people smuggling routes.
In the latest incident, the Rohingya boat was spotted Thursday by a Malaysian air force jet off the northwestern island of Langkawi and then intercepted by 2 navy vessels backed by a helicopter.
Malaysian sailors gave the Rohingya food before escorting them out of the country's waters, the air force said.
""With their poor settlements and living conditions... it is strongly feared that undocumented migrants who try to enter Malaysia either by land or sea will bring (COVID-19) into the country,"" said an air force statement late Thursday.
It added that ""maritime surveillance operations will be intensified"".
The development signaled that Malaysia, which is under a nationwide lockdown to combat the spread of the virus after recording more than 5,000 cases and 80 deaths, is toughening its stance to deny Rohingya entry.
While relatively few boats carrying the minority have arrived in Malaysia since the 2015 crisis, some have been allowed into the country. Earlier this month, 202 Rohingya landed in Langkawi and were detained.
'DEATH SENTENCE'
Malaysia is a favored destination for the migrants from Myanmar as it is a Muslim-majority nation with a sizable Rohingya diaspora.
Many travel on crowded, rickety boats from squalid camps near Bangladesh's border, home to nearly a million Rohingya who fled Myanmar after a military offensive in 2017.
In the earlier incident, 60 Rohingya died on a boat crammed with hundreds of people stranded in the Bay of Bengal for more than 2 months, according to survivors.
That vessel was denied entry by Malaysia and Thailand and then headed back to Bangladesh where the migrants were picked up by the coast guard late Wednesday. About 400 people were rescued.
Activist group Fortify Rights said Rohingya had told them other ships were adrift at sea between Bangladesh and Malaysia, and urged regional governments to allow boats ashore.
""Sending an ill-equipped ship of refugees out to sea is unlawful and a death sentence,"" said the group's CEO Matthew Smith.

MANILA - The Philippine National Police (PNP) on Thursday vowed to strictly implement the coronavirus lockdown following a reported increase in the number of private vehicles traveling in Metro Manila.
Speaking to ANC, PNP deputy chief for operations Lt. Gen. Guillermo Eleazar said they noticed that more cars started returning after the Holy Week and during the distribution of government's emergency subsidy to families affected by the crisis.
""Ibang tao, akala nila ay puwede na maglabasan. That's why we notice a lot of vehicles sa kalsada,"" he said.
PNP chief Lt. Gen. Archie Gamboa has ordered his subordinates to strictly enforce the enhanced community quarantine imposed in Luzon to curtail the spread of COVID-19, Eleazar said.
The Highway Patrol Group (HPG) has also been directed to set up checkpoints in major thoroughfares and check occupants of private vehicles if they are authorized to travel, he added.
Only allowed to travel during the lockdown are those in the medical services, security services, financial services, utilities and other involved in essential services.
As one member per household is allowed to travel to avail of essential needs, this has become prone to abuse because some use it as a license to go to other cities, Eleazar said.
The police official said HPG is coordinating with the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) and Land Transportation Office (LTO) to issue tickets and confiscate the licenses of quarantine violators.
Since the start of the lockdown, some 119,000 quarantine violators have been accosted, Eleazar said. Majority were given warning while some 2,900 remain in detention.
""Sa mga pasaway nating mga kababayan, mag-isip kayo, kasi kapag kayo ay mahuli talagang sakripisyo. Mahirap ang mangyayari sa inyo,"" he said.
Eleazar also said they had a meeting with city mayors, who were thinking of other means of limiting the movement of people.
Among the suggestions that came up were allowing residents to go out on certain days and having market on wheels.

MANILA - President Rodrigo Duterte on Thursday warned beneficiaries of the Social Amelioration Program that he would not hesitate to withdraw support should they be found to have misused the financial aid given to them by the government.
Duterte made the statement following reports that a number of beneficiaries were found to have wasted the emergency subsidy of the government through gambling or drinking activities.
In his speech, the Chief Executive ordered the Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG) to look at these incidents.
“I’d like the DILG to investigate sinong pasabong pati yung nag-iinuman. Alam mo sa totoo lang, yung kayong nagsasabong pati nag-iinuman, ibig sabihin may pera kayo. Do not expect any help from me. Sabihin ko talaga. Sorry nalang,” Duterte said.
The President said that he would rather give the money instead to those who are truly in need, noting the limited funds of the government.
“Eh dapat yung assistance na binibigay ng gobyerno eh dapat talagang gamitin ninyo sa wastong paraan. Now for those people who are identified by the barangay captains and the mayors, who are violating the quarantine, pasensya ho kayo. Help would not… ay kung ganon may pera pala. So kulang na kulang talaga ibigay ko nalang talaga sa nangangailangan at walang mapuntahan,” Duterte warned.

“Kayo, what have you done for the country except to talk and criticize and talk?”
The President likened his critics to ""snakes"".
“Sa Mindanao maraming ahas, pero hindi ko alam na karamihan cobra lumipat na dito,” Duterte said.
“Kita mo nagdadaldal. ’Yan, mga kobra. Walang ginawa kundi maghintay, magkagat, just to be able to open his or her mouth, para sabihin alam lahat.”
In his address that lasted 50 minutes, Duterte instead urged those who criticized him to follow the government’s guidelines against COVID-19.
“Itong mga nagbabatikos naman. There will always be a time for everything and I hope the next magsabi ako, maniwala kayo. Kasi po ako magsabi walang politika, hindi na po ako makatakbo,” he said.
“For so many years, ilang taon na silang nandiyan. Puro posturing, puro porma, pa pretty boy, marami ’yan.
“Huwag kayong makinig diyan. Dito kayo makinig sa gobyerno. Tutal ako ang nagdadala. I’m telling you we’re doing everything.”

Four Trillion ang budget mo, tapos hahanapan mo ako ng ambag? Batukan kaya kita.

Former Sen. Antonio Trillanes IV, one of Duterte's fiercest critics, lashed out on Thursday night.
""Four trillion ang budget mo, tapos hahanapan mo ako ng ambag? Batukan kaya kita,"" he wrote on Twitter.
This year's spending plan is 9 percent higher than the P3.76 trillion budget for 2019.
To date, the novel coronavirus has infected 5,660 persons in the country, the highest among Southeast Asian countries as of Thursday.

MANILA (2nd UPDATE) - President Rodrigo Duterte on Thursday ordered the military and police to be prepared in taking over enforcement of lockdown measures following rampant violations of the enhanced community quarantine imposed in Luzon to curtail the spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
""I’m just asking for your disiplina konti. Kasi 'pag ayaw ninyo, ayaw ninyong maniwala mag-take over ang military, pati police. I am ordering them now to be ready,"" he said in a late night virtual press briefing.
""Ang police pati military ang mag-enforce sa distance… social distance at ‘yong curfew, sila na. Parang martial law na rin. Mamilli kayo. Ayaw ko pero 'pagka naipit na ‘yong bayan at walang disiplina kayo, hindi na bale sana kung hindi kayo maniwala sa akin wala naman akong paki,"" he added.
""Hindi naman tayo kaibigan, hindi naman tayo kapartido, ayaw ninyo sa akin eh di okay lang. Pero ngayon anumang partido mo o anumang kulay mo sumunod ka. Kasi ‘pag hindi, ang kaharap mo sunod ang militar na pati pulis,"" Duterte further added.
As of Thursday, the Philippines has 5,660 COVID-19 cases, with 362 deaths and 435 recoveries.

In his speech, the President told local government units to follow the national government's guidelines against COVID-19.
""Hindi nga naman ako namimilit. Hindi nga ito martial law eh. And even 'yong martial law, you don't put people in prison. Walang rason ang martial law kasi wala namang virus diyan, wala namang bacteria, whatsoever,"" he said.
The President added, ""Hindi nga naman ito martial law pero parang martial law na rin, in the sense I have to impose something on you for your own good and for the good of the country and people.""
The Philippine National Police Joint Task Force Corona Virus Shield reported earlier this week that some 108,088 quarantine violators were accosted from March 17, the start of the Luzon lockdown, until April 12.
Of this number, 76,989 were given warnings while 4,969 were fined. A total of 5,539, meanwhile, were charged while 20,591 are facing complaints.
The President placed Luzon's population of over 50 million under lockdown - barring public gatherings, suspending school, work and public transport - in a bid to prevent further spread of the contagious COVID-19.
The lockdown was supposed to end on April 12, but the President extended it to April 30 to effectively contain the crisis.

MANILA - Local government units in Metro Manila should zero in on tracing, testing and treating of COVID-19 patients in a bid to flatten the curve of the pandemic, a government official said Thursday.
In a virtual press briefing, National Task Force (NTF) COVID-19 Response spokesperson Restituto Padilla said they would localize the implementation of the national action plan to eliminate the threat of the virus and mitigate the impact of the crisis.
""Ang hangarin po natin 'is to flatten the curve' sa NCR dahil ito po ang sentro ng karamihan sa kaso ng mga COVID-19 sa bansa,"" he said.
(Our goal is to flatten the curve in NCR because that's the center of most cases of COVID-19 in the country.)
""I would like to emphasize, we cannot be complacent at this time nor at any time thereafter until our country is rid of this disease,'"" he added.
To rein in COVID-19, Padilla said expanded and targeted testing, which is being carried out in South Korea, China and Singapore, should be conducted by LGUs.
Suspected coronavirus carriers, frontline workers and members of the vulnerable sectors will be prioritized in the testing, he said.
By scaling up tracing, Padilla said authorities would be able to identify COVID-19 hot spots.
""Kapag ating nagawa ito nang tuloy-tuloy ay unti-unti na tayong makakausad patungo sa 'new normal,'' he said.
(When we're able to do this, we can gradually shift towards the new normal.) 
The Philippines has so far tested 42,215 individuals since the virus, which emerged in Wuhan City in Hubei province, China, reached the country. As of Thursday, a cumulative number of 5,660 people have contracted the disease in the country.
The country's tally of infections include 362 people who succumbed to the disease while 435 have recovered.

MANILA - The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) Philippines on Thursday urged the public to ensure the safety and well-being of children as various measures affecting them have been imposed to contain the spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
With schools closed nationwide and people ordered to stay home to curb the spread of COVID-19, children's routines and support systems are disrupted, exposing them to violence, distress and neglect, said lawyer Marj Ardivilla, child protection specialist of UNICEF Philippines.
""The key message on the pandemic is that there is a silent emergency happening at home, where home confinement, isolation, economic woes also increase at risk children to exposure of other types of violence, not just online,"" Ardivilla said in an interview on ANC.
""We talk about physical violence. We talk about psychological violence. We talk about emotional violence.""
As people moved online to communicate due to the restriction of their movement in public, children can also be exposed to cyber violence and risky online behavior, Ardivilla warned.
She urged parents and guardians to support their kids deal with the crisis despite feeling anxious and stressed.
""Practice open communication and nurture an open and caring environment at home,"" she said, adding children rely on their parents to provide a sense of safety and security.
To create a sense of normalcy at home while dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic, the UN's children's agency advised parents to be calm and proactive, stick to a routine, let their children feel their emotions, check with them about what they're hearing, create welcome distractions, and monitor their own behavior.
In a statement released Tuesday, UNICEF also called on the Philippine government to align with global guidance to release children in conflict with the law, and immediately adopt and implement guidelines to protect children against COVID- 19 for those whose continuing detention will be required by law.
“In times of emergency, children are already confused and distressed from the fear and anxiety brought by the uncertainty of the spread of disease. We at Unicef would want to ensure that there is a protective and caring environment for children at all times,"" said Patrizia Benvenuti, Unicef Philippines Chief of Child Protection Section.
""We encourage all local government units to implement the recently launched Joint Memorandum Circular that shall protect the best interest of children, by ensuring that they are physically, emotionally, and psychologically protected all the time,"" she added.

,Apr 16 2020,nCov,Valenzuela mayor Rex Gatchalian says not testing PUMs a concern,ABS-CBN News,"
MANILA--Valenzuela City mayor Rex Gatchalian on Thursday expressed concern over not testing so-called persons under monitoring (PUMs) after his local government found out 5 of them carried the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
""This is very alarming. A whole category deleted by the Department of Health is actually testing positive,"" Gatchalian said in an interview on ANC.
The health department last week released a new guideline that PUMs are no longer included in the new classification of COVID-19 cases.
In the DOH's February guideline, PUMs are those exposed to a COVID-19 infected patient or has a travel history, but do not exhibit symptoms. They are required to undergo a monitored 14-day home quarantine.

 
""So in effect, I was like, 'Why is this happening when experts said don't test them anymore?' And my immediate reaction was not only for Valenzuela, but to all the Department of Health,"" Gatchalian said.
To date, the city has 53 confirmed COVID-19 cases. The new patient is a 34-year-old hospital frontliner.
Gatchalian said the city started its localized mass testing Saturday and would be including PUMs to narrow down potential carriers.
""With this targeted testing, we are narrowing it down and we're going to allocate the resources for those who need it the most. Testing is actually saving us the most on much needed resources in manpower,"" he said.
The city government will later test frontline workers, vulnerable communities and returning overseas Filipino workers (OFWs).
After the enhanced community quarantine was extended to April 30 to halt the contagion, Gatchalian said city officials would be distributing 220,000 food vouchers, including to middle class and working class families.
""We know they are hurting and we wanted to make sure there is food on the table,"" he said.
Valenzuela handed out food packs to 112,000 families belonging to low-income households when the lockdown was imposed in March.
With an extended lockdown, Gatchalian said his city would be asking for more assistance from the national government.
""Yes, we are fairly a big LGU. Yes, we can manage our people, but government resources are always not infinite. It's always finite compared to the infinite needs,"" he said.

MANILA - The Philippine government has distributed financial assistance to 4 million out of 18 million poor families affected by the coronavirus pandemic, the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) said Wednesday, nearly a month into the lockdown imposed in Luzon and several areas in the country to halt the contagion.
Speaking to radio DZMM, Social Welfare Undersecretary Milo Gudmalin also said the agency had downloaded some P65 billion worth of funds to 1,228 local government units (LGUs) for the government's Social Amelioration Program (SAP).
""Hindi pa (nangangalahati). Malayo pa pero na-distribute na natin ito... Inaasahan natin sa linggong ito, dadami, dodoble ang mabibigyan ng subsidy ng ating LGUs,"" he said.
The Philippine government has allotted a P200-billion emergency package for low-income households to help them weather the crisis.
Under the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act, each beneficiary will receive cash aid ranging from P5,000 to P8,000 in April and May based on minimum wage in the region.
Among those entitled to the cash aid are the elderly, homeless Filipinos, pregnant women, indigents, “no work, no pay” workers, and families that belong to the marginalized sectors.
One of the reasons for the slow distribution of cash subsidy, Gudmalin said, was that LGUs have to reconcile the list of beneficiaries.
""May proseso kasi na ginagawa. Nililista ng barangay kung sino ang dapat makakatanggap, gagawa ng payroll, i-encash ang pera at doon mag-uumpisa ang pamimigay,"" he added.
The aid was released on April 2 and DSWD immediately coordinated with LGUs on creating a memorandum of agreement for the release of fund on April 3, Gudmalin said. Distribution of fund to different localities started on April 7.
To remedy the government's rollout of the program, DSWD released guidelines, saying the agency would audit the list of beneficiaries later.
""Hindi na muna gagawa ng validation ang DSWD. Kailangan masigurado ng LGUs na qualified at entitled beneficiaries ang makakasama sa listahan,"" Gudmalin said.
For families who were not able to receive cash subsidy, they can appeal to DSWD and will be included in the second wave of distribution, he said.
If DSWD will discover that LGUs have given cash aid to unqualified beneficiaries, they would have to reimburse, Gudmalin added.
Those who do not follow the guidelines set by the national government may face administrative, civil and criminal charges.
The DSWD can be reached through its hotline 8951-2803.
As of Wednesday, the Philippine has recorded 5,453 coronavirus cases, with 349 deaths and 353 recoveries.

WASHINGTON - Iceland has provided a textbook example of how to get out ahead of a looming pandemic: per capita, it has tested more people for coronavirus than any other country on earth and it got started a month before the first case was even confirmed in the tiny Nordic island nation. 
In a study published Tuesday in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers from Icelandic universities and deCODE Genetics, a subsidiary of the US biotech giant Amgen, released the results of an all-out screening program launched on Jan. 31 -- before the disease caused by the virus had even been baptized COVID-19 and more than a month before the global pandemic was declared.
The study involved 2 testing drives. The first, starting Jan. 31, targeted people with symptoms of coronavirus infection and people who had traveled to high-risk areas -- initially China and the Alps regions of Austria, Italy and Switzerland -- or people who had come into contact with others who were in fact infected with the virus.
It found that as of late March, 13.3 percent of more than 9,000 people who were screened tested positive. The first case of infection was confirmed on Feb. 28.
In a second testing program that began March 13, deCODE Genetics screened the general population of people with no coronavirus symptoms or who had mild symptoms, such as those of the common cold, and were not in quarantine. Here, the proportion of positive cases was much lower: between 0.6 percent and 0.8 percent.
As of right now, Iceland has carried out tests on 36,000 people, which is 10 percent of its population.
That makes it by far the world leader in testing per capita -- 10 times more than South Korea, which has won much praise around the world for acting quickly to test its people as the virus spread. South Korea has conducted 10 tests per 1,000 inhabitants, according to the website Our World in Data.
MANY ASYMPTOMATIC CARRIERS OUT THERE
This aggressive testing program in Iceland apparently helped slow the spread of the virus by allowing health authorities to detect people who were infected and contagious but had no symptoms or thought they just had a cold or the flu.
When people were told they had tested positive, they had to self-isolate at home until 10 days after their fever had subsided or until they tested negative for the virus. And anybody who came in contact with them had to self-quarantine for 2 weeks.
If the people who ended up being positive had not been tested, they probably would not have self-quarantined and would have gone on to infect others unknowingly.
Unlike other countries, Iceland refrained from closing its day care facilities and elementary schools. High schools and universities did shut down March 16, followed by swimming pools, sports arenas, movie theaters, bars and restaurants.
So far, Iceland has detected 1,720 cases of the virus, which is proportionally higher compared to countries that test only people who have been hospitalized. But its coronavirus death toll of just 8 people is per capita just a tenth of that of France, for instance.
The government of Iceland says it believes the apex of its chapter of the pandemic sweeping the globe is now passed, and plans to reopen high schools, universities, museums and beauty salons on May 4.
The study yielded other interesting findings as well.
One is that 43 percent of people who tested positive either had no symptoms, or at least they did not at the time of their testing. This provides further evidence that many carriers of the virus are asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic.

LONDON - A 106-year-old great-grandmother, thought to be the oldest patient in Britain to beat the novel coronavirus, was discharged from hospital to applause from nurses and health workers.
Connie Titchen, from Birmingham, in central England, battled the virus for just under 3 weeks and was given a clean bill of health by medics at City Hospital.
""I feel very lucky that I’ve fought off this virus,"" Titchen said. ""I can’t wait to see my family.""
As Titchen was wheeled out, the hospital's masked health workers lined the ward to clap her out. Titchen told health staff she was looking forward to seeing her family and having a good meal.
""I am hungry,"" she said.
Titchen was born in 1913 when George V, grandfather of Queen Elizabeth II, was on the throne. She was born before the Russian revolutions of 1917, lived through both world wars and has now survived COVID-19.
She was admitted to hospital in mid-March with suspected pneumonia and diagnosed with COVID-19 soon afterwards. But she battled the virus and won.
Granddaughter Alex Jones, 40, said Titchen had always been physically active, though she does have a soft spot for McDonalds occasionally.
""She has always cooked for herself too, although she likes a cheeky McDonalds every now and then. I haven’t told her they are closed,"" said Jones. 
""I think the secret of her old age is that she is physically active and very independent. She had a hip operation back in December and within 30 days she was walking again. She really is amazing and I know all the family can’t wait to see her. She has quite a few fans!""
Nurse Kelly Smith who looked after Titchen said: ""It’s been fantastic to see Connie recover. She is amazing and we’ve been doing our best to nurse her back to health.""
""We were really pleased when she was given the all clear. It’s nice to see patients leave our ward after having beaten this virus.""

MAYNILA - Mas naghigpit pa ang Presidential Security Group (PSG) sa mga ipinatutupad nitong hakbang para matiyak na hindi mahahawaan ng coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) si Pangulong Rodrigo Duterte.
Sabi ni PSG Commander Col. Jesus Durante, minamandato na nila sa lahat ng lalapit sa Pangulo na sumailalim muna sa rapid test.
Gagawin ito ng PSG Task Force COVID medical team at iba ito sa polymerase chain reaction o RT-PCR test kits na ginagawa ng RITM.
Ang rapid test ay dagdag sa kasalukuyang medical assessment at measures na ipinatutupad ng PSG para protektahan ang Pangulo.
Sabi ni Durante, parang pregnancy test ito kung saan matapos kuhanan ng dugo ay 15 minutes lang malalaman na ang resulta.
Ang mga mapapatunayang positibo ay hindi papayagang makapasok sa lugar kung nasaan ang Pangulo, lalo na kung nakitaan sila ng sintomas gaya ng lagnat.
Aabisuhan din ito ng medical personnel ng PSG na mag-self quarantine. 
Walang exempted aniya dito at maging ang high-ranking government officials, PSG troopers at close-in personnel na laging kasama ng Pangulo ay sumasailalim dito.
Pero paglilinaw naman ni Durante, hindi nila itinuturing na definite at absolute na ang resulta ng rapid test gayong antibodies at hindi ang mismong virus ang nababasa ng pagsusuri.
Subject for confirmation pa rin aniya sa RT-PCR test ng RITM kung talagang positibo sa COVID- 19 ang isang bisita.
Gayunman, minabuti na rin ng PSG na gumamit ng ganito bilang dagdag proteksiyon na rin sa Pangulo.
Tatlong linggo na aniya nila ginagawa ang prosesong ito sa Malacañang.

COPENHAGEN - Global efforts to join forces against the coronavirus faltered Wednesday after Donald Trump halted funding for the World Health Organization, igniting criticism from leaders who are urging solidarity in the face of a crippling economic crisis.
The US president's shock move came as a patchwork of countries experiment with loosening lockdown measures, ushering the planet into a new and uncertain phase of a pandemic that has killed more than 125,000 people worldwide and infected at least 2 million. 
In Europe, Denmark became the first country on the badly-hit continent to start reopening schools, while Finland lifted a travel blockade on the Helsinki region. 
Italy and Spain have also allowed some businesses to restart after signs both are finally flattening the curve following weeks of punishing death tolls. 
But as leaders launch into delicate debates of how to jump-start economies without triggering new waves of infection, Trump rattled efforts at global solidarity by ramping up his blame-game with the WHO, the UN's health agency. 
The president ordered the US to freeze funding pending a review into the WHO's role in ""severely mismanaging and covering up the spread of the coronavirus."" 
Trump charged that the outbreak could have been contained ""with very little death"" if the WHO had accurately assessed the situation in China, where the disease broke out late last year.
Leaders around the globe fired back at the US president, who had initially downplayed the dangers of a virus that has now killed more people in the United Sates than any other country on the planet.
Beijing warned that the move would ""undermine the international cooperation"" at a ""critical moment"" in the pandemic. 
Trump also earned a rebuke from UN chief Antonio Guterres as well as entrepreneur Bill Gates who tweeted that cutting funding was ""as dangerous as it sounds.""
The European Union's foreign policy chief was similarly disapproving. 
""There is no reason justifying this move at a moment when their efforts are needed more than ever to help contain and mitigate the coronavirus pandemic,"" Josep Borrell said in a tweet. 
And African Union chief Moussa Faki Mahamat condemned Trump's decision as ""deeply regrettable."" 
Trump's controversial attack came as the world is facing down a looming economic catastrophe, which the International Monetary Fund has said could see $9 trillion wiped from the global economy in the worst downturn since the 1930s Great Depression.
Underlining the point, Europe's powerhouse Germany has been in recession since March, the government said Wednesday.
The virus-hit Chinese economy, second only to the US, probably contracted for the first time in around 3 decades in the first quarter, according to an AFP poll of economists.
Meanwhile finance ministers from the G20 -- the world's richest countries -- held virtual talks Wednesday about a possible debt moratorium for poor states struggling to weather the costs of the pandemic. 
EUROPEAN LOCKDOWN EASING
With tentative hope the pandemic could be past its peak in some European hot spots, countries are gradually lifting restrictions -- to mixed reception.
Children started returning to nurseries, kindergartens and primary schools in parts of Denmark, where other measures, such as the closing of borders, bars, restaurants remained in place. 
Finland's Prime Minister Sanna Marin also lifted a travel ban in the Helsinki region even as she urged residents to continue avoiding movement, saying ""now is not the right time to go to the summer cottage."" 
Italy, the first European country to enter a full lockdown, is allowing bookshops, launderettes, stationers and children's clothing retailers to reopen.
And Spain, which saw another dip in its daily death toll, has permitted work to start some factories and construction sites, though most people remain under strict stay-at-home measures. 
Yet warnings abound that a real return to normal is still a long way off.
Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said the confinement was working but that ""nothing will be the same until a vaccine is found.""
Germany was also expected to extend its coronavirus restrictions to May 3, regional government sources said Wednesday.
Harvard scientists, meanwhile, have warned it is unlikely that one-time lockdowns will do the job, predicting that repeated periods of social distancing could be needed into 2022 to avoid overwhelming hospitals. 
'UNENFORCEABLE, UNSUSTAINABLE'
Elsewhere, governments are struggling to enforce lockdowns in impoverished regions where shutdowns are spreading hunger among the poorest. 
As the virus appeared to be on the retreat in some parts of richer Europe, it is slowly taking hold in Africa, which has seen 15,000 cases and 800 deaths continent-wide -- with fears over growing hunger and possible social unrest.
""You are condemning people to a choice between starving and getting sick,"" said Jakkie Cilliers at the Pretoria-based Institute for Security Studies (ISS), warning that lockdowns were unsustainable across much of Africa.
""It's not possible for 10 people living in a tin shack... to not go outside for 3 weeks.""
A similar crisis is emerging in Ecuador, where hunger trumps fear of the virus for residents in rundown areas of the badly affected city of Guayaquil. 
""The police come with a whip to send people running, but how do you say to a poor person 'Stay home' if you don't have enough to eat?"" said Carlos Valencia, a 35-year-old teacher.
The city's mayor has warned that overstretched medical facilities mean many are dying without the chance to be tested -- a reality that could be be hiding the true extent of the carnage in many poorer places. 
People are continuing to ""collapse in their houses, in the hospitals, all over the place,"" said mayor Cynthia Viteri.
However, in parts of the world that saw early outbreaks, there were some hopefully examples of life going on as normal.
Though they were required to wear face masks and gloves, South Koreans nevertheless headed to the polls Wednesday and delivered a strong show of support for President Moon Jae-in, commending his handling of the epidemic.

NEW DELHI - Millions of people in rural India will be allowed back to work next week despite a nationwide coronavirus lockdown, the government said Wednesday, as it conceded the hardships of shutting its vital farming economy were too great.
Restrictions on movement in the world's second-most populous nation of 1.3 billion people -- put in place in late March -- have hit the poorest the hardest, including rural migrant workers and other laborers.
In cities and towns, usually bustling streets are deserted with shops shuttered, while jobless migrants who did not manage to make the long journey home to villages, often on foot, are living in crowded shelters in cities.
The lockdown has also taken place during the harvest season, with farmers worried their reaping and sowing cycles will be severely disrupted and place further pressure on India's food supply chain -- already hit by transport delays.
""To mitigate hardship to the public, select additional activities will be allowed,"" the Home Affairs Ministry said.
""The revised consolidated guidelines are aimed at operating those sectors of the economy which are critical from the perspective of rural and agricultural development.""
Under the new guidelines to be implemented from April 20, agriculture and related sectors including farmers' markets, logistics, repair shops and brick kilns will be restarted.
Strict measures will be enforced, including the wearing of face masks or coverings.
Some factories such as manufacturing will also be re-opened but staffing will be limited and working hours staggered.
Factory owners are required to try and provide dormitories for workers or arrange special transport to and from the plants.
Refineries, coal production and some construction will also be permitted.
The rural and industry sectors make up about 40 percent of India's GDP. Some 70 percent of India's workforce lives in rural regions.
Many fear India's lockdown has pushed millions of workers, particularly in the informal economy, deeper into poverty.
""There are no buyers and I'm selling very little,"" vegetable seller Waseem Ahmed at a market in the capital New Delhi told AFP Wednesday, adding he did not know where or when his next meal would come from.
Ahmed, who is 28 and supports a family of 10, said he couldn't even leave the wholesale market as local police were beating anyone seen outside during the lockdown.
India has reported just over 11,400 coronavirus cases including 377 deaths. But experts warn that more testing needs to be done to gauge how widely the infectious disease has spread.
There are concerns that weaker public health care systems in South Asian nations will be unable to cope with a major outbreak.

MANILA - The Philippine National Police (PNP) is prepared to provide security for the possible implementation of ""selective quarantine"" past April 30, its head said Tuesday.
""From here, the way forward in my analysis is for us to expect a longer operation period in our law enforcement and public safety functions beyond April 30 for a possible selective quarantine in some areas,"" PNP chief Archie Gamboa said in a video message.
Since the enhanced community quarantine was imposed in Luzon and elsewhere in the country to curb the spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the 205,000-strong police force has apprehended more than 100,000 lockdown violators, mostly in Luzon.
The police also nabbed 680 unscrupulous traders for price control and fair trade violations, and caught some 8,000 public utility vehicles (PUVs) for violating mass transit ban.
""What was initially proposed as a community quarantine covering Metro Manila was supposed to end today, had it not been overtaken by the turn of events that made it urgently necessary to expand the duration and scope of the community quarantine and enhance its implementation across Luzon until April 30,"" Gamboa said.

 
To help the government respond to the impacts of the crisis, especially for those in the marginalized sector who are badly affected, the PNP created a ""Bayanihan Fund Challenge"" to raise over P200 million from its personnel.
""Men and women of the PNP, I know that individually, we have more than enough to spare for our government and our people in their direst need. I believe this is not too much our country can ask from us and to which we are willing to give,"" the PNP chief said.
To date, the police have raised P34 million from star-rank police officers and their staff, who account for 20 percent of the PNP strength.
He said leaders in the command group and directorial staff, police regional offices, national support units, and all star-rank officers have committed 50 percent of their basic pay for the month of May.
""I must emphasize that the Bayanihan Fund Challenge is strictly voluntary with no standard amount of contribution specified. The project does not authorize automatic salary deduction, or the use of funds sourced from PNP appropriations,"" Gamboa said.
In his message, he also revealed that qualified police personnel will receive on April 16 a hazard pay of P500 per day for their service during the health crisis.
Members of Public Safety Mutual Benefit Fund, Inc. (PSMBFI) will also receive P5,000 cash aid to tide them over the crisis, Gamboa said.
As of Wednesday, the Philippines has recorded 5,453 coronavirus infections, with 349 deaths and 353 recoveries.

BANGKOK - Thais are flocking to Bangkok's Chinatown to sell their gold jewelry as the price of the precious metal spikes and the economy tanks due to the coronavirus pandemic.
Gold surged to a 7-year high on Tuesday to $1,731.25 an ounce, following global moves led by the US to reinflate economies with trillions of dollars of stimulus measures.
That has boosted the price of gold across the world, tempting many to sell their stocks of the precious metal at a time of economic hardship without recent precedent. 
Many Thais buy gold jewelry as an investment in times of plenty, to be sold when prices rise or belts tighten.
In Bangkok, where a virtual lockdown has taken root for a fortnight, hundreds flocked to Yaowarat, Bangkok's Chinatown, to trade bracelets, necklaces and rings for cash as local gold prices jumped more than 20 percent.
""I don't have any savings so I decided to sell the gold I have for cash to keep me afloat during this time,"" Thanakorn Promyuyen, a 39-year-old street vendor told AFP.
Traders have bought tens of millions of dollars worth of gold since Tuesday, according to Jitti Tangsitpakdi, a chairman of a trade association.
""One shop bought 200 million baht ($6.1 million) of ornaments and bars,"" he said, explaining businesses whose revenue has been strangled by the lockdown are being forced to sell their gold savings.
""Their businesses are in bad shape; better to sell gold and keep cash,"" he added.
""In over 60 years and I never seen people queue like this to sell their gold."" 
Thailand's economy is forecast to contract by more than 5 percent this year after the virus shuttered borders -- killing the cash cow tourist industry -- leaving millions unemployed.
""I don't have any income, only expenses,"" said 43-year-old Aumporn Pansa as he sold his jewelry.
""I have kids to take care of as well as monthly bills, so I had to come here and sell.”

Local officials in the barangay level are dipping in to their calamity funds to provide relief assistance to communities that have been dislocated by the lockdown on Metro Manila implemeted by the government to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Fernando G. Sepe Jr., ABS-CBN News


MANILA - The novel coronavirus doesn't spare anyone. So it is more important than ever to stay healthy during the enhanced community quarantine.
As millions of livelihoods hang in the balance, the government has been distributing relief goods to tide families over the pandemic.
Since access to food becomes a challenge, the Food and Nutrition Research Institute (FNRI) created recipes on how to eat healthy using the food packs.
FNRI director Mario Capanzana said Filipinos could add vegetables such as pechay and alugbati when cooking sardines and noodles.
""Kung may noodles o sardinas, maaaring samahan ng gulay na magpapasarap nito,"" he told radio DZMM.
To further boost the immune system, Capanzana said it was also important to consume vitamin C, which aids the body in fighting infections.
Fruits that are abundant in vitamin C are guava, ripe papaya, strawberry, rambutan, pomelo, green mango, and dalandan, among others.
""Ilang piraso nito ay maaaring mag-meet ng ating requirement ng vitamin C,"" Capanzana said.
When rice is not available, root crops such as sweet potatoes are excellent alternative for carbohydrates.
""Sweet potatoes and cassava are cheaper and more nutritious. They can be stored longer in the pantry... They are safe alternatives for people with hypertension and diabetes because of their high fiber content and low glycemic index,"" the FNRI said.
The FNRI said eggs were also great sources of protein, vitamins A, B, E, and K.
""These nutrients are essential in maintaining bodily functions and immunity,"" the agency said.
Legumes like munggo, kadyos, kidney beans and nuts are also good sources of protein, vitamins and minerals, the FNRI said.
""They are less perishable and can be added to a variety of dishes,"" the agency said.
The FNRI also urged the public to get enough sleep, exercise frequently and maintain healthy weight.

,Apr 15 2020,nCov,The ANC Brief: No nationwide lockdown,ABS-CBN News,"
The Philippines has commenced mass testing for the coronavirus. Meanwhile, the number of cases keeps rising. Here are the stories making the headlines today on ANC:



No cash for middle class
The number of COVID-19 cases in the country breached the 5,000 level. But the number of recoveries in a single day reached a new high with 53. COVID-19 Response Chief Implementor Carlito Galvez Jr. has ruled out a nationwide lockdown. The task force is also tracking down 15,000 potential carriers of virus. President Rodrigo Duterte approved a P50.8-billion wage subsidy for workers of small businesses. Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez said cash aid for the middle class wouldn't happen.

Fit and healthy
The Palace said a petition to compel the disclosure of the true state of President Duterte’s health would be junked. On Monday, a lawyer filed a petition before the Supreme Court for the disclosure. But Malacanang said the petition was based on speculation and “anchored on mere conjectures and surmises.” He said Duterte is “fit and healthy” to lead the country amid the pandemic.



Time of reckoning
The Department of Justice (DOJ) Office of the Prosecutor released Tuesday a subpoena for Sen. Koko Pimentel for allegedly breaching quarantine protocol after he showed up at a hospital despite experiencing symptoms of the coronavirus. A preliminary investigation has been tentatively set for May 20.

While the world fights COVID-19
According to Gregory Poling of the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative (AMTI), China is still building its presence in the disputed South China Sea as the world grapples with COVID-19. Recently, a Chinese sea vessel sunk a Vietnamese fishing boat. The Philippines expressed solidarity with Vietnam on the incident. But who or what can stop China? Poling recommends a multilateral effort to put political and economic pressure on China.

MANILA - Medical research company Manila HealthTek Inc. said Tuesday it aims to produce 8,000 coronavirus test kits per day, which will be distributed to different local government units (LGUs).
Dr. Raul Destura, founder and CEO of Manila HealthTek Inc., said in an interview on ANC that production of the locally made test kits is expected to go in full swing next week.
""It took us several days to do all the manufacturing requirements because of supply chain issues. We're hoping by next week, we are in full manufacturing swing already,"" he said.
Reagents, which are substances used to detect the presence or absence of another substance, have yet to arrive.
""It's a challenge getting them to the country because so many countries are looking for the same thing. As soon as it arrives, we will be on full manufacturing capacity and to be able to manufacture 8,000 tests per day,"" Destura said.

The kit was developed by scientists from the University of the Philippines National Institutes of Health (UP-NIH) and the Philippine Genome Center with the support of the Department of Science and Technology. It is being manufactured and distributed by Manila Healthtek Inc. 
The Philippines, which started its expanded COVID-19 testing on Monday, is currently using procured test kits from other countries.
""Hopefully we can support the additional needs so it can be a massive testing program,"" Destura said.
During the interview, he said there were plenty of factors that can affect the accuracy of tests.
""One of the major problem is the sample collection... that's why the Department of Heath combined bothnasal pharyngeal swab and oral pharyngeal swab to increase testing the likelihood the pickup of the disease,"" Destura said.
He added, ""The test is not the end-all and be all of a making a diagnosis. It should still be complemented with a clinical assessment. That's why testing like this is recommended to be done on hospital and not at home.""

The United States has the largest epidemic currently and has been a ""fantastic partner"" in addition to being the largest donor to the WHO, Harris said.
""There will always be criticisms of organizations, it's important to listen criticism especially constructive criticism,"" she said. ""And our work will go regardless of any kind of issues.""

On vaccines, Harris said: ""We really shouldn't be expecting to see the vaccine at least for 12 months or longer.""

MADRID - Spain's death toll from the novel coronavirus topped 18,000 on Tuesday, as the rise in new infections dropped to its lowest level since the country imposed a nationwide lockdown last month.
The 567 new deaths reported by the health ministry were slightly up from Monday's death toll and they take the total number of fatalities to 18,056 --- officially third in the world behind the United States and Italy.
The number of new infections rose by just over 3,045, or 1.8 percent, to 172,451, the smallest increase since the country of around 47 million people imposed a nationwide lockdown on March 14 to curb the spread of the virus.
Health authorities say Spain has overcome the peak of the coronavirus, after registering its highest death toll of 950 people on April 2. 
""The trend is good, in line with what we have seen in recent weeks,"" the health ministry's emergencies coordinator, Fernando Simon, told a press conference to discuss the latest coronavirus figures.
But while the fall in the number of new cases means hospitals in hard-hit regions like Madrid and Barcelona are no longer overflowing with people, ""beds in intensive care units remain in a situation of high stress,"" he added.
Spain tightened its lockdown on March 30 by freezing all non-essential activities like construction and manufacturing for 2 weeks -- a measure that was lifted on Monday despite warnings from some quarters that removing it too soon could trigger a fresh outbreak.
But shops, bars, restaurants and other businesses considered non-essential remained closed and people are only allowed to leave their homes to work if they can not do their jobs from home, or to buy food or medicine or walk their dog.
Transport Minister Jose Luis Abalos said Monday that about two-thirds of people were strictly following the lockdown and ""practically do not go outside at all.""
The lockdown is expected to remain in place at least until April 25.

There are only a few visuals that are as symbolic as a white wedding dress. Next to the groom, it is the bridal gown that stands out and takes center stage when any woman imagines her dream wedding. 
Choosing the perfect dress is considered one of the most important decisions a bride makes, rooted in the idea of a woman should look her absolute best on one of the most important days of her life. Thus, many brides-to-be spend their time carefully planning for a timeless stunner that is a reflection of their own unique style. 
With all the effort spent on a single dress meant to be worn once, wouldn’t it be nice to if many others will get the chance to enjoy it too?

Beauty queen and Instagram influencer Tinjoy Agcopra-Gutierrez was one of the lucky brides blessed with the opportunity to wear the dress of her dreams when she wed her now-husband Reyjhie Gutierrez last December 2019. 
She commissioned renowned designer Val Taguba to create a stunning gown for her walk down the aisle. “I had 4 fittings. During the final fitting, I literally had tears of joy. The dress was everything I ever wanted and dreamed of.”
On March 28, Tinjoy announced on her social media account that she was selling her wedding dress for a very meaningful cause: the proceeds will be donated towards purchasing the medical needs of the frontliners at Southern Philippines Medical Center.

Hours after her announcement, the Val Taguba dress was sold for half the original amount to a lucky bride-to-be. “I never expected to receive such an overwhelming response. It took hours before someone decided to buy the gown but I did not confirm the sale immediately,"" shares Tinjoy. 
""A lot of people are saying I should have put it up for bidding so I could raise more funds for PPE but, as much as I care for the price, I cared more as to whom I’d sell it to. I followed her on Instagram and added her on Facebook just to get a sense of whether she would really take good care of my dress.”
In the end, it was the buyer's story that finally convinced Tin. ""She fell in love with the dress and wanted to help. The crazy part is that she is still single and searching for the love of her life,"" shares Tinjoy. ""I hope that my dress will give her luck in finding the one. I asked her to invite me to their wedding.""

The sale of the Swarovski-studded dress translated into money enough to purchase thousands of surgical and N95 masks for the frontliners at Southern Philippines Medical Center. 
“For the first batch, I bought thousands of surgical masks from Manila, even buying them at a higher price because of the scarcity. I also procured hundreds of face shields with the help of other funds that I raised on my Instagram account. I am also procuring a number of PPE suits from my nursing clinical instructor who messaged me.”
Tinjoy humbly appeals to everyone to help and protect our frontliners. “We can’t afford any decrease of the manpower in hospitals so we have to help protect our dear health care workers. There is already a shortage, as the current situation stands,” she says. 
It is one way of expressing her gratitude for the sacrifice that the health workers do for the country. “My endless gratitude to all of you. No amount of donations or money can ever repay what you are risking for our country. Thank you so much for doing everything you can every single day to save lives. We all are very proud of you.”
“I wanted my wedding dress to be something more meaningful. Come 10-20 years, I’d get to look back and proudly share this story to our future kids and tell them that my wedding dress was the most beautiful dress I’ve got to wear in my entire life and it, in a way, helped save lives,” she happily shared.

MANILA - A male detainee in Metro Manila may have died last week from the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the Bureau of Jail Management and Penology said Thursday.
In a statement, BJMP spokesperson Jail Chief Insp. Xavier Solda said that while the detainee died from a heart ailment and hypertension, his death certificate also indicated that ""other conditions contributing to his death is possible COVID-19 infection.""
“Taking the attending physician’s point of view, citing possible COVID 19 as contributing condition is a piece of information that we cannot take lightly,"" Solda said.
""Our position is always at the side of caution; that is why we triple our efforts in establishing an isolation center outside the jail facility,"" he added.
In response to the incident, the BJMP conducted contact tracing and found out that 17 detainees need to be isolated for a more focused medical care.
Solda said the BJMP's COVID-19 isolation center, located in Quezon City, has already been completed, with the support of the International Committee of the Red Cross and the Philippine Red Cross.

,Apr 10 2020,nCov,FB group 'SuperTsuper' comes to the rescue of out-of-work drivers,"Davinci Maru, ABS-CBN News","
MANILA - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has upended livelihoods, and the transport sector is among those bearing the brunt of the crisis.
Since mass transit in Luzon has been suspended, public utility drivers are not able to make a living, putting their lives hanging precariously in the balance.
But a group of University of the Philippines (UP) alumnae and students has come to the rescue of out-of-work drivers, through the Facebook group ""SuperTsuper.""
""It's just so heartbreaking to see the hardworking people who bring us to where we need to be everyday immobilized by the lockdown, so we wanted to help even in just a small way,"" Mariel Cunanan, one of the group's administrators, told ABS-CBN News on Thursday.
Cunanan and her friends created the Facebook group on March 31, and since then nearly 35,000 joined to help.
""What prompted this whole thing is seeing a lot of drivers on social media asking for even just 1 or 2 pesos from people on GCash to help them survive this lockdown,"" she said.
Through ""SuperTsuper,"" drivers of jeepneys, tricycles and transportation network vehicle service (TNVS) could ask for donation from group members coursed through Globe's e-wallet service GCash.
Cunanan and other administrators strictly screen the PUV drivers to ensure their call for help are legitimate. They will be asked to provide their names, photos, addresses and name of their respective associations.
""Once posted, donors are free to donate to whoever they like, regardless of amount and how many people they want to give to,"" she said.
She added, ""So the money doesn't really go through us -- the whole selling point of SuperTsuper is direct donations. No more middlemen so you know 100% of your money is going to someone in need. And it's also an avenue for donors and the tsupers to interact, humanizing the donation process because the donors will see the people whose lives they're touching talaga.""
The donation varies from P20 to P2,000, Cunanan said.
One story that stuck with her was that of 63-year-old jeepney driver Eduardo Solis.
""He has 3 children and 6 dogs to feed, and it was a true testament to how sometimes those who have less have the most love to give,"" she said.
Since most seniors are not tech-savvy, Cunanan said she had to guide Solis on using social media.
""A lot of drivers are like this, very grateful to the donors and extremely kind. All of their stories are worth hearing talaga,"" she added.
In nearly 2 weeks, ""SuperTsuper"" has helped some 700 to 900 drivers all over the Philippines and will continue to do so as long as people are willing to donate.
""Give what you can because ""not much"" to us can mean everything to them,"" Cunanan said.
The Philippine government imposed an enhanced community quarantine in the entire Luzon, home to more than 50 million people, to arrest the spread of the novel coronavirus.
The same measure was imposed in many other areas in the Visayas and Mindanao.
Transport group Piston earlier said there were 500,000 jeepney drivers and 200,000 small jeepney operators affected by the lockdown.

MANILA - Two Philippine senators who have contracted the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) said Thursday they will donate their plasma to help the ongoing research for treatment of the illness.
Senators Sonny Angara and Juan Miguel ""Migz"" Zubiri said they are heeding the call of the Philippine General Hospital for COVID-19 survivors to submit blood for its experimental treatment for patients with severe symptoms of the disease using convalescent plasma therapy.

COVID-19 survivors sought for blood, plasma donations in hopes of finding virus cure

The PGH, one of the country’s referral hospitals for the disease, earlier said plasma from COVID-19 survivors, which is extracted from the blood, contains antibodies against the disease.
Similar experiments have been carried out in China and South Korea as scientists scramble to develop the vaccine against COVID-19.
""'Pag nakuha ko na 'yun [formal notice of second swab test], puwede na ako mag-donate ng dugo ko, plasma para sa mga pag-aaral na sabi nila,"" Angara said.
The senator tested positive for the coronavirus on March 26. He was released from the hospital on April 6 after recovering from the illness.
Angara is completing his mandatory 14-day quarantine and awaiting results from his second swab test.
Zubiri, meanwhile, hopes to celebrate his birthday on April 13 by doing the same act.
""Pangako ko sa Panginoon na kung mabuhay tayo sa virus na ito… mag-donate po sa PGH para magamit po nila sa plasma testing,"" he said.
Zubiri was confirmed to have caught the COVID-19 on March 16. A follow-up test indicated he is already negative, while the result of a subsequent one is still unknown as of press time.
The two lawmakers also vowed to file measures that will strengthen the country’s medical and scientific defenses against infectious diseases. The measures will include proposals that will fund research on possible vaccine against COVID-19.

MANILA - An online and mobile application system to track people manifesting symptoms of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was launched Wednesday by its developer and the Philippine government's task force against the pandemic.
The National Task Force against COVID-19 said in a statement Thursday that StaySafe.ph is a website and a mobile application that ""encourages people to report their health condition, as well as those of their family members.""
""This system, as we have seen, can serve as [a] monitoring [for] of all communities. As we have seen, it could do segregation of persons under investigations, it could also do a lot of things,"" National Security Adviser Hermogenes Esperon Jr. said during the launch.
Manila-based developer Multisys created StaySafe.ph at no cost to the government.
""Willing po kaming makipagtulungan sa government. This is no longer a business. This is helping each other,"" Multisys founder and CEO David Almirol Jr. said.
Almirol said the system was designed to help authorities monitor the health condition of people and conduct a more efficient contact tracing.
StaySafe.ph also features a dashboard where users can be updated on COVID-19 cases even globally.
Frontline workers, local government units (LGUs) and private companies will be given access to the admin dashboard to help them keep track of the number of confirmed cases, suspected COVID-19 carriers, and location of patients, among other things.
They will also receive system alerts so they could immediately respond to severe COVID-19 cases, and provide direct online consultations to patients. 
The online platform will also allow private companies to identify employees who need help and provide them with assistance.



Users won't have to disclose sensitive information when registering in the StaySafe.ph website or mobile app.
""We are not asking for the birthdate because if you capture the birthdate, you are [violating] the data privacy. But we capture the age so we are not violating the data privacy,"" Almirol said.
During the registration process, users will be asked if they are feeling any of the COVID-19 symptoms. The platform will then generate a result indicating mild, moderate or severe, depending on the number of symptoms a user is experiencing.
The data will then be sent to a ""heat map"" in the platform’s admin dashboard, which will then show the areas and the number of people exhibiting COVID-19 symptoms.
In expressing gratitude to Almirol for the online system, COVID-19 task force chief implementer Carlito Galvez encouraged others to help ""in whatever way you can"" in the country's ""fight"" against the pandemic.
As of Thursday, the Philippines recorded 4,076 COVID-19 cases, with 203 deaths and 124 recoveries.

Jonalyn Calvez-Cabugao and her family has been sharing free pechay outside their home located in Barangay Kayvaluganan, Basco for anyone who passes by. 
Her family harvests these vegetables themselves and sells them in their local market. Yet, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, they found it in their hearts to share these resources in their neighborhood for free.
Sharing what they, too, were graciously given in an abundance is what their family aims to do. 
“The main intention for free pechay is to share blessings,” she shares. “We are blessed to harvest a lot this season.”

MANILA - The Philippines is among the countries with the lowest number of COVID-19 cases, its health chief said Thursday.
""Isa tayo sa may pinakababang bilang,"" Health Secretary Francisco Duque said in a press briefing with President Duterte past midnight. 
As of Wednesday, the novel coronavirus infected 106 more people, raising the nation's tally to 3,870.
The disease, which originated in Wuhan City in Hubei province, China, has so far killed 182 people in the Philippines with 96 recoveries. 
Duque attributed the low numbers to strict containment measures such as air travel restrictions and the enhanced community quarantine in Luzon. 
""Nakatulong ito sa pagpigil ng pagkalat ng COVID-19 sa Pilipinas,"" he said.
However, the Philippines, unlike countries that have much more COVID-19 cases, has tested relatively fewer people due to its limited number of test kits and stricter conditions on who should be tested. 
As of April 5, only 19,585 individuals have been tested for COVID-19. This number includes COVID-19 positive patients who undergo multiple tests. Of the total number tested, 83% yielded negative results. 
In early March, the Philippine government denied entry to foreign nationals coming from countries with confirmed local transmissions of COVID-19.
It also imposed a month-long lockdown in Luzon, an island group of over 50 million people, to arrest the spread of the disease, which has been extended until April 30.
In Asia, the Philippines ranked 10th in the countries with COVID-19 infections, data from US-based John Hopkins University.
China, where the virus originated, has the most number of coronavirus cases with more than 80,000. It is followed by Iran, Turkey, South Korea, Israel, India, Japan, Pakistan and Malaysia.
Meanwhile, among Southeast Asian countries, the Philippines comes second after Malaysia with more than 4,000 COVID-19 cases.

MANILA - President Rodrigo Duterte on Thursday said some P300 billion in government funds that would be used to combat the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic have yet to be collected.
""'Yong pinagdadaldal ng isang congressman na u***, na may P300 billion ibinigay ng Kongreso, hangin po lahat 'yan. Wala pa 'yang pera na 'yan dito,"" he said in a pre-recorded public address aired early Thursday, in response to an unnamed lawmaker.
""Saan na ‘yung P300 billion? Wala pa po ‘yan, kokolektahin pa po ‘yan. Saan ‘yung P270 billion? Wala pa po ‘yan, kokolektahin pa po ‘yan,"" he reiterated.
He did not name the lawmaker who drew his ire.
In March, Congress granted Duterte special powers to tap some P275 billion in unused government funds to address the crisis.
Under the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act law, the government will provide cash aid from P5,000 to P8,000 to 18 million families belonging to low-income households.
In the same briefing that aired early Thursday morning, Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) Secretary Rolando Bautista said the agency has distributed some P100 billion in cash to Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program (4Ps) beneficiaries during the ongoing crisis.
Duterte earlier welcomed the suggestion to include middle-income families in his administration's social amelioration program, but added that the government does not have enough funds for now.
""I will try to remedy whatever, kung may mapulot pa tayo sa daan,"" Duterte said in a televised speech Monday.

""The economy is not moving, standstill so wala tayong kita. Ang ginagamit natin, ito na 'yung inireserba natin na pera. Ang ipinagyayabang ko na may pera tayo, P300 billion,"" he added.
Duterte said the government's priority is the ""poorest of the poor,"" but he agreed that others are also affected.
""I am reiterating that our most vulnerable citizens, most especially the poorest of the poor, must receive the government's assistance immediately, kung hindi patay 'yan sa gutom. Alam ko na we cannot just focus or zero in itong poorest of the poor,"" he said.
He also ordered Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez to look for more funds for the government's response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
""The P100 billion for one month, or the P270 billion, for two months yan, nakaprogram na, as earlier estimated, is not enough. I'm calling on the secretary of finance to generate.... Magnakaw ka, maghiram ka, wala akong pakialam, i-produce mo 'yung pera kasi 'pag naubos na ito, hindi ko malaman,"" Duterte said.
""We are exploring options to adjust our budget. Iyong budget na ‘yung --- ‘yung earlier na budget wala pa ‘yung COVID. Sinabi ko bawasan na lang ‘yung iba or totally ilaglag mo na lang ‘yang project na ‘yan, ilagay mo dito kasi ang unahin natin ang tao, ang tiyan.

LONDON - A man who stole 3 face masks from a London hospital during the coronavirus crisis has been jailed for 3 months.
Lerun Hussain, 34, pleaded guilty to the theft at a London magistrates' court on Tuesday after the theft from King's College Hospital late on Sunday.
Hussain, from south London, was arrested on suspicion of theft and also detained for being in breach of a court order.
Meanwhile, a doctors' surgery in Kidderminster, in the English midlands, has urged thieves to return its only box of face masks after it was stolen.
Police said they were aware of a reported theft and would be visiting the surgery on Wednesday.
There have been several coronavirus-related arrests in Britain during the pandemic, including a man held in north London for threatening to give police officers the virus by spitting on them.
So far, 6,159 deaths have been reported in Britain from COVID-19.

NEW DELHI - Hundreds of monkeys have taken over the streets around India's presidential palace, leading an animal offensive taking advantage of deserted streets as the country remains under a coronavirus lockdown.
With India's 1.3 billion population and tens of millions of cars conspicuous by their absence, stray domestic animals and wildlife has moved to fill the void, while also suffering from the pandemic fallout. 
In the financial capital Mumbai, peacocks have been seen perched on top of parked cars, displaying their spectacular trains.
In Delhi, troops of monkeys now scamper over the walls of the Rashtrapati Bhawan presidential compound, past military guards and into the grounds of ministries and other official buildings.
""They are stealing a lot more, but not yet threatening humans,"" said one officer on duty at the palace entrance.
The Rhesus macaque monkeys -- who often snatch food from shoppers' bags -- have long been a problem in the capital, but there have been reports of some getting into office buildings during the lockdown.
Other animals have also been emboldened by the coronavirus restrictions on humans, who are only allowed out for food and essential items.
A Himalayan black bear last week wandered into Gangtok, capital of the northeastern state of Sikkim, entering a telecoms office and injuring an engineer, media reported.
HUNGRY STRAYS
Indian Forest Service officers, meanwhile, have shared videos on social media of elephants trundling past shuttered shops along deserted streets.
But the lockdown has also been deadly for some animals.
Four horses normally employed for tourist carriage rides near Kolkata's landmark Victoria Memorial have died from starvation in recent days, animal rights activists said.
Some 115 horses, which make their living pulling carriages bedecked with flowers and balloons, were left to fend for themselves after the government ordered the shutdown, Sushmita Roy, spokeswoman for the Love and Care for Animals group told AFP.
""They are becoming sick. We fear many more will die in coming days if they do not get food,"" she said.
The owners of the carriages say they have no money for the horses after being ordered off the streets.
""We are finding it difficult to feed our family. How can we feed our horses?"" said one owner, Sunny.
India's army of stray cows and dogs have also found new freedom to take over city intersections and forage in waste bins, but even those scraps have disappeared as restaurants and shops have closed.
Aditi Badam of the Posh Foundation in Noida, outside Delhi, said shelters like his were struggling to feed its animals and other strays during the lockdown.
Her foundation has been receiving increasing numbers of calls about abandoned dogs and pets, which he said had become a ""major issue.""
""It getting tougher day by day here,"" Badam told AFP, adding that strays near the office blocks of multinational companies and outsourcing firms in the city were starving as all had closed down.

BALI - Pharmacists on the Indonesian holiday island of Bali are tackling a shortage of anti-coronavirus hand sanitizer by making their own unique, tropical version -- from thousands of liters of fermented palm wine. 
The idea was the brainchild of Bali police chief Petrus Reinhard Golose, who says he was alarmed that supplies of alcohol-based disinfectant were in short supply while prices soared for what was left on the market.
He rustled up some 4,000 liters of the popular, potent beverage -- known as arak -- by asking local manufacturers to donate from their stocks, with the force also dipping into its own funds to buy up extra supplies. 
Staff at Bali's Udayana University were then tasked with turning the wine into a handwash that could protect against the coronavirus. 
Within a week, they had managed to produce a disinfectant with a 96 percent alcohol content to meet WHO standards, according to the university.
Some clove and mint oil were added to the mixture to reduce hand irritation.
""So far we've produced 10,600 bottles of hand sanitizer using arak and Bali police have given them out to people in need,"" Dewa Ayu Swastini, head of the university's pharmaceutical faculty, told AFP on Wednesday.
Bali has reported 49 confirmed cases of the coronavirus and 2 deaths.

MUMBAI--Serena Williams' coach Patrick Mouratoglou has called on tennis governing bodies to come together and devise a way of helping lower level professionals struggling financially due to the coronavirus shutdown.
The tennis season was halted in early March due to the pandemic, leaving players in the lower tiers who solely depend on tournament winnings without the opportunity to earn a living.
In a letter posted on Twitter and addressed to the tennis community, Mouratoglou said the current situation showed how ""dysfunctional"" the sport was.
""Unlike basketball or football players, tennis players aren't covered by fixed annual salaries. They're independent contractors,"" he said.
""They're paying for their travels. They're paying fixed salaries to their coaching staffs, while their own salaries depend on the number of matches they win.""
While tennis rewards top players handsomely those in the lower echelons often struggle to make ends meet.
Mouratoglou, who started working with Williams in 2012 and has guided her to 10 of her 23 Grand Slam singles titles, said the top players deserved everything they earned.
""However, I find it revolting that the 100th-best player of one of the most popular sports in the world – followed by an estimated one billion fans – is barely able to make a living out of it,"" the Frenchman said.
The men's ATP Tour and the WTA, which runs the women's circuit, suspended all tournaments until mid-July after countries started locking down their borders to contain the spread of the flu-like virus.
A 2018 International Review Panel report commissioned to address betting and integrity issues said that players in the lowest tiers were susceptible to corruption because of the difficulty in making a living.
Only 250-350 players, the report said, earned enough to break even.
Georgia's Sofia Shapatava, the world's 375th ranked women's singles player, has started a petition seeking assistance from the International Tennis Federation for lower-level professionals.
Many others have joined her to voice their concerns about the financial hardships players face during the shutdown.
The WTA and the ATP said they were working to boost players' earnings when the sport resumed and might extend the 2020 season to allow more tournaments to be held.
Mouratoglou said it was crucial to keep lower-level players in the game.
""We all rely on those governing bodies, who have the power to protect the professional tennis economy and hold social responsibility,"" he added.
""We can't leave lower-ranked players behind anymore. This isn't right. Tennis needs change. Let's use this free time to start a discussion."" (Reporting by Sudipto Ganguly; editing by Peter Rutherford)

ZISIQIAO, China - Since China began frantic efforts to curb a coronavirus epidemic in late January, residents in the tiny snake breeding village of Zisiqiao have had to come to terms with a ban on wildlife trading, its lifeline for decades.
Zisiqiao employed hundreds of people to breed 3 million snakes a year. Now, the rows of wooden slats that housed the captive reptiles stand empty, and abandoned.
The Chinese character for ""snake"" has even been removed from the sign on the front wall of a specialty snake meat restaurant on the village's edge.
""In the village now, there's definitely no one breeding snakes,"" said Yang Heyong, a 71-year-old former breeder. ""It must be because of the epidemic. Zhong Nanshan (China's top medical adviser) has already said it is related to bats and snakes!""
Zisiqiao has been an unlikely center of China's snake industry for nearly 4 decades. It is dotted with small factory farms and its ""snake culture"" museum is a tourist attraction.
Snakes also form part of the village's informal economy, with families keeping them in backyard holds to sell to restaurants or traditional medicine traders.
The global coronavirus pandemic is believed to have originated in exotic animals on sale in the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.
The broad consensus suggests SARS-CoV-2 originated in bats, and early research suggested it reached humans via snakes, but many say pangolin - also on sale in the Wuhan market - are a more likely culprit.
China issued a temporary ban on the trade and consumption of wildlife on Jan. 23 and vowed to amend animal protection and epidemic prevention legislation to make that ban permanent. Thirteen provinces have implemented their own local regulations to ban wildlife consumption.
In Zisiqiao, built along the edge of a canal about 200 kilometers (120 miles) from Shanghai, snake breeding permits were canceled in January. Winter is the off-season and breeding normally begins in April or May, so the economic impact hasn't yet hit home.
While some residents said they expected restrictions to be relaxed once the crisis ends, government officials insisted they were permanent, and even if new licenses are issued later this year, the criteria will be far stricter.
""At the end of the epidemic, it still won't be permitted,"" said Lu Jinliang, vice-chief of the local village Communist Party. ""They will have to switch professions, raise other species.""
A HUMAN PROBLEM?
Even before the coronavirus outbreak, the snake trade was under scrutiny.
A study by Wuhan University published last December looked at snakes collected from the city's seafood markets, including the one blamed for the coronavirus pandemic.
China trades 7,000 to 9,000 tons of snake a year, and intensive farming may have enhanced the transmission of parasites and other infectious diseases, the study said.
However, Yu Xuejie, professor of the School of Health Sciences at Wuhan University and one of the study's authors, told Reuters that he did not believe snakes were the origin of the coronavirus.
Another paper published last month said that while the virus originated in bats, genetic evidence suggests snakes may have been the intermediary species. However, its findings have been disputed, said Patrick Aust, research associate with the Department of Zoology at the University of Oxford.
""The source is most likely mammalian, probably bats but other suspects too, including pangolins,"" he told Reuters, adding that there was no reason for snakes to be singled out as a health risk.
Animal welfare organizations have welcomed China's wildlife ban, including the snake farming restrictions, and are urging the government to make it permanent. But no species should be singled out for blame, they said.
""This is a disease issue: it is not just one animal's problem or responsibility,"" said Aili Kang, executive director of the Asia Program of the Wildlife Conservation Society, a non-government organization
""This is not one species' problem: it is a human problem.""

SINGAPORE - Singapore on Wednesday announced new measures to accelerate local food production as the coronavirus pandemic disrupts global supply chains, including a plan to turn car park rooftops in public housing estates into urban farms.
The densely populated city-state produces only about 10 percent of its food needs but has plans to increase that as climate change and population growth threaten global food supplies.
Around the world, restrictions on population movement because of the coronavirus outbreak are wreaking havoc on farming and food supply chains and raising concern of widespread shortages and price increases.
""The current COVID-19 situation underscores the importance of local food production, as part of Singapore's strategies to ensure food security,"" authorities said in a statement. ""Local food production mitigates our reliance on imports, and provides buffer in the event of food supply disruptions.""
Authorities have repeatedly assured locals that the city-state has sufficient food supplies, amid bouts of panic buying that have gripped the island during the outbreak.
Farmers and the government have been looking at ways to overcome the shortage of land in Singapore, where only 1 percent of its 724 sq km (280 sq miles) is devoted to agriculture and production costs are higher than the rest of Southeast Asia.
In response to the outbreak, authorities aim to speed up local production over the next 6 months to 2 years.
This includes providing a S$30 million ($21 million) grant to support production of eggs, leafy vegetables and fish in the shortest time possible, and identifying alternative farming spaces, such as industrial areas and vacant sites.
As part of that project, the Singapore food agency will launch a tender for rooftop farms on public housing car parks for urban farming starting next month, authorities said.

MANILA - With the spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) far from abating, the illness has yet to reach its peak in the Philippines.
As the end to the pandemic is not yet in sight, a mathematics professor at the University of the Philippines Los Baños suggested multiple strategies to combat the fast-spreading disease.
In an interview on ANC, Dr. Jomar Rabajante called on the government and public to prepare for a ""long-term war.""
""This is unlike a typhoon where you have a typhoon now and there's sunshine tomorrow,"" he said.
To rein in the spread of COVID-19, Rabajante said the government must ramp up efforts to detect and isolate possible coronavirus carriers, in addition to strict containment measures.
Physical distancing, frequent handwashing, and wearing of mask in public must also be observed, he added.

Tracking COVID-19 cases in the Philippines

Since emerging in Wuhan City in Hubei province, China last year, the virus has sickened 3,764 people in the Philippines, including 177 deaths and 84 recoveries.
Worldwide, COVID-19 has infected nearly 1.3 million people and killed more than 72,000 others, latest data from the World Health Organization (WHO) showed.
The Philippine government also extended the lockdown in Luzon to April 30 to establish the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Philippines extends lockdown of millions in Luzon to April 30

""The enhanced community quarantine buys us time, but it doesn't mean that after April 30 we need to go back to our usual norm. We need to change strategies,"" Rabajante said.
Based on his forecast, he said the epidemic time in the Philippines could not also be asynchronous or would not happen at the same time.
""There could be different peaks in the different provinces,"" Rabajante said, adding that mobility of people should be monitored.
He also urged the government to check lower-income communities in Metro Manila, where many families live in cramped shanties and lack the means to protect themselves.
""We need to check more on them. They wouldn't know they are sick or they probably won't go to the hospital that's why they are not reported,"" Rabajante said.
Metro Manila, which has become the epicenter of the outbreak in the Philippines, is home to nearly 13 million people.
In March, Rabajante created an SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infected and Recovered) model of COVID-19 for Metro Manila and predicted there could be 2,500 cases in mid-April.
""Now we're seeing that the detected cases are increasing we need to adjust our model,"" he said.
A study by the UP COVID-19 pandemic response team revealed that the peak of the curve is estimated to be between April to June.
Around 140,000 to 550,000 people are projected to be infected in Metro Manila, the report also showed. This includes undetected, mild and asymptomatic cases comprising 80 percent of the total tally.
The team also called for more open, transparent data and sharing of information.
""COVID-19 is not an invisible enemy. It leaves behind traces of itself, which we can use to get ahead of the curve and stop it in its tracks. But to get there, we have to gather and share as much data as possible, apply the best science available, and ultimately listen to what the numbers could tell us,"" it said.

MADRID - The pace of coronavirus deaths in Spain ticked up for the first time in 5 days on Tuesday, with 743 people succumbing overnight, but there was still hope the national lockdown might be eased soon.
Tuesday's toll from the health ministry compared to 637 people who died during the previous 24 hours, taking the total to 13,798, the second highest in the world after Italy.
Still, the proportional daily increase of 5.7 percent was about half that reported a week ago.
""It is normal to have some oscillations... What matters is to see the trend and the cumulative data,"" said Maria Jose Sierra, deputy chief of health emergencies, adding that latest data included some delayed notifications from the weekend.
Total cases rose to 140,510 - the highest in Europe and second in the world after the United States.
As officials worked on a plan to lift some of the tough restrictions in place that have shut down non-core firms, the Spanish unit of Germany's Volkswagen said it may partially reopen its plant in northern Navarra region in 2 weeks.
""We will try to do everything possible to resume on April 20,"" said a spokesman for the plant, adding that all workers would wear masks and gloves and disinfection would be used.
The plant was shut down in mid-March after the coronavirus pandemic interrupted the supply chain.
 WIDER TESTING
For restrictions to be lifted, officials say testing has to be widened to find carriers who may have mild or no symptoms.
The government is planning mass, quick antibody tests in coming days. Cadena Ser radio said about 62,000 people would be tested twice with an interval of 21 days to see the effect of any easing of measures on contagion.
Care homes for the elderly have been among the worst-hit by the pandemic, accounting for a third of all deaths, according to some estimates. But not all were the source of bad news.
In the northern Basque city of Guernica, relatives, neighbors and the local fire brigade applauded care staff at the Juan Calzado nursing home, dancing to the sound of loud pop music played via loudspeakers. 
The staff decided to move in with its virus-free residents for 15 days so as not to expose them to contagion from the outside, Reuters footage showed.

""The mothers tested negative, but the babies tested positive so we have to consider their contacts with medical staff,"" Health Minister Nelu Tataru said in an interview with the Antena 3 TV station late Monday.
The babies have no symptoms and all but one of them, together with their mothers, have gone into self-isolation at home.
Tataru pointed to the ""failures in the activities of both maternity officials and the local public health directorate (DSP)"" and promised severe measures if necessary.
The local DSP chief has already been dismissed. 
""For the past 2 days I have felt like I am living in a horror film,"" one of the mothers told the local pressalert.ro website. 
""The staff were not wearing masks,"" she said, adding that the mothers had heard on Wednesday through unofficial channels that there was a case of coronavirus in the hospital.
""On Thursday the hospital was disinfected with us inside,"" she said.
The unit in the western Romanian city of Timisoara was briefly placed under quarantine on March 31 but was reopened the next day on the orders of the local DSP, which insisted at the time that there was ""no risk of infection for patients or doctors"" even though 13 members of staff had already tested positive.
The latest case adds to worries about how Romania's system is coping with the epidemic. 
Medical staff have spoken out in recent weeks over insufficient equipment for those on the frontline.
There are more than 4,400 confirmed cases in Romania so far and 180 people have died.

Since emerging in China in December, the coronavirus has killed almost 75,000 people as drugmakers worldwide race to develop a vaccine and treatments for the disease.
Plasma therapy could become ""an alternative treatment for patients in critical condition who do not respond to antiviral drugs,"" said Choi Jun-yong, a doctor and researcher at Severance Hospital in Seoul, where both patients were treated.
But large-scale clinical trials were needed to prove its effectiveness, he added.
One of the 2 patients was a 71-year-old man with no underlying conditions who only improved when treated with plasma from a recovered patient in his 20s, along with steroids.
He was initially given malaria drugs and a respirator for severe pneumonia.
The other patient, a 67-year-old female, also did not respond to initial treatments including malaria, HIV drugs, and oxygen therapy. She began to recover after receiving plasma therapy and steroids at the same time, researchers said.
Their findings were published in the peer-reviewed Journal of Korean Medicine.
Kwon Jun-wook, an official at Seoul's Central Disease Control Headquarters, said plasma therapy was ""important"" when there was ""currently no vaccine or treatment available"" for the virus. 
He called on experts to examine the 2 cases urgently.
Research on plasma and other therapies ""will proceed quickly,"" Kwon added.
Small studies on plasma have demonstrated its effectiveness in treating infectious diseases, including Ebola and SARS.
Trials started in France on Tuesday involving 60 patients in Paris hospitals, half of whom will receive plasma from recovered patients.
The US Food and Drug Administration authorized physicians to experiment with the strategy to fight the coronavirus, and tests are also being carried out in China.
South Korea endured one of the worst early outbreaks of the virus, but appears to have brought it under control thanks to its extensive ""trace, test and treat"" program.

PARIS - The coronavirus pandemic has killed more than 75,000 people worldwide, the majority of them in Europe, since it emerged in China in December, according to a tally compiled by AFP from official sources at 5:45 p.m. on Tuesday (Manila time).
A total of 75,538 deaths have been recorded, including 53,928 in Europe, the continent worst hit by the virus.
The official tallies probably reflect only a fraction of the actual number of cases. Many countries are testing only the most serious cases.
Italy, which recorded its first coronavirus death at the end of February, has 16,523 fatalities, followed by Spain with 13,798, the United States with 10,993 and France with 8,911.
Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, 1,350,759 cases have been registered around the world, including 708,898 in Europe, 384,947 in the United States and Canada, and 122,348 in Asia.

MANILA - The Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) said Tuesday it proposed to the national government the grant of financial assistance to some 150,000 overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) affected by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
In an interview on ANC, Labor Secretary Silvestre Bello III said beneficiaries, both here and abroad, would receive $200 or P10,000.
""As soon as we get the budgetary allotment, we can immediately remit cash assistance to our OFWs,"" he said.
""We have confidence that the President will approve that,"" he added.
More than a thousand Filipino seafarers from ships docked in the United States and Europe have been repatriated after being stranded in their respective workplaces due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
More than 500 OFWs have contracted the disease, latest data from the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) showed.

DOLE gets P5-billion budget boost for workers' cash aid

During the interview, Bello said DOLE was seeking a P5 billion supplemental budget to cushion the effects of the crisis on the workforce.
The national government's task force on COVID-19 on Tuesday approved DOLE's request, which will be used for the social amelioration program for formal sector workers such as OFWs and local workers with reduced or no income.
The specific DOLE programs that will benefit from the supplemental funding are the COVID-19 Adjustment Measures Program (CAMP), Tulong Panghanapbuhay sa ating Displaced/Disadvantaged Workers (TUPAD) Sanitation Project, and the ​Abot Kamay ang Pagtulong​ (AKAP) ​sa OFWs.

Catholics pray at the Antipolo Cathedral in Antipolo, Rizal on Holy Monday, April 6, 2020, amid the start of the lockdown of Rizal Province to curb the spread of COVID-19. The province tightened its checkpoint procedures and shut down its borders to travelers except for health workers, food industry workers, and other authorized personnel. Mark Demayo, ABS-CBN News


MANILA - The Catholic Bishops’ Conference of the Philippines (CBCP) on Tuesday urged the faithful to pray hard during the observance of the Holy Week as the country deals with the coronavirus crisis.
""My first advice to them is to pray hard as a family. They should be together. They should pray together and invoke the name of the Lord, so that the Lord may constantly be with them in this time of crisis,"" said CBCP spokesperson Fr. Jerome Secillano, as millions are told to stay home to rein in the spread of the highly contagious disease.
In an interview on ANC, Secillano said Filipino Catholics should focus during liturgical celebrations, which will be conducted through television, radio or online.
""If the Mass is ongoing, they should refrain from doing other things... Be focused on the celebration and pray,"" he said.
In the absence of face-to-face confession as churchgoers are prevented from congregating, the faithful should be sincere in being sorry for the sins they have committed, Secillano added.
""I think, right now, the only thing that should matter is our relationship with God,"" he said.
The CBCP released guidelines for bishops and priests in the country on how to celebrate the liturgies of Holy Week, which falls from April 5 (Palm Sunday) to April 12 (Easter Sunday).
For the Mass of the Lord’s Supper on Holy Thursday, the CBCP said each priest may celebrate the mass alone, which “is due to the intrinsic connection between the priesthood and the Eucharist, the anniversaries of which are highlighted in the liturgical celebration of this evening.”
Good Friday liturgy usually includes the Veneration of the Cross. Adhering to the earlier decree from the Vatican, the CBCP reminded priests and the faithful that “the Presider alone will do the kissing in the Veneration of the Cross.”
For the Easter vigil, the CBCP said it is to be celebrated only in a cathedral and parish churches and should be held not earlier than 5 p.m.
Filipino Catholics can also observe Holy Week activities through an online Visita Iglesia, which can be accessed at www.cbcpnews.net/visitaiglesia.
As of Tuesday, the Philippines reported 3,764 coronavirus infections, including 177 deaths and 84 recoveries.

TOKYO (UPDATE) - Japan on Tuesday declared a state of emergency over a spike in coronavirus cases, ramping up efforts to contain infections but stopping short of the strict lockdowns seen in other parts of the world.
The government has come under mounting pressure to tackle an outbreak that remains small by global standards but has raised concerns among Japanese medical experts, with warnings that local healthcare systems are already overstretched.
""As I decided that a situation feared to gravely affect people's lives and the economy has occurred... I am declaring a state of emergency,"" Abe said.
The move allows governors in 7 affected regions including Tokyo to ask people to stay indoors and request businesses close.
But many supermarkets and other shops will stay open, transport will continue to run and there are neither enforcement mechanisms nor penalties laid out for those who fail to comply with government requests.
""Although a state of emergency is declared, it won't mean a city lockdown as seen overseas,"" Abe said.
""We will prevent the spread of infection while maintaining economic and social services such as public transport as much as possible.""
Pressure to declare an emergency had increased after Tokyo reported several days of record infections, with 143 new cases logged on Sunday.
Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike has already asked residents of the capital to avoid unnecessary outings and work from home, but had pushed for an emergency declaration to give her requests legal strength.
Seven regions are covered by the month-long declaration: Tokyo, neighboring Chiba, Kanagawa and Saitama, the western hub of Osaka and neighboring Hyogo, and the southwestern region of Fukuoka.
The measure will last through to the end of the Golden Week holiday period, when much of the country travels in a rare break.
'LIVES AT STAKE'
""It may cause inconvenience in daily life, but I call for everyone's cooperation because lives are at stake,"" Koike told reporters earlier.
The measure also allows governors to commandeer property for medical purposes and close public facilities like schools, many of which have already shut down.
The economic impacts of the measure and the broader global pandemic have raised concern of a recession in Japan, and Abe on Monday unveiled plans for a stimulus package worth around $1 trillion, or 20 percent of gross domestic product.
Japan has so far been spared the sort of virus outbreak seen in parts of Europe and the United States, with close to 4,000 confirmed infections and 80 deaths.
But medical experts have repeatedly sounded the alarm in recent weeks, citing the rapid increase of infections in parts of the country. 
And on Monday, doctors in Tokyo said the situation in the capital was already in ""critical condition."" 
PUBLIC BACKING
In a bid to ease the pressure, rules requiring people infected with the virus to stay in hospital even if their symptoms are mild have been relaxed, with Koike saying hotels would be designated as quarantine facilities for those in non-serious condition.
The government has also pledged to step up testing capacity and the number of beds and ventilators available to treat those in serious condition.
The state of emergency is a relatively relaxed approach to lockdown compared to other parts of the world, a function of Japan's legal system, which restricts the government's ability to limit the movement of citizens.
""Japan is still haunted by the negative legacy of the war and the oppression of its citizens,"" said Yoshinobu Yamamoto, an emeritus professor of international politics at the University of Tokyo.
But he warned that there could be calls for stronger measures if the outbreak continues to spread.
Japan saw its first case of the virus in mid-January, and came under heavy criticism for its handling of the coronavirus-wracked Diamond Princess, where an on-board quarantine ended with over 700 people contracting the virus and 11 deaths.
In the capital, people expressed support for the state of emergency, with some saying they felt it should have been declared sooner.
""When you see on TV what's going on in New York with the cases doubling within 3, 4 days, it really sends chills down my spine,"" 76-year-old Mitsuo Oshiyama told AFP.
""I don't understand why the government waited so long.""
