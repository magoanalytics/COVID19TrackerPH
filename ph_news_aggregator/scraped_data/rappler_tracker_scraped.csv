MANILA, Philippines – Philippine Airlines (PAL) terminated some 300 employees, as the company incurs losses primarily due to the travel bans caused by the novel coronavirus.
""The streamlining will strengthen the company in the wake of losses sustained in 2019, aggravated by the ongoing travel restrictions and flight suspensions to areas affected by COVID-19,"" PAL said on Friday, February 28, referring to the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.
The airline said that it implemented a ""voluntary separation initiative"" for long-serving employees and a retrenchment process on Friday.
PAL said that affected employees will receive ""appropriate separation benefits,"" as well as trip pass privileges.
Affected employees will also get career counseling and outplacement support.
""PAL continues to be focused on managing the risks related to the COVID-19 situation, in the interest of public health and safety,"" it said.
Parent firm PAL Holdings earlier told the Philippine Stock Exchange that it registered a total comprehensive loss of over P3 billion in the 1st semester of 2019, a sharp 355% increase from the total loss of P661.6 million during the same period in 2018.
PAL reported consolidated expenses amounting to P77.75 billion in the six-month period of 2019, 3.3% higher than the previous year's total of P75.27 billion.
The novel coronavirus that originated from Wuhan, China, has so far killed over 2,800 and sickened over 83,700 people across the country and worldwide. The World Health Organization already declared an international emergency over the virus.
As of Friday, the Philippines has recorded 3 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus, all of them Chinese. One died, while the other two recovered.
The DOH has also probed 621 patients in the Philippines for possible infection. Of this number, only 30 remain admitted to heath facilities nationwide, while 588 have been discharged. – Rappler.com

The World Health Organization earlier declared the outbreak an international emergency, warning that the novel coronavirus poses a ""very grave threat.""

Photo by Anthony Wallace / AFP 
MANILA, Philippines – The Philippine government is eyeing the repatriation of Filipinos in Macau, Health Assistant Secretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said on Friday, February 28.
Vergeire said in a news briefing that the Inter-agency Task Force (IATF) met to discuss the plan and were reaching out to the Macau government for the repatriation process.
The IATF is also discussing logistical matters, such as what kind of carrier the repatriates would be brought in, if they would travel by air or sea.
Vergeire said that the final decision may be reached after the IATF meeting this weekend.
Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles, an ex-officio member of the IATF, said in a news brieing earlier this week that at least 200 Filipinos in Macau have signified their desire to be repatriated.
Unlike the repatriates from Wuhan, China; and the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan, the DOH said that repatriates from Macau and other countries would not be brought to the New Clark City (NCC) in Capas, Tarlac, for quarantine.
Vergeire said that the Diamond Princess repatriates had a ""special situation,"" because the transmission dynamics are unique on the ship. Since it is a contained place, it is difficult to determine the circumstances of the people on board, so the Philippine government quarantined them in New Clark City where they could be closely monitored.
Since the possible repatriates from Macau were not subject to the same situation, the DOH would only consider them as persons-under-monitoring, subject to home-based quarantine. Vergeire noted that they would be strictly monitored.
The first batch of 49 Filipino repatriates from Hubei province were quarantined in NCC and discharged on February 21.
Four days later, 445 repatriates from the Diamond Princess were brought to NCC. The DOH reported that a total of 5 exhibited symptoms, although two had already tested negative for COVID-19. Three were still awaiting results. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – The Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) is investigating a foreign cargo vessel for allegedly violating the Philippines’ 14-day quarantine rule amid the novel coronavirus outbreak.
PCG Spokesperson Commodore Armand Balilio said that PCG Commandant Admiral Joel Garcia ordered the investigation of the Panama-flagged MV Harmony 6, which arrived at Poro Point in La Union on February 23.
Captain Luu Van Loi, MV Harmony 6 skipper, declared to Philippine authorities on February 23 that the ship left China on February 10, apparently to skirt the 14-day quarantine strictly implemented on ships coming from China and other areas with the coronavirus outbreak. 
The PCG said that based on the initial report, the MV Harmony 6 arrived in Changzhou, China, on February 13 and left that country on February 18. 
“Scheduled to have its next port call at the Port of Poro Point in La Union, Philippines, the crew of the vessel allegedly turned off its Automatic Identification System (AIS) from 19 February 2020 until its arrival in Philippine waters on 23 February 2020,” the PCG said.
The MV Harmony 6 was placed under temporary detention at the anchorage area pending PCG investigation.
“PCG will coordinate with BOQ to identify possible criminal charges if MV Harmony 6 will be found guilty of mentioned violations,” the PCG said.
Under the rule, foreign vessels that came from any country with reported COVID-19 cases should observe a 14-day period from its date of departure to its arrival in Philippines waters, before the Bureau of Quarantine (BOQ) conducts a health inspection on its crew. This is a requirement for the issuance of port clearance.
“However, due to the Captain’s misrepresentation of its date of departure from China, the BOQ team boarded the vessel to conduct the health inspection among its 18 Vietnamese and 5 Indian crew in just 6 days, instead of the required 14-day quarantine period,” the PCG said.
Fortunately, the PCG Command Center, with the help of the National Coast Watch Center (NCWC), managed to alert La Union port authorities about the altered date of departure on February 24, a few hours after the health inspection.
The Philippines has imposed a partial travel ban on China and its administrative regions Hong Kong and Macau to help prevent the spread of COVID-19. 
As of  Friday, the COVID-19 death toll in mainland China stands at 2,788, while there are 78,824 people infected with the virus there. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – The Department of Health (DOH) confirmed on Friday, February 28, that two more repatriates from the coronavirus-hit Diamond Princess cruise ship docked in Japan showed flu-like symptoms.
This brings the number of symptomatic repatriates to 5. Three, not feverish, were reported to exhibit symptoms on Thursday, February 27. However, the DOH announced that 2 of them had already tested negative for the coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The remaining 3 are awaiting results. 
The two new persons under investigation were brought to a referral health facility due to sore throat. Their specimens were collected and sent for testing at the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine.
“While we are still waiting for the other test results, we assure the public that our referral hospitals are well-equipped and prepared to handle COVID-19 cases once they arise. Our health response team at the quarantine facility is being extra cautious to prevent further health risks,” said Health Secretary Francisco Duque III.
Of the 538 Filipinos who were previously quarantined on the cruise ship docked in Yokohama, a total of 445 were repatriated late Tuesday night, February 25. They went through several layers of screening before, during, and after the flight to ensure they were asymptomatic and coronavirus-free.
All the Filipino repatriates from Diamond Princess are subject to another 14 days of quarantine from their arrival in New Clark City.
Eighty Filipino crew members have so far tested positive for COVID-19. These confirmed cases were left behind in hospitals in Japan. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – The World Health Organization (WHO) has cited 9 countries, including the Philippines, that show that the spread of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)  ""can be contained"" after these nations recorded no new positive cases in the past two weeks. 
“The key message that should give all countries hope, courage and confidence is that this virus can be contained. Indeed, there are many countries that have done exactly that,” WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a press briefing on Wednesday, February 26.
“Fourteen countries that have had cases have not reported a case for more than a week, and even more importantly, 9 countries have not reported a case for more than two weeks: Belgium, Cambodia, Finland, India, Nepal, Philippines, the Russian Federation, Sri Lanka, and Sweden,” he added. 
Still, the WHO Director-General clarified that this did not mean that new COVID-19 cases “may not came to these countries, but the cases that made it before have been contained.” 
COVID-19 is the name of the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.
The Philippines has so far recorded 3 confirmed COVID-19 cases, all Chinese travelers  from Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, who came to the Philippines in late January.  
Since then, the country has not reported any new confirmed cases, and no local transmission of the virus as of Friday, February 28.
The Department of Helath (DOH) is probing a total of 621 patients for possible infection, but only 30 remain admitted in hospitals nationwide. The other 588 patients under investigation have already been discharged. 
DOH Secretary Francisco Duque III told Rappler on Friday, February 28, that even with the WHO update served as ""inspiration"" for the Philippine government to remain vigilant in handling the COVID-19 threat.
“This should not be a reason for us to be complacent nor should we put our guards down. We should use this as inspiration to do better [in terms of containing COVID-19],” Duque said in a phone interview. 
A total of 442 Filipinos repatriated from the Diamond Princess  cruise ship earlier this week were on a 14-day quarantine at the New Clark City in Capas, Tarlac.
Another 3 repatriates started showing flu-like symptoms on Thursday, February 27, and were transferred to a hospital outside the quarantine center for further observation. – Rappler.com  "

MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – The Philippines is looking at banning travel to Japan, Italy, and Iran in light of the increasing cases of the novel coronavirus in the 3 countries, Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles said on Friday, February 28. 
In an interview with CNN Philippines, Nograles said that the country's task force is constantly assessing the situations in the 3 countries. ""Ayaw ko pangunahan (I don't want to preempt anything), but obviously the task force is looking at these countries as well,"" said Nograles.
He mentioned the importance of checking the situation in Iran, due to the large volume of Filipinos situated there.
""Hindi natin puwedeng balewalain ang Iran because we still have Filipinos in Iran – more than a thousand na mga kababayan natin ang naninirahan po diyan sa Iran. So tinitingnan din po namin iyan,"" he said. (We cannot brush off Iran because we still have Filipinos in Iran – more than a thousand of our countrymen live there. So we're taking a look at it too.)
The New York Times reported that the number of infections in Iran and Italy doubled in just two days, approaching 900 combined. Seventeen people in Italy died as of Friday, while 26 in Iran died as of Thursday.
Japan lists 214 cases with 4 deaths nationwide. In Yokohama, 538 Filipinos were previously quarantined aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship. Some 445 have been repatriated, while others who were symptomatic or contracted the COVID-19 disease stayed behind.
On Thursday, February 27, the Philippine government banned travel of Filipino tourists to South Korea, and also restricted travelers coming from its North Gyeongsang province. 
Travel ban criteria
In a February 28 press conference, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III enumerated the criteria for the inclusion of countries in travel bans. He said there are 4 factors to consider:

Presence of local transmission in the country proposed to be covered by the ban
Volume of travelers coming into the country
Context and threat based on international health regulations
Health expenditure per capita 

Duque also said they look into a particular country's entry restrictions on people traveling from China. If that country has no full restrictions from travelers from China, then that puts the country at a higher risk. 
The Inter-agency Task Force consider these in deciding if a travel ban would be partial or total. – Rappler.com "

File photo by Valerie Escalera/Presidential Photo 
MANILA, Philippines – House Minority Leader Bienvenido Abante Jr – who was supposed to have an official trip to Saudi Arabia – was barred from entering due to a temporary travel ban imposed on Filipino travelers due to the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) scare. 
But it seems the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) was not aware of the travel restrictions on the Philippines, as Assistant Secretary Eduardo Meñez said they are still getting the “exact details” on the ban as of Friday morning, February 28. 
“We are confirming the exact details of KSA acting’s on COVID restrictions. Thank you for this information about Cong Abante,” Meñez said in a text message to Rappler. 
Saudi Arabia has already banned pilgrims from visiting Islam's holiest sites there in attempt to contain the spread of COVID-19, the disease caused by 2019-nCoV.
According to Abante, he was scheduled speak to several overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) organizations in Jeddah, Saudia Arabia regarding the proposed Department of OFWs. 
He boarded an Emirates flight from the Philippines bound for Saudi Arabia on Wednesday, February 26, with a layover in Dubai. From there, he was supposed to take a connecting flight to Jeddah on Thursday, February 27.
While in Dubai, however, Abante’s airline informed him that he will no longer be allowed to enter Saudi Arabia because its government already barred Filipino tourists from entering due to the 2019-nCoV.  
But Abante thought he would still be able to travel since he had a diplomatic passport with him and was on an official House trip. 
“On Thursday, February 27, I was in Dubai and en route to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia on an official trip when I was informed by our airline that I would not be allowed to board my connecting flight to Jeddah due to sguidelines issued by the Saudi government prohibiting the entry of Filipino nationals possessing tourist visas,” Abante said in a statement.  
“While I am aware that these travel restrictions are in place to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 virus, to my knowledge government functionaries on official trips are not covered by this ban – including myself, as I am a government official traveling with a diplomatic passport and a travel authority issued by the House of Representatives,” he added. 
In the end, Abante was forced to just stay in Dubai for now and is expected to fly back to Manila over the weekend. 
Still, the Manila 6th District congressman understands the precautionary measures that had to be taken by Saudi Arabia to help prevent the spread of COVID-19. 
“Be that as it may, given the threats posed by the COVID-19 outbreak, I understand and respect the precautions being undertaken by governments worldwide to protect their populations from this disease, and trust that our Department of Foreign Affairs will work to clarify matters regarding this unfortunate misunderstanding,” Abante said.  
As of Friday, the Philippines has recorded no local transmission of 2019-nCoV. The 3 confirmed cases recorded in the country were all Chinese nationals, one of whom died while the other two recovered from their symptoms. 
To date, the Department of Health is probing a total of 621 patients for possible infection, but only 30 remain admitted in hospitals nationwide.

The disembarkation of about 240 crew members, including many foreign nationals, is expected to last several days, according to the Japan health ministry.
They will stay at the National Tax College in Wako, Saitama Prefecture, near Tokyo for further monitoring by doctors, and can leave the facility only after testing negative for the virus, the ministry said.

Since the outbreak, which has resulted in 3 confirmed cases and one death in the Philippines, churches have also discouraged worshippers from holding hands during mass.

She was among thousands of people, some wearing surgical masks, who lined up at Baclaran church in Manila for services on Wednesday.
Ash Wednesday marks the beginning of Lent, the run-up to Easter, and includes Catholics having crosses drawn in ash on their foreheads.
The Philippines is overwhelmingly Catholic, with some 80% of its people said to be believers. Its unique brand of the religion also includes gruesome annual re-enactments of the crucifixion of Jesus Christ.
Local church officials have also ""strongly recommended"" that Catholics do not kiss or touch the cross during Good Friday services, which is usually common practice.

MANILA, Philippines – Philippine health officials have stopped tracking down other people who came into contact with the 3 Chinese visitors who tested positive for the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) while in the country in late January.  In a press conference on Wednesday, February 26, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said there would be no more contact tracing efforts in relation to the 3 cases because the 14-day incubation period for 2019-nCoV had long passed, and there were no other confirmed cases being reported so far.
Duque made the statement in response when asked whether the rest of the people who came into contact with the 3 confirmed cases were still the subject of contact tracing. During the briefing, it was learned that the Department of Health managed to trace 67% of these people so far.
Asked if the DOH was still looking for the other people that the 3 Chinese travelers had come into contact with while in the country, Duque said: “Wala na, kasi lampas na lampas ang incubation period natin.... There is no indication of the group or groups that might have been exposed to the 3 Chinese nationals, mukhang walang indication na nagkasakit sila. Kasi kung nagkasakit sila ay dapat nakita na ‘yan sa mga ospital natin,” said Duque.  
(There will be no contact tracing for now because it’s way, way past the incubation period.... There is no indication that the groups that might have been exposed to the 3 Chinese nationals got sick. Because if they did, then our hospitals would have found out already.) 
The DOH chief said the government would instead focus its efforts on strengthening the capacities of health facilities nationwide to prevent the spread of COVID-19 – the disease caused by the novel coronavirus – should another patient test positive for it.
“So doon na lang...level ng gamutan, doon na lang dapat ibuhos ang dapat ang lahat ng dapat isagawa ng DOH (So on the level of treatment, that’s where the DOH should focus its efforts),” Duque said.  
The Philippines has so far recorded 3 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus, all of them Chinese who arrived in the Philippines in January. One died, while the other two recovered. 
The Philippine government came under fire during a Senate hearing on February 4, after it was revealed that there was an apparent lack of communication between the DOH, the Civil Aeronautics Board, and the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines on contact tracing for possible COVID-19 cases.
As of 5 pm on Wednesday, there were 614 patients under investigation (PUIs) in the Philippines for possible 2019-nCoV infection. Of this number, 101 remained in health facilities across the country, while the other 510 were already discharged.

There are at least 84 Filipinos confirmed to have the virus, but all are based outside the Philippines, including two in the United Arab Emirates, one in Hong Kong, one in Singapore, and 80 who were aboard a cruise ship quarantined in Japan.
The World Health Organization earlier declared the outbreak an international emergency, warning that the novel coronavirus poses a ""very grave threat.""
So far, the virus has killed 2,715 and infected more than 77,000 people in China. Cases have been recorded in at least 33 countries. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – The Philippine Stock Exchange index (PSEi) dipped to 6,909 on Wednesday, February 26, its lowest level in more than a year, as the novel coronavirus continued to spread fear among investors.
The PSEi lost 277 points or almost 4% and went as low as 6,879 within the trading day. This is its weakest since November 13, 2018, when it closed at 6,843.
This is also the biggest 1-day percentage drop since January 11, 2016, when it fell by 4.4%.
In an email to Rappler, the PSE said the index lost a staggering P401.5 billion in market value.
All sub-indices were in the red, with industrial and property leading the decline.
The most actively traded companies were Ayala Land (down 6.6%), BDO (down 4.4%), SM Prime (down 2%), SM Investments (down 2.5%), and Jollibee (down 5.7%).
Luis Limlingan of Regina Capital said Philippine shares stumbled as more companies abroad indicated earnings would be affected from the spread of the novel coronavirus.
Limlingan said the next support level is at 6,800. If it breaks that level, the next support would be at 6,600.
A support is a price level where the decline in stock prices is expected to pause as investors start buying the losing shares. As prices drop, demand for the stock increases or stabilizes.
Ayala's Integrated Micro Electronics, which was down by over 8%, has temporarily closed its factories in China due to the outbreak.
SM Malls president Steven Tan said in an ANC interview that their malls in China are like ""ghost towns.""
Fast-food giant Jollibee has temporarily closed 14 of its Yonghe King stores in the Chinese province of Hubei. Wuhan City, the epicenter of the outbreak, is in Hubei.
There were 184 decliners and 27 advancers on Wednesday, while 30 remained unchanged.
Foreign buying stood at P4.47 billion, while foreign selling was at P7.56 billion. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines (3rd UPDATE) – The Philippines on Wednesday, February 26, temporarily prohibited Filipino tourists from traveling to South Korea due to the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) scare.
The Philippine government also banned the the entry of travelers from South Korea’s North Gyeongsang province, which has been grappling with an outbreak of COVID-19, the disease cuased by the novel coronavirus.
“Any travel to South Korea will be temporarily suspended,” Department of Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said in a press conference but added groups of people not covered by the ban.
Duque said permanent residents, overseas Filipino workers with jobs in South Korea, and students based in that country will still be allowed to travel to South Korea, subject to proper precautionary measures.  
Before proceeding to South Korea, those who are not covered by the travel ban will be required to sign a declaration that they know and understand the risks involved in traveling to South Korea.
As of 3:40 pm on Wednesday, South Korea recorded the highest number of 2019-nCoV cases outside mainland China at 1,146. Of this number, 12 died while 22 had recovered from COVID-19.
In the case of the ban on the entry of travelers from North Gyeongsang province, Duque clarified that ""Filipinos and their foreign spouses and children, and holders of permanent resident and diplomatic visas will be allowed entry subject to exiting screening and quarantine protocols.""
Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles said the inter-agency task force decided to impose only a partial travel ban on those arriving from North Gyeongsang because the South Korean government gave its assurance that it will be able to isolate the 2019-nCoV cases there.
""There's an assurance from the South Korean government that they'll be able to contain 'yong problema at isolated, most of the cases are isolated in these two areas, meaning to say mostly Daegu City and Cheongdo county. But in-expand na rin natin [ang travel ban] sa buong province of North Gyeongsang,"" Nograles said.
(There's an assurance from the South Korean government that they'll be able to contain the problem and most of the cases are isolated in these two areas, meaning to say mostly Daegu City and Cheongdo county. But we decided to expand the travel ban to the entire province of North Gyeongsang.
Presidential Spokesperson Salvador Panelo said in a news briefing on Wednesday that the government body on top of COVID-19-related measures would determine the need for an expanded South Korea travel ban.
“The Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases shall conduct a risk assessment of the situation in the aforesaid country within 48 hours to analyze whether it is necessary to expand the travel ban” to cover other parts of South Korea, Panelo said, adding that “strict protocols” will be observed on travelers arriving from areas not covered by the ban.
South Korea is the Philippines' number one source of foreign tourists, followed by China. Earlier this month, the Philippine government imposed a travel ban on travelers from China, Macau, and Hong Kong over the COVID-19 outbreak.
Big question
A big question, however, is how authorities in either country would be able to distinguish travelers who have been to North Gyeongsang, from those who have not. Most flights coming into the Philippines from South Korea take off from Busan, Incheon, or Jeju, with passengers from different areas.
“Hindi ko alam kung paano ang kanilang protocol doon (I don’t know about their protocol there). I will ask them how. Siguro (Maybe) in cooperation with the Korean government because…they’re also trying very hard to contain the spread of the virus so magkakaroon siguro sila ng coordination (they’ will probably have coordination),” Panelo replied.
South Korea has reported more than 1,100 confirmed cases of COVID-19 – the name of the disease  the novel coronavirus, the largest number of infections outside China. There have been 11 deaths from the disease in the country.
The vast majority – 90% – of the recent infections were in Daegu, South Korea’s fourth-largest city and the epicenter of the outbreak, and the neighboring province of North Gyeongsang, Agence France-Presse reported.
In the Philippines, health officials have probed 610 patients for the virus. There had been 3 confirmed cases of infection – all Chinese tourists – of whom one died and two recovered.
A total of 84 Filipinos have contracted the virus outside the Philippines – two in the United Arab Emirates, one in Hong Kong, one in Singapore, and 80 who were onboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan. – Rappler.com "

Before disembarking the plane, the Filipinos were first assessed for possible symptoms of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. They will undergo another health assessment upon arrival at New Clark City.
The Department of Health (DOH) said only those who will show no signs of COVID-19 will be asked to stay at the Athletes' Village for their 14-day quarantine period.
Should a repatriate show signs of the new disease, he or she will be immediately brought to a hospital and isolated from other patients for further observation.
As of Tuesday, a total of 80 Filipinos caught the novel coronavirus while aboard the Diamond Princess, which had been in quarantine since February 4 at the port of Yokohama in Japan following the spread of the virus among the ship's crew and passengers. Ten of them have since recovered and been discharged.
None of these 80 positive cases, however, were included in the Philippine government's repatriation program for now.
There were a total of 3,700 people onboard the ship, including 531 Filipino crew members and 7 Filipino passengers. 
As of Tuesday, the Philippines has recorded 3 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus, all of them Chinese. One died, while the other two recovered.
The DOH has also probed 610 patients in the Philippines for possible infection. Of this number, only 98 remain admitted to heath facilities nationwide, while 509 have been discharged. – with reports from JC Gotinga/Rappler.com  "

MANILA, Philippines – Filipino tracksters continue to gear up for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics despite the threat of the novel coronavirus outbreak.
Pole vaulter EJ Obiena, the first Filipino to qualify for Tokyo, has been mapping out his preparation plans with Ukrainian coach Vitali Petrov which center around competing and training in California, USA and Europe. 
Obiena, who cleared 5.8 meters to punch his Olympic ticket, was slated to see action in the Asian Indoor Championships and the World Indoor Championships in China in March but both events were postponed. 
World Athletics, formerly known as the IAAF, decided to call off both championships due the coronavirus outbreak. 
Obiena and Petrov will unveil their new plans on February 25.
Like Obiena, three-time SEA Games 400m hurdles gold medalist Eric Cray was forced to tweak his plans following the postponement of the events in China and he instead competed in two indoor meets in New Mexico, USA. 
He can make the Olympics by meeting the qualifying standard of 48.8 seconds or by being ranked in the world's top 50 by the end of the qualifying date on June 29.
Cray will be suiting up in several top-notch competitions in the USA in the next 4 or 5 months.
Meanwhile, William Morrison achieved a distance of 20.21 meters in shotput in a meet in Indiana, USA earlier February – a mark that compares favorably with the qualifying standard of 21.1 meters.
In a conversation with Philippine Athletics Track and Field Association president Philip Ella Juico, Morrison expressed confidence in meeting the qualifying standard ""with a lot of hard work and technical adjustments.""
Kristina Knott, who lorded over the 200m sprint in the 2019 SEA Games, was also affected by the cancellation of the events in China. 
The Florida-based runner will compete in the Texas relays before she moves to Orlando and train there until the rest of the outdoor races are confirmed for April and beyond.
Knott will then have stops in San Antonio and Austin in Texas and in Japan and Italy. 
Pole vaulter Natalie Uy, the 2019 SEA games gold medalist and a 2019 Asian Championship bronze medalist, recently set a new Philippine indoor record of 4.25 m. 
Uy participated in the Pole Vault Summit in Nevada and will play in several outdoor events in the months to come. 
Christine Hallasgo, who emerged as the surprise marathon gold medalist in the 2019 SEA Games, proved her victory was no fluke by winning the MILO National Marathon this month in Tarlac City. 
Meanwhile, the rest of the 50-string PATAFA national pool are preparing for regional meets, national championships, and the Philippine National Athletics Championships. – Rappler.com "

SINGAPORE – The Singaporean Ministry of Health (MOH) said the first Filipino novel coronavirus patient is now in stable condition as of Monday, February 24.
His identity remains anonymous due to Singapore's privacy laws.
""We have verified with the MOH that the patient is in stable condition in the hospital,"" said Philippine Ambassador to Singapore Joseph Yap in a media briefing Monday afternoon, February 24.
Yap said the Singapore government has not disclosed the identity of the Filipino. The most that Singapore has relayed to the Philippine embassy is that the Filipino is a male 41-year-old permanent resident of the city-state. The patient does not have a recent travel history to China.
Yap also confirmed that the Filipino is Singapore's Case 89 of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.
The MOH provided information about Case 89 in its novel coronavirus bulletin on Sunday, February 23. Below is an excerpt from the MOH bulletin, as quoted verbatim:
6. Case 89 is a 41 year-old male Singapore Permanent Resident who has no recent travel history to China. He is currently warded in an isolation room at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID).
7. He reported onset of symptoms on 3 February and had sought treatment at two general practitioner (GP) clinics on 3 February, 7 February, 10 February, 17 February and 21 February. He was referred to NCID on 21 February, and subsequent test results confirmed COVID-19 infection on 22 February morning.
8. Prior to hospital admission, he had gone to work at Affinity Equity Partners (S) Pte Ltd (8 Temasek Boulevard) and visited Bishan Community Club (51 Bishan Street 13). He stays at Serangoon Avenue 3.
Travel ban not recommended
Yap said that despite Case 89, he is not recommending travel restrictions against Singapore because the novel coronavirus situation here is improving. Earlier, Philippine Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr also said he is opposing a travel ban to Singapore, citing the city-state's capacity to handle the outbreak.
""I know it's one case that hits close to home because it's a kababayan (countryman) who is ill, but on the other hand, in terms of the bigger picture in the whole of Singapore, I think the situation is better now than it was one or two weeks ago,"" Yap said.
In an earlier phone interview with Rappler, Yap advised Filipinos, ""I think we should just continue to be careful, to be cautious, but there's no reason to be panicking.""
In the first few weeks after Singapore got its first case of COVID-19, the city-state had the highest number of novel coronavirus cases outside China. It has since been overtaken by South Korea and Japan.
Singapore has at least 89 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus, according to data from the Singaporean government as of Sunday evening. Of these cases, 65 contracted the virus in Singapore while 24 got it outside the country.
The Singaporean government said 49 patients have been discharged, 35 are stable, and 5 others remain in critical condition. No one has died due to the virus in Singapore. – Rappler.com "

REMITTANCES. Filipino workers line up to send money to their families. File photo by Pat Nabong/Rappler  
MANILA, Philippines – The Philippine government expects that the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak would only have a ""minimal effect"" on the total cash remittances from overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) by the end of 2020.
Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles said in a press conference on Monday, February 24, that the government foresees a decrease of 0.8 percentage points in total cash remittance growth in 2020 – from the initial projection of 3% to just 2.2% – as an effect of COVID-19, the disease caused by 2019-nCoV.
""Because of this COVID-19 epidemic, we have adjusted our growth projections to 2.2% and now expect $34.2 billion in remittances for 2020. Nevertheless, this shall still breach another record high in overseas Filipino remittances,"" Nograles said.
He said the government had initially expected OFW remittances to reach as high as $34.5 billion by the end of this year. But Nograles said they had to adjust their projections due to the partial travel ban on China and its administrative regions Hong Kong and Macau.
The government has already allowed some 25,000 Filipinos to return to their jobs or homes in Hong Kong and Macau after being stranded in the Philippines due to the travel ban.
Nograles said the existing travel restrictions, however, would not severely affect OFW remittances as mainland China accounts for only 0.1% of total OFW remittances, Hong Kong 2.7%, and Macau 0.4%.
""DOLE (Department of Labor and Employment) also assures us that remittances from other source countries such as the US, UAE, and Saudi Arabia may help compensate for the possible slowdown in remittances coming from China, Macau, and Hong Kong. And we are encouraged by historical data that shows that Philippine remittances have been resilient even in the face of global downtrends,"" added the Cabinet secretary.
In 2019, personal remittances from OFWs reached a record high of $33.5 billion, which is 3.9% higher than the $32.2 billion recorded in 2018.
As of Monday, the Philippines has recorded 3 confirmed cases of COVID-19, all of them Chinese. One died, while the other two recovered.
The Department of Health has probed 609 patients in the Philippines for possible infection. Of this number, 126 remain admitted in heath facilities nationwide, while 480 have been discharged. – Rappler.com "

HANOI, Vietnam – Teacher Brenda* from Baguio City has been waiting for classes to resume after Vietnam’s Ministry of Education and Training (MET) extended the Lunar New Year break due to the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) scare.
“If the forced vacation extends to another week, I’ll just stay home and wait. But if they extend it longer, I’ll start looking for an alternative source of income,” Brenda, 37, said.
Brenda is among the many Filipino English teachers in Vietnam who are losing income since the MET suspended classes as a preventive measure against the COVID-19 pandemic.
The suspension of classes began on February 3. Since then, classes have not resumed, preventing many Filipinos working at English Learning Centers from earning their daily wages.
According to Brenda, her employer cannot pay her for the month of February because the students’ parents asked for a reimbursement of the tuition fee they paid for their children’s English language lessons.
Teacher Mary, 23, from Ilocos Sur, came back to Hanoi after spending the Lunar New Year break in the Philippines. She has been staying with her sister since. She is working in Hai Duong, a province in Northern Vietnam, but she has not yet returned to her workplace because of the class suspension.
“I am not expecting I’ll get paid this month because I did not teach,” she said.
The MET released its directive for a week of cancellation of classes on the first week of February. The second directive was released for the city of Ho Chi Minh on February 14, which stated that classes are cancelled until February 29. The city of Hanoi and 62 provinces were later included in the directive.
Teacher Cecilia, 40, from Mankayan in Benguet, has a full-time contract with a “big” English center. Her school moved some of her classes to an online platform. Her teaching hours are lesser but she will still earn her monthly salary. However, she has to offset her teaching hours once the school resumes its regular schedule.
Both Brenda and Mary are working for “small” English centers and have a full-time contract with their employers.

The three Filipinos, like many other English teachers in Vietnam, are waiting for further announcement from the MET after the Municipal People’s Committee of Ho Chi Minh requested an extension of the school break until the end of March.
This could mean two months of no income for many Filipino English teachers.
Meanwhile, online hubs like Filipino English Teachers in Vietnam and Filipino Expats in Vietnam have offered their help to those greatly affected by the crisis.
On Facebook community pages, Filipinos in different parts of Vietnam wrote they were willing to take in kababayans (countrymen) who are in need of a place to stay while ""this remains unsolved and 'till classes resume.""
Vietnam has recorded 16 cases COVID-19 infection, where 15 have recovered and been discharged from the hospital. Vietnam also closed its borders to China for the meantime.

MANILA, Philippines – Around 400 Filipinos on board the Diamond Princess cruise ship docked in Japan are set to come home on Tuesday, February 25, according to Department of Health (DOH) Assistant Secretary Maria Rosario Vergeire.
Vergeire confirmed the repatriation date on Monday, February 24, after DOH coordination with the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Philippine embassy in Tokyo.
Although over 400 Filipinos requested repatriation, the exact number of repatriates will be known only on Tuesday. Vergeire said they would still be subject to a screening process that would include testing and assessment if they have signs and symptoms of the COVID-19 disease. 
Those who test positive or exhibit symptoms prior to disembarking will be left behind, along with the 59 novel coronavirus-positive crew members in Japan. 
The repatriates will depart on two carriers. While they are on board the aircraft, the DOH will conduct regular monitoring. Those who manifest signs of respiratory illness will be isolated in one area of the plane. The planes are set to arrive at the Clark International Airport, where another layer of screening will be conducted upon landing.
Those who manifest illness will be brought to hospitals, while asymptomatic passengers will be taken to New Clark City in Tarlac for a two-week quarantine period.
""During the 14-day quarantine procedure, 20 medical teams from DOH hospitals will manage the quarantine facility to provide appropriate health services. Patients will be checked twice a day and provided with food and basic provisions,"" the DOH said.
A total of 538 Filipinos had been quarantined aboard the Diamond Princess docked at the port of Yokohama, Japan, since the outbreak of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which infected a total of 763 people aboard the ship.
Left behind for now
The 59 crew members who are COVID19-positive will not be included in the repatriation on Tuesday. They are currently in hospitals in Japan. If they test negative twice within 48 hours and exhibit no more symptoms, then they will be cleared to go home.
The two Filipinos in Japan who previously tested positive but recovered from the coronavirus will not be included in Tuesday's repatriation.
According to Vergeire, the Japanese government assured the Philippine government that the Filipinos who won't be going home yet will be taken care of.
Less than 20 Filipino ship crew members will be left behind, as designated by their employers. 
As of Monday, the confirmed cases in the Philippines has been stable at 3 for the past weeks. One died and two recovered and have been discharged from the hospital. The DOH has probed 609 for possible novel coronavirus infection, but 480 have been released. There remains 126 patients in various health facilities nationwide. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – The Philippine government will not yet impose a travel ban on South Korea, which has so far recorded the highest number of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) cases outside of mainland China.
On Monday, February 24, Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles told Malacañang reporters that the inter-agency task force handling the 2019-nCoV outbreak has yet to talk about possibly restricting travel to and from South Korea.
He said the Philippine government would be relying on existing protocols and recommendations from the World Health Organization (WHO) before imposing another travel ban.
""Sa ngayon wala pang desisyon 'no? Pag-uusapan ito sa task force,"" Nograles said. (Right now there's still no decision on this, okay? The task force will still talk about it.)
There has been a surge of 2019-nCoV infections in South Korea in the past days, with the country recording 763 confirmed cases as of 1:50 pm on Monday. Of this number, 7 people have died while 18 have recovered from COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus. (READ: South Korea on frontline as coronavirus spreads)
Nograles assured the public that none of those who tested positive in South Korea is a Filipino.
""So far, Filipinos there are safe, and I think the South Korean government is also doing everything that they can to contain the epidemic and control the situation,"" said the Cabinet secretary in a mix of English and Filipino.
For now, the Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs has advised Filipinos to ""delay non-essential travel"" to South Korea.
The Philippines is currently imposing a partial travel ban on China and its administrative regions Hong Kong and Macau to help prevent the spread of COVID-19. But the government has already allowed some 25,000 Filipinos to return to their jobs or homes in Hong Kong and Macau after being stranded in the Philippines due to the travel ban. – Rappler.com  "

MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – The number of Filipino crew members aboard Japanese cruise ship M/V Diamond Princess who have been infected with the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has risen to 59 as of Monday, February 24. 
The latest figure was announced by both Health Assistant Secretary Maria Rosario Vergeire and Foreign Affairs Assistant Secretary Eduardo Meñez during the weekly “Laging Handa” press briefing in Malacañang on Monday.  
THe 59 infected cases include two crew members who have already recovered from COVID-19, the disease caused by 2019-nCoV.  
“To date, 59 out of the 538 overseas Filipinos from the cruise ship had been confirmed with COVID-19. Two of the confirmed cases have recovered since isolation and admission [in health facilities],” Vergeire said. 
A total of 538 Filipinos – only 7 of whom are passengers while the rest are crew members – had been quarantined aboard the Diamond Princess docked at the port of Yokohama, Japan, since the outbreak of 2019-nCov, which infected a total of 763 people aboard the ship. 
Over 400 Filipinos from Diamond Princess have already requested to be repatriated to the Philippines. But Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles said their trip back to the country, originally set on Sunday, February, 23, was postponed to sometime this week “out of an abundance of caution to further safeguard the health and safety of our kababayans (countrymen).”
The Cabinet officials did not specify the new flight schedules of the Filipinos to be repatriated from Japan, but the DOH said in a briefing later on Monday afternoon that the repatriation will happen on Tuesday, February 25. (READ: Virus ship crew's families fear for kin as PH evacuation postponed)
None of the 52 positive cases will be allowed to go back to the Philippines, while those that will be allowed to enter the country will be subjected to a 14-day quarantine period at the New Clark City in Capas, Tarlac, the designated national quarantine facility for possible COVID-19 cases.
Meñez also said several Filipino crew members will be asked by their employer, Magsaysay Maritime Corporation, to stay behind to keep the cruise ship running, but only “essential” staff will be asked to work.  
“Actually even before na in-announce ’yong essential crew, I believe over 100 of our crew members nagsabi na rin sila na they were willing to stay behind should it be required by the employer. Pero as the situation developed, mukhang ang [Diamond Princess management] mismo ang nagsabi na titingnan namin kung sino lang ang crew member na essential,” Meñez said. 
(Actually, even before they announced that an essential crew will be needed, I believe over 100 of our crew members already expressed they were willing to stay behind should it be required by the employer. But as the situation developed, it looks the Diamond Princess management itself said they would still have to check who only among the crew members would be considered essential for the operations.) 
As of Monday, the Philippines has so far recorded 3 confirmed cases of COVID-19. One of them died, but the other two recovered and have since been discharged from the hospital.  The Department of Health has probed 609 patients in the Philippines for possible novel coronavirus infection. Of this number, 126 remain admitted in various heath facilities nationwide, while 480 have been released. – Rappler.com "

SINGAPORE – The Philippine government is not implementing a travel ban against Singapore even if close to 90 individuals here, including a Filipino permanent resident of the city-state, have contracted the novel coronavirus.
Praising how the Singaporean government has handled the crisis, Philippine Ambassador to Singapore Joseph Yap said he will not recommend travel restrictions against Singapore. His superior, Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr, earlier said he will also oppose a travel ban against the city-state.
“It’s unfortunate that we have a kababayan (countryman) affected by the virus, but the overall situation in Singapore really, I think, is stable and is in fact improving,” Yap told Rappler late Sunday evening, February 23. (READ: Singapore announces $4.6-billion boost to fight virus)
Yap cited information from the Singaporean Ministry of Health (MOH) that on Sunday there were no new cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, in Singapore. Two were discharged from the hospital on the same day.
This brings to 51 the number of people who have recovered from COVID-19 in Singapore, which has 89 recorded cases of the disease as of Sunday.
“I think whatever protocols and procedures that Singapore has in place, seem to be showing results. If anything, there is even less reason now to have travel restrictions of any kind compared to one or two weeks ago,” Yap said.
He added, “I think we should just continue to be careful, to be cautious, but there's no reason to be panicking.”
What’s at stake
If a travel ban against Singapore is imposed, Yap said that “definitely, it will be very inconvenient for everybody.” 
The ambassador noted that Singapore is one of the Philippines’ top trading partners. Singapore is the Philippines’ top export market in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, and the Philippines’ 5th biggest in the world, according to data from the Philippine embassy. Singapore is also the Philippines’ second largest international investor.
The embassy added that Singapore is the Philippines’ biggest tourist market in ASEAN.
“It’s not as simple as just saying, you know, we’ll ban people for health reasons. We have to seriously weigh the pros and cons, whether the damage will be much more than what we’re trying to prevent,” Yap explained.
Locsin earlier also opposed a travel ban against Singapore, as he tweeted on February 14: “I will not support a travel ban to and from ASEAN Singapore. A ban should hinge NOT on the incidence and number of infections/fatalities but on the demonstrated capability of the state concerned to contain the disease and strictly regulate ingress and egress from its air/seaports.”
The MOH on Sunday informed the Philippine embassy that a male Filipino permanent resident of Singapore contracted the novel coronavirus. Singapore has not disclosed the identity of the Filipino patient, and will only give more information to the Philippine government if the Filipino gives his consent.
Singapore will shoulder the Filipino patient’s hospital bills, as the city-state does with other COVID-19 cases. Yap said the Philippine embassy however is willing to help in reaching out to the Filipino patient’s relatives or flying them into Singapore if needed. 
In the first few weeks after Singapore got its first case of COVID-19, the city-state had the highest number of novel coronavirus cases outside China. It has since been overtaken by South Korea and Japan.
Singapore has at least 89 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus, according to data from the Singaporean government as of Sunday evening. Of these cases, 65 contracted the virus in Singapore while 24 got it outside the country.
The Singaporean government said 49 patients have been discharged, 35 remain stable, and 5 others remain in critical condition. No one has died due to the virus in Singapore.  – Rappler.com "

SINGAPORE (UPDATED) – The Singaporean government is investigating the close contacts of the first Filipino case of the novel coronavirus here, as the patient, whose identity Singapore has not disclosed, did not recently travel to China.
Philippine Ambassador to Singapore Joseph Yap confirmed these details to Rappler late Sunday evening, February 23, as he said the Philippine embassy is ready to help the Filipino coronavirus patient.
""The patient has no recent travel history to China, and they are still investigating his close contacts to find out more about where he could have gotten the virus from,"" Yap told Rappler.
Yap said it is possible that the patient's close contacts are also Filipinos, ""but it's hard to speculate."" He noted that Singapore's protocol for all coronavirus patients here is to trace their close contacts and to test them for the virus, if necessary.
The Filipino ""is now in isolation"" at Singapore's National Centre for Infectious Diseases, said Foreign Affairs Undersecretary Brigido Dulay earlier on Sunday.
It was also on Sunday evening when Singapore's Ministry of Health (MOH) advised the Philippine embassy about the Filipino patient, Yap said.
The most that the MOH disclosed was that the Filipino is a male permanent resident of Singapore, according to Yap. The patient needs to give his consent to the Singaporean government before his identity can be disclosed to the Philippine embassy.
""We do not know the identity because the MOH has not shared it with us for privacy reasons,"" the ambassador said.
Yap said that based on the Singaporean government's protocol, Singapore will shoulder the hospital bills of the Filipino patient and all other novel coronavirus cases. (READ: Singapore announces $4.6-billion boost to fight virus)
But the Philippine embassy can help by contacting his relatives or flying them into Singapore, if needed, using the Philippine government's fund to assist overseas Filipinos.
""We stand ready to render all the assistance that he would need,"" Yap said.
'No reason to panic'
Singapore has at least 89 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus, according to data from the Singaporean government as of Sunday evening. Of these cases, 65 contracted the virus in Singapore while 24 got it outside the country.
The Singaporean government said 49 patients have been discharged, 35 remain stable, and 5 others remain in critical condition. No one has died due to the virus in Singapore.
Singapore now has the 3rd highest number of novel coronavirus patients outside China. The country used to have the biggest number of patients outside China, but South Korea now has at least 602 confirmed cases. Japan has 132.
These figures exclude the 634 patients from the cruise ship Diamond Princess, docked in Japan.
Sought for words of reassurance for Filipinos in Singapore, Yap said: ""My advice is still the same: We should remain calm. Yes, there is one case, but we should continue to remain calm and continue to exercise vigilance. We really should continue to follow the advisories from the Ministry of Health.""
He added that ""the Singapore government has actually been doing a good job in terms of implementing their protocols."" He pointed out, for instance, that the number of novel coronavirus cases has been going down while the number of discharged patients has been going up.
""The trend is positive, and I personally feel that the situation now is more stable than it was maybe one or two weeks ago. I think we should just continue to be careful, to be cautious, but there's no reason to be panicking,"" Yap said. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – The Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) advised Filipinos to ""delay non-essential travel"" to South Korea, as the East Asian country raised its alert level for the novel coronavirus to the highest on Sunday, February 23.
There is currently no ban on Filipinos traveling to South Korea, but the DFA said ""travelers are cautioned to delay non-essential travel to the country as a precaution.""
South Korea reported 169 new infections and 3 more deaths on Sunday, bringing the total number of infections to 602 and the total number of deaths to 5.
South Korea now has the most infections outside of China, aside from the Diamond Princess cruise ship docked in Japan. More than 600 passengers and crew of the cruise ship have tested positive.
The DFA said the Philippine embassy in Seoul is closely monitoring the situation and coordinating with the Filipino community.
""The embassy has not received information that there are Filipinos in South Korea infected by COVID-19,"" said the DFA, referring to the disease caused by the virus.
""Filipinos in South Korea experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 should immediately contact the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention at 1339.""
For emergencies, the DFA said Filipinos in South Korea may also call the Philippine embassy at (+82) 10-9263-8119.
As of Sunday, at least 55 Filipinos have contracted the virus, all based outside the Philippines. Two are in the United Arab Emirates, one in Hong Kong, one in Singapore, and 51 from the Diamond Princess. (READ: Filipino coronavirus case in Singapore didn't travel to China)
In the Philippines, there have been 3 confirmed cases, all Chinese. One of them died, while the other two recovered.

MANILA, Philippines – House Deputy Speaker Johnny Pimentel urged the government to brace for a drop in tourism resulting to loss of thousands of jobs due to the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) that broke out in China, a major market in the Philippine hospitality industry.
“We have to put together a plan to help these displaced workers transition to other jobs,” Pimentel said in a statement on Sunday, February 23.
Pimentel projected the Philippine stands to lose up to 1.2 million Chinese visitors in 2020, primarily because of the travel ban on mainland China. Even if the virus is suppressed and the travel ban lifted, he said “the damage has already been done” and that a rebound would take longer than the country would wish.
Pimentel urged the Department of Tourism (DOT) and the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) to draw up an emergency skills retooling and jobs plan for thousands of workers facing layoffs.
The House leader also reminded the Social Security System to give out P20,000 in unemployment insurance to workers who would be involuntarilty separated.
In 2019, a total of 1,743,309 vacationers from China arrived in the Philippines, according to the DOT.
Aside from China, the Philippines welcomed the most visitors from South Korea (1,989,322 visitors), United States (1,064,440 visitors), Japan (682,788 visitors), and Taiwan (327,273). In these countries, the DOT expects a dip in visits of at least 10%.

MANILA, Philippines – Families of hundreds of Filipino crew members still stuck on board the coronavirus-stricken Diamond Princess cruise ship are increasingly worried for their relatives' health, as the Philippines postponed on Saturday, February 22, a scheduled trip to bring them home.
The vessel, moored off the Japanese coast in Yokohama near Tokyo, has the biggest cluster of coronavirus infections outside the Chinese epicenter, with over 600 cases confirmed among the 3,700 passengers and crew.
While hundreds of travelers have disembarked more than 1,000 crew remain – including over 400 Filipinos whose return on Sunday, February 23, has been delayed until Japan clears them to travel, the Philippines said Saturday.
""[The task force] is adjusting the schedule out of an abundance of caution with a view of safeguarding the health and safety of our OFWs (overseas Filipinos) onboard,"" the health department said in a statement.
Adding to the families' worry, a Philippine foreign ministry official said Saturday 49 Filipinos on board have tested positive for the virus, two of whom were successfully treated and discharged from the hospital.
(READ: Quarantine nightmare still not over for left-behind cruise ship crew)
Norma Fajardo, whose daughter is part of the Diamond Princess security team, said the crew have been well treated and cared for, but she is worried her work makes her particularly vulnerable to the virus.
""We couldn't do anything because she works in security so she has to monitor passengers,"" Fajardo told AFP.
""We're worried. She could get infected anytime,"" she added.
Fajardo said crew who get sick are allowed to rest, but those without symptoms were encouraged to continue working.
Esther Rivera – whose son is a ship photographer – has urged the Philippine government to bring them home.
""I hope they get pulled out from the ship because they are infecting each other there,"" Rivera said.
Once flown home, the repatriated Filipinos will be quarantined for two weeks in a northern Philippine facility previously used to house athletes in the 2019 Southeast Asian Games.
Japan has faced mounting criticism for its quarantine arrangements as passengers disperse across the world.
The cruise ship was quarantined on February 5 – after a passenger who disembarked in Hong Kong tested positive for the virus – but many crew were not isolated because they were needed to keep the vessel running.
Some were preparing food and delivering meals to cabins, leading some critics to charge they were inadvertently spreading the virus throughout the boat.
Princess Cruises President Jan Swartz has written a letter to the crew, saying the firm was ""deeply grateful and incredibly proud of all of you.""
Around 10 million Filipinos work abroad and the money they send home spurs the local economy where many still live in deep poverty despite the country's robust growth.
The government has for decades hailed overseas workers as modern heroes, but advocacy groups have highlighted these Filipinos vulnerability in troubled countries, or during epidemics. – Rappler.com

MANILA, Philippines – The repatriation of Filipinos on a cruise ship in Japan has been tentatively moved to ""early next week"" instead of Sunday, February 23, the Department of Health (DOH) announced.
The DOH said in a statement on Saturday, February 22, that the Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Disease (IATF-EID) ""unanimously resolved"" to move the homecoming date of over 400 Filipinos aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship.
“This is to allow the Japanese health authorities to complete the laboratory testing of the 400-plus Filipino crew members aboard the ship and comply with established Japanese quarantine protocols,” the DOH said.
It added that the task force adjusted the schedule ""out of an abundance of caution with a view to safeguarding the health and safety of our overseas Filipinos onboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship.""
“The Japanese government has ensured that appropriate health services are being provided to affected overseas Filipinos aboard the ship. Our Tokyo Embassy is working closely with the Japanese health and foreign ministry to complete the quarantine protocols for the Philippine Government to repatriate our Filipino crew members as soon as possible,” the DOH said. 
The decision was made a day after two Australians evacuated from the cruise ship  tested positive for coronavirus on their return home, despite being cleared in Japan.
Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr earlier ordered the immediate repatriation of the Filipinos aboard the ship on Wednesday, February 19. This was just hours hours after ship passengers who tested negative for COVID-19 – the name of the disease caused by the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) – following a 14-day quarantine were allowed to disembark.
About 460 to 480 Filipinos were aboard the ship, both passengers and crew members.
 
Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said in an earlier press conference that the repatriation was originally set for Tuesday, February 25, but the DFA moved it to Sunday, February 23, after the Japanese government announced they would close down the cruise ship.
Earlier reports said the 52 Filipinos infected with 2019-nCoV would not be included in the repatriation.
As of Friday, February 21, a total of 634 confirmed cases of COVID-19 was recorded on the Diamond Cruise ship, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Two former passengers died.
Meanwhile, the DOH gave a clean bill of health to 30 Filipino repatriates from Wuhan, China, after a 14-day quarantine at the New Clark City in Tarlac.
 
The DOH said the 10-member Health Emergency Response Team (HERT) from the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) and the DOH, 6 flight crew members, and 3 ground crew operators involved in the Wuhan mission were also declared healthy and showed no signs and symptoms of COVID-19, the name of the disease from infection with nCoV-2019.
The 49 Filipinos were set to leave New Clark City on Saturday.
The Philippines has so far recorded 3 confirmed cases as of Friday noon, with one death and two recoveries. A total of 597 possible cases are currently under investigation. So far, there were no cases of local transmission. – Pauline Macaraeg/Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – The scores of Filipino passengers and crew members of Japanese cruise ship Diamond Princess who were infected by the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) will not be among those to be repatriated to the Philippines on Sunday, February 23.
Department of Health (DOH) Assistant Secretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said they received a report as of Friday morning, February 21, that 52 Filipinos aboard the ship have already tested positive with 2019-nCoV, after 8 new cases were recorded. But she clarified the DOH was still “verifying” the latest figure.
“At gaya po ng ating napag-usapan at napagkasunduan namin [sa Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF)] na wala hong sasama sa repatriation na may sintomas (And just like what we discussed and agreed upon in the Inter-Agency Task Force, none of those who showed symptoms will be repatriated yet),” Vergeire said in a press conference on Friday afternoon.
The DOH official said the IATF handling the coronavirus scare is yet to finalize plans for these 52 Filipinos, but she promised they will “not be left behind.”
“Paguusapan po uli yan sa Inter-Agency Task Force. But as we have heard from the President [Rodrigo Duterte] and even our Secretary [Francisco Duque III], sinasabi lagi no Filipino o wala tayong kababayan na iiwanan. We will not be leaving them behind,” Vergeire said.
(The Inter-Agency Task Force will still have to talk about that. But as we have heard from the President Rodrigo Duterte and even our Secretary Francisco Duque III, they always say no Filipino will be left behind.)
She said that because the 52 cases tested positive for COVID-19 – the disease caused by 2019-nCoV – on different days, there would be separate individual arrangements for their logistical needs. These include different days of stay in the hospital, of discharge, and trips back to the Philippines as well.
About 460 to 480 Filipino passengers and crew members of Diamond Princess are set to be repatriated on Sunday from Yokohama, Japan to New Clark City in Capas, Tarlac, the Philippine government’s designated quarantine facility for COVID-19.
The IATF agreed that the DOH and the Magsaysay Maritime Corporation, the employer of the Filipino crew members, will both primarily shoulder the expenses for the repatriation process.
The DOH will be deploying health personnel to watch over the quarantined Filipinos and will also pay for the costs of their transportation to New Clark City as well as the on-site medical needs of the repatriates, hospitalization expenses through Philhealth, and personal protective equipment (PPE) for the first 5 days of the quarantine period.
The Magsaysay Maritime Corporation, meanwhile, will bear the cost of all transportation expenses of the repatriates from Japan until the completion of the quarantine period, PPE for the remaining period of the quarantine, as well as, food, lodging, personal hygiene kits and disinfectants, waste disposal services, and other incidental expenses of the repatriated crew.
The Department of Transportation will be tasked to bring the repatriates from Haribon Airport in Pampanga to New Clark City in Tarlac. The Overseas Workers Welfare Administration will provide livelihood packages to the repatriates and also pay for their transportation from Manila to their respective destinations after the quarantine period.
Vergeire said the hundreds of repatriates from Diamond Princess are currently being checked for possible COVID-19 symptoms.
Medical teams from the DOH will also test them before they leave the cruise ship and right after they disembark from the two planes that will take them back to the Philippines. 
Just like the 30 overseas Filipino workers repatriated from Wuhan, China – the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak – the second batch of quarantined Filipinos would be subjected to twice-a-day monitoring during their 14-day quarantine at New Clark City.
As of Friday, the DOH has probed 597 patients in the Philippines for possible COVID-19 infection. Of this number, 139 patients are still admitted in various health facilities nationwide, while 455 have already been discharged.
The Philippines has, so far, recorded 3 confirmed cases of COVID-19. One of them died, but the other two recovered and have since been discharged from the hospital.
In mainland China, the new disease has killed 2,235 people and infected a total of 75,466 as of 3:45 pm on Friday. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – The first batch of 49 Filipinos quarantined in New Clark City will now be allowed to go home after showing no signs and symptoms of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). 
In a press conference on Friday, February 21, Department of Health (DOH) Assistant Secretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said they will be holding a send-off ceremony for the 49 Filipinos on Saturday, February 22, the last day of their 14-day mandatory quarantine.
New Clark City in Capas, Tarlac was designated as the country's quarantine facility to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus. The site was first used in December last year as the Athlete's Village of the Southeast Asian Games.
“On February 22, DOH is set to conduct a send-off ceremony for the 30 repatriates and 19 crew members [and members of the repatriation team] at the New Clark City quarantine facility, which marks their completion of the required 14-day quarantine,” Vergeire said.
“All the quarantined individuals have not shown signs and symptoms of fever, cough or sore throat during their 14-day stay. They will now be allowed to go back to their respective homes and places,” the DOH official added.  
Of the 49 repatriates, 30 are overseas Filipino workers who were based in the province of Hubei in China, where COVID-19 – the disease caused by 2019-nCoV – has killed 2,235 people and infected a total of 75,466 as of 3:45 pm on Friday.  
The rest of the Filipinos quarantined in New Clark City include government personnel who were part of the repatriation team, 6 flight crew members, and 3 ground crew operators. (READ: DOLE to assist OFWs repatriated due to novel coronavirus crisis)
“We are glad that our repatriates are all well and safe from COVID-19. Our repatriation mission is not possible without the dedication and cooperation of the entire Inter-agency Task Force for Emerging Infectious Diseases with all its member agencies. We are extremely grateful for the collective effort of the government,” Vergeire said.
This now means New Clark City will have been completely vacated and ready for occupancy by the time the 460 to 480 Filipinos who were quarantined for days inside the Japanese cruise ship M/V Diamond Princess will fly back to the Philippines on Sunday, February 23. 
Vergeire’s updated figure on the second batch of repatriates from Diamond Princess is about 20 to 40 people fewer than Health Secretary Francisco Duque III’s earlier estimate of “around 500.” 
At least 44 Filipino passengers and crew members of Diamond Princess have tested positive for COVID-19, though one case has already recovered from the disease and is the first Filipino to do so.  
Vergeire said the 43 Filipinos who are still COVID-19-positive will not be allowed to go back to the Philippines. 
As of Friday, the DOH has probed 597 patients in the Philippines for possible COVID-19 infection. Of this number, 139 patients are still admitted in various health facilities nationwide, while 455 have already been discharged.  
The Philippines has so far recorded 3 confirmed cases of COVID-19. One of them died, but the other two recovered and have since been discharged from the hospital. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – The Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) confirmed that 3 more Filipinos who were onboard the Japanese cruise ship M/V Diamond Princess were infected with the novel coronavirus.
""Yes, 41 plus 3 new cases. Minus one who has recovered,"" the DFA said in a statement on Thursday, February 20, when asked to confirm if there are additional Filipino cruise passengers who tested positive for the novel coronavirus.
This means there are now 44 Filipinos who got infected with the novel coronavirus after being onboard the Diamond Princess, which had been quarantined in the port of Yokohama, Japan. 
One of the 44, who was the first Filipino reported to have contracted the novel coronavirus, has already recovered from COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. 
Some 500 Filipino passengers of Diamond Princess are set to be repatriated back to the country on Sunday, February 23. 
Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said all of them will be brought to New Clark City in Tarlac to be quarantined for another 14 days. 
Medical personnel from 16 government hospitals across Luzon will be deployed to help oversee the health status of the repatriates during the quarantine period.
As of Thursday, the DOH has yet to report any case of local transmission of COVID-19, although the Philippines has recorded 3 confirmed cases of the new disease. One of them died, while the other two recovered.  
The Philippines has a total of 556 patients under investigtion for the novel coronavirus as of this posting.

MANILA, Philippines – Around 500 Filipinos who were quarantined onboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan due to the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) are set to be repatriated to the Philippines on Sunday, February 23. 
In a press conference on Thursday, February 20, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said the repatriation was originally set for Tuesday, February 25, but the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) adjusted the date after the Japanese government announced it will be closing down the cruise ship.
""The [original] date [was] February 25, [but] it will be advanced to February 23. That's on a Sunday. The exact time is being determined by DFA as they are coordinating the repatriation of not 400 but 500 Filipinos with their counterpart in Japan and with the Ministry of Health, [Labor, and Welfare],"" Duque said.  
Two planes, with a 2- to 3-hour interval between their arrival times, will be flying the Filipinos from Japan to the Clark Air Base on Sunday. From there, the repatriates will be brought to the Athletes' Village in New Clark City in Tarlac, where they will have to undergo another 14-day quarantine period.  
Once the repatriates arrive in New Clark City, at least 549 Filipinos will be quarantined there to be monitored for possible cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by 2019-nCoV.
The first batch of quarantined Filipinos used to work in the Chinese province of Hubei, the epicenter of the outbreak, which has so far killed 2,118 people and infected 74,500 across China.
Duque said the Department of Heath (DOH) will be implementing a 1:1 repatriate-to-room ratio during the quarantine. But passengers with family members will be asked to stay in one room.
The DOH will also be deploying health personnel from 16 government-run hospitals across Luzon to do shifts in New Clark City and watch over the health of the quarantined Filipinos.
Among those to be quarantined are at least 41 Filipinos who were aboard the cruise ship and later tested positive for COVID-19.
Duque said the first infected Filipino to recover from the disease – a crew member of Diamond Princess – will still be subjected to the 14-day quarantine in New Clark City.  
""Oh yes, ika-quarantine din 'yan (Oh yes, he has to be quarantined). Because number one, we don't know much of the virus. We don't know if there's going to be immunity or if there's going to be re-infection,"" Duque said. 
As of Thursday, the DOH has yet to report any case of local transmission of COVID-19, although the Philippines has recorded 3 confirmed cases of the new disease. One of them died, but the other two recovered. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – The first Filipino reported to have contracted the novel coronavirus has recovered from the infection, the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) said on Wednesday, February 19.
He is a crew member of the cruise ship Diamond Princess, which had been quarantined at the port of Yokohama, Japan, for 14 days as the virus infected more than 500 passengers and crew while onboard.
“The Department of Foreign Affairs, together with the Philippine Embassy in Tokyo, is pleased to announce that the first Filipino crew member who tested positive for COVID-19 and was admitted to the hospital on February 5 has been successfully treated and is scheduled to be discharged today, February 19,” the DFA said in a statement.
“COVID-19” is the term for the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.
Forty other Filipino crew members of the Diamond Princess cruise ship are being treated for the novel coronavirus in hospitals in and near the Tokyo Metropolitan Area. Six of them were diagnosed earlier on Wednesday.
The 14-day quarantine imposed on the ship's passengers ended on Wednesday, and authorities facilitated the disembarkation of some 500 passengers who tested negative for the virus.
There were a total of 538 Filipinos onboard the ship, including those who had tested positive for the virus.
The Philippine Embassy in Japan is working with Japanese authorities and the management of Princess Cruises “to finalize the details, logistics, and schedule of the repatriation” of the ship’s Filipino crew members and passengers. They will be flown home “at the soonest possible time,” the DFA said.
The DFA earlier on Wednesday ordered the “immediate repatriation” of Filipinos who were on the Diamond Princess.
As of Wednesday, the COVID-19 global death toll has reached 2,000 – 5 of the deaths outside China. There were more than 74,000 confirmed cases in China alone, and hundreds more reported in two dozen countries.
In the Philippines, there have been 3 confirmed cases – one death and two recoveries of Chinese tourists. A total of 527 possible cases are currently under investigation. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr has ordered the immediate repatriation of Filipinos on the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Yokohama, Japan.
Locsin announced this in a tweet on Wednesday, February 19, hours after ship passengers who tested negative for COVID-19 – the name of the disease caused by the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) – following a 14-day quarantine were allowed to disembark.
""I have ordered our Tokyo Embassy to immediately repatriate our people in the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Yokohoma, Japan,"" Locsin said.
""It’s our duty to take care our overseas Filipinos wherever they are. I want them home now!"" he added.

@DFAPHL I have ordered our Tokyo Embassy to immediately repatriate our people in the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Yokohoma Japan. It’s our duty to take care our Overseas Filipinos wherever they are. I want them home now!
— Teddy Locsin Jr. (@teddyboylocsin) February 19, 2020

As of Wednesday, 41 Filipino crew members of the ship tested positive for COVID-19. Like others on the ship confirmed to be infected with the virus, they were brought to hospitals in Japan for treatment. Including the 41 crew members, there were a total of 538 Filipinos on the ship.
Assistant Secretary Rosario Vergeire said in a news briefing on Wednesday that the Department of Health (DOH) was making all the necessary preparations for the returning Filipinos.
Vergeire said that the DOH was checking hospitals and facilities where the repatriates would be quarantined, in coordination with local governments, but did not specify them.
The Filipinos earlier repatriated from Wuhan in Hubei, China, were brought to New Clark City in Tarlac. The government had also earlier cited the unused drug rehabilitation facility in Fort Magsaysay, Nueva Ecija, as a quarantine site.
'Proper repatriation process'
Vergeire said that Philippine officials have been coordinating with the Japanese government and the cruise ship management since last week to ensure that everything would be in place once the repatriation of the Filipinos begin.
Apparently in response to some views that it was taking the Philippine government some time to repatriate the Filipinos on the ship, Vergeire noted that many things had to be arranged because it involved a large group of over 500 people.
""So ever since last week, our government has already been coordinating with the government of Japan, and also our ministry of foreign affairs nakikipag-usap na po doon. We sat down with the Diamond Princess handler here already to negotiate our terms para makuha na natin kung paano talaga natin gagawin itong pagrerepatriate. So I think hindi naman sa natagalan; ipinoproseso lang nang maayos,"" she explained.
(Ever since last week, our government has been coordinating with the government of Japan, and also our ministry of foreign affairs is also talking with their counterparts. We sat down with the Diamond Princess handler here already to negotiate our terms so we can determine how to carry out the repatriation. So I think it's not that the process was slow; we're just doing this properly.)
Additional quarantine period
Vergeire said that a 14-day quarantine would be strictly enforced on all repatriated Filipinos. When the decision was made to repatriate the Filipinos on the ship, one of the conditions was to conduct an additional quarantine period even though they were already quarantined on the ship, she added. 
“The 14-day period will somehow give us assurance,” the health official said.
The DOH also reported that its supplemental budget request was granted, and that most of the fund would be spent on personal protective equipment for healthcare workers. Vergeire did not disclose the amount, but said the DOH would release the breakdown of this budget in the coming days.
As for the possible procurement of Favilavir, the first anti-novel coronavirus drug approved by China’s regulatory body, Vergeire said it would first have to be endorsed by the World Health Organization and the Philippines' Food and Drug Administration before it can be used locally.
As  of Wednesday, the COVID-19 death toll reached 2,000 – 5 of the deaths outside China. There were more than 74,000 confirmed cases in China alone, and hundreds more reported in two dozen countries.
In the Philippines, there have been 3 confirmed cases – one death and two recoveries. A total of 527 possible cases are currently under investigation. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – Three Cabinet officials, including Health Secretary Francisco Duque III, on Tuesday, February 18, assured the public that it is “safe” to organize and attend public gatherings for as long as people follow the prescribed precautionary measures to protect themselves from the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).
Duque, Interior Secretary Eduardo Año, and Tourism Secretary Bernadette Romulo-Puyat issued the joint statement which is a modification of the Department of Health (DOH) advisory on February 7, “strongly” urging the public to avoid public gatherings to stem the spread of COVID-19, the disease caused by 2019-nCoV.
“The Department of Health (DOH), Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG), and the Department of Tourism (DOT) would like to assure everyone that it is safe to organize and attend public gatherings, meetings, and festivals as long as all precautionary measures identifed by the DOH are observed,” they said in the statement.
The DOH chairs the  Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF) for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases Meeting, while the DILG and the DOT are among its members.

The DOH reminded the public to wash hands regularly and seek medical attention for signs of cough, colds, sore throat, and fever, which are symptoms of COVID-19. 
“All preventive and precautionary measures have been put in place by the national government to contain the spread of the COVID-19,” said Duque, Año, and Puyat.
The Cabinet officials also said the guidelines in “handling guests” in tourism enterprises in the country are being implemented even before the government imposed a now-partially lifted temporary travel ban to and from Hong Kong, Macau, and China, the epicenter of COVID-19 which has so far killed 1,863 people and infected more than 72,300 people there. 
“The safety of the public, especially our tourists and employees in the tourism sector, remains the priority of the Philippine government,” the officials said.
The officials gave the assurance as the government moved to boost domestic tourism especially this summer season, after the COVID-19 outbreak slowed down the influx of foreign visitors, especially those from China.
Puyat had earlier told lawmakers that the Philippines stands to lose P42.9 billion in tourism revenues for the peak months of February to April due to the COVID-19 threat.
President Rodrigo Duterte himself had expressed willingness to be a domestic travel ambassador of sorts, to encourage Filipinos to patronize local tourist spots.
The DOT wants Duterte himself to travel to popular beach destinations like Boracay, Cebu, and Bohol – places frequented by Chinese tourists – to offset the death of foreign tourists. 
As of Tuesday, the DOH has yet to report any case of local transmission of COVID-19, although the Philippines has recorded 3 confirmed cases of the new disease. One of them died, but the other two recovered and had been discharged from the hospital. 
There are currently 49 Filipinos under quarantine in New Clark City in Tarlac, a majority of whom were repatriated from Hubei, China.

MANILA, Philippines – Eight more Filipinos working on the Japanese cruise ship Diamond Princess have contracted the novel coronavirus, bringing the total number of infected Filipino crew members to 35, the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) said on Tuesday, February 18.
On Sunday, February 16, 27 Filipinos were reported as positive for COVID-19, the term for the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.
“The Filipinos who tested positive for COVID-19 were immediately transferred to Japanese hospitals and are now undergoing treatment. The (Philippine Embassy in Japan) constantly communicates with all patients currently confined in Japanese hospitals to ensure their well-being and to provide assistance,” the DFA said in a statement.
The Japanese government is set to announce on Tuesday the disembarkation procedures as the ship’s quarantine period ends.
“The Embassy is coordinating with all relevant Philippine and Japanese government agencies and is meeting with senior management representatives of Princess Cruises to ensure an orderly and safe repatriation of Filipinos once they clear the Japanese quarantine requirements,” the DFA said.
All Filipino passengers and crew of the Diamond Princess who wish to be repatriated will be accommodated by the government, the Department of Health (DOH) said on Tuesday.
“The DOH will follow strict infection control and quarantine procedures to ensure the safety of our repatriates and health workers who will man the quarantine facility,” the Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases said in a statement.
There were a total of 538 Filipinos onboard the Diamond Princess. One of them became the first Filipino case of COVID-19. The ship has been on quarantine at the port of Yokahama since February 5.
On Monday, the DFA said the government sent “care packages” containing toiletries and other supplies to the Filipinos on the cruise ship.
As of Monday evening, Philippine health officials had monitored a total of 521 patients for the novel coronavirus. Only 171 of them remained at hospitals.
The country has had 3 confirmed cases of infection, all of whom were Chinese tourists. There have not been any new confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the Philippines since February 5.

MANILA, Philippines – Filipinos stranded in the Philippines because of the novel coronavirus outbreak are now allowed to return to their jobs in Hong Kong and Macau, the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) and the Deparetment of Health (DOH) said on Tuesday, February 18.
The Philippine government’s Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID) has exempted overseas Filipino workers (OFW) from the two special administrative regions of China from an outbound travel ban meant to prevent the spread of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, which originated from Wuhan City in Hubei province, China.
DFA Undersecretary for Civilian Security and Consular Concerns Brigido “Dodo” Dulay first made the announcement in a tweet on Tuesday afternoon.
""The Task Force also agreed to authorize travel to Hong Kong and Macau for permanent residents of the respective Special Administrative Regions, Filipinos leaving abroad for study, and Overseas Filipino Workers, provided that the travellers sign a declaration signifying their knowledge and understanding of the risks involved,"" the IATF-EID stated in its resolution released by the DOH also on Tuesday.
Some 25,000 OFWs and Filipino residents of Hong Kong had been urging the government to exempt them from the travel ban that has been in force since February 2, after health officials confirmed the first two cases of the virus in the Philippines, and following the death of one of the COVID-19 patients.
Today, DFA Sec Locsin’s advocacy has come true. OFWs returning for work in Hongkong and Macau have been exempted from the outbound travel ban by the IATF-EID, subject to certain procedural formalities. Woohoo!! @teddyboylocsin— Dodo Dulay (@dododulay) February 18, 2020
Several of the stranded OFWs organized themselves into a group called #StrandedPH and launched a social media campaign hoping to spark action on their plight. Members of the group have been interviewed by different news outlets including Rappler, explaining that their prolonged absence could cost them their jobs.
Aware that the ban was meant to protect them from catching COVID-19, the stranded OFWs said they were willing to sign a waiver absolving the Philippine government of any liability should they fall ill upon their return to Hong Kong.
Besides the risk of losing their income sources, some of the stranded Filipinos had invested a lot of money, even accumulated debts, for the opportunity to work in Hong Kong. In the case of Hong Kong residents, some have had to pay for accommodations during their unexpected prolonged stay in the Philippines.
Upon hearing of their exemption from the ban, #StrandedPH group administrator Edward Borja thanked the government agencies and media outlets for the publicity that “paved the way to help the government agencies make a final decision towards lifting the ban.”
“Me, my family, my co-admins and my fellow OFWs are overwhelmed with happiness with this decision by our government. Now we are all just waiting for airlines to reopen flights so we can book right away,” Borja said in a statement.
As of Monday evening, Philippine health officials had monitored a total of 521 patients for the novel coronavirus. Only 171 remained at hospitals. The country has had 3 confirmed cases of infection. There have not been any new confirmed cases since February 5.

MANILA, Philippines – Anticipating billions of pesos in revenue losses in the tourism industry, due to the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) scare, the Department of Tourism (DOT) is recommeding that President Rodrigo Duterte visits popular island destinations to help boost the domestic tourism industry.
DOT Undersecretary Arturo Boncato Jr said on Monday, February 17, they had so far chosen Boracay, Cebu, and Bohol as the initial destinations to be visited by Duterte, who had invited Filipinos to travel with him around the country amid the 2019-nCoV threat.  
“So, [we are doing this] just to arrest and to cushion whatever impact this crisis may bring to the tourism industry. As we see it, it’s still early and, as we all know, we are uncertain as to how long this would go on. And we’d like to have those measures as early as possible addressed,” said Boncato in a press briefing in Malacañang.
The DOT official said they wanted Duterte to begin his tour around the country by end of February or early March to “showcase the sites and attractions” that are popular among tourists. 
“So maaari pong ipapakita natin dito iyong mga pinakasikat na beaches, for example, ano, at saka iyong mga activities na nagbibigay ng mga unique experiences sa mga turista. At malamang ipapakita din natin iyong local communities ’no,” Boncato said. 
(So we can possibly showcase the most famous beaches, for example, and the activities that would give unique experiences to tourists. Of course, we would also feature the local communities.) 
It remains unclear, however, if Duterte himself already agreed to the itinerary. The President is also notorious for skipping pre-scheduled public engagements often due to health-related issues. (READ: LIST: Duterte's skipped events, long absences) 
Tourism Secretary Bernadette Romulo Puyat already told lawmakers the Philippines stands to lose P42.9 billion in tourism revenues for the peak months of February to April due to the COVID-19 threat.  
Boncato also said the DOT also estimates that the country would have a foregone revenue worth P14.8 billion alone following the ongoing travel ban covering China, Hong Kong, and Macau. 
As of Monday, the Department of Health has yet to report any case of local transmission of COVID-19, although the Philippines has recorded 3 confirmed cases of the new disease.

   CEBU CITY, Philippines – The Philippine National Police (PNP) filed charges against an optometrist here in Cebu for allegedly posting on Facebook unverified information related to the novel coronavirus.
According to a statement from the PNP, Josephil Brian Consuelo, an optometrist, erroneously posted on Facebook that a patient under observation had died at the University of Cebu Medical Center.   
No patients under observation in Cebu have died, according to the latest update from the Department of Health. Based on latest figures from the DOH, there are a total of 55 patients under investigation for the virus in the Central Visayas. 
 According to the PNP, Consuelo was arrested last Thursday, February 13.   The Central Visayas' anti-cybercrime unit checked the post and filed charges after finding out the information was false.   Consuelo's post could not be found as of this posting.   
Police Colonel Marlo Castillo, head of the Central Visayas' anti-cybercrime unit, said that the defendant would face the charges.
Castillo said they were in coordination with Cebu province to monitor any information about the virus that could cause unnecessary panic.
""We would like the public to know that spreading fake news and misinformation has equivalent legal consequences,"" Castillo said.
PNP chief General Archie Francisco Gamboa said the police would continue to act against the spread of misinformation amid the ongoing novel coronavirus crisis. 
""Again, we urge the public to refrain posting unverified information that creates panic and confusion and we will file criminal charges to those proven spreading these false reports,"" Gamboa said.   
Consuelo's arrest comes a week after the Cebu Provincial Board passed a resolution against spreading ""fake news"" related to the novel coronavirus. 
The National Bureau of Investigation said they would also go after those who ""peddle coronavirus fake news.""
Currently, at least 28 Filipinos have the novel coronavirus, but are all based outside the country. This includes one in the United Arab Emirates, and 27 aboard a cruise ship quarantined in Japan.

MANILA, Philippines – The Philippine government provided care packages to the 538 Filipinos still quarantined on the Japanese cruise ship Diamond Princess due to the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) scare.
Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) Assistant Secretary Eduardo Meñez said in a press conference on Monday, February 17, this is the initial assistance the Philippine government has provided the Filipinos onboard the cruise ship. 
""The Philippine embassy, as I said, is in constant contact [with them]. We have, through the Japanese government, delivered care packages containing toiletries and non-medical supplies, and are in constant contact with the medical authorities,"" Meñez told reporters in Malacañang.  
Of the 538 Filipinos onboard, at least 27 are confirmed to have COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus. The first case of COVID-19 in a Filipino was confirmed onboard the Diamond Princess. 
The cruise ship has been in quarantine since February 5 at the port of Yokohama near Tokyo following the 2019-nCoV outbreak.
For now, Meñez said it is ""not clear"" to him who is shouldering the medical expenses of the infected Filipinos. But he gave an assurance that the Philippine government would shoulder the costs if the need arises.
""At this point, it is not clear to me whether the medical expenses of those positive, of those identified to be COVID-positive are being shouldered by whom. I would imagine that in the initial case, it would be the Japanese government. But the employer as well will probably have some responsiblity for paying for the medical expenses,"" Meñez said.
""But if in the final analysis, the government needs to pay, the government will step up accordingly,"" he added. 
Asked further if the government would aid the Filipino passengers who would wish to be repatriated from the cruise ship, Meñez said, ""Of course.""

""President Duterte…said China has been kind to us, and we can only show the same favor to them,"" he added.
Malacañang has yet to publicize the letter as of this posting, but Huang said it will be made public soon.
In the forum, Huang defended the Chinese government's response to the viral outbreak amid criticism that it had been negligent in alerting the public during its early stages.
The envoy went on to thank Filipinos and their government for aid and assistance sent to China ""despite the urgent need in this country.""
""Despite their own difficulties,"" the Philippine government sent 42 boxes of relief goods on a chartered flight to Wuhan City in Hubei, China, the epicenter of the outbreak, Huang said.
""In our view, this move is not only material support but more importantly, spiritual inspiration to the Chinese people. That's what we need,"" he added.
Duterte has consistently tried to shield China from criticism. When he first publicly addressed Filipinos about the outbreak on February 3, he chided them for seeking a total travel ban of mainland Chinese. He called it ""xenophobia.""

MANILA, Philippines – Tales of misery continue for more than 25,000 stranded Filipinos who hope to return to Hong Kong for work as the Philippine government remains firm on its ban on travelers coming to and from China, Hong Kong, and Macau.
The Philippine government imposed the travel ban on February 2 as the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak worsened worldwide. 
The virus was discovered in the city of Wuhan in China, prompting the lockdown of several provinces, and several countries' travel ban covering the mainland and its special administrative regions. 
In a unity statement sent to media, a group of Filipino with contracts in Hong Kong appealed to the government to lift the ban as they fear losing their jobs due to their “prolonged absence.” 
The group is composed of foreign domestic workers, skilled workers, and permanent Hong Kong residents. 
“The burden is made heavier by the loans they had to take out to pay for placement fees and other expenses to secure their jobs,” the group said. 
The group added that some Filipino residents also worry about not being able to pay their monthly rent and bills on time. 
“In another category are those who have been raised in Hong Kong and don’t have houses in the Philippines anymore, and are thus forced to pay for accommodation and food [in the Philippines] while waiting for the ban to be lifted,” the group said. 
Edward Borja, 52, who works as a swimming teacher in Hong Kong, said he and his family initially planned to stay in Manila until February 6, but since the ban had been imposed, they could not leave the country. He worries not only about the bills they need to pay in Hong Kong, but he also fears not having an income if they won't be able to return to Hong Kong by March. 
“Ngayon, nakausap ko 'yung employer ko. Ibibigay niya raw ang full salary ko ngayong February, pero kapag tumagal pa kami rito hanggang March, no pay no work na ako noon. This is our struggle now. Paano pa ang hirap na dinaranas ng mga domestic helpers natin?” Borja told Rappler.
(My employer told me that she’d give my full salary for February, but if we can’t return to Hong Kong by March, it will be no work no pay. This is our struggle now. The domestic helpers must be having a harder time.)
Joms Ortega, 33, who works as a child play performer in Hong Kong, initiated the Facebook group #StrandedPH, which has now more than 1,000 members. 
Ortega said they sent a letter to the Overseas Workers Welfare Administration (OWWA) on Monday, February 17, appealing to lift the travel ban so they could return to Hong Kong.
“Pag-uusapan na nila (They will talk about it). There will be a meeting this afternoon and tomorrow. Hopefully, there will be a partial decision by then. But, of course, they can’t promise us anything. We hope this will be fixed in the next few days,” said Ortega. 
Better health care system
The Duterte administration's latest move banning travelers from and to China, Hong Kong, and Macau widens the scope of restrictions that had been put in place aimed at preventing the spread of the virus.
On Friday, January 31, Duterte eimposed a ban on travelers from Wuhan City and Hubei province – the epicenter of the 2019 novel coronavirus – as well as other affected regions of China.
But for Borja, the Hong Kong government is prepared for returning workers in their country. He said the health care system in Hong Kong ensures that “we all get excellent medical care at little or no cost to us, while some of us have private medical coverage that comes with our employment.”
“Dito nga sa atin, nagkakaubusan ng masks, pero kasi 'yung mga companies namin a Hong Kong, binibigyan kami ng masks at ng sanitizers,” said Borja. (Here in the Philippines, there is shortage of face masks, but in Hong Kong, our companies provide us with masks and sanitizers.)
“We don’t worry about our protection. We don’t need to pay anything. The Philippine government could not provide that. I’m not questioning the Department of Health. They’re really good but sa dami ng populasyon ng bansa natin, it’s impossible for them to match that. I feel safer there,” he added. 
The group said they are willing to sign a waiver absolving the Philippine government of any liability if they fall ill upon their return to Hong Kong.
“All we ask is the right to travel back to the city where we live and work,” the group statement read.

There are at least 12 Filipinos confirmed to have the virus, but all are based outside the Philippines, including one in the United Arab Emirates and 11 who were aboard a cruise ship quarantined in Japan.
The World Health Organization declared the outbreak an international emergency, warning that the novel coronavirus poses a ""very grave threat.""
So far, the virus has killed more than 1,660 and infected over 68,000 people in China. Cases have been recorded in more than two dozen countries. – Rappler.com "

AKLAN, Philippines – Malay acting town mayor Frolibar Bautista lifted the border checkpoints on Saturday, February 15, after placing restrictions on travelers who had been to mainland China.
The Malay task force reported a total of 45 foreigners without proper documents of history of travel, while 39 who had shown their passports had been to China within the last 14 days. They were refused entry to Boracay Island.
Executive Order Number 4, issued on February 6 by Bautista, directed health workers and law enforcement units to monitor the entry of any persons, regardless of nationality, before entering the town of Malay and Boracay Island over coronavirus concerns. (PH coronavirus watch: Suspected cases per region, as of February 15, 2020)
Border checkpoints were set up by the task force in Nabas-Malay boundary, barangay Dumlog, and Sitio Bacolod in barangay Caticlan, to check the passports and travel history of visitors.
All persons travelling from or transiting to China and its special administrative regions of Macau and Hong Kong for the past 14 days were temporarily banned from February 7 to 15 out of caution that travellers may be infected with the deadly virus.
Bautista said travellers to Boracay Island would receive further screening in Caticlan port. They would be advised to fill-up health declaration cards and get checked by the personnel there for common signs of coronavirus.
Visitors on roll-on roll-off vessels from Batangas and Mindoro are also required to submit their health declaration cards upon arrival at Caticlan port.
Negative for COVID-19
Meanwhile, 9 persons under investigation (PUIs) in Aklan were discharged from Aklan provincial hospital. The 9 cases had been found |negative for infection of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), according to the Provincial Health Office (PHO-Aklan).
A bus driver who was put in quarantine in Aklan training center in Kalibo, Aklan was also discharged on February 15. The male patient had no travel history to infected countries and had no close contact with confirmed coronavirus patients, but insisted on self-quarantine after experiencing flu-like symptoms.
With the lifting of the Taiwan travel ban, airports and seaports in Aklan are on heightened surveillance to examine passengers in a bid to stop the spread of coronavirus.
Taiwan is the third largest source market of Boracay Island, with 30,624 arrivals last year.
Provincial Health Officer I Dr. Cornelio Cuachon said the provincial inter-agency task force isolation rooms with 12 beds for PUIs in Dr. Rafael S. Tumbokon Memorial Hospital (DRSTMH) in Kalibo, Aklan and the Aklan training center as temporary holding area for persons under monitoring (PUMs).
Augmentation personnel from Department of Health (DOH) are also deployed in airports and district hospitals to help in monitoring coronavirus cases. – Rappler.com "

CEBU CITY, Philippines – At least 25 Filipinos who were quarantined in Busay village in Cebu, after disembarking from their Taiwan flight in Mactan-Cebu International Airport, are now home.
On Tuesday, February 11, 78 passengers were held at the Mactan airport when the Philippines included Taiwan in its temporary travel ban because of the novel coronavirus or COVID-19. They initially refused quarantine.
The 25 passengers were assigned to the provincial quarantine facility in Busay village, while the rest were sent to facilities provided by Cebu City and Department of Health Central Visayas. (READ: Cebu readies another quarantine area amid coronavirus threat)
Those assigned in the Busay quarantine unit complained of the poor facilities such as lack of electricity and running water, as well as, smelly blankets. They also said that they were not provided with bed sheets.
Apart from the 25, at least 5 were from Hong Kong.
Because of the complaints, the Cebu provincial government decided to move them, including those in the Hong Kong flight, to another quarantine facility in Pinamungajan on Friday, February 14.
Still, the 25 passengers from Taiwann opted to go home instead. Of the 25, 21 people went to their residences in Davao while the 4 others went home within the province.
The 4 from Cebu were made to sign a document committing to immediately get themselves checked into a hospital should they feel flu-like symptoms.
As of writing, no one checked in the Busay facility.
Meanwhile, there are 24 people being observed at the provincial quarantine facility in Lahug. They were from Hong Kong and Macau.
The Philippines on Friday lifted the travel ban imposed on Taiwan, after the latter protested.
The chairperson of the Manila Economic and Cultural Office in Taipei warned that Taiwan could cancel visa-free privileges for Filipinos in retaliation to the ban.
Philippine health officials said however that the lifting of the ban has nothing to do with the threat of cancelling the visa-free privileges.
There are 3 confirmed cases in the Philippines, including one death. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – The Philippine government's inter-agency task force (IATF) handling the novel coronavirus crisis has decided on Friday, February 14, to lift the travel ban imposed on Taiwan due to the virus. 
""The lifting of travel restrictions for Taiwan has been agreed by the members of the IATF by reason of the strict measures they (Taiwan) are undertaking, as well as the protocols they are implementing to address the COVID-19,"" Presidential Spokesperson Salvador Panelo said, referring to the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Disease. 
Panelo said the lifting of the ban is ""effective immediately.""
""Accordingly, travel may now be made by any national to Taiwan from the Philippines and vice versa,"" Panelo said.
Malacañang's announcement came 4 days after the Department of Health revealed that Taiwan was covered by the temporary travel ban imposed by the Philippines on mainland China and its special administrative regions to prevent the spread of the virus. 
Last Monday, February 10, Health Undersecretary Eric Domingo said Taiwan was included because the World Health Organization recognizes it as part of China.
Since Monday's announcement, the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in the Philippines has denounced the move, saying Taiwan was ""wrongly included"" in the ban. 
The chairperson of the Manila Economic and Cultural Office in Taipei warned that Taiwan could cancel visa-free privileges for Filipinos in retaliation to the ban. 
But Health Secretary Francisco Duque III, speaking to reporters after the IATF meeting on Friday, said the decision to lift the ban had nothing to do with the threat to cancel visa-free privileges.
""(This is) purely on public health and safety, and of course the need to see whether there is a threat or increased risk if we didn't allow the travel from Taiwan to the Philippines,"" Duque said.
Asked what specific protocols observed by Taiwan made the task force decide to lift the ban, Duque said the DOH would release a more detailed report next week.
But the health chief did imply that one of the reasons was that Taiwan has not yet reported local transmission of COVID-19. Outside of China, Singapore, Japan, Thailand, Hong Kong, Germany, France, Vietnam, South Korea, and Australia have reported local transmission of the disease.
Taiwan, a self-ruled democracy, has found itself increasingly caught up in travel restrictions aimed at China, where the outbreak has killed over 1,380 people and infected over 63,000, as of Friday.
On Friday, Panelo said the inter-agency task force will also evaluate other jurisdictions, including Macau, for possible lifting of the travel ban. 
""We have said from the very start that this (travel ban) will be subject to risk assessment. This has been a temporary ban to begin with, and there hasn't been any decision by the IATF that has been set in stone,"" Duque said. 
Health officials in the Philippines have so far probed 455 patients for the novel coronavirus, including 3 confirmed cases. Two of the cases have since recovered, while one died due to severe pneumonia because of the novel coronavirus. – Rappler.com "

Wondering how you can show your affection on Valentine’s Day amid the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) scare? Let Health Secretary Francisco Duque III count the ways.
Asked during a February 14 press briefing how best to celebrate Valentine’s given the health department’s advisory asking people to avoid crowded gatherings, Duque said, “The best greeting is like this,” then waved his hand in greeting. 
You can also acknowledge the other person by slightly bowing your head and putting your hand to the opposite chest “if you want the Namaste,” the health chief said, referring to a customary Hindu greeting.   
If you want to give your loved one a kiss, it would be best to give them a flying kiss, and this is how to do it correctly, according to the health chief, “When you do the flying kiss, make sure it (your hand) does not touch your lips, and you also don’t talk while you are delivering the kiss.”
Duque had a light exchange with Malacañang reporters amid immense pressure on the health department to level up its response to the new virus. So far, the Philippines only has 3 confirmed cases  and no case of human transmission. One of them died after developing severe pneumonia due to the virus, but the other two recovered from the respiratory disease and have since been discharged from the hospital. 
The virus has killed 1,383 people and infected over 64,400 others, mainly in China. The health department heads the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Infectious Diseases, which leads government efforts to contain the spread of the new disease. 
The task force’s resounding advice to the public has been to practice proper hygiene and coughing etiquette. The virus can be transmitted through respiratory droplets, which means that when an infected person coughs or sneezes, droplets carrying the virus could reach infect other people. 
In the meantime, the task force also recommended a temporary travel ban on travelers coming from mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan. Taiwan has since contested its inclusion, even warning that visa-free privileges for Filipinos there could be suspended due to the ban.  – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – Health Secretary Francsico Duque III said it is premature to assume that the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) crisis is stabilizing as “blindspots continue to characterize the virus.”  
The health chief said this during a Malacañang press briefing on Friday, February 14, discussing the government’s preparedness to respond to the disease, which has killed 1,383 people and infected over 64,400 others, mainly in China.  
Answering questions about whether there are signs that the situation could be stabilizing, Duque said, “I don’t want to be a killjoy, but it’s premature. We’ve seen some initial trending that it’s not consistent. We have to wait for more data to come in and to establish a trending that’s more consistent, whether it’s plateauing or going down. Still, the situation remains fluid.”
For this, the DOH relies on regular risk assessment reports from the World Health Organization (WHO), the UN agency working closely with Chinese authorities to establish more facts about the new virus and the disease it causes. For instance, there are still no conclusive reports to say that 2019-nCoV transmission could be airborne. 
“Blindspots here continue to characterize this virus and the efforts to familiarize ourselves with this virus is ongoing. Science has never been more active than it is today precisely to continue to characterize the very granular aspects of this virus,” the health chief added. 
According to a February 10 Agence France-Presse report, the WHO said there were “tentative signs the epidemic (was) stabilizing” but that there might “be more infections abroad in people who have never traveled to China.” 
So far, local transmission of 2019-nCoV has been reported in Singapore, Japan, Thailand, Hong Kong, Germany, France, Vietnam, South Korea, and Australia. There is no local transmission yet in the Philippines, but Duque said that the government is treating it as a possibility in the Philippines. 
455 patients probed
The health department has so far probed 455 patients for 2019-nCoV in the Philippines as of February 14. Of the 455, 191 remain admitted in hospitals across the country, while 258 have been discharged. 
Of the accumulated total of 455, 386 patients have already tested negative for the virus while 66 cases are still pending test results. 
The DOH on Friday also announced another death of a patient under investigation, but confirmed that the new fatality died due to cardiovascular attack and in fact tested negative for the virus. 
According to the DOH, the patient, a 71-year-old Filipino from La Union who had a history of travel to Taiwan, was admitted to the hospital after “manifesting with coughs.” He died Thursday night, February 13. 
Two other patients being probed for possible 2019-nCoV infection have died from other illnesses. All 3 fatalities subsequently tested negative for 2019-nCoV.
So far, the Philippines has confirmed 3 cases of 2019-nCoV in the country. One of them died after developing severe pneumonia due to the virus, but the other two recovered from the respiratory disease and have since been discharged from the hospital. – Rappler.com  "

City health officials immediately admitted the patient to the isolation room of the James L. Gordon Memorial Hospital here to undergo the mandatory two-week quarantine for travellers who have been to China during their trip abroad.
Mayor Rolen Paulino Jr said the traveller is now being monitored and is listed as Olongapo's first person under investigation for possibly contracting the  coronavirus disease or COVID-19.
Dr. Rodrick Bustamante, head of the city health office, said it was commendable that the patient voluntarily sought the assistance of local authorities upon showing flu-like symptoms.
Bustamante said the patient has undergone test for the COVID-19 virus. He said the results of the test would immediately be made public.
Health officials here have also started contact tracing to find out who were with the patient during the overseas trip. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – Labor Secretary Silvestre Bello III wants the Duterte administration's travel ban on Taiwan, which was imposed due to the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), to be lifted for overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) who wish to return there.
Though confident that the ban will be lifted soon, Bello said on Thursday, February 13, that he has asked the Department of Health (DOH) to exempt OFWs bound for Taiwan.
The DOH leads the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases and, along with agencies like the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Department of the Interior and Local Government, decides on matters like travel restrictions aimed at preventing the spread of 2019-nCoV.
""For those who are affected by the travel ban in Taiwan, we ask for your patience, and in a few days, there will be a review,"" Bello said.
""We are seeking understanding from our OFWs because the implementation of a temporary ban by the DOH is for your own safety as well. We hope for a possible lifting of the ban in a few days.""
In the meantime, the labor department will provide P10,000 in financial aid to OFWs stranded in the Philippines. It will also help OFWs with accommodation and transportation.
So far, the ban is in place for travelers to and from mainland China, its special administrative regions of Macau and Hong Kong, and Taiwan. Only Filipinos and permanent resident visa holders are allowed to enter the Philippines, while Filipinos cannot go to the areas included in the ban.
The DOH admitted that it initially overlooked the ban on Taiwan due to ""confusion"" among involved agencies, but started implementing it the weekend of February 8 to 9.
Taiwan is included in the ban as the Philippines has a One-China policy, meaning it ""respects the position of the Chinese government that there is but one China and that Taiwan is an integral part of Chinese territory."" The World Health Organization also recognizes Taiwan as part of China in its situation reports about 2019-nCoV. 
But Taiwan has since denounced the Philippine government's move, asserting it is not part of China.
There are now concerns that Taiwan may cancel visa-free privileges for Filipinos in retaliation for the travel ban.
So far, the Philippines has 3 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus. They are imported cases, the patients having traveled from China. One of them died, while the other two have since recovered.
As of Thursday noon, the novel coronavirus has killed 1,368 people and infected over 60,300 people worldwide. – Rappler.com

MANILA, Philippines – The Department of Health (DOH) has probed a total of 441 patients for the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) as of Thursday, February 13. 
This is an increase of  33 from the total of 408 the previous day, February 12. 
Of the 441patients, 230 are currently admitted in hospitals, while 206 have been discharged but are still being monitored daily by the DOH in case they develop symptoms. A total of 252 patients have already tested negative for the virus, while 186 samples are still being processed by the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM).

The DOH said there are no longer reports of patients refusing admission to hospitals. It was a problem the agency encountered last week, as at least 10 patients refused hospitalization, citing concerns about expenses. 
The health department assured those being treated in public hospitals that costs will be fully shouldered by the government. Meanwhile, for patients in private hospitals, the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation has an available insurance package for 2019-nCoV treatment.  
So far, there have been 3 confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV in the Philippines. One of them died due to severe pneumonia caused by the virus, while the other two have recovered from the infection and have since been discharged from the hospital.
All 3 are imported cases, as the patients traveled from China already carrying the virus. This means that there is still no local transmission of 2019-nCoV in the Philippines. But the health department said it was prepared in case of an outbreak of local transmission, as the World Health Organization has advised all countries to be prepared. Local transmission outside of China has so far been recorded in Singapore, Japan, Thailand, Hong Kong, Germany, France, Vietnam, South Korea, and Australia.  
The WHO has also said that the new virus constitutes a grave threat to the world, having already killed 1,369 people and infected more than 60,300, mostly in China. – Rappler.com "

'STAY CALM.' President Rodrigo Duterte delivers a taped message on the 2019 novel coronavirus. RTVM screengrab 
MANILA, Philippines – With over 400 persons under investigation for the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) in the Philippines, President Rodrigo Duterte urged Filipinos to trust in government efforts to quell the spread of the virus.
In a taped message aired on Thursday, February 13, Duterte called on Filipinos to “remain calm,” as he gave assurances that officials were working with the World Health Organization and private groups in facing the “challenge and preparing for any eventuality.”
Duterte's message comes nearly two weeks after the Philippines recorded its first confirmed case of the novel coronavirus on January 30. 

“To my fellow Filipinos, I understand that many of you are worried about the world health and the well being of our loved ones. It is normal to feel anxious, concerned, and even afraid,” he said.
“I call on our people to remain calm, vigilant, responsible and I also ask your trust and cooperation, support as we face the challenge. Tayo ay magkaisa (Let us unite) together as one nation, this challenge can be overcome,” the President added.
Apart from this, Duterte gave an update on the current situation of the virus in the country reiterating the findings of health officials that no local transmission has been found in the Philippines to date. He likewise gave a recap of measures taken by the government to address the virus, including the repatriation of 30 Filipinos from China – ground zero of the coronavirus outbreak.
Duterte said the government was ready to bring home more Filipinos from China should they wish to be repatriated.
Meanwhile, he reminded the public to observe good cough etiquette, maintain personal hygiene, and practice frequent hand washing to prevent the spread of the virus.
Slow to act? Duterte earlier got flak for his initial response to the virus, with many saying he was slow to act compared to other leaders who swiftly put in place sweeping restrictions to quell the spread of the virus.
In his initial messages on the coronavirus, Duterte told Filipinos ""everything is well"" in the Philippines and that there's ""nothing really to be extra scared of."" He said public ""hysteria"" over the coronavirus was ""unwarranted"" and that the virus would “die a natural death” as he expressed confidence in medical advances. 
Duterte had also hit xenophobic calls to bar all Chinese from entering the Philippines, saying it was in “bad taste.” He later joked he would “slap” the virus while later saying the government was “on top” of the coronavirus threat.
The Department of Health has confirmed 3 cases of the novel coronavirus in the Philippines. These include the first death outside China – a 44-year-old Chinese man who traveled to the Philippines from Wuhan. The other two cases had recovered from the virus.
Read President Duterte’s full message below:
To my fellow Filipinos,
Today, we face the very grave threat of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 or COVID-19. As of now there are only 3 confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection. None of those infected is a Filipino national. There is no evidence yet of local community transmission here in our country.
The government, together with the World Health Organization (WHO), medical societies and partners in private sectors is addressing the challenge and preparing for any eventuality.
Last Sunday, we repatriated several of our countrymen from the affected areas in China. The government is taking care of them while they are in quarantine.
To our kababayans who remain in lockdown areas in China, I assure you that the government is ready to bring you home if you want. Hindi naman kayo papabayaan.
To my fellow Filipinos, I understand that many of you are worried about the world health and the well being of our loved ones. It is normal to feel anxious, concerned and even afraid.
Maging malinis. Hugasan 'yung kamay frequently, 'yung paulit-ulit. Kung every handshake mo, kung humatsing ka, takpan mo bunganga mo at tingnan mo hindi ka makahawa sa ibang tao. Kung ikaw naman ay may ubo, magmask ka na lang.
Maging maingat at 'yung mga impormasyon na importante na manggaling sa WHO, ay ating pakinggan. At huwag makinig diyan sa mga haka-haka. Sa gobyerno kayo nakatutok.
Nandiyan ang totoo sa gobyerno, wala diyan sa mga taong haka-haka na wala namang ginawa kung hindi manakot para kapwa niya tao.
I call on our people to remain calm, vigilant, responsible and I also ask your trust and cooperation, support as we face the challenge. Tayo ay magkaisa together as one nation, this challenge can be overcome.
Maraming salamat po.

MANIILA, Philippines – Then chairperson of the Manila Economic and Cultural Office (MECO) in Taipei warned on Wednesday, February 12, that Taiwan could cancel visa-free privileges for Filipinos in retaliation for its inclusion in the travel restrictions imposed by the Philippines in relation to the novel coronavirus outbreak. 
MECO Chair Angelito Banayo said Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen met with her Cabinet and ordered that a list of possible retaliatory measures be drafted against the Philippines due to its the travel ban that covers Taiwan, based on Manila's adherence to a one-China policy.  
“Maraming (There are many) possible retaliatory measures.... One possible retaliatory measure is i-cancel ‘yun (they will cancel [visa-free entry for Filipinos]),” Banayo said in an interview with DZMM.
""Posible rin 'yun ang unang hakbang,"" he added. (It could be a first step.)
Taiwan earlier denounced the Duterte administration's move to include it in temporary travel restrictions, saying the Philippine government had ""wrongly included"" it in its ban against non-Filipino travelers coming from China, Hong Kong, and Macau.
The Philippines belatedly clarified that Taiwan was included in its travel ban since the World Health Organization (WHO) recognizes it as part of China.
Taiwan, a self-ruled democracy, has found itself increasingly caught up in travel restrictions aimed at China, where the outbreak has killed more than 1,100 people and infected over 44,600, as of Wednesday. It likewise maintained it is a ""factual error"" for the WHO to regard it as part of China.
""The Philippines should not be misled by WHO's wrong information on Taiwan.... We urge the Philippine government to immediately correct its decision on Taiwan and remove Taiwan from the travel ban,"" the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in the Philippines said in an earlier statement.
Taiwan started implementing a visa-free policy in 2017, allowing Filipinos to enter Taiwan and stay for up to 14 days. It extended the policy until July 2020 as ""a display of Taiwan's amity with the Philippines.""
Duterte to 'review' ban
Responding to Taiwan's protest, Presidential Spokesperson Salvador Panelo said concerns would be relayed to President Rodrigo Duterte, though he maintained the ban was in place as part of efforts to quell the spread of the coronavirus.
""We will relay to the President the request of certain quarters to reconsider the travel ban to Taiwan,"" Panelo told reporters in an interview.
""The reason why we are effecting the travel ban is because we are trying to protect our countrymen from the infected. If there is no infection there, we will give it to the President [to review],"" he added.
Taiwan earlier assured the public it has taken ""all measures needed"" to swiftly contain the spread of the novel coronavirus. As of Wednesday, Taiwan recorded 18 confirmed coronavirus cases.
The WHO earlier declared the outbreak a global emergency, triggering several countries, including the Philippines, to set travel restrictions largely focused on China. – with reports from Agence France-Presse/Rappler.com

CEBU CITY, Philippines – Seventy-eight passengers have been held at the Mactan Cebu International Airport (MCIA) since Tuesday, February 11, for refusing quarantine when they arrived. (READ: Taiwan covered by travel ban due to novel coronavirus – DOH)
The passengers were apparently in the air – or on a quick transit – when the Philippines issued a clarification on Monday, February 10, that Taiwan was among the countries included in the travel ban on China and its special administrative regions due to the novel coronavirus or Covid-19.  
The Philippines and the World Health Organization consider Taiwan as a part of China. Taiwan denounced its inclusion in the travel ban shortly after the announcement, asserting it is an independent state.
MCIA manager Steve Dicdican told reporters in a chance interview, streamed by local newspaper The Freeman, that the passengers were upset when they disembarked from their flight because they did not know about the clarification until they arrived in Cebu.
He said they protested the mandatory quarantine. Another staff member described the passengers as ""enraged."" “This started yesterday (Tuesday), a lot of them were transiting only from Taiwan. They're in the holding room. We're trying to convince them to go on 14-day quarantine,” Dicdican said
 Filipinos are not included in the ban, but in Cebu province, arriving passengers from banned countries must undergo a 14-day quarantine period. (READ: Cebu readies another quarantine area amid coronavirus threat)
 According to Dicdican, majority of them were only transiting in Taiwan. Many of the passengers are also not from Metro Cebu, and outside of areas where Department of Health can inspect if they are qualified for home quarantine.  To be qualified for home quarantine, a Bureau of Quarantine officer has to check if anyone living in the household might be susceptible to catching the virus.
Currently, there is space for 250 in the quarantine facilities prepared by the province of Cebu and the Department of Health.
Cebu is a major tourist destination in the country. All 3 of the confirmed cases of novel coronavirus in the country passed through Cebu en route to other destinations. One of them became the first Covid-19 death outside of China.
There are 54 patients under investigation by the DOH in Central Visayas for possible exposure to Covid-19. 
According to Dicdican, the passengers are being fed by the Cebu provincial government, and none are exhibiting flu-like symptoms.
 The airport has been under a state of emergency since the World Health Organization declared the novel coronavirus an international emergency on January 31.
The airport manager said they would continue convincing the passengers to go under quarantine. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – The Philippines stands to lose at least P42.9 billion in tourism revenues due to the threat of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), Tourism Secretary Bernadette Puyat said on Wednesday, February 12.
During the House hearing on the economic impact of 2019-nCoV, Cavite 7th District Representative Jesus Crispin Remulla asked Puyat how much the Philippines has lost in terms of tourism receipts.
Puyat explained that P42.9 billion ($848.62 million) is the projected revenue loss for February to April this year, as the Philippines banned non-Filipino travelers coming from China, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan.
""P42.9 billion, it's going to be for February, March, and April,"" Puyat said, explaining that it was computed based on the past 3 years' data.
Remulla pressed further, asking how much ""exactly"" has the Philippines lost since the travel ban was enforced.
But Puyat could only give the estimate of P16.8 billion ($332.33 million) for the month of February.
""If we compute the whole of February, it will be P16.8 billion, but we are still halfway. This is only based on our forecast,"" she said.
When it comes to flights, Puyat, citing Civil Aeronautics Board data, said 465 flights have been canceled as of Tuesday, February 11, totaling 101,452 seats.
The Philippines also lost at least 14,211 tourists from 11 canceled cruise calls to various ports in Luzon and the Visayas. (READ: Finance team says PH economy 'can handle' coronavirus effects)
Before the travel ban was enforced, the Department of Tourism (DOT) had projected a total of 795,250 visitors from China, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan from February to April. This is less than 10% of the 9.2 million tourist arrivals targeted for the entire 2020.
But other markets have decreased trips to the Philippines, too, because of the 2019-nCoV threat:

Europe - decreased bookings to the Philippines, some have canceled their trips
United States - reported cancellations in Philippine Airlines flights
Japan - 643 people have reportedly canceled their trips
Korea - 6,576 airline booking cancellations, while 2,368 people canceled package tours
Australia - government encourages domestic travel instead

To recover lost revenues, Puyat said the DOT is working with major airlines to roll out ""more value-added tour packages, discounted accommodation rates, and marked-down prices for domestic flights.""
Puyat added that ""summer packages and multi-destination"" packages will be promoted yearlong in a bid to boost domestic tourism. (READ: Businesses worry more about Duterte gov't than novel coronavirus)
The World Health Organization has warned that the 2019-nCoV outbreak is a ""very grave threat.""
So far, it has killed at least 1,115 people and infected over 45,000, surpassing figures from the SARS outbreak of 2002-2003. – Rappler.com

BAGUIO CITY, Philippines – A 10-month-old baby and her mother are among the 9 persons under investigation (PUI) for the coronavirus in the Cordillera region.  
Amelia Pangilinan, acting regional director of the Department of Health-Cordillera, said on Wednesday, February 12, that the spike in the number of PUI is nothing to worry about as all of them voluntarily brought themselves in as part of “health seeking behavior.”  
Three of the 9 are in Baguio while 3 others are in Abra. The rest are from Mountain Province and Benguet.  
The 5 previous PUI have been discharged. They included a Chinese student who came from a province near Wuhan, the ground zero of Covid-19. 
The infant and her mother just happened to make a stop-over in Hongkong. Many of the 9 also have history of travel to China, Pangilinan said. 
Some of them are domestic help while one is an English teacher in China who happens to be on vacation.  
Cagayan Valley remains to have the most number of PUI in Northern Luzon with 18 and no one discharged yet.  
Pangasinan also had its first PUI, a 28-year-old woman from Lingayen town who went to Taiwan for a vacation.
As of morning of Wednesday, February 12, there are 382 patients under investigation in the Philippines. Of the 3 confirmed cases, one died due to pneumonia, while the two others were discharged – meaning, they tested negative twice already.
Abroad, 6 Filipinos are confirmed to have contracted the virus: one the United Arab Emirates and 5 in Japan.

MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – The Department of Health (DOH) has probed a total of 408 patients for the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) as of Wednesday noon, February 12.
This marks an increase of 26 from the 382 reported on Tuesday, February 11.
A total of 208 have already tested negative for 2019-nCoV, while 197 cases are still pending test results from the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM).
Of the 408 patients under investigation, 238 are currently admitted in hospitals after showing symptoms, while 165 have already been discharged. Health Undersecretary Eric Domingo said none of the symptomatic patients have severe symptoms.

The discharged patients are still under strict monitoring, which means that the DOH communicates with them daily for updates in case they begin to show symptoms.
Domingo also said they have no longer received reports of patients refusing admission. The health official last week disclosed that at least 10 patients refused admission to hospitals, citing concerns about expenses.
The DOH has promised that treatment in public hospitals will be shouldered by the government, and that the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation has launched an assistance package for patients being probed for 2019-nCoV in private hospitals.
Here is the breakdown of patients per region:

Ilocos Region - 5

Still no local transmission
So far, there have been 3 confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV in the Philippines. One of them died due to severe pneumonia caused by the virus, while the other two have recovered from the infection and have since been discharged from the hospital.
All 3 are imported cases, as the patients traveled from China already carrying the virus. This means that there is no local transmission of 2019-nCoV in the Philippines yet, Domingo said. (READ: Time to prepare for possibility of wider coronavirus transmission in PH) 
Local transmission outside of China has so far been recorded in Singapore, Japan, Thailand, Hong Kong, Germany, France, Vietnam, South Korea, and Australia, according to Domingo.
The health official said the DOH and Philippine hospitals are ready for the possibility of local transmission.
""The WHO (World Health Organization) has signified that we should all get ready because they've been seeing it happen in other countries, even in countries that are far [from China]. So all countries must prepare,"" he said.
The DOH is looking to expand laboratory testing for the virus as part of its disease detection efforts. Domingo said the DOH is eyeing 4 subnational reference laboratories connected with the RITM for 2019-nCoV testing. He also said the RITM will readily train private hospitals interested in assisting with disease detection efforts.
The WHO declared the 2019-nCoV outbreak a global public health emergency, warning that it constitutes a ""very grave threat"" for the world. It has killed at least 1,115 people and infected over 45,000, surpassing figures from the SARS outbreak of 2002-2003. – Rappler.com  "

MANILA, Philippines – The Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in the Philippines (TECO) denounced the Duterte administration's move to include Taiwan in travel restrictions imposed over the novel coronavirus.
In a statement on Tuesday night, February 11, TECO said Taiwan was ""wrongly included"" in the ban against non-Filipino travelers coming from China, Hong Kong, and Macau.
""The Republic of China (Taiwan) is a sovereign and independent state. Taiwan issues its own passport and visas and has exclusive jurisdiction over its people and territory. In fact, Taiwan is not, nor has it ever been, part of the PRC (People's Republic of China),"" TECO said.
Taiwan, a self-ruled democracy, has found itself increasingly caught up in travel restrictions aimed at China, where the outbreak has killed more than 1,100 people and infected over 44,600.
The Philippines on Monday, February 10, announced Taiwan was included in a temporary travel ban imposed on mainland China and its special administrative regions since the World Health Organization (WHO) recognizes it as part of China.
The Philippines also observes a one-China policy as stated in the 1975 Joint Communique between the Chinese and Philippine governments, which ""respects the position of the Chinese government that there is but one China and that Taiwan is an integral part of Chinese territory.""
Health Undersecretary Eric Domingo, however, admitted that the inclusion of Taiwan in the expanded ban was not immediately implemented because of ""confusion"" among involved agencies. Implementation for non-Filipino travelers only began over the weekend.
Taiwan maintains it is a ""factual error"" for the WHO to regard it as part of China.
""To confuse Taiwan with China has caused troubles for our side and in the international community,"" Taiwan foreign ministry spokeswoman Joanne Ou said, adding the ""Chinese factor is obvious"" in Manila's decision to include Taiwan in travel restrictions.
""The Philippines should not be misled by WHO's wrong information on Taiwan.... We urge the Philippine government to immediately correct its decision on Taiwan and remove Taiwan from the travel ban,"" added TECO.
Taiwan likewise assured the public it has taken ""all measures needed"" to swiftly contain the spread of the novel coronavirus.
Aside from the Philippines, Italy has banned flights by Taiwanese carriers, Bangladesh has stopped Taiwanese travelers from entering, while Mongolia initially enacted a ban and then said it would review visa applications on a case-by-case basis.

Our region is at a critical juncture in the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak. The majority of cases are still in China, but the virus has now been confirmed in many parts of the world. While we must continue efforts to contain its spread, it is also time that all countries, including the Philippines, prepare for the possibility of wider transmission. (READ: Coronavirus death toll reaches 1,110 – gov't)
There are now some reports of clusters of cases with no apparent link to transmission in China. The latest information suggests that the virus may be more transmissible than early data suggested. This does not mean that the virus will start spreading easily within the Philippines or elsewhere tomorrow, or perhaps ever – of course, we hope that it won’t. But while countries are still working hard on containing the virus, we must be ready in case there is wider spread. This requires action today, because preparation takes time, especially to ensure that the response reaches everyone in all parts of the country. 
Responding to wider transmission would require shifting the focus of activities to protect the vulnerable and minimize the health and social impact. If we don’t prepare now, we will not be able to activate and implement those plans when they are needed. (READ: WHO warns of 'very grave' global virus threat)
For example, in case of wider community transmission, we would need to ensure health facilities can focus on treating the most vulnerable and severe cases. This may mean planning to switch away from medically isolating or quarantining everyone who is infected, to encouraging people with mild illness to stay at home to recover – so that health care facilities do not become overwhelmed. Steps must also be taken to ensure health facilities do not become places that amplify the virus’ spread, infecting staff and other patients. (READ: 382 patients probed for novel coronavirus in PH)
We must also be ready to make a switch away from testing all suspected cases and tracing the contacts of every person who has the virus, to instead applying limited testing capacity to monitor geographical spread and trends – and using this information to inform decisions about the most appropriate public health response.
In addition, we need to be ready to consider the possibility of closing schools or postponing mass gatherings, if necessary, to reduce opportunities for the virus to spread.
I understand why people are worried, as this is a new disease and there is much we still don’t know. The best thing we can do is to be prepared. In addition to those measures governments can take, we all share a collective responsibility to take simple measures to protect not just ourselves as individuals, but our communities, including the most vulnerable. These measures are important in any stage of an outbreak. 
Wash your hands – frequently, and thoroughly. If you are coughing or sneezing, cover your nose and mouth with a tissue or your elbow. Keep your distance – we recommend at least 1 meter – from people who are unwell. If you’re sick, stay home so you don’t risk infecting others – and seek medical care if you have trouble breathing. And please, don’t circulate rumors and misinformation online and to your friends and family. When people have the wrong information, they can make decisions which actually harm themselves, and others.
In addition to looking at the virus’ transmissibility, we are closely monitoring its severity. Of all cases reported in China to date, around 2% of people have died. Outside of Hubei province, the death rate among those infected is around 0.4%.
We must continue to watch the transmissibility and severity of the virus closely and assess the situation as it evolves. In the meantime, we urge countries to prepare. Even if, in the end, there is no need to switch on these measures in response to the COVID-19 outbreak, this is always time and effort well-spent – because it makes us better prepared for the next new disease or outbreak, whenever that may occur.
WHO will continue to support the Philippines and all countries in their preparedness and response efforts. The current outbreak is a test for all of us, but by focusing not only on what confronts us today, but planning ahead for tomorrow, taking steps to ensure preparedness efforts reach every corner of every country, together we will be able to limit the health, social, and economic impacts. – Rappler.com

MANILA, Philippines – President Rodrigo Duterte once again turned to the military when confronting problems faced by the government, saying he would tap uniformed personnel to ensure order in the country in the event the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak becomes a pandemic.
Duterte on Monday, February 10, said he wanted the military and police to instill public order should the spread of the coronavirus worsen. He likewise said that while the government was ""on top"" of the ""idiot"" coronavirus threat, doctors should work double-time to find a cure to the virus.
""Kung sabihin mo na ano, pandemic talaga (If you say it's really a pandemic already), then I will have to utilize for order and obedience of people, the military and the police,"" Duterte said in a speech before local chief executives.
Earlier in his speech, Duterte rejected criticisms his administration was slow to act on the coronavirus and that it lacked the infrastructure to deal with such an outbreak. He cited the expertise and restrictive measures taken by health officials as proof it was dealing with the disease.
Despite this, Duterte continued to downplay the spread of the coronavirus, saying the public would rely on the strength of Filipinos' antibodies to prevent the spread and further contamination from the virus.
""You want to shout to the heavens? Go ahead. Will it prevent the coronavirus from entering the country? Long before the alarm was raised marami nang mga (there were many) Chinese and Filipinos...na pumunta na doon (who went there [Wuhan]. So kung sabihin mo (So if you say) it's a matter of contamination, we will just have to rely on how strong the antibodies of the Philippines are,"" Duterte said.

Duterte also sought to give assurances once more that Filipinos had nothing to worry about as he said the government was ""doing its best"" to respond to the spread of the coronavirus in the Philippines.
""Maniwala lang kayo sa gobyerno (Just have faith in the government), in a crisis involving deaths and getting people sick, we will do our very best,"" he said.
While health officials have given assurances they are closely monitoring suspected novel coronavirus cases in the country, they repeatedly reminded the public to practice good personal hygiene such as frequent handwashing and to seek medical treatment immediately, if necessary.
So far, health officials announced 284 patients were under investigation for the coronavirus in the Philippines.
The Department of Health has confirmed 3 cases of the novel coronavirus in the Philippines. These include the first death outside China – a 44-year-old Chinese man who traveled to the Philippines from Wuhan. The man was the country's second confirmed case of the novel coronavirus, and a companion of the first patient, a 38-year-old Chinese woman, who has since recovered from the virus.
The Philippines' third confirmed case, a 60-year-old woman from China, also subsequently tested negative for the novel coronavirus after a few days in the hospital and has since returned to China.
As of Monday, the novel coronavirus has killed over 900 and sickened over 40,000 globally, with China as the worst-hit country. Meanwhile, at least 3,400 have reportedly recovered. – Rappler.com "

CEBU, Philippines – The Cebu Provincial Board on Monday, February 10, passed on first, second, and third reading an ordinance against the spread of false information regarding the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). 
The ordinance will penalize people spreading false information on social media or text about the disease. The penalties will range from a fine of up to P5,000 or less than one year of jail time.
Residents who see posts online containing fake nCoV-related news or who receive text messages on the 2019-nCoV should pass on their complaints to the Provincial Legal Office.
The ordinance also prohibits and penalizes any misdeclaration of information on Health Declaration Cards which passengers are required to fill in. 
Pertinent information filled in by passengers – such as whether or not passengers have been in China, Macau, or Hong Kong in the past 14 days – will be counterchecked by the Bureau of Immigration upon checking passports. The same penalties for fake news also apply for any falsification in the health cards.
The Office of the Governor cerified the ordinance as urgent.
According to 4th District Board Member Honorable Kerrie Shimura, chairperson on the Committee of Health and Social Services, the ordinance is in line with Executive Order (EO) 5 and 5-A series of 2020, recently signed by Governor Gwen Garcia.
Workers in local government offices violating the protocols provided by the preceding EOs will be dealt administrative disciplinary action, including civil or criminal actions allowed by the Local Government Code.
EO 5 explains the protocols on the travel ban along and the hybrid quarantine system. Filipinos and permanent visa holders from China, Macau or Hong Kong or any country but have been in the enumerated states for the past 14 weeks are given the option to choose to undergo a home-based quarantine or a facility quarantine. EO 5-A, meanwhile, is the protocol for seaports on both passenger and cargo vessels.
Both are preventive executive orders meant to address confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV.
As of Monday, February 10, the number of those who have died from 2019-nCoV has reached over 900. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – The first patient confirmed to have the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in the Philippines has recovered from the infection, the Department of Health (DOH) confirmed on Monday, February 10.  
Health Undersecretary Eric Domingo said that the 38-year-old woman from Wuhan, China, who was the Philippines' first case of the novel coronavirus, has tested negative for the virus twice and ""has in fact been discharged.""
Domingo could not confirm if the woman has already flown back to China since her release from the hospital on Saturday, February 8. 
Before testing negative for the virus, the woman had already been recovering in San Lazaro Hospital and had not been showing symptoms.  
The woman's recovery from the disease means that there are currently no living patients with the virus in the Philippines.  
The woman's traveling companion, a 44-year-old man who also tested positive for the novel coronavirus, died of complications due to severe pneumonia. 
The Philippines' third confirmed case, a 60-year-old woman from China, also subsequently tested negative for the novel coronavirus after a few days in the hospital. She has since returned to China, according to the DOH.  
The third case, Domingo had earlier said, was evidence that ""the virus can be eliminated as immune system mounts response against it.""
But the DOH still urges the public to remain vigilant and practice precautionary measures, as the disease continues to claim lives in China.
As of Monday, the novel coronavirus has killed 910 and sickened over 40,500 globally, with China as the worst-hit country. But at least 3,400 have reportedly recovered. 
As of Monday, the DOH has probed a total of 314 patients for possible novel coronavirus infection. A total of 261 patients under investigation are still admitted to hospitals, while 50 have been discharged. 
Here is the breakdown of patients under investigation per region:

Ilocos Region - 3
Cagayan Valley - 13 
Cordillera Administrative Region - 7
Central Luzon - 41
Metro Manila - 115

Only one person died due to the novel coronavirus in the Philippines, but it marked the first death due to the virus outside China. Two other patients under investigation, who both tested negative for the virus, died due to other illnesses, 
The Philippine government has imposed a temporary travel ban to mainland China and the special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau in an effort to curb the spread of the virus.
Some 30 Filipinos from Hubei province, the epicenter of the outbreak, were also repatriated on Sunday, February 9, and are currently under quarantine in New Clark City in Capas, Tarlac. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – Four more Filipinos aboard a cruise ship quarantined off Yokohama, Japan, tested positive for the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).
""The 4 Filipinos, who are all crew members, are among the 6 newly confirmed cases of the virus since the vessel was docked...on February 4,"" the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) said in a statement on Monday, February 10.
The total number of infected Filipinos on the Diamond Princess cruise ship is now at 5, with one other crew member earlier confirmed to have the virus. They are being treated in hospitals in Japan.
Dozens of other people aboard the Diamond Princess have also tested positive for 2019-nCoV.
The Japanese government quarantined the cruise ship after an 80-year-old passenger who departed from Hong Kong was found to have the virus. The ship, carrying some 3,700 passengers and crew, is anchored off a pier in the Kanagawa Prefecture capital.
The DFA earlier said 538 Filipinos were onboard the Diamond Princess.
The agency again assured the public that the Philippine embassy in Tokyo is ""closely coordinating with Japanese authorities, and is in constant communication with the Filipinos still onboard [the cruise ship], to provide them all possible assistance.""
As of Monday morning, the novel coronavirus has killed 908 people and infected over 40,000 people across 26 countries.

MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – Labor Secretary Silvestre Bello III said that financial and employment assistance will be readily available for overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) repatriated from novel coronavirus-hit areas such as China, Hong Kong, and Macau. 
Bello said the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) is ""ready with its reintegration program,"" which will consist of immediate financial assistance, as well as help with employment and livelihood opportunities. 
Repatriated OFWs will receive at least P20,000 from DOLE. ""When they come here, no questions asked, as long as they're an active member of the Overseas Workers Welfare Administration, we give financial assistance,"" Bello said.  
The labor secretary added that repatriated OFWs who choose to remain in the Philippines will get livelihood assistance from DOLE. The labor department will also assist those who end up seeking jobs abroad anew.
""We have been busy establishing labor relations with countries such as Canada, Russia, Czechoslovakia, Croatia, even China (for this purpose),"" Bello said. 
OFW parents can also apply for scholarships for their children. ""This is a long-term assistance,"" the labor chief added. 
So far, a total of 30 Filipinos have been repatriated from Hubei province in China, the epicenter of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak. 
They are now under a 14-day quarantine period at the Athletes' Village in New Clark City. None of them showed symptoms of the 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease, according to the Department of Health (DOH).  
It remains unclear whether there will be a second batch of OFWs to be repatriated and quarantined, but the Department of Foreign Affairs said it would be ready to assist them should they express interest in returning to the Philippines. 
The interagency task force on emerging infectious diseases led by the DOH is also mulling the expansion of the novel coronavirus travel ban from just mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau, to include Taiwan.
According to Bello, there are at least 120,000 documented OFWs in Taiwan.
""You can expect to add maybe another 20,000 of undocumented OFWs,"" he said. 
The DOH said the the decision will be finalized Monday, February 10, after a meeting of the task force. 
Under the current ban, all non-Filipinos traveling from China and its special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau are barred from entering the country. Travelers coming from transit points in Hong Kong are covered by the travel ban as well. Likewise, Filipinos are barred from traveling to China, Hong Kong, and Macau. 
DOLE had already said OFWs affected by the travel ban will be given P10,000, as well as assistance with accommodation and transportation from the government. The same benefits would be extended to OFWs affected by a travel ban to Taiwan, if imposed. 
Bello said that as of Monday, there are about 3,500 returning OFWs stranded in the Philippines due to the travel ban. He said that the number could rise to as high as 10,000 to 15,000. 
Department of Foreign Affairs Undersecretary Ernesto Abella said officials will reach out to the employers of the affected Filipinos to explain the government's ban.
""The consulates through POLO (Philippine Overseas Labor Office) will contact their employers and explain the situation to them,"" he said.
So far, the Philippines has 3 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus. They are imported cases, the patients having traveled from China. One of them died, one is recovering in a hospital, and the other already tested negative for the virus after a second round of tests.

MANILA, Philippines (5th UPDATE) Thirty Filipinos returned from China’s Hubei province, the epicenter of an outbreak of the deadly novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), are now back in the Philippines on Sunday morning, February 9.  
In a press statement, the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) said the repatriated Filipinos on the chartered flight which ""landed at the Haribon Hangar in Clark Air Base included 29 adults and one infant.""
Also quarantined are two individuals from the Philippine consulate in China who handled the repatriates' documents, said the Department of Health (DOH).

The DFA called for the repatriation of Filipinos in China on January 28.
However, only 30 returned to the Philippines, from the earlier announced 56, because of some circumstances on the ground.
One family, said the DFA, ""had a change of heart."" Some Filipinos there also cited the government's travel restrictions on flying back to China as their reason for staying behind, added the DFA.
Asked if there would be a 2nd batch of repatriates, the DFA said it depends on the demand. ""Also, please be reminded that the repatriation was organized mainly for the Filipinos and their families in Wuhan or Hubei because of the existing lockdown where they couldn’t move even if they wanted to.""
Levels of screening
In a separate statement, the DOH explained that the repatriates underwent 3 levels of screening before they were able to fly back home:

Only asymptomatic individuals, or those who do not show symptoms, were allowed to board.
During the flight, they were closely monitored for any symptoms.
Upon landing, they were checked again for symptoms.

Officials from the DFA and the DOH earlier said the 30 would be brought to the New Clark City Athletes’ Village and will be quarantined for 14 days, alongside the team assigned to repatriate them. 
Health Undersecretary Gerardo Bayugo said in a briefing on Sunday afternoon that ""no contamination"" happened and no one showed symptoms at the airport.
""So all the people who were repatriated are now safe and resting in the quarantine facilities in New Clark City,"" he said.
The DOH Central Luzon Center for Health Development has declared code blue for hospitals and health facilities in the region to immediately address medical needs of the repatriated Filipinos.
""If an individual, during his or her stay in the quarantine facility, suddenly shows signs and symptoms, the DOH had deployed medical teams to immediately assess and facilitate transfer to [a] hospital for close monitoring,"" added the DOH.
How the quarantine will work
Upon landing, the repatriates disembarked at the hangar, and not the passenger area, of the Clark International Airport. They will be transferred directly to the quarantine facilities at the Athletes’ Village.
There, they will each be given their own room. Medical staff will be on hand round the clock to monitor their health. Support staff will mostly be working in a separate building from the repatriates in quarantine.
The repatriates will be allowed to use mobile phones mainly to stay in touch with their families and relatives. The facility will have Wi-Fi.
The team of government representatives left Clark at 10:15 pm on Saturday, February 8, on a chartered flight from the Royal Air Charter Service, arriving in Wuhan Tianhe International Airport early morning on February 9.
In a statement on Sunday, Presidential Spokesperson Salvador Panelo said the safety of Filipinos here and abroad ""continues to be the paramount concern"" of the government.
""Let us pray for our fellow countrymen, as well as [for] the members of the repatriation team...that they do not show any symptom of having caught the virus,"" he added. – with reports from Janella Paris and Sofia Tomacruz/Rappler.com "

Of the 3 confirmed 2019-nCoV cases, the first patient, a Chinese woman, already tested negative for the virus after the most recent tests by the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine. The DOH said she was well and no longer showed symptoms.
The second patient, the first patient’s partner who traveled with her to the Philippines from Wuhan, China, died of complications due to the novel coronavirus. His was the first death due to the virus outside China.
The third patient has since returned to China after a second round of tests showed her negative for 2019-nCoV.
Outside the Philippines, two Filipinos were reported to have contracted 2019-nCov: one is based in Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates, and the other, a crew member of a Japanese cruise ship.
On Saturday night, the Philippine government sent a chartered flight to Wuhan, China, to repatriate at least 26 Filipinos from Hubei province, the epicenter of the 2019-nCoV outbreak.

MANILA, Philippines – The government on Saturday, February 8, started repatriating Filipinos from China’s Hubei province, the epicenter of the outbreak of the deadly novel coronavirus.
The first batch of at least 26 repatriates are expected to arrive at Clark International Airport in Pampanga at around 5 am on Sunday, February 9, and will then be brought to the New Clark City Athletes’ Village where they will be quarantined for 14 days, officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) and the Department of Health (DOH) said in a media briefing on Saturday evening.
A team of 8 representatives from the government were to depart from Clark at 10:15 pm on Saturday on board a chartered flight from the Royal Air Charter Service, and were expected to arrive at the Wuhan Tianhe International Airport at 1:15 am on Sunday.
The team consists of 3 officials from the DFA Office of the Undersecretary for Migrant Workers’ Affairs (OUMWA), and two doctors, two nurses, and one medical technologist from the DOH.
They will assist the repatriates and give them medical screenings during the 3-hour flight back to Clark onboard the same chartered plane.
Two officials from the Philippine Consulate General in Shanghai, China, accompanied the repatriates while waiting at the airport in Wuhan.
The members of the repatriation team from the DFA and DOH, and the flight crew will also be subjected to the 14-day quarantine, the officials said.
There were more than 40 people on the repatriation flight’s manifest but only 26 of them were at the airport as of 8 pm on Saturday, when the officials gave the media briefing. Only 10 more were expected to show up, but the repatriation team “will wait until the last minute,” said DFA-OUMWA Undersecretary Sarah Lou Arriola.
The others may have decided to stay behind or could not make the 10-hour trip to the airport in Wuhan, Hubei’s capital city. Still others may have problems with their visas or were caught up in cases that prevent them from exiting China, Arriola added.
The repatriates will be monitored throughout the flight home and be subjected to 3 levels of medical screenings, said DOH Undersecretary Dr. Gerardo Bayugo.
Upon landing, the repatriates will disembark at the hangar, not the passenger area, of the Clark International Airport. They will then be transferred directly to the quarantine facilities at the Athletes’ Village.
There, they will each be given their own room. Medical staff will be on hand round the clock to monitor their health. Support staff will mostly be working in a separate building from the repatriates in quarantine.
The repatriates will be allowed to use mobile phones mainly to stay in touch with their families and relatives. The facility will have WiFi connection.
Among the repatriates is an infant, Arriola said. Fearing stigma, they asked the DFA not to disclose their identities to the public.
The Philippines has had 3 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus, of whom one died on February 1. Philippine officials have so far placed a total of 267 people under a probe for the virus.
At least 722 people have died from the virus in China while more than 34,000 have been infected, according to the latest official figures.

PANIC BUYING. People look at the empty shelves at a local supermarket in Singapore after panic buying swept through the city after the government raised the alert level for a deadly novel coronavirus in Singapore on February 8. Photo by Roslan Rahman/AFP 
SINGAPORE – Philippine Ambassador Joseph Yap urged Filipinos to stay calm but vigilant after Singapore raised its disease alert level a notch higher to “code orange” due to the novel coronavirus threat.
“My personal appeal to all our kababayans (countrymen) is to stay calm, do not panic, but be vigilant. It is likely that the spread of the virus will get worse before it gets better,” Yap told Rappler on Saturday, February 8.
Yap said around 200,000 Filipinos work in Singapore – 40% as household service workers and 60% as service workers and professionals.
“I would like to emphasize that code orange encourages us to cancel or defer large-scale gatherings, avoid crowded places, and adopt heightened measures to prevent infection. Let us all do our share and contribute to the overall efforts of the Singapore government to address the problem,” the ambassador added.
Code orange refers to the 3rd highest level in Singapore’s 4-tier color-coded system for disease outbreaks, which Singapore developed after it battled the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003.
Under the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (Dorscon) of Singapore, code orange means that “the disease is severe and spreads easily from person to person, but the disease has not spread widely in Singapore and is being contained.”
Excluding the 64 novel coronavirus cases aboard a Japanese cruise ship, Singapore has the highest number of novel coronavirus cases outside China, based on data from the World Health Organization (WHO) as of Friday, February 7. No deaths linked to this virus, however, have been reported in Singapore.
China has at least 31,211 of the 31,481 novel coronavirus cases around the world. At least 637 people have died in China due to the novel coronavirus, while one has died in the Philippines.
Panic buying in Singapore
Singapore’s declaration of code orange on Friday prompted locals to rush to groceries and hoard vitamins, sanitizers, tissue papers, and instant noodles just hours after the announcement.
Many Singaporeans compared the panic buying to the “zombie apocalypse,” which, according to them, is typical of their “kiasu” culture – a fear of losing out in this highly-competitive country.
The panic buying worried the Singaporean government enough to issue an advisory against it on Friday. “Be responsible and do not hoard items. Panic and over-buying supplies will deprive others who really need these things,” the Singaporean government said.
In a video message on Saturday, Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong warned Singaporeans: “Fear can do more harm than the virus itself. It can make us panic, or do things which make matters worse, like circulating rumours online, hoarding face masks or food, or blaming particular groups for the outbreak.”

Singapore raised Dorscon code orange after a few of the 33 novel coronavirus positive cases in the country have been found to have neither links to previous coronavirus cases nor recent travels to China.
Does code orange mean the Philippines will also regulate travel by Filipinos to and from Singapore, as the Philippines did with mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau? The Philippines recently banned Filipinos from traveling to mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau, while requiring Filipinos coming from these areas to quarantine themselves for 14 days.
Yap said the embassy defers to the Philippine national government on any possible travel ban to and from Singapore.
“However, if our opinion is requested by Manila since we are more aware of the situation here in Singapore, we would suggest that there is no need for a travel advisory at this time. While there is some community spread of the virus, the spread of the virus is still very limited at 33 as of last count, and the well-organized efforts of the Singapore government to contain it, which to me are highly remarkable, should minimize the chances of widespread infection,” Yap said.
Read our full Q and A with the ambassador below:
RAPPLER: How prepared is the embassy to deal with possible coronavirus cases among the Filipinos here in Singapore?
AMBASSADOR YAP: The best preparation we are doing is basically information drive, that is to ensure that the reminders and advisories of both our government and the host country on preventive measures are properly cascaded to all Filipinos in Singapore.
Every day, the Ministry of Health (MOH) of Singapore gives updates on the status of the host government’s efforts to contain the spread of the virus. We are encouraging all our kababayans here in Singapore to do their share by keeping themselves updated and by doing their part to contribute to the overall efforts to stop the spread.
The Embassy issues regular advisories and updates to the Filipino community through its website and facebook page.
RAPPLER: What coordination is the Philippine embassy here making, if any, with the Singaporean government to protect our Filipino workers here, especially domestic helpers?
AMBASSADOR YAP: I share your particular interest in the safety of our domestic workers. But remember that the virus does not discriminate against anybody. so our reminders are directed to all our kababayans here in Singapore.
Before the Ministry of Health convened a meeting with the members of the diplomatic corps last Wednesday, we already made arrangements with them to inform us immediately if any Filipino national is confined for the 201-nCoV infection. I personally met with a Ministry official on 3 February to formally convey our request and get some updates on Singapore’s efforts to contain the spread of the virus and establish lines of communication.
The reminders and guidelines issued by the Ministry of Health of Singapore are applicable to all foreign workers, Filipinos included: observance of good personal hygiene, being socially responsible, monitoring of personal health condition, and now deferment or cancellation of large-scale events.
The Embassy has also coordinated with the MOH to ensure that our front line Filipino medical personnel are properly protected in the performance of their work. We have received the assurance of MOH that all necessary precautions and protocols are in place to protect all medical staff.
Another request we conveyed to the Ministry of Health is to inform us (Philippine Embassy) immediately if any Filipino national has been infected and confined so that our Assistance to Nationals SOP can be activated, which involves coordination with the family of the infected individual and monitoring of his or her health condition.
We will respond according to the needs of the affected individual and in coordination with the host country.
Internally, the Embassy has already organized ourselves. We have established a Task Force that is in charge of the action plans to deal with the problem.
RAPPLER: Is the Philippine government considering a travel ban to and from Singapore given the declaration of code orange? Why or why not?
AMBASSADOR YAP: Every country makes a decision on such a matter on the basis of its national interest. We leave it up to our national government officials to make a decision on this. However, if our opinion is requested by Manila since we are more aware of the situation here in Singapore, we would suggest that there is no need for a travel advisory at this time. While there is some community spread of the virus, the spread of the virus is still very limited at 33 as of last count, and the well-organized efforts of the Singapore government to contain it, which to me are highly remarkable, should minimize the chances of widespread infection. Therefore, the current situation does not require such an advisory at this time.
RAPPLER: What safety tips or perhaps words of assurance can you give our kababayans as Singapore is under code orange?
YAP: My personal appeal to all our kababayans is to stay calm, do not panic but be vigilant. It is likely that the spread of the virus will get worse before it gets better. The Singapore Government and the MOH are on top of the situation. They have a multi-ministry task force that is coordinating the response of Singapore to this virus. They are very well organized and they have the added advantage of having gone through the SARs outbreak.
Let us religiously observe the guidelines of the host government, particularly in relation to the monitoring of our personal health, good personal hygiene and tips on how to avoid getting the virus.
I would like to emphasize that code orange encourages us to cancel or defer large-scale gatherings, avoid crowded places, and adopt heightened measures to prevent infection. Let us all do our share and contribute to the overall efforts of the Singapore government to address the problem
To those who want to know more about the overall picture of the virus spread in Singapore, we encourage you to visit the MOH website: www.moh.og.sg or you can email us (atnsgpe@gmail.com) or you call us through our hotline: 9072 2797

MANILA, Philippines – Zambales Governor Hermogenes Ebdane said provincial health officials were currently monitoring a patient who shared he had traveled together with two patients in the Philippines earlier confirmed to have the 2019 novel coronavirus.
In a statement, Ebdane said the patient ""voluntarily reached out to the DOH [Department of Health], divulging a history of travel together with the two Chinese patients who were tested and confirmed to be positive for the virus.""
The patient has been confined at the Ramon Magsaysay Memorial Hospital since Thursday, February 6, and was among persons under Investigation by health officials.
Ebdane said that the patient, who remained in isolation, was assessed to be ""well and stable, exhibiting no pertinent symptoms such as fever, cough, or difficulty breathing.""
He added the hospital sent the patient's specimen samples to the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine to confirm if the patient had the coronavirus.
The latest in the Philippines. Philippine authorities said they were monitoring 215 persons for the novel coronavirus as Saturday, February 8. 
So far, the Department of Health has confirmed 3 cases of the novel coronavirus in the Philippines, including the first death outside China – a 44-year-old Chinese man who traveled to the Philippines from Wuhan. The man was the country's second confirmed case of 2019-nCoV, and a companion of the first patient, a 38-year-old Chinese woman.
As of Saturday morning, February 8, the novel coronavirus has killed 720 people and infected over 34,000 people across 26 countries.

AKLAN, Philippines – A multi-agency task force has put in place strict and intensified border checkpoints when entering Boracay Island in an effort to prevent the spread of the 2019 novel coronavirus.
Acting Malay town mayor Frolibar Bautista asked law enforcement agencies and health personnel to enforce travel restrictions on visitors who have recently travelled to China, Macau and Hong Kong.
There are no longer direct flights from Wuhan, China and other cities in mainland China to Kalibo International Airport, but authorities will continue to expand health screenings of travelers, not only in local airports.
In Executive Order No. 004 series of 2020 issued on Thursday, February 6, Bautista suspended the entry of all travelers with travel history from China and its special administrative regions for the past 14 days.
The Philippine National Police, Philippine Army, Philippine Coast Guard, Bureau of Immigration and the Bureau of Quarantine are also directed to coordinate with the Malay Municipal Health Office (MHO) and Municipal Tourism Office to check incoming travellers at Malay’s seaports, airport and roads.
What to expect. On February 7, Friday, 3 border checkpoints, located within the two kilometer radius of Caticlan port, were set up in the barangays of Union (Nabas) and Caticlan (Malay) near Nabas-Malay boundary, in barangay Dumlog in mainland Malay and Sitio Bacolod in Barangay Caticlan to monitor and identify people who may have coronavirus symptoms.
The new measure to operate border checkpoints in all entry points to Malay, Aklan and Boracay Island would be the first line of defense against individuals who experienced flu-like symptoms of the contagious disease.
Meanwhile, Foreigners and local tourists arriving through Kalibo and Caticlan airports, northern Antique and Iloilo, ports of Caticlan and Alegria (Buruanga) via roll-on, roll-off vessels from Batangas and Mindoro, and motorized pumpboats from Romblon would also be screened for signs of fever and cough.
Aside from this, handheld thermometers were also operational in border checkpoints where inbound travelers to Boracay Island would be required to present their passports for verification. Health personnel and law enforcers were also wearing surgical face masks for their protection.
If a traveller shows symptoms, MHO workers will perform a more detailed medical assessment, and the traveler is taken to a hospital for further care.
No coronavirus cases. So far, there have been no reported coronavirus cases in Malay, Aklan and Boracay Island, according to task force deputy information manager Madel Joy Tayco.
The local task force on coronavirus said some 180 persons were under monitoring (PUMS) in Boracay Island as of February 7.
MHO and the task force have been cooperating closely with hotels and establishments to ensure public safety and health of residents and other visitors, and have been keeping a close watch on PUMs in the island.
Tayco also reiterated the importance of proper hygiene and hand washing to prevent infection of coronavirus which has caused deaths and illnesses worldwide. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – The Department of Health (DOH) is now probing 215 persons for the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in the Philippines as of Friday noon, February 7.
The latest figure was higher than the 178 reported the previous day, February 6. Of the 215, 185 are admitted to hospitals, 17 have been discharged, while 3 have died, two of whom due to causes other than the novel coronavirus. 
Health Undersecretary Eric Domingo said that the latest death of a patient under investigation was confirmed Thursday, February 6.
The patient, a Chinese male whose age was not disclosed, died of ""underlying restrictive lung disease."" The DOH had earlier reported the death of a patient under investigation, but for preexisting medical conditions unrelated to the novel coronavirus (READ: TIMELINE: The novel coronavirus epidemic) 
Of the 215 patients, a total of 48 already tested negative for the virus. At least 127 test results are still pending as of this posting. 
So far, there are 3 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus in the country.
The first patient already tested negative for the novel coronavirus in the latest round of tests of the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine, but another test with negative results is needed before she can be discharged from the hospital. Domingo said she is well and no longer showing symptoms. 
The second patient, her partner who traveled with her to the Philippines from Wuhan, China, died of complications due to the novel coronavirus. His death marked the first death due to the virus outside China.
The third patient has since returned to China after a second round of tests showed she was already negative for the novel coronavirus.  
Domingo disclosed that 9 patients under investigation have refused to be admitted to hospitals. He said the DOH is working with local authorities to convince them to get admitted.
According to Domingo, some have refused admission due to anxieties over hospital expenses. He said they can rest assured that expenses for the novel coronavirus treatment will be shouldered by the government. 
The increase in the number of patients under investigation came after the DOH tracked down all 441 contacts of the first two confirmed cases. The couple, who was traveling from Wuhan, China, went to Cebu and Dumaguete City before seeking medical help in Manila. 
Of the 441 contacts, 32 are included in the 215 being probed by the DOH, while 203 are under home quarantine as they showed no symptoms. 
Domingo said 206 of the contacts have yet to be interviewed by the health department's Epidemiology Bureau due to erroneous contact details. Health officials are coordinating with local authorities in Cebu and Dumaguete City to get in touch with them. 
Below is the breakdown of patients per region:

Ilocos Region - 3
Cagayan - 4

Repatriation efforts
Repatriation efforts for the 45 Filipinos who had expressed desire to be brought home from Hubei province in China are underway, with the Department of Foreign Affairs personnel coordinating with Chinese authorities for the necessary clearance.
Once in the Philippines, the returnees will be quarantined in the Athletes' Village in New Clark City in Capas, Tarlac. 
They are expected to arrive on Sunday morning, February 9, but the date is not final as the Philippines has yet to get clearance from the Chinese government for repatriation. 
Efforts of the government's interagency task force on the novel coronavirus have also been met with resistance from the Capas local government, who said they were not consulted by the agencies involved that the quarantine area will be in their community. 
""DOH did not at all involve Capas LGU in its last-minute decision for New Clark City to be used as quarantine zone,"" Capas Mayor Reynaldo Catacutan said in a statement Friday.
But in an interview with CNN Philippines, the town's vice mayor admitted that the New Clark City is under the jurisdiction of the Bases Conversion and Development Authority, which offered the facility to the DOH for use in its quarantine procedure. 
Domingo said the DOH has since reached out to the local government of Capas. He said that repatriates will be isolated and not affect any member of the community. 
He reiterated that Filipinos who are cleared by the Chinese government for repatriation will first undergo screening by Chinese health officials before boarding the chartered plane that will take them to Clark. They will then undergo another screening by DOH personnel before takeoff. If they show symptoms in China, they will be sent to Chinese health facilities for treatment.

,"February 06, 2020",nCov,"Camiguin restricts entry of travelers from China, Hong Kong, Macau over coronavirus threat",Bobby Lagsa,"
 
CAGAYAN DE ORO, Philippines – Camiguin Island will now restrict the entry of foreign tourists with travel history to China, Hong Kong, and Macau in the last 3 months as a precautionary measure against the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). 
With summer just around the corner, Camiguin is expecting an influx of tourists, from 50,000 per month to a peak of 80,000 during Holy Week.
Camiguin Governor Jurdin Jesus Romualdo on January 31 issued Executive Order (EO) No. 5, which requires every tourist to disclose their travel history in the last 3 months prior to their arrival in the island.
The EO was issued days earlier than the national government's expanded ban on travelers from the 3 countries.
Tourists from other countries who merely had a layover in China, Hong Kong, and Macau will also not be allowed to enter the island. According to the governor, they simply followed the President's order not to allow even those with a layover in China to enter the country.
Romualdo said that they have deployed screeners in Camiguin Airport and two ports to individually interview foreign tourists about their travel history.
In January, a tourist in the island was put in isolation and considered a person under investigation for the novel coronavirus. The tourist tested negative for the virus.
There were at least 130 Chinese tourists in Camiguin in the last week of January.
""The province of Camiguin is one of the tourist destinations in the Philippines, making the introduction of the disease in the province a high probability,"" Romualdo said.
He said they cannot take chances in allowing tourists with travel history to the 3 countries.
The island province also created a novel coronavirus task force to implement measures that will prevent the virus from entering the island.
""It is important that precautionary measures and protocol are established to monitor the presence of the disease and make a timely response if it arises,"" Romualdo said.
Romualdo said they instructed and trained hotel staff to report tourists suspected to have the novel coronavirus to the Camiguin Provincial Health Office and the Camiguin General Hospital. They also asked hotels to refund accommodation bookings made by Chinese tourists even before coming to the island.
""We have met with hotel operators and asked for their cooperation,"" Romualdo said.
EO covers residents, too
The EO also covers residents in the island who have travel history to China, Hong Kong, and Macau.
""This requirement is also mandatory to every resident of Camiguin who has [traveled] to places where [the] novel coronavirus has been proven to exist,"" the EO stated.
It requires residents with travel history to undergo a medical check-up.
Romualdo said the government can prosecute any person found to have willfully hidden such required information when demanded. The person shall be subject to investigation and applicable criminal prosecution.
Meanwhile in Cagayan de Oro City, Mayor Oscar Moreno thumbed down a proposal to put a business park on lockdown following hearsay of Chinese residents who supposedly have the novel coronavirus.
Earlier this week, Councilor George Goking proposed that the city's 2019-nCoV task force order a lockdown on the Alwana Business Park in Barangay Cugman. Some Chinese citizens working in Cagayan de Oro City are living in the business park's residential buildings.
A fake news circulated this week that there was a Chinese who died in one of the hotels because of the novel coronavirus. The City Health Office and the Department of Health conducted an inspection and found nothing.
""The task force did not really push through with the idea due to legal implications,"" Goking told reporters here.
Goking said that he would request it if the Alwana Business Park management refuses to cooperate with government agencies who may be conducting an ocular inspection there.
Moreno said he will not be restricting the movement of people and vehicles in and out of the complex just because Chinese nationals are living there.
""Just because they are Chinese, [does not mean] we have to look at them differently,"" Moreno said in a radio interview.
""You don't order [a] lockdown simply because of the race issue. It's not doable. What we need is simply communication, and, of course, they have been very cooperative. Let's not jump to conclusions just because they're Chinese."" Moreno added.
The novel coronavirus that originated from Wuhan, China, has so far killed 564 and sickened over 28,000 people across the country and worldwide. The World Health Organization already declared an international emergency over the virus.

MANILA, Philippines – The Department of Health (DOH) on Thursday, February 6, confirmed that the 45 Filipinos to be repatriated from Hubei province in China – the epicenter of the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak – will be quarantined in New Clark City's Athletes' Village in Tarlac. 
Health Secretary Francisco Duque III inspected the facility on Thursday morning and said that the place is ready to house the returning Filipinos, who are expected to arrive early Sunday, February 9.
Upon arrival, the overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) from Hubei will immediately be counted as patients under investigation, of which there are 178 as of Thursday. (READ: 'Novel coronavirus' or 2019 nCoV: What we know so far)
Two buildings in New Clark City, which was used during the 2019 Southeast Asian Games, will be used for quarantine – one for asymptomatic patients and the other for those who develop symptoms.
There will also be a polyclinic in the facility, where returnees who develop symptoms throughout the 14-day quarantine period will be brought and treated. The two buildings will be cordoned off from the rest of New Clark City, according to Duque. 
Contact with the outside world will be minimal, Duque said. Patients will only be allowed to communicate with their families over the internet. 
The health chief also said that medical staff from 5 nearby hospitals will alternate shifts to tend to the returnees. 
""We will be providing the needed medical logistics including hygiene kits, disinfectant solutions, transportation, and other things that will be needed in the quarantine process,"" he added.  
How repatriation will work: According to Foreign Affairs Undersecretary Brigido Dulay, Filipinos who are cleared by the Chinese government for repatriation will first undergo screening by Chinese health officials before boarding the chartered plane that will take them to Clark. 
If they are found with symptoms by Chinese health officials, they will not be allowed to come back home to the Philippines. Instead, they will be brought to hospitals in China for treatment and observation. 
If they don't show any symptoms, they will be allowed to board the plane, where 5 DOH personnel will check them for symptoms a second time. If they are absolutely not symptomatic, they will be allowed to fly home to the Philippines. Otherwise, they will be treated in Chinese health facilities.
Upon arrival in Clark, they will again be checked for symptoms. Those who have fever, coughs, and colds will immediately be brought to the facility's polyclinic and be isolated from the rest of the returnees who show no symptoms. 
According to Dulay, a team from the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) in Wuhan, China, is already working with Chinese authorities to secure the necessary permits for the repatriation.  
""Today we already have our DFA team inside Wuhan City and they are there working on the ground preparing for the repatriation of our OFWs. They are on the ground and they're taking the risk,"" Dulay said.  
He also revealed that 4 of the 45 Filipinos who want to be repatriated have problems with their immigration status, which means it remains uncertain if they will be able to come home on Sunday. 
After the quarantine period, the returning OFWs will be assisted by the Overseas Workers Welfare Authority for employment concerns, the DOH and the DFA said.
The novel coronavirus that originated from Wuhan, China, has so far killed 564 and sickened over 28,000 people across the country and worldwide. The World Health Organization already declared an international emergency over the virus.

LEGAZPI CITY, Philippines – Albay's famed Magayon Festival has joined the list of the country's tourist-magnet events scrapped because of health fears caused by the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).
Albay Governor Al Francis Bichara announced the cancellation of the month-long Magayon Festival Wednesday, February 5, during a meeting with all department heads of the provincial government at the Governor's Guest House.
The Magayon Festival is held every April in honor of the Bicol Region's iconic Mount Mayon.
""We need to avoid events that will draw in crowds,"" said Dorothy Colle, provincial tourism officer.
As of this posting, there are still no recorded incidents of nCoV infections in the Bicol Region.
In the same meeting, Bichara approved Albay's purchase of 4 thermal scanners to identify people with fever and other flu-like symptoms.
These thermal scanners will be placed at the Legazpi City Domestic Airport, Legazpi City Grand Bus terminal, malls and a a still unspecified public place.
The Provincial Government of Albay  advised the public to practice proper hygiene to prevent the spread of  infections. It also advised anyone showing symptoms of the virus such as coughing, sneezing, having hard time to breathe and respiratory ailment, toseek medical doctors and to do self-quarantine.
Isolation hospitals
The Department of Health in Bicol designated 3 government hospitals to be used in case of an nCoV outbreak in the province. These are the Bicol Regional Training and Teaching Hospital in Albay, Bicol Medical Center in Naga City and Bicol Sanitarium in Cabusao, Camarines Sur.
Dr. Ernie Vera, DOH Bicol director, said during the Regional Disaster Risk Reduction Management Council meeting held at the Office of Civil Defense Wednesday, that all referrals for suspected nCov patients will be referred to these hospitals.
The BRRTH, BMC and Bicol Sanitarium hospitals passed through the medical examination of Regional Epidemiology and Surveillance Unit (RESU) of Department of Health regional office here.
Vera said that BRTTH would admit persons under investigation (PUIs) for the virus from the provinces of Albay, Sorsogon, Masbate and Catanduanes; while the Bicol Medical Center will take PUIs coming from the provinces of Camarines Sur and Camarines Norte.
The Bicol Sanitarium would be the alternative facility in case of th high number of PUIs in the two identified government referral hospitals.

MANILA, Philippines – Rapid test kits that could expedite the process of confirming 2019 novel coronavirus cases in the Philippines need to be validated first by the World Health Organization (WHO) before use, the Department of Health (DOH) said.
As of Wednesday, February 5, the WHO has not validated a single rapid test kit for use of laboratories, according to Health Undersecretary Eric Domingo. This effectively means that no test kit has yet been approved by the Philippines' Food and Drug Administration (FDA). 
""There are actually test kits available, you can probably buy them online, but the WHO has not yet validated any test kit,"" Domingo said. 
Right now, the WHO-approved protocol is ""still the long laboratory test"" done by the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM), according to the health official. 
Currently, the RITM is running tests with primers from a referral laboratory in Japan, of which it has a limited supply. The DOH had initially sent samples to a referral laboratory in Australia to confirm the presence of the novel coronavirus – a process that took more than 48 hours.
With testing capacities in place locally, results can be expected within 24 to 48 hours. Rapid test kits would expedite the process of confirming novel coronavirus cases, making it more efficient for the government to perform disease detection.
""WHO told us that they're validating a test kit right now, and it might take one to two weeks before they come up with the recommendation,"" Domingo added. 
Scientists at the University of the Philippines' (UP) National Institutes of Health said on Tuesday, February 4, that they had developed test kits for the novel coronavirus and would release them next week to the RITM for validation. 
Domingo said that WHO also told the UP institute to send them the kits for validation. ""Once it's validated and it is very clear that it is accurate, then it can be used,"" Domingo said. 
While there are no commercial test kits cleared by the FDA for use as of Wednesday, infectious disease expert Edsel Salvana said that the FDA can fast-track the verification of such products in times of health emergencies.
Salvana also stressed that it is important for the RITM to test the validity of such kits first to ensure their efficacy.
""We don't want false positive and false negative results,"" he said. 
More persons in the Philippines are expected to be probed for the novel coronavirus after the DOH expanded its criteria for monitoring. 
It had initially screened only people coming from Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the outbreak, but has since expanded it to cover the rest of China. The DOH is now monitoring even asymptomatic people traveling from China.  
As of Wednesday noon, February 5, there are 133 patients under investigation for the novel coronavirus, 3 of whom tested positive. The virus has killed 492 and infected 23,939 across China and 24 other countries. (READ: First nCoV-related death outside China as patient dies in PH)

She added that a number of PHAP partner companies in Southeast Asia have commercially available test kits that have passed regulations in their own countries, though she did not reveal what these companies were and how many. 
She said, however, that PHAP would make sure that prospective test kits go through proper FDA screenings before being used locally. 
As testing capacities are being improved, medical experts like Edralin and Salvana echoed advisories from the DOH and WHO to remain calm and practice proper hygiene.

The Japanese government quarantined the Diamond Princess cruise ship after an 80-year-old passenger who departed from Hong Kong tested positive for 2019-nCoV.
The ship, carrying some 3,700 passengers, was prevented from sailing and is anchored off a pier in the Kanagawa Prefecture capital.
The Japanese Health Ministry said 10 individuals were later found to be infected, including 9 passengers and a crew member. All would be transferred to a health care facility for treatment.
Carnival Japan Incorporated, operator of the Diamond Princess, said the 10 infected include 3 Japanese, 3 Chinese, 2 Australians, an American, and a Filipino.
The DFA confirmed a Filipino was indeed among those who tested positive for the novel coronavirus. This marked the first confirmed case of 2019-nCoV in a Filipino.
The DFA gave assurances that the Philippine embassy in Tokyo is in ""constant communication"" with the remaining Filipinos on the ship.
The agency added that it is closely coordinating with Japanese authorities to provide all possible assistance to the Filipinos.
""The Philippine embassy in Tokyo is closely and actively monitoring the welfare of Filipinos onboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which is currently docked off the port of Yokohama, Japan, under a quarantine implemented by the Japanese government,"" the DFA said.
As of Wednesday morning, the novel coronavirus has killed 492 people and infected over 23,000 people across 25 countries.
The World Health Organization declared a global health emergency over the outbreak, which has prompted countries such as the Philippines and the United States to impose strict travel restrictions. – with reports from Kyodo News/Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – The provinces of Pampanga and Iloilo designated their respective isolation facilities Wednesday, February 5, in preparation for the possibility of a 2019 novel corona virus (nCoV) outbreak in the areas. 
In Pampanga, the  Bureau of Quarantine of the Clark International Airport (CRK) said the provincial government provided additional personnel to help monitor arrivals. The BOQ would train the new manpower on how to identify suspected cases of nCoV from arriving passengers.
Pampanga Governor Dennis Delta Pineda also said they were providing a 40-foot aluminum container van that would  be used as an isolation area for suspected nCoV 2019 positive passengers going through Clark airport.
Mabalacat City Mayor Crisostomo Garbo said they would  provide two ambulances for the Clark airport.
Iloilo isolation hospitals
Meanwhile, in Iloilo, the provincial government has designated the Dr. Ricardo Y. Ladrido Memorial District Hospital (DRYLMDH) in Lambunao town as the facility for the confinement of identified persons under investigation (PUI). PUIs are those who are manifesting flu-like symptoms.
Hospital Management Office Chief Dr. Cynthia Cabangal-Ng said DRYLMDH has has 6 isolation units and is capable of providing extension rooms.
“If ever there will be a spillover, we can possibly transfer all patients of Lambunao to other district hospitals. Lambunao will then be dedicated to PUIs only,” she said.
She added that the hospital personnel who will handle the patients will undergo training on self-protection.
But Dr. Cabangan-Ng said the province remains coronavirus-free.
Iloilo Governor Arthur Defensor Jr said the provincial government was also purchasing protective gears for hospital personnel, as well as, additional thermal scanners.
Defensor also appealed for donations of hospital equipment from the private sector. – Rappler.com "

FIGHT VS FAKE NEWS. The police joins the campaign against misinformation on the 2019 novel coronavirus. PNP file photo 
MANILA, Philippines – The Philippine National Police (PNP) is citing a repealed Marcos-era decree in its fight against fake news peddlers in the wake of misinformation and panic amid the global outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).
In a statement on Wednesday, February 5, the PNP announced that they would join the lookout for sources of false information. They cited two laws as basis:

Presidential Decree 90, which bans unlawful rumor-mongering and spreading false information;
Unlawful means of publication and utterances under Article 154 of the Revised Penal Code in relation to Republic Act 10175 or the Anti-Cybercrime Law

Rappler has sought comment on the possible oversight, but the PNP's spokesman has yet to reply as of posting.
The first problem: Presidential Decree 90 has been voided 34 years ago by former president Corazon Aquino after the ouster of the dictatorship of Ferdinand Marcos. “[I]nstead of promoting the said objective, the aforesaid issuances in effect paved the way for violations of the freedom of expression of the people,” Aquino said in Executive Order No. 65, which repealed the Marcos decree.
The second problem: It is unclear whether those who share fake news will be punished too. The Supreme Court has declared as unconstitutional the provision of the Cybercrime Law that punishes aiding and abetting crime, or in this context, sharing fake news.
Justice Secretary Menardo Guevarra did not directlty address questions about this, saying that law enforcers would first need to scout for a “malicious scheme” or “pattern” of the act. – with a report from Lian Buan/Rappler.com

FREEDOM OF SPEECH. Justice Secretary Menardo Guevarra defends his order of investigating 2019-nCoV fake news saying the freedom of speech has limitations. File photo by Angie de Silva/Rappler 
MANILA, Philippines – Justice Secretary Menardo Guevarra on Wednesday, February 5, defended his department order to investigate fake news on the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), saying there are ""limitations to the constitutional right"" to free speech. 
""I expect that freedom of speech issues will be raised, but as lawyers we all know that there are limitations to this constitutional right, including the greater interest of the public,"" Guevarra said in a message exchange with reporters on Wednesday.
Guevarra signed on Tuesday, February 4, Department Order No. 052 that tasked the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) to investigate and prosecute ""alleged deliberate spread of misinformation and fake news"" about the 2019-nCoV, even though there is no law in the Philippines that defines and punishes ""fake news.""
Pressed for a law that would cover this order, Guevarra said that if technology would be used, it would be ""appropriate charges under the Revised Penal Code in relation to the cybercrime prevention law.""
Cybercrime and warrantless arrest
The Supreme Court has declared as unconstitutional the provision of Republic Act No. 10175 or the Cybercrime Prevention Act that punishes aiding and abetting crime, or in this context, sharing fake news.
Guevarra did not categorically answer whether those who share fake news would be punished, saying the NBI ""will scope the field first and see if there's a malicious scheme or pattern somewhere.""
""No further comments for now,"" Guevarra said.
Guevarra was asked whether there is a possibility of a warrantless arrest because Rodel Jayme, the web administrator who was accused of uploading the Bikoy narcolist videos, was arrested without a warrant on the basis of a cybercrime investigation. 
The Department of Justice (DOJ) upheld the warrantless arrest, citing ""hot pursuit."" Jayme was eventually charged of inciting to sedition.
""It will all depend on the factual circumstances,"" said Guevarra.
Free speech
Law professor Ted Te said the department order ""directly contradicts freedom of expression,"" citing the decision of the High Court in Chavez vs Gonzales that declared as unconstitutional a government press release against the publication of the ""Hello, Garci"" tape.
That decision, as in other decisions on free speech, said government regulations that restrict free speech must have a compelling state interest. One of the tests to determine this is the presence of a clear and present danger to the public. 
Guevarra said the clear and present danger is ""causing undue panic and alarm in part, but also undermining government efforts for a unified and coordinated approach to a common threat that affects us all.""
Te said that the DOJ must give the NBI clear guidelines on what to define as fake news.
""The DOJ and the NBI have their own cybercrime experts. I suppose they’ll scope the field first and see if there’s a malicious scheme or pattern somewhere,"" said Guevarra.
Guevarra said ""Malacañang had nothing to do"" with the DOJ order. – Rappler.com "

CORONAVIRUS SCARE. Lawmakers want to augment the Department of Health's budget in 2020 to help buy face masks and protective equipment against the novel coronavirus. File photo by Ben Nabong/Rappler 
MANILA, Philippines – Two ranking lawmakers are now proposing to give at least a P2-billion supplemental budget to the Department of Health (DOH) to purchase surgical masks and personal protective equipment (PPE) amid the ongoing threat of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). 
On Tuesday, February 4, House committee on health chair Angelina Tan filed House Bill (HB) No. 6166 seeking P2.04 billion for the DOH, while House committee on ways and means chair Joey Salceda's HB No. 6177 pegged the amount at P2.24 billion. 
Salceda's HB No. 6177 explicitly said P2.04 billion would primarily be used to buy surgical masks and PPE for the following:

P945,000 for persons under investigation by the DOH
P9.45 million for health care workers
P2.025 billion for the PPE of health care workers
P4.522 million for 40 Filipinos to be repatriated from China

Another P20 million would be allotted for the hazard pay and benefits of epidemiologists on the frontlines of fighting the new disease.
Tan's HB No. 6166 was more general, as its Section 1 states the proposed supplemental budget would be for ""augmenting the budget for the health system response"" of the DOH. 
But in her media statement on Wednesday, February 5, Tan said the P2.04 billion is the ""estimated amount needed to buy additional surgical masks and personal protective equipment over the next 3 months.""
She previously sought just a P1-billion supplemental budget for the DOH to help fight the coronavirus threat.
HB No. 6166 would require the DOH to submit a report to the Senate committees on finance, and health and demography as well as the House committees on appropriations and health to give a detailed account of how the supplemental budget would be used.
But World Health Organization country representative to the Philippines Rabindra Abeyasinghe already said they are not recommending the use of surgical masks for the general public amid the 2019-nCoV scare.
He said it would be ""preferable"" if the masks were instead reserved for high-risk individuals and health workers. 
President Rodrigo Duterte also said the public ""hysteria"" over the new disease is ""not needed,"" though he also said the government is set to procure face masks for Filipinos amid the ongoing shortage in the market.
As of Wednesday afternoon, the Philippines has recorded one death due to 2019-nCoV, the first Chinese to die from the new disease outside of China.
This 44-year-old Chinese man is one of 3 confirmed coronavirus cases in the country along with a 38-year-old woman, with whom he traveled from Wuhan, and a 60-year-old woman, who also came from Wuhan.
The DOH is currently monitoring 133 patients for possible 2019-nCoV.
Globally, the coronavirus has already infected 23,939 people and killed 492.

CORONAVIRUS MONITORING. Background photo by Louie Lapat/Rappler 
KALIBO, Philippines – Around 350 Chinese tourists in Boracay Island are being monitored by a local task force of Malay, Aklan to control the spread of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). 
Deputy task force information manager Madel Joy Tayco said the Chinese nationals arrived in Boracay Island before the government issued a directive for the temporary banning of foreigners and Filipinos coming from China and its special administrative regions of Macau and Hong Kong.
The number of persons for monitoring in Boracay Island has dwindled from a high of 2,000 tourists after direct flights to and from mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau were cancelled. 
“The tourists with travel history to China were cleared by Bureau of Quarantine (BOQ) in local airports...it is now our task to monitor and manage them based on the guidelines of the World Health Organization and Department of Health until they leave Boracay Island,” said Tayco, also working as Nurse II of Municipal Health Office (MHO) of Malay, Aklan. 
Contrary to.media reports, the Chinese tourists are persons for monitoring and not persons under investigation (PUIs) with no flu-like symptoms associated with the Wuhan coronavirus. The disease, as of February 5, has killed at least 490 people.
Tayco clarified the Chinese nationals were closely monitored in their hotels in coordination with hotel nurses and medical team, and not isolated in the island by health authorities.
“The monitoring of these foreigners include the checking of body temperature and other symptoms like difficulty of breathing and cough, which are done twice a day. So far, wala naman silang signs or symptoms,” she stressed.
On January 28, MHO Malay also started an information education dissemination campaign with resorts, hotels, schools, and other establishments to prevent the possible transmission of virus.
“We aim to educate and inform the public in Malay, Aklan, especially Boracay Island about the novel coronavirus and how they could protect themselves,” Tayco added.
As this developed, Provincial Health Officer I Dr. Cornelio Cuachon, Jr. identified Gov. Corazon L. Cabagnot Tourism and Training Center in Old Buswang, Kalibo, Aklan as a temporary holding facility for inbound travelers from China, Macau, and Hong Kong to undergo a 14-day quarantine period.
The Aklan training center was recommended by BOQ and the provincial inter-agency task force. The facility earlier handled 11 Chinese nationals on January 25 to monitor their conditions.
They were spending their vacation in Boracay Island when the Provincial Health Office-Aklan was alerted by DOH after four of them had close contacts with a coronavirus patient in Hong Kong.
The foreigners - 7 adults and 4 children - returned home on January 31 to Chengdu, China via Kalibo International Airport.
As a precautionary measure, BOQ and DOH personnel also conducted mandatory thermal scans of domestic tourists coming from Cebu, Manila and Clark to Kalibo International Airport and Caticlan airport in Malay, Aklan.
Health declaration cards are also collected and checked by health authorities for every incoming travelers. (READ: Philippines confirms 3rd case of novel coronavirus)

""We deem it prudent to avoid situations where the health and safety of our cadets, PMA alumni, and their families are put at risk,"" said Lorenzana.
Magalong, who is a member of PMA Class of 1982 denied there was  lockdown.

MANILA, Philippines (6th UPDATE) – The Department of Health (DOH) on Wednesday, February 5, reported the Philippines’ 3rd confirmed case of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).
Health Undersecretary Eric Domingo said that a 60-year-old woman from Wuhan, China, tested postive for 2019-nCoV. She traveled from Wuhan through Hong Kong and arrived in Cebu on January 20, and headed directly  to Bohol.

Domingo said that on January 22, the woman consulted a private hospital after developing fever and colds, and was admitted to a  hospital in Bohol.
Several samples were taken from the woman on January 23 and January 24. The latter samples were sent to the Victorian Infectious Disease Reference Laboratory in Australia and the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM).
Domingo said that the Victorian Infectious Disease Reference Laboratory sent back the test results on the January 24 samples on January 29, and RITM on January 30 – both came out negative.
With her test result for 2019-nCoV negative, the woman was discharged from the hospital 9 days after admission and was allowed to travel back to China on January 31.
Domingo said that the RITM later ran tests on the first sample taken from the woman on January 23 after it became capable of testing samples for 2019-nCoV. 
Domingo said that on February 3, RITM notified the DOH that the January 23 samples tested positive for 2019-nCoV. This showed that the woman was able to mount immunity against the virus by the time the January 24 samples were taken. 
Asked why it took the DOH two days to report the third confirmed case, Domingo said: ""We found out evening of February 3, and yesterday we were at the Senate. As you well know, the secretary was there the whole day, so we couldn’t have a press conference yesterday."" 
He added that the the DOH's regional office in Central Visayas was immediately notified and that they were able to begin contact tracing on Tuesday, February 4.
""Before we announce it, we make sure the regional office and the local government units already know,"" Domingo said.
The first two 2019-nCoV cases in the country were a couple who traveled to the Philippines from Wuhan, China, the center of the outbreak. The man died on February 1, the first death due to the virus outside China.
133 cases probed
The DOH said it is now probing a total of 133 patients for 2019-nCoV. 
As of February 5, 115 patients are admitted to hospitals, while 16 were discharged but were being contacted by DOH surveillance officers daily for updates on their symptoms. Two patients under investigation have died, one of whom tested negative for the virus and died due to other complications.
The DOH added that 63 of the patients under investigation are Filipinos, 54 are Chinese, and 16 other foreign nationals. Of this number, 32 traveled from Wuhan, China, while others came from Hong Kong and other parts of China.
The DOH also confirmed that health workers are included in the 54 Filipino patients under investigation.

Drilon said the 43-year-old patient, who came from Taiwan, tested negative in the confirmatory test conducted by the RITM.
He said the patient was set to be discharged from the government hospital.
Drilon added that two more persons under investigation were still confined at the hospital's Emerging Infectious Disease Facility, awaiting for the laboratory results from RITM.
In a statement, AirAsia said it was working closely with the government, especially the DOH, after it was confirmed that the Philippines’ 3rd case of 2019-nCoV took an AirAsia flight from Cebu to Shenzhen, China, on January 31.
“AirAsia is ready and willing to provide relevant documents to the DOH, including the flight manifest and available contact details of guests on board the flight, given the urgency of this situation. The operating flight crew have also been quarantined in compliance with the Philippine government’s travel ban,” it said.
“All AirAsia aircraft undergo disinfection procedures according to prescribed protocol,” the airline added.

MISPLACED PRIORITIES? DOH Secretary Francisco Duque lll skipped the House hearing on the novel coronavirus on February 5, 2020 to inspect a quarantine facility in Nueva Ecija. File photo by Darren Langit/Rappler 
MANILA, Philippines – Visibly upset legislators told Health Secretary Francisco Duque III he needs to get his priorities in order after he failed to attend a House hearing on Metro Manila’s response to the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). 
On Wednesday, February 5, Muntinlupa Representative Ruffy Biazon called out Duque for begging off from attending the House committee on Metro Manila development’s hearing to inspect a quarantine facility in Fort Magsaysay in Nueva Ecija.
Duque went to Fort Magsaysay on orders of President Rodrigo Duterte. The facility in the military reserve will serve as a quarantine area for Filipinos set to be repatriated from China on Saturday, February 8.
""Pakiparating po kay Secretary Duque: Ayusin ho niya ang kanyang priorities (Please tell this to Secretary Duque: He should get his priorities straight),"" Biazon told heads of various DOH bureaus present during the hearing. 
“So I guess this shows the type of priorities that the Secretary has. As the overall in-charge of handling this crisis, I believe he should have been there. Hindi ‘yong pag-iinspekto na lang ng mga kuwarto (He should not just spend time inspecting rooms). So to the DOH, we appreciate your presence but I am very sure there will be questions here that you wouldn’t be able to answer,” he added.
A few minutes later, Biazon recalled the Senate hearing on Tuesday, February 4, which revealed an apparent lack of communication between the DOH, and the Civil Aeronautics Board and the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines on contact tracing for possible 2019-nCoV cases.  
Duque had even threatened to fire “incompetent” officials from the DOH’s Epidemiology Bureau. But for Biazon, no one is to be blamed but the health secretary himself. 
The Muntinlupa congressman cited Republic Act No. 11332 or the “Mandatory Reporting of Notifiable Diseases and Health Events of Public Health Concerns Act,” which gives the DOH chief the power to “declare epidemics of national and/or international concerns except when the same threatens national security.” 
“Itong krisis na hinaharap natin sa kalusugan ng mga Pilipino, siya ang incident commander. Sa kanya manggagaling ang kautusan. Lahat ng ahensiya – DFA (Department of Foreign Affairs) and others – mapapasailalim sa kanya. Kaya ito ho tayo nababahala kung ano ba ang priorities dito sa pag-attend sa problemang ito,” Biazon said. 
(He is the incident commander of this crisis involving the health of Filipinos. The orders should be coming from him. All agencies – including the DFA and others – would fall under him. That's why we are concerned over his priorities in attending to this problem.)
Manila 1st District Representative Manuel Lopez, House committee on Metro Manila development chair, agreed with Biazon. 
“We would not like to lambast the Secretary...pero ang nais lang po namin ipaalam sa kanya [ay] baka nakakalimutan niya ang paalala namin kung anu-ano po ang kapangyarihan na binigay po sa kanya ng Republika ng Pilipinas (But we want to remind him that he may be forgetting the powers given to him under the Republic of the Philippines),” Lopez said.
Duque had already appeared before the House during the question hour in the plenary session on January 29. But only a few lawmakers lined up to interpellate the DOH chief, excluding Biazon and Lopez. 
As of 9 pm on Tuesday, the Philippines recorded one death due to the 2019-nCoV, the first to die from the disease outside of China. 
This 44-year-old Chinese man is one of two confirmed coronavirus cases in the country along with a 38-year-old woman, with whom he traveled from Wuhan via Hong Kong, to the Philippines.
The DOH is currently monitoring 105 patients for possible 2019-nCoV. Of this number, 91 were still in hospitals while 12 had been discharged.
Globally, the coronavirus has already infected 23,939 people and killed 492, as of Wednesday morning.

This means that if you bought stocks at the start of 2020, priced at almost 7,800 each, you have lost over 8% of your investments.

While the stock market is not totally indicative of the economy’s health, it does tell quite a lot about business sentiment. So far, it seems that sentiment does not go with some of the numbers.
Analysts and even the government’s economic team have all been somewhat unanimous in saying that while the impact of the novel coronavirus is hard to price in, the economy, so far, can take the hit.
The Philippines is also a domestic consumption-driven economy, which means that the economy is not very reliant on trade to grow. Trade-driven economies like China have taken a direct hit on both the lingering trade war and the spread of the coronavirus.
So why are investors still fleeing the Philippines?
It seems that more than the virus, businesses are getting more worried over the political climate under the Duterte administration.
“Investors are definitely worried and they are waiting for decisive action from the government to contain the virus. But remember this is not the only thing that investors are worried about, there's lots of domestic developments too,” said Jun Calaycay, chief of research of Philstocks.
With no clear gameplan and a credible, assuring tone in containing the virus, the business community is more jittery.
Business as usual?
Strictly looking at the numbers and somewhat excluding all other factors, the Philippine economy is perceived to be surviving the novel coronavirus.
All the market experts and economists whom Rappler was able to interview agree that the economic impact is ""minimal,"" provided that the situation does not escalate further.
Carlo Asuncion, Unionbank's chief economist, said that the tourism and trade sectors will be the most affected.
""In 2010, the PSA [Philippine Statistics Authority] put the average foreign tourist spend at $84/day, and last year, tourists visiting from China were approximately about 1.5 million. Thus, the Philippines may stand to lose a minimum of $126 million worth of foreign tourist spending this 2020 as the coronavirus scare continues to sow fear in the short-term,"" Asuncion said.

""People-movement-related businesses may also lose in the short-term as people tend to stay rather than roam around risking unnecessary exposure to the largely unknown disease.""
If the novel coronavirus delivers a “severe, but temporary impact” or an outbreak lasts 6 months, Unionbank’s economic research unit expects Philippine full-year economic growth to decline at least 0.3% to at most 0.8% in 2020. 
Calaycay added that while the overall economy remains robust, he warned that flight restrictions and cancellations have a ""spillover effect."" 
""It does not end in flights and tourism. There are jobs not necessarily related to these sectors but are dependent or somewhat connected to them, so we need to watch out for that as well,"" Calaycay said.

Meanwhile, ING Bank Manila chief economist Nicholas Mapa noted that the warm ties between the Philippines and China mean that Duterte also inherits Beijing's problems.
""When China sneezes, the Philippines catches a cold and picks up a cough given recent developments in economic ties,"" Mapa said.
China is currently the Philippines' top trading partner. Exports to China from January to November 2019 improved 6.3% to $8.8 billion, from $8.3 billion during the same period in 2018, according to PSA. Over 56% comprised electronic parts.
Mapa estimated losses to hit as high as $600 million due to the slowdown in tourist arrivals, effectively hitting overall consumption from retail sales, restaurants to hotels. (READ: Duterte expands ban on travelers from China, Hong Kong, Macau over coronavirus fears)
""Another possible hit would be the restricted movement of Chinese to and from the mainland, with POGO [Philippine offshore gambling operators] workers not able to return or incomes curtailed by the slowdown in business,"" Mapa said.
Meanwhile, Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation economist Michael Ricafort noted that consumers can expect lower oil prices due to the coronavirus outbreak.
He noted that global crude oil prices have already declined to a new 3-month low, which is already lower compared to the levels during the US-Iran tensions in early January 2020. The decline is due to the anticipation for lower global oil demand for oil especially in China, which is the world’s biggest oil importer.
While economists have estimated the impact to be minimal so far, the novel coronavirus scare is fueling the business community's jitters.
""For as long as uncertainty hangs over the Philippines, we can expect anxiety to weigh on the economy the same way a cold or cough curtails all of us. For the most part, we can still operate as business as usual, albeit stopping from time to time to wipe our noses or cough into a tissue,"" Mapa said.
Uncertainty
The presence of the novel coronavirus in the Philippines comes at a time where Duterte has weaponized contract reviews, seen by some as a move to favor allied businessmen. 
The elite, not used to attacks by a strongman, were quite unsure about how to handle such a scenario they never saw coming.
Duterte's rants against Ayala-led Manila Water and Manny V. Pangilinan's Maynilad has sent stock prices so low, the market has not seen such prices in over a decade.
Earlier this week, investors were somewhat given a boost when Enrique Razon, a perceived ally of Duterte, took a slice or 25% of Ayala's Manila Water. After the announcement, euphoric investors pushed stock prices back in the green.
""Yes, it somewhat calmed down the market. But it is still bad for the business environment overall. Does this mean that the whole contract review is all over? It does not feel right,"" said an analyst who requested anonymity.
The business community is also awaiting the fate of the Lopez's ABS-CBN, as well as keeping a close eye on the economic impact of Taal Volcano, and the reported cases of African swine fever outside Luzon.
Prior to these negative developments, the Duterte administration has already started to show signs of having difficulty attracting investors.
Foreign direct investments (FDIs) fom January to September 2019 posted $5.1 billion only, down nearly 37% compared to the $8.1 billion recorded in the same period in 2018. This brings the net FDI inflows for the 9-month period to only $5.12 billion down by nearly 37% compared to the $8.11 billion recorded in the same period in 2019. (READ: [OPINION | Point of Law] Challenges in business that cannot scare us)
Hot money or portfolio investments also showed weakness, as it saw a net outflow of $1.9 billion last year, according to the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas. This is a turnaround from the inflows of $1.2 billion in 2018. The BSP projected portfolio investments to register inflows worth $8 billion last year.
How soon can we see the impact of all these uncertainties? 
University of Asia and the Pacific economist Victor Abola said in a recent press briefing that in general, there is a ""lag"" before the real impact of uncertainties can be felt.
""Real effect can be felt after a year or so. For the current year, plans are there already and people will not stop executing plans because of certain negative actions,"" Abola said.
After missing its growth targets and struggling to attract more investors, the government now has the additional task of stemming the domino effect that the new virus has triggered. – Rappler.com "

CEBU CITY, Philippines – Cebu Governor Gwendolyn Garcia signed an executive order Tuesday, February 4, placing this province under a state of preparedness because of the threat of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) and designating 4 public facilities to be used as quarantine areas.
As part of this levelled up preparation the provincial government has identified the Eversly Child Sanitarium in Consolacion, Cebu, as the primary public facility where all Filipinos coming from  mainland China and the special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau will be committed to undergo a mandatory 14-day quarantine.
Aside from Eversly, the other quarantine facilities tapped by the provincial government are the Mandaue General Hospital, the New Life Facility in Pinamungajan town, and the Women and Children Development Center in Lahug, Cebu CIty.   All in all, the 3 facilities could handle up to 250 people.
 These facilities were set up when Cebu was planning to quarantine all passengers coming in from mainland China, even before President Rodrigo Duterte ordered a travel ban last week.
Also an author of Garcia's resolution was 4th District Provincial Board Member Kerrie Shimura, the Chairperson of the Committee on Health and Social Services.
“There is a clear and present danger of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus entering Cebu that warrants an immediate need for the implementation of measures to prevent its entry while establishing protocols for the quarantine of infected individuals in case entry;” the resolution read. The declaration empowered local government Disaster Risk Reduction Management offices to take actions to minimize the adverse effects of a recognized danger.  
At least 4 of the 31 patients under investigation by the Department of Health for the coronavirus are from the Central Visayas.   
The Cebu provincial government is also preparing protocols for home quarantine for arriving Filipinos.    The process for home quarantine was still being discussed with the local government units and Philippine National Police. 
""We have not established the protocols on homestay, we will have to bring them directly straight to the Eversely facility,"" Garcia said.
""Right now, we need to know where are their homes… we need to identify what times these are so that the mayors themselves will also be on board including the barangay kapitan,"" she added.The first death due to the coronavirus outside of China happened in the Philippines. The tourist came from Wuhan City to the Philippines via Dumaguete and Cebu. The Epidemiology Bureau of the DOH has found a total of 74 contacts the couple interacted with in Cebu and Dumaguete As of Tuesday, February 4, the DOH was looking into 80 people for 2019-nCoV. This includes 2 confirmed cases and 68 others who were still confined in hospitals, while 10 who have been discharged but are still being monitored. Of these, 48 samples are awaiting confirmation for the 2019-nCoV, while 30 have tested negative.– Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – Scientists at the National Institutes of Health of the University of the Philippines (UP) Manila said they have developed a test kit that would help the Department of Health (DOH) confirm more cases of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in the country.
The test kit will be released next week for evaluation of the DOH, said scientist Raul Destura during a Senate hearing assessing the government's response to 2019-nCoV on Tuesday, February 4.
""Hopefully by next week, it will be ready for the DOH to verify and validate before they give their recommendation for use in the country,"" Destura said.
He added that UP scientists developed the test kit after Chinese scientists released the whole genome sequence of the virus to the public.
The test kit would allow the DOH to more rapidly detect the presence of 2019-nCoV in samples taken from patients ""under investigation"" or observation, which are now at 105.
Currently, the DOH is using the primer it had acquired from Japan, which allows its research arm, the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine, to determine ""within 48 hours"" whether samples are positive for 2019-nCoV.
""[What we're using is] like a code that more or less it will guide us to identify [the virus]. This is exactly the virus that's similar to the one in Wuhan,"" Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said.
But the primer is not yet commercially available, making it difficult for the DOH to acquire it in big batches.
World Health Organization country representative to the Philippines Rabindra Abeyasinghe said several research groups around the world are still racing to develop rapid test kits for the virus.
""Test kits will not be completed for about another week to 10 days, after which we have agreed that we will provide the test kits to the Philippines and other member states that are at risk,"" he said.
Senators on Tuesday criticized the DOH for apparent lapses in leadership especially in its protocols for contact tracing. In about a week, the health department has only traced 17% or around 50 of the 331 people who came into contact with the Philippines' two confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV.
Duque blamed the lapses on incompetent individuals in the DOH's Epidemiology Bureau. He also promised ""aggressive contact tracing"" which would involve police.
As of Tuesday, the virus has infected more than 20,000 and killed over 400, nearly all in China. (READ: World currently 'not in a pandemic' of China virus – WHO) – Rappler.com

NEGROS ORIENTAL, Philippines – Negros Oriental Governor Roel Degamo issued an executive order (EO) suspending classes in all levels in public schools from Wednesday, February 5, to Friday, February 7.
This is part of the precautionary measures of the provincial government to contain and mitigate the spread of the deadly novel coronavirus, the governor said in his EO issued Tuesday, February 4.
The governor also said that private schools may suspend their classes in their respective schools at their own discretion. 
Silliman University in Dumaguete City had earlier announced that its classes from preschool to senior high school will be conducted online starting February 5.
Five individuals in this province who came in contact with the two confirmed cases of novel coronavirus in the Philippines were placed under quarantine at a hospital after they exhibited flu-like symptoms.
Another 25 persons were also being monitored after they came in contact with the two confirmed patients, a Chinese couple. They were also required to be quarantined for 14 days.
The driver of the tricycle hired by the Chinese couple is now being assessed by health authorities in Negros Oriental, Provincial Information Officer Bimbo Miraflor said.
He ferried the couple to a resort in Dauin town.
He was also advised to place himself in quarantine and avoid close contact with family members, neighbors, and friends.
He will also receive financial assistance worth P5,000 from the provincial government, according to Miraflor. 
The Philippines' health department confirmed the second case of the novel coronavirus in the Philippines on Sunday, February 2. Both confirmed cases traveled to the Philippines from Wuhan, China.
The second patient died on Saturday, February 1 – the first death recorded outside China. 
The novel coronavirus that originated from Wuhan, China, has so far killed 426 and sickened over 20,000 people across the country and worldwide. The World Health Organization already declared an international emergency over the virus. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – The Department of Health (DOH) is now probing 105 persons for the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) as of noon on Tuesday, February 4. 
This is up from the 80 initially reported by the DOH at the Senate hearing on the government’s response to 2019-nCoV earlier on the same day. 
Most of the patients under investigation are being observed in Metro Manila, where 36 patients are being probed. This includes the Chinese couple from Wuhan, China, who were the first two confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV in the Philippines. One of them eventually died due to severe pneumonia resulting from the virus, which has killed over 400 people and infected over 20,000 people in 25 countries, mostly in China.

Here is the breakdown of cases per region:

Calabarzon - 4
Mimaropa - 4
Western Visayas - 10
Central Visayas - 16
Eastern Visayas - 3
Northern Mindanao - 5
Davao region - 6

Of the 105, 91 are currently admitted to hospitals while 12 have been discharged but are under strict monitoring. Strict monitoring means that the the DOH’s epidemiology bureau checks up on them daily for symptoms.  
Health Secretary Francisco Duque III also told reporters after the Senate hearing on Tuesday that the DOH is verifying a third possible case of 2019-nCoV, but said more details would be revealed on Wednesday, February 5.  
The increase in cases being probed comes as the criteria for probing expanded to persons coming not just from Hubei province but also from all of mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau. 
Duque also said the increase was “due to the strengthened surveillance system and contact tracing of the Epidemiology Bureau,"" but the Tuesday Senate hearing revealed lapses in the DOH’s protocols, particularly in contact tracing. 
The health chief said that that he would hold officials in the DOH’s epidemiology bureau accountable for their incompetence in dealing with the urgent health crisis. – Rappler.com  "

MANILA, Philippines – Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said “heads will roll” in the health department’s Epidemiology Bureau as a Senate hearing revealed gaps in its work identifying people who possibly came in contact with patients who tested positive for the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). 
Speaking to reporters after the Senate hearing on the 2019-nCoV on Tuesday, February 4, Duque dodged criticisms of his “failure of leadership” and said that the problem was “within some of the operating units of the Department of Health (DOH).” 
The epidemiology bureau of the DOH monitors the spread of infectious diseases, the latest of which is the emerging 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease. The bureau is also supposed to take the lead in contact tracing, or tracking down people who have interacted with those positive for the virus. This included co-passengers on the flights they were on, as well as personnel in establishments and hotels they went to.  
“I've always assumed that they already have the competence, that they already know what they're doing, and that they are familiar with the protocols,” he said, adding that it is not his job to “get into operational details.”
“The secretary of health orchestrates everyone. When you orchestrate an ensemble, I am not going to get somebody to teach him to play the violin, I already expect him to know how to play the violin as the orchestrator. It is not a failure of leadership. It is probably a question of incompetence on the part of some of those who form part of the orchestra,” Duque added.
Senators took turns grilling Duque on the issue of contact tracing, which is crucial in quelling the spread of the virus, which has killed over 400 people and infected over 20,000 people in 25 countries, mostly in China. 
The lawmakers pointed out the apparent lack of communication between the DOH and the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) and the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP).   It was revealed in the hearing that the government has reached out to only 17% or around 50 of the 331 passengers who may have come in contact with the country's first two confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV.
Duque said that Cebu Pacific and Philippine Airlines, whose flights the carried the two confirmed cases, provided the DOH redacted flight manifestos, withholding the passengers' contact information. But airlines invoked the Data Privacy Act. 
But CAB and CAAP said it was unlikely that airlines would do this given the circumstances.
“We need to assess (the epidemiology bureau) for their competencies for that particular job. We will have to assess them right now. We will convene the epidemiology bureau to really find out,” Duque said. 
Duque also said “aggressive contact tracing” would begin Wednesday, February 5. Upon the recommendation of Senator Ronald dela Rosa,  the police would now be involved  in the process of finding people who were possibly infected. “We need to talk to PNP to tell us exactly the cooperation that is needed, the coordination that is needed on the ground level when the contact tracing ought to be done,” Duque said. 
As of Tuesday, February 4, the DOH was probing 80 people for 2019-nCoV. This figure included the 2 confirmed cases, 68 others who were still in hospitals, and 10 who have been discharged but are under monitoring. Of these, 48 samples are awaiting confirmation for the 2019-nCoV while 30 have tested negative. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – Justice Secretary Menardo Guevarra on Tuesday, February 4, ordered the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) to go after peddlers of fake news involving the 2019 novel coronavirus or the 2019-nCoV.
""The NBI, through Director Dante A. Gierran, is hereby directed and granted authority to conduct an investigation and case build-up on the alleged deliberate spread of misinformation and fake news about the 2019-nCov ARD and false reporting of 2019-nCov ARD (Acute Respiratory Disease) cases and, if evidence warrants, to file the appropriate charges against persons found responsible thereof,"" Guevarra said in Department Order No. 052 signed on Tuesday.
But what law covers fake news, if there is no law that defines and punishes it?
As of posting, Department of Justice (DOJ) Spokesperson Undersecretary Markk Perete was unable to name a specific law that can potentially cover fake news in the context of the 2019-nCov. 
""We cannot, at this point, speculate on the charge/s as these will depend on the evidence gathered during the investigation process,"" said Perete.
""Laws exist to ensure, among others, public order and safety. Upholding such laws becomes even more important when circumstances that agitate the public emerge,"" Perete added.
The anti-fake news bill, introduced by Senate President Vicente ""Tito"" Sotto III, will empower the DOJ to take down websites it deems to contain fake news. The Human Rights Watch has slammed this bill for infringing on the right to free speech.
Sotto himself peddled fake news on Tuesday when he showed at a Senate hearing a video of 2019-nCov conspiracy theories, which Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr dismissed as the ""craziest video.""
Will Sotto be investigated too?
""All leads will have to be considered, including those presented at the Senate,"" Perete said.
Free speech
The Legazpi City police filed on Tuesday a complaint for alarm and scandal against a vlogger who pulled a prank by laying down and acting sick in front of Yashano Mall in the city's port district on Sunday afternoon.
Will the right to free speech protect people in this case?
""Persons who unnecessarily aggravate such agitation through actions violative of our laws cannot be allowed to unjustly claim protection under the basic guarantees of our Constitution. To hold otherwise will invite chaos and disorder,"" said Perete.
Law professor Ted Te, however, said Guevarra's department order ""directly contradicts freedom of expression.""
Te cited the 2008 Supreme Court case Chavez vs Gonzales which declared as unconstitutional the press release of the National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) warning against the publication of the ""Hello Garci"" recording. The Supreme Court said the press release constituted prior restraint.
""Alarms and scandals is a felony; the Department Order deals specifically with 'fake news' and makes it a basis for case build-up, possible arrest and prosecution. This directly contradicts freedom of expression,"" Te said.
Perete denied that the department order restrains free speech, saying it does not restrict action.
""It merely directs the NBI to investigate certain acts already committed, and if warranted, to file the appropriate complaint before the proper body,"" said Perete.
Can the Cybercrime Law kick in for ""fake news"" posted online?
""While Cybercrime Law specifically mentions 'content-based restrictions' it does not specifically refer to spreading 'fake news,'"" said Te. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – As the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak continued to stir public concern, Senate President Vicente Sotto III showed a conspiracy theory video that  claimed the coronavirus to be a form of ""biowarfare"" developed by the United States against China.
Sotto used his question time at a Senate hearing into the Philippine government's measures against the novel coronavirus to play the video that he said his office had received, saying it was among his and other senators' ""concern.""
""Mr Chair, I will not ask any questions. Instead I would like to focus on the concern, of my concern and some other members of the Senate and of course our people – of the unknown origin [of the novel coronavirus] as quoted by the WHO. Meron tayong kasabihan eh (We have a saying). If you want to defeat an enemy, know the enemy. Ano ba itong virus na ito (What is this virus all about)?"" Sotto said on Tuesday, February 4.

Before playing the video, Sotto called the report ""somehow very interesting, if not revealing"" as he called on those present to pay close attention to it.
The video, which cited no official information or sources and was already debunked by experts, suggested Western countries ""developed"" the coronavirus as biowarfare against China in an effort to stop its rise as a global power. The theory has been debunked by experts.
'Craziest video.' After playing portions of the video, Sotto then asked Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr for his comments on the video. Sotto did not ask for the opinions of health officials such as Health Secretary Francisco Duque III or WHO country representative Rabindra Abeyasinghe who were at the hearing.
Locsin said it was an example of the ""craziest video"" he has ever seen and proceeded to debunk its contents and said it was illogical for the coronavirus to be created as a biowarfare weapon.
The DFA chief pointed out information presented in the video clashed with other supposed reports it showed, saying, ""In this video, there are the suspects: China inflicting it on itself – 99% of infections are all Chinese so why would they do that?""  
Locsin added, ""Again, [the claim is] this is a plan of the US and the West to destroy China by first destroying itself. This is really clever, so I don't know if you can believe this.""
Responding to this, Sotto said though he and others in the Senate were ""not prepared to take the content of the video hook line and sinker,"" and it was ""best"" officials were ""aware"" of what is being spread about the virus.
Dangerous fake news.  At the start of hearing, Senator Christopher ""Bong"" Go, chairman of the Senate committee on health and demography, cautioned the public against spreading fake news during the outbreak, saying fake news peddlers should be ""quarantined."" 
""'Yung mga panay dada naman diyan para makapagsalita, mga bashers sumasakay sa sitwasyon para sa pansariling interes, mga tao gusto lang magdulot ng panic ang mga nagpapakalat ng fake news, kayo ang dapat maquarantine para di makahawa,"" said Go.
(Those who want to just say something, bashers who are riding on the situation for their own self-interest, people who want to cause panic and spread fake news, you should be the ones quarantined.)
With the outbreak of the coronavirus, false news and misinformation have mushroomed online, prompting medical experts to warn that these were not only false but dangerous.
""Fake news in a health setting is dangerous. Fake news in an emergency public health situation is deadly so it's very, very important we only consume verified sources of news,"" said infectious disease expert Dr Edsel Salvana in an interview with ABS-CBN News. (LIST: Where to get official, reliable info on novel coronavirus)
In fact, the World Health Organization and medical experts previously explained what they know so far about the 2019 novel coronavirus: that it is from a family of coronaviruses that can cause illnesses ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome. (READ: FAQs: Ano-ano ang alam natin tungkol sa 2019 novel coronavirus?)
The new coronavirus was also believed to have originated in a market in Wuhan City, China, where wildlife was sold and sanitary conditions subpar.
In defense of China. While talking about the video showed by Sotto, Locsin praised and defended China's handling of the coronavirus outbreak even as China's top leadership itself had admitted ""shortcomings and difficulties"" in government response and handling of the outbreak.
Locsin believed China's handling of the coronavirus outbreak further cemented the country as a global power for effectively handling the disease.
""This disease is only proving the resilience and strength of China. In 10 days they have built a massive containment facility. That only shows that...this challenge will not weaken China but will strengthen it in the eyes of the world as a power that just cannot be defeated even by nature,"" he said.

In a phone interview with Rappler, Legazpi City acting police chief Lieutenant Colonel Aldwin Gamboa confirmed that they had filed a case on Tuesday afternoon accusing the man of violating Article 155 of the Revised Penal Code, which bans inappropriately causing alarm and scandal.
Gamboa said the man apparently laid down and acted sick in front of Yashano Mall in the city's port district on Sunday afternoon, but ended up causing unnecessary panic.
There's no arrest yet: Gamboa clarified that the man who pulled the apparent prank has not been arrested as they have not secured an arrest warrant.
If the case prospers, the man could be imprisoned from 1 to 30 days, or could be fined at most P200.

,"February 04, 2020",nCov,Senate hearing bares gaps in PH contact tracing for novel coronavirus,Janella Paris,"
HEALTH CHIEF. Health Secretary Francisco Duque III attends the Senate hearing on the Philippines' preparedness on the 2019 novel coronavirus on February 4, 2020. 
MANILA, Philippines – The Department of Health (DOH) has only contacted 17% or around 50 of the 331 passengers who may have come in contact with the country's first two confirmed cases of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), revealing gaps in the government’s protocol for tracking down potentially infected persons. 
Health Secretary Francisco Duque III made the statement in a Senate hearing on Tuesday, February 4, after Senator Nancy Binay asked for a  progress report on DOH efforts to track down passengers on the same flights as the couple from Wuhan, China, one of whom became the first person to die of the virus outside China.  (READ: TIMELINE: The novel coronavirus epidemic)
“I’ll be the first one to admit, it’s not easy to do this,” Duque said, referring to contact tracing, during the Senate hearing on the Philippine government's preparedness against the 2019-nCoV attended by a number of Cabinet officials led by Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea.
The Philippines' 2019 nCoV cases – a 38-year-old woman and 44-year-old man – traveled from Wuhan via Hong Kong, and from there took a Cebu Pacific flight to Cebu, then later another Cebu Pacific flight to Dumaguete.  Days later, they a took Philippine Airlines flight to Manila. They were both admitted to the San Lazaro Hospital in Manila upon arrival but the man died nearly a week later, on February 1.
Senators took turns grilling government officials on the issue of contact tracing, which is crucial in stemming the spread of the dread virus, which has killed over 400 people and infected over 20,000 people in 25 countries, mostly in China.
Senators noted the apparent lack of communication between the DOH and the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) and the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP) regarding contact tracing.
“Nakakalungkot na parang hindi kayo nag-uusap (It's disappointing to see that it seems you haven’t been speaking to each other). Secretary Duque, you could have coordinated with CAAP and CAB if you are having these difficulties,” said Binay.
Though Cebu Pacific and Philippine Airlines had both released statements about cooperating with the health department’s Bureau of Quarantine (BOQ) and providing the necessary flight manifest data, Duque said airlines had shared flight manifests but had “not been sharing contact details of passengers and invoking confidentiality.”
“They are invoking Data Privacy. This is rather strange, in this urgent situation, I do not understand why this is the case. But I think this has to be investigated,” Duque said.  
But CAB Executive Director Carmelo Arcilla said airlines would readily give such information under current circumstances. “In my experience, the experience of our office, they would be willing to share it, especially during an event like this,” he said. 
CAAP General Manager Eddie Monreal said, “People, as long as you tell them the flight number, I’m sure, if they were on board, they would also volunteer themselves, so I don’t see a reason why the airlines would withhold the names.” 
Monreal added that only the passengers who occupied the 4 seats in front, 4 seats behind, 4 seats to the left, and 4 seats to the right of infected people – not all plane passengers – have to be contacted, as planes have hospital-grade HEPA filters, which clear the air of airborne particles and viruses.  
But Duque also admitted that there might be a “lack of transparency on the part of some (DOH) people.” Visibly flustered, Duque said, “In all of our meetings, there have been no indications raised to me that this has been a problem.” 
Senator Francis Pangilinan said of the apparent lapse, ""When only 17% of those passengers have been contacted since this issue erupted, I don’t think it’s only a failure of communication, I think it is also a failure of leadership on the part of the health department.""
The DOH had said since the confirmation of the first 2019-nCoV case in the Philippines on January 30 that it was on top of identifying people the patient interacted with, as well as the establishments that she went to and employees she had been in contact with. So far, it has established 8 of these people as persons under investigation, meaning they showed symptoms of respiratory illness. 
As of Tuesday, February 4, the DOH was probing 80 people for 2019-nCoV. This figure includes the 2 confirmed cases, 68 others who were still in hospitals, and 10 who have been discharged but are under monitoring. Of these, 48 samples are awaiting confirmation for the 2019-nCoV while 30 have tested negative. – Rappler.com  "

MANILA, Philippines – The Senate committees on health and demography and finance on Tuesday, February 4, hold a hearing to discuss the government’s preparedness to respond to the 2019 novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV threat, which has been declared a public health emergency of international concern by the World Health Organization.
The Philippines has so far confirmed 2 cases of 2019-nCoV, one of whom died due to pneumonia as a result of being infected by the virus. Currently, the Department of Health (DOH) is investigating 78 other patients who have shown symptoms of respiratory illness and have had history of travel to Wuhan, China, the outbreak’s epicenter.
The government has also imposed a temporary travel ban to and from mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau. The government is also seeking to repatriate the over 300 Filipinos in Hubei province, where Wuhan is. Have these measures been enough? – Rappler.com

AKLAN, Philippines – The impact of the coronavirus outbreak on Boracay's tourism industry could be worse than the Boracay closure.
Peter Tay, liaison officer to Boracay for the Chinese Embassy in the Philippines, expressed fears that travel restrictions could further hurt tourism businesseses and tourist spending. 
 
""It is going [from] bad to worse. When the Boracay closure happened, you could look forward [to the] October 26 re-opening. Itong situation ngayon, hindi natin alam when it will end, (We don't know when this current situation will end),"" Tay said on a Radyo Todo Aklan interview on Monday, February 3. 
On Sunday, February 2, President Rodrigo Duterte restricted the inbound travel of foreigners from China and its special administrative regions to the Philippines, and required Filipinos and those holding permanent resident visas to undergo a 14-day quarantine. (READ: China coronavirus death toll rises to 425 – gov't)
The directive, however, didn't mention how long the temporary ban would last. 
Carriers including Philippine Airlines, Cebu Pacific, Xiamen Air, China Eastern Air, OK Air, and Air Asia have suspended or canceled flights to and from China, Macau, and Hong Kong. (READ: Traveling amid coronavirus outbreak? Here's what you need to know)
Almost 60% of island hopping and water sports activities, as well as majority of vendors, tattoo artists, and beach masseuses will be affected by the temporary ban. Chinese restaurants owners have decided to close shop, while hotels across the island have recorded cancelations. 
The island – which saw 434,175 Chinese tourists, or 50% of its 865,419 foreign visitors, last year – is usually packed with travelers during the peak season of January to May. 
“We were caught by surprise, but we have to accept that this is actually happening. No hard feelings. I am more concerned [for] the livelihood  of the local workers affected by the situation,"" Tay added. 
As a precaution, Tay also encouraged hotel workers to visit hospitals or medical care facilities if they experience coughing and difficulty in breathing.
Meanwhile, acting Malay town mayor Frolibar Bautista said he will no longer declare a temporary ban on tourists from China and its special administrative regions in the area since President Duterte already issued a directive. 
Boracay hasn't come to complete standstill, however, as the island continues to accommodate Koreans, Taiwanese, and tourists from long-haul destinations.

HEALTH PRECAUTIONS. Metro Manila commuters wear face masks as protection from the novel coronavirus on February 3, 2020. Photo by Jire Carreon/Rappler  
MANILA, Philippines – President Rodrigo Duterte on Monday, February 3, said the government would procure face masks for Filipinos as stockpiles of surgical face masks were depleted amid fears over the spread of the 2019 novel coronavirus.
Duterte made the announcement after holding a meeting with Cabinet members regarding the Philippine government's response to the novel coronavirus outbreak.
""Is government doing something to buy more, to protect more? Yes we are doing it (procuring masks). We are not just sitting down here. We have resources coming,"" Duterte told reporters in a press briefing in Malacañang on Monday night.
Panic buying. After the Department of Health confirmed the first case of coronavirus in the Philippines on January 30, Filipinos raced to drugstores to purchase face masks out of fear of contracting the virus.
In areas such as Cebu City, suppliers were forced to ration masks while pharmacies implemented a ""one box per person"" policy to prevent hoarding. In Metro Manila, individuals likewise emptied pharmacies' and medical supply stores' shelves of masks, prompting the police to deploy personnel to manage crowds.
This came despite the World Health Organization saying that masks are not needed by healthy people with no respiratory symptoms.
Downplaying outbreak. Meanwhile, Duterte downplayed the spread of the novel coronavirus to the country, saying the public's ""hysteria"" over the virus was unwarranted.
""This coronavirus is scaring people all over. The response of the people from the initial reports of the coronavirus was almost hysterical when there was really no need for it, actually,"" Duterte said.
""Why do you have to be hysterical? Why don't you just go to the hospital and have yourself treated?"" he added.
So far, the Department of Health has confirmed two cases of the novel coronavirus in the Philippines. On Monday, health officials said they were also monitoring 80 persons under investigation for the virus.
The Philippines recorded the first death due to the novel coronavirus outside China in a 44-year-old Chinese man who traveled to the Philippines from Wuhan. The man was the country's second confirmed case of the novel coronavirus, and a companion of the first patient, a 38-year-old Chinese woman.
As of Monday, the virus has killed 362 people and infected over 17,000 people worldwide. – Rappler.com

CORONAVIRUS RESTRICTIONS. President Rodrigo Duterte reiterates travel restrictions against non-Filipinos coming to the country directly from China, Hong Kong, and Macau as the novel coronavirus spreads. Malacañang photo 
MANILA, Philippines – President Rodrigo Duterte on Monday, February 3, rejected calls for the Philippine government to bar all Chinese from entering the country as he hit the display of xenophobia against Chinese amid the global spread of the 2019 novel coronavirus.
Duterte made the statement Monday night, addressing calls online that supposedly urged the Philippine government to bar all Chinese from entering and send those in the country back to China.
""If the question is if I will bar Chinese from entering, the answer of course is no. That is an utter disrespect to a human being.... This mentioning [of] the Chinese and blaming them is xenophobia,"" Duterte said in a press conference Monday night.
""Stop this xenophobia thing,"" he added.
Duterte said calls to have Chinese in the Philippines return to China were ""a case of bad taste."" He sought to remind Filipinos that Chinese were not at fault for the emergence of the disease, which could have propagated in other places. (READ: Robredo urges Filipinos to respect Chinese amid coronavirus spread)
""It happened in China – at least the first [case] – but that is not the fault of anybody. Not of the Chinese, not the Filipinos, not of anyone,"" he said.
The President then urged the public to ""remember"" the thousands of Filipinos who are in China, saying countries should help one another take care of its citizens.
""We have many Filipinos in China. Even if we have none, we are a community of nations, we cooperate. China has been kind to us, we can only show the same,"" Duterte said.
Travel restrictions. The Philippine government on Sunday, February 2, implemented a ban against non-Filipinos coming to the country directly from China, Hong Kong, and Macau in an effort to quell the spread of the virus.
The restrictions, Duterte said, do not cover Chinese who hold valid Philippine visas and are coming from other countries outside China. 
Aside from this, the Philippines also temporarily stopped issuing visas to travelers from China, Hong Kong, and Macau, while immigration officials suspended the visa upon arrival mechanism for Chinese tourists and businessmen.
Asked if the government is considering expanding travel bans to include other countries with confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus, Duterte said the Philippines would follow the advice of the World Health Organization (WHO).
""They (WHO) have all the inputs and they would know what to do...we go by the regulations that will be given out by the WHO. We cannot act on our own,"" he said.
Travel bans, though, were imposed even if the World Health Organization warned that closing borders was likely ineffective in halting transmission of the virus. 
Slow to act? Duterte has been criticized for being slow to act on the novel coronavirus compared to other countries which swiftly put in place sweeping restrictions to quell the spread of the virus and informed the public of such measures.
Despite this, the President said ""everything is well"" in the Philippines and that there's ""nothing really to be extra scared of.""
""It will die a natural death, ito matatapos rin ito (this too shall pass), will it worsen in the meantime? Maybe.... [But] the progress of medical science now is far different than the yesteryears,"" Duterte said as he expressed confidence that health experts would find a ""solution"" to the novel coronavirus. 
While health officials have given assurances they are closely monitoring suspected novel coronavirus cases in the country, they repeatedly reminded the public to practice good personal hygiene such as frequent handwashing and to seek medical treatment immediately, if necessary.
So far, the Department of Health has confirmed two cases of the novel coronavirus in the Philippines.
These include the first death outside China – a 44-year-old Chinese man who traveled to the Philippines from Wuhan. The man was the country's second confirmed case of the novel coronavirus, and a companion of the first patient, a 38-year-old Chinese woman.

BACOLOD, Philippines – At least 5 individuals were quarantined at a hospital in Negros Oriental while two others were quarantined at another hospital in Bacolod City after exhibiting flu-like symptoms.
The Department of Health (DOH) on Sunday, February 2, confirmed the second case of the novel coronavirus in the Philippines. Both confirmed cases traveled to the Philippines from Wuhan, China.
The second patient, who was the traveling companion of the first confirmed case, died on Saturday, February 1 – the first death recorded outside China. The DOH is currently monitoring 80 patients for possible infection.
The 5 persons being monitored in Negros Oriental came in contact with the two confirmed cases, who both had a travel history to Dumaguete City.
Provincial Information Officer Bimbo Miraflor, in a press conference on Monday, February 3, said swab samples were already taken from the 5 individuals – a plane passenger, two hotel employees, and two from a resort – and were sent to the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine for tests.
Miraflor said two of these persons have fever, while the others have cough and sore throat.
He said another 25 individuals who came in contact with the two confirmed cases were also being monitored. Although they were not exhibiting flu-like symptoms, they were required to be quarantined in 14 days. 
Negros Oriental Governor Roel Degamo instructed the Provincial Social Welfare and Development Office to assist those who were identified to have direct contact with the two confirmed cases. The provincial government will provide them P5,000 assistance as they will not be able to work while under quarantine.
The provincial government again called on those who came in contact with the two confirmed cases to visit or present themselves to the Provincial Epidemiology and Surveillance Unit or the Negros Oriental Provincial Hospital. 
Due diligence
Meanwhile, Negros Occidental Governor Eugenio Jose Lacson announced on Monday that two patients were also quarantined in a hospital in Bacolod City.
The suspected patients are a 43-year-old Canadian who came from Taiwan, and a 12-year-old Filipino who traveled from Macau, China, and Hong Kong. 
Lacson said the Canadian was admitted to a hospital on Friday, January 31, adding that a private hospital initially refused the admission of the patient.
The Filipino was admitted to a hospital the following day, February 1, he said.
Lacson said the patients did not travel together.
He called on the public not to panic. ""We're debating [whether] to announce this or not, but it is not fair [if we will not announce it].... I can't just keep it from the public. Because of due diligence, we monitored two persons under investigation,"" he said.
""We don't want to create a scare. It's good [that we know] because they are now being quarantined,"" he said.
Lacson said the results will be out in 48 hours, and that the provincial government will continue to trace those who had direct contact with the patients. He also advised them to submit to the quarantine procedure.
He stressed that there is still no confirmed case of the novel coronavirus in Negros Occidental.
Lacson said the provincial government will reactivate its Provincial Infectious Disease Action and Control Committee to curb the possible spread of the virus.
Lacson also called on private hospitals to be prepared.
""I hope, if there is a need for them to admit a patient with suspected symptoms, just in case, I hope these private hospitals will be willing to treat these patients,"" he added.

MANILA, Philippines – Overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) affected by the temporary travel ban to mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau will receive assistance in the form of cash, accommodation, and transportation from the government. 
The Overseas Workers Welfare Administration (OWWA) said in a Monday, February 3, memorandum that it would provide P10,000 to each OFW supposed to travel back to mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau, but was instead stranded in Manila airports after the announcement of a travel ban to and from the said areas affected by the 2019 novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV outbreak. 
Aside from cash, they will also be accommodated in a OWWA halfway house. The agency will pay for their travel back to their provinces of origin. OWWA said OFWs may avail of the assistance from OWWA officers at the aiports or through the OWWA hotline at 1348.
Though they have no precise numbers, the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) estimated that around 300 OFWs were stranded in Manila airports on Monday, February 3, after the travel ban was imposed. Most of them were bound for Hong Kong and Macau, DOLE added.  
Malacañang had initially announced a travel ban to and from Hubei province, whose capital is Wuhan, ground zero of the outbreak. (READ: PH expands visa suspension for travelers from China, Hong Kong, Macau)
But the travel ban was expanded Sunday, February 2, to cover all of mainland China and the special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau, shortly before the Department of Health (DOH) announced the second case of 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease in the country. 
The ban means that all non-Filipinos traveling from China and its special administrative regions would be barred from entering the country. Travelers coming from transit points in Hong Kong will be covered by the travel ban as well. Likewise, Filipinos would be barred from departing for China, Hong Kong, and Macau. 
Airlines have also followed suit, with several flights to the 3 areas canceled in an effort to contain the spread of the virus.
The Philippines also temporarily stopped issuing visas to travelers from China, Hong Kong, and Macau.

As of Monday, the virus has killed at least 360 people, including one in the Philippines. As of 12 pm on Monday, there are a total of 27 patients under investigation in the National Capital Region..
President Rodrigo Duterte expanded the Philippine government's ban on travelers, covering any person coming directly from China, Hong Kong, and Macau within the last two weeks. 
Here is how LGUs in Metro Manila are preparing for possible new cases of the highly infective virus.
Quezon City
Quezon City Mayor Joy Belmonte is set to inspect 3 government-run hospitals – Quezon City Medical Center, Rosario Maclang Bautista General Hospital, and Novaliches District Hospital – for their readiness in the event of more 2019-nCoV cases.
The 3 hospitals have been equipped with the necessary safety equipment, such as an isolation tent, to take in people suspected of carrying the virus. The tent would allow patients to be isolated from other hospital patients.
These hospitals are also part of the task force for monitoring and responding to the virus.
Private hospitals have also been briefed with regard to the protocols in handling suspected nCoV patients.
Further, 80 frontline responders and logistics personnel of the Quezon City DRRMO were trained on the proper use of personal protective equipment, proper handling of patients, and proper disposal and disinfection of equipment.
Quezon City Health Department Head Dr. Esperanza Arias has also oriented doctors on the virus and activated fever lanes in multiple health facilities to expedite the response to 2019-nCoV concerns.
Quezon City residents may contact the city's 122 hotline for information on nCoV.
Parañaque City
According to Parañaque City Health Office head Olga Virtusio, all medical officers have already been informed about the virus, and hospitals have already prepared for isolation of persons under investigation. 
Virtusio said that while they have a makeshift tent, they are lobbying for another isolation tent of better quality.
She added that triaging is already in place as well. Triage involves the assessment and immediate isolation of carriers of 2019-nCoV away from other patients, according to the World Health Organization. 
Moreover, information on the virus is being printed for dissemination, said Virtusio. 
Pasig City
In a Facebook post, Pasig City Mayor Vico Sotto said that a quarantine tent has been set up at the Pasig City General Hospital for those with symptoms of the flu.
In addition, Sotto said healthcare professionals in the emergency room are implementing the triage algorithm of patients with suspected nCoV infection.
Further, infrared thermometers have been turned over to the Department of Education-Pasig, to be distributed to 44 public schools. The thermometers will be used at the entrances of schools starting Monday to check if students have a fever.

The measure must be able to go through 3 successful readings in the House and in the Senate before it can be transmitted to Malacañang for President Rodrigo Duterte's signature.

Only Filipino citizens and permanent resident visa holders are exempted from the ban.
""We implement the directive to the letter. What we are looking at is not the nationality, but where they came from,"" Sandoval said.

Epidemiology Bureau Director Ferchito Avelino said that 8 of the new cases being monitored are people who came in contact with the couple from Wuhan, China, who were the first positive cases of 2019-nCoV in the Philippines. The 8 people showed signs of coughs and colds, according to Avelino. 
Avelino added that the Epidemiology Bureau has found a total of 74 contacts the couple interacted with in Cebu and Dumaguete. They have been advised to go on home quarantine and are discouraged from interacting with other people within 14 days. 
The increase in cases being probed comes as the criteria for probing expanded to persons coming not just from Hubei province but also from all of mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau. 
Health Francisco Duque III also said the increase was “due to the strengthened surveillance system and contact tracing of the Epidemiology Bureau,"" but this is amid criticism that the health department has been very late in its response to the virus that has claimed more than 360 lives and sickened 16,823 as of Februrary 3.
Lawmakers, as well as the public, had been calling for a travel ban on all of mainland China even before the first case of 2019-nCoV was confirmed in the Philippines, but their calls were met with the president’s statement saying a ban would imperil economic and diplomatic relations with China.
Duterte finally answered the call for a ban on travelers from mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau, on the same day that the DOH announced the first 2019-nCoV-related death in the Philippines – the first one outside of China. 
The DOH continues to urge the public to remain calm and practice proper hygiene and coughing etiquette to prevent infection. It also calls on the public not to hoard surgical masks, as they are only needed by people showing symptoms. The DOH is asking that they be reserved to ""people who need them most, especially medical personnel.""
Duterte is set to meet with the DOH and other medical experts on Monday to discuss government response to the disease. Health officials are looking at two military facilities as possible quarantine areas for Filipinos returning from Wuhan, China, Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana said on Saturday, February 1. These sites are not final, Duque said, but they will be discussed in Monday's cabinet meeting. The Department of Foreign Affairs said that 42 Filipinos have so far requested for repatriation from Wuhan, the epicenter of the viral outbreak. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – About 300 Chinese were left stranded at several terminals across the country, following the Philippine government's sweeping travel restrictions imposed amid the global spread of the 2019 novel coronavirus.
Bureau of Immigration Spokesperson Dana Sandoval disclosed this during a press briefing at Malacañang on Monday, February 3, adding the number included Chinese who wished to return home to China after trips to the Philippines.
""Three hundred Chinese nationals are stranded...because most airlines cancelled their flights [to China],"" Sandoval said.
Apart from the 300 Chinese, Sandoval said other foreigners were also stranded at several terminals, though most have been able to depart as of Monday.
In limbo. The Duterte government on Sunday, February 2, implemented an entry ban against non-Filipinos coming to the country from China, Hong Kong, and Macau. Government authorities have likewise barred Filipinos from leaving the country to travel to China and its special administrative regions.
The sweeping travel restrictions have prompted airlines to follow suit, with several flights to China, Hong Kong, and Macau cancelled in an effort to quell the spread of the coronavirus.
What will happen to Chinese nationals? Sandoval gave assurances affected Chinese who were stranded in the country will be able to return home as the Chinese embassy has pledged to send an aircraft to fetch their nationals stranded in the Philippines.
She likewise urged the public to refrain from unnecessary travel and to bear with government restrictions in the meantime.
The Philippines joined a growing list of countries that have put in place temporary but sweeping travel restrictions on travelers coming from China within the last two weeks. Such bans followed the health officials' announcement that the coronavirus spread to the Philippines and the World Health Organization's (WHO) declaration the outbreak as a global emergency.
Despite this, the WHO warned that closing borders was probably ineffective in halting transmission and could accelerate the virus's spread. Travel restrictions, they added, could also slow the arrival of assistance and support for the management of the virus.
As of Monday morning, February 3, the virus has killed 360 people and infected over 17,000 people worldwide. – Rappler.com

MANILA, Philippines – Vice President Leni Robredo on Sunday, February 2, urged the public not to resort to discrimination against Chinese in the Philippines amid fears over the global spread of the 2019 novel coronavirus .
Robredo said doing so would be ""wrong"" as it was akin to subjecting Chinese nationals , who likewise suffered from the virus, to further difficulty while already being on the frontlines of the infection.
Robredo sought to remind Filipinos that Chinese were not at fault for the emergence of the disease and that the public should focus on battling the virus rather than discriminating against others.
""Lahat naman ginagawa para mahanapan ng lunas iyong sakit na ito. Pero ang pakiusap lang po natin...huwag namang huhusgahan iyong lahat na mga...Chinese citizens, iyong lahat na mga bumibisita dito sa atin. Iyong sa atin po, tama na nag-iingat tayo, tama na temporarily suspended iyong mga flights. Pero ito po, walang iisang may kasalanan tayo, kaya tayo, magtulungan"" Robredo said.
(We're doing everything necessary to find a cure for this disease. What we're asking is do not judge all Chinese citizens in the Philippines. It's okay to be cautious, it is good were being careful, it is right that flights have been temporarily suspended. But this (virus) is not any one person's fault so we should help one another.)
""Hindi po nakakatulong iyong pagbabatikos, hindi po nakakatulong iyong paghuhusga sa iba pang mga nakakasalamuha natin, kasi pare-pareho lang naman po tayo,"" she added. (READ: Racism more dangerous than novel coronavirus – FilChi business group)
(It does not help to ridicule and judge others who we encounter because we're all the same.)
Robredo's reaction to government measures: Meanwhile, the Vice President said the Duterte administration's ban on travelers coming directly from China, Hong Kong, and Macau was a ""welcome development,"" though she lamented restrictions should have been taken sooner.
Robredo likewise downplayed calls for her to lead the country as she urged the Duterte government to take swift precautions against the spread of the coronavirus in the Philippines.
Robredo was referring to a Twitter poll where respondents said they wanted her to lead the country following dissatisfaction over the government's current handling of the situation.
""Iyong solusyon hindi naman ganoon. Pero ang solusyon, mas maging swift lang sana, mas maging aggressive iyong response ng gobyerno, kasi natatakot iyong tao, eh.... Hindi naman natin sinasabi na walang ginagawa, pero hanggang kasi hindi alam ng tao kung ano iyong ginagawa, iyong takot nandoon, eh,"" Robredo said.
(That's not the solution. The solution is to act swiftly and aggressively because the public is worried.... We're not saying the government isn't doing anything but until Filipinos know what is being done, the fear is there.)
Robredo urged President Rodrigo Duterte to publicly address the Filipino people when making statements, saying the public was only looking for assurances the government was taking all necessary steps to protect them.
""Alam natin na very popular si Pangulo, na kapag siya iyong mag-assure sa mga kababayan natin na lahat ginagawa ng pamahalaan, tingin ko hindi ganoon kagrabe iyong takot, eh,"" Robredo said.
(We all know the President is very popular so if he assures our countrymen that the government is doing everything it can, I don't think people will be as scared.)
The latest in the Philippines. Health officials on Sunday confirmed the second case of coronavirus in the country.
The patient, who already died, was said the be the companion of the Philippines' first confirmed case, according to health authorities. Both patients travelled to the Philippines from Wuhan, China.
The patient's death marks the first confirmed death outside of China due to the coronavirus. The WHO stressed, though, the case was not a ""locally-acquired"" as the fatality came from Wuhan.
Robredo reminded the public to practice proper personal hygiene and urged Filipinos to stay calm amid the spread of the coronavirus. 
As of early morning Sunday, February 2, the virus has killed 304 people and infected over 14,000 people worldwide. – Rappler.com

CEBU CITY, Philippines – As fear of being infected with the coronavirus grips Metro Cebu, drugstores here are forced to ration surgical face masks to meet the high demand.
Pharmacies are implementing a ""one box per person"" policy in the purchase of face masks to prevent hoarding.
  During a meeting on Friday, January 31, Cebu City Mayor Edgardo Labella requested the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) to monitor prices of face masks and to also sanction those who are hoarding these.  David Tumulak, chairperson of the City Council Committee on Disaster Risk Reduction and Management,  said that pharmacies caught selling overpriced masks will be charged with violating the Consumer’s Act and the Disaster Risk Reduction Law for hoarding. 
He said 7 pharmacies here are now being investigated for allegedly overpricing the masks.
An official statement by DTI representative Dinah Gladys Oro said there should not be a shortage of face masks in Cebu City as supplies for the Central Visayas region directly arrive here from the National Capital Region (NCR).
The DOH-Central Visayas Center for Health Development said face masks were not the only means to prevent respiratory tract infections. DOH said individuals can have good health through proper rest, diet, proper handwashing and cough etiquette. (READ: Novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV: What we know so far)
Department of Health Central Visayas Director Jaime Bernadas said that the 38-year-old Chinese national from Wuhan, who was the first confirmed patient of the coronavirus in the Philippines, had been in Cebu for only 3 hours as a transit passenger. 
“What we need to do is to be vigilant and to be healthy so we are not susceptible to the virus,” said Bernadas.
The World Health Organization declared the outbreak an international emergency. The death toll is currently at 212 as of Friday, January 31. 
The DOH recommended the use of face masks for those who are sick to help contain spreading the virus. For those going to crowded places and have pre-existing conditions, face masks may help prevent infections. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines– The Federation of Filipino Chinese Chambers of Commerce and Industry Incorporated (FFCCCII) cautioned the public not to resort to racism as the novel coronavirus spreads worldwide, adding that discrimination is more dangerous than the disease.
“Spreading fake news and racist, xenophobic messages can be more dangerous than the virus itself due to their negative effects of causing confusion, fears, rancor and instability,” FFCCCII said in a statement on Saturday, February 1.
The business chamber also reminded Filipinos that China is an important economic partner of the Philippines for a thousand years.
“In fact, we should give moral support and encouragements to China in their valiant efforts to contain this ailment,” FFCCCII said.
The group said it plans to donate a million or more face masks to Filipinos, although the World Health Organization already said that masks are not needed by healthy people with no respiratory symptoms. (READ: FAST FACTS: What's next after novel coronavirus declared an int'l emergency?)

MANILA, Philippines – Adamson University (AdU) drew flak online after it released a memorandum on Friday, January 31, directing Chinese students to observe self-quarantine for two weeks as a precautionary measure against the 2019 novel coronavirus (nCoV). 
This memorandum was released a day after the Department of Health (DOH) confirmed the first case of nCoV in the country – a 38-year-old woman who came from virus epicenter Wuhan and traveled to Cebu and Dumaguete before she was admitted to a government hospital in Manila.
Issued from the Office of the President of Adamson University and posted online by the AdU Student Government, the memorandum stated that this decision was made “to ensure a healthy and virus-free environment.” 
“Thus, we have made a decision that all Chinese students, both graduate and undergraduate, observe self-quarantine starting today until February 14, 2020,” the statement reads.
  
It added that Chinese nationals are advised to postpone all transactions inside the university for the stated period of 2 weeks. 
It also urged professors and students to maximize use of the e-learning system so as not to hamper the continuous delivery of learning for the affected students. 
Meanwhile, local students and all other students will continue with their classes.  
Racism? 
But Filipinos on social media aren’t pleased with the safety precaution ordered by Adamson University to its Chinese students. 
Some of them pointed out how this decision from the University stirred racist attacks on Chinese nationals. 
 




  
Nearly 10,000 people have been infected in China and new cases were found abroad, with more than 20 countries now affected by the disease. (READ: FAQs: Ano-ano ang alam natin tungkol sa 2019 novel coronavirus?)
Why not include travel history?
Some netizens also questioned the memorandum for singling out Chinese students and not the others with a travel history to the affected countries. 
  
  
  
Better communicated
Others defended the university saying that the memorandum was intended for good. Some said that the use of words in the memo should be phrased better. 
  
  
  
  
Soon after the memorandum posted online went on fire, the university apologized to the public. It also made clarifications to its earlier memorandum. 
“The Memorandum modifies the previous one released, and we apologize for the misimpression it may have created,” the statement reads. 
 
It clarified that those ""who travelled to and from countries with confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV, including China and/or Hongkong, within the last month, or who may have in close contact or had exposure to a potential source of infection during their travel abroad” were ordered to observe self-quarantine and seek medical attention for at least 2 weeks. 
It further noted that Chinese students and guests who were not limited by the conditions earlier stated, were not included in those directed to undergo the self-quarantine advisory and would be allowed to enter the campus, as opposed to their earlier statement. 
The university also assured its community that it was working its best to ensure the health and safety of everyone. 
The 2019-nCoV that originated from Wuhan, China, has so far killed 213 and sickened nearly 10,000 people across the country and worldwide. The World Health Organization already declared an international emergency over the virus.

AKLAN, Philippines (UPDATED) – Authorities are monitoring two persons in Dr. Rafael S. Tumbokon Memorial Hospital in Kalibo, Aklan to minimize any chance of exposure to 2019 novel coronavirus acute respiratory disease (2019-nCov ARD).
The first is a 23-year-old flight attendant who came from Wuhan, China on January 21 where she developed cough after 3 days. The cabin crew of that same flight was quarantined in a private isolation room since Thursday, January 30.
Wuhan is considered the epicenter of the 2019-nCov ARD outbreak.
The second, a 17-year-old male Chinese tourist, was also referred by a local hospital in Boracay Island to the Aklan provincial hospital after experiencing flu-like symptoms.
Meanwhile, a flight attendant from Palawan with travel history in Taiwan and Shanghai, China, however, denied she was quarantined in Aklan provincial hospital. She said she was in the hospital to get her medical clearance on January 31, Friday.
On January 28, 3 foreigners were discharged from the Aklan provincial hospital after the results of their tests for the 2019-nCov came out negative.
Provincial Health Officer I Dr. Cornelio Cuachon, Jr. said seaports and airports in Aklan were on heightened alert to step up precautions for the deadly and highly-contagious Wuhan coronavirus. PHO-Aklan was also closely coordinating with Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP) and Bureau of Quarantine (BOQ) to check incoming travelers from other countries.
Kalibo airport manager Eusebio Monserate, Jr said passengers flying to and from Shanghai, Tianjin, Fuzhou, Chengdu, Peking, Nanjing, Hangzhou, Changsha and Wuhan in China on February 1 were affected by the indefinite cancellation of flights.
""Magiging drastic ang pagbaba ng numero ng flights at arrivals ng visitors natin in Kalibo airport. Lahat ng flights to China are suspended until further notice,"" he added.
(The number of flights and arrivals of visitors in Kalibo airport will go down drastically. All of the flights to China are suspended until further notice.)
Monserate said the cancellation of around 20 commercial flights was a precautionary measure to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus, which has killed 213 people in mainland China.
Amid the coronavirus outbreak in Hubei province, the Aklan Medical Society urged the public on January 31 to observe good personal hygiene and stay healthy at all times to contain the 2019-nCOv ARD.
The common symptoms of coronavirus include breathing difficulties, cough and cold, fever and shortness of breath.
Meantime, the 11 Chinese tourists under medical observation in Kalibo, Aklan returned to China on January 31. They boarded a China Eastern Airlines plane around 2:40 pm, Friday, in Kalibo International Airport to take a four-hour flight en route to Chengdu, China.
Cuachon said the tourists were fit to travel to China after they secured medical clearances from attending doctors.
""They had no flu-like symptoms and they will be closely monitored also in China,"" he added.
The foreigners, who were spending their vacation in Boracay Island, were tracked down by health authorities. Four of them had close contacts with a coronavirus patient in Hong Kong.
On January 24, the Chinese tourists – 7 adults and 4 children – were admitted in Aklan provincial hospital in Kalibo, Aklan. The Chinese nationals were asked to stay in the Gov. Corazon L. Cabagnot Tourism and Training Center in Old Buswang, Kalibo since January 25 for medical observation for 10 to 14 days even without flu-like symptoms.
However, the anxiety of parents and students had grown after health authorities in Aklan confirmed 11 tourists have been isolated. The 'virus scare' also prompted the suspension of classes near the Aklan training center on January 29. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – Health officials are looking at two military facilities as possible quarantine areas for Filipinos returning from Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the outbreak of the novel coronavirus, Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana told reporters on Saturday morning, February 1.
Department of Health (DOH) officials visited the naval station on Caballo Island in Manila Bay on Friday, January 31, and will visit the Drug Rehabilitation Center in Fort Magsaysay in Nueva Ecija on Saturday, Lorenzana added.
In November 2014, the naval station on Caballo Island, near Corregidor Island and a part of Cavite City, served as a quarantine area for least 133 Filipino soldiers who were United Nations Peacekeepers. They had then just arrived in the Philippines after a mission in Liberia amid an outbreak of the Ebola virus in West Africa. None of the peacekeepers tested positive for Ebola.
Meanwhile, the drug treatment and rehabilitation center in Fort Magsaysay was built in late 2016 to house up to 10,000 drug dependents who were expected to surrender to the government in its “war on drugs.”
However, the facility has been mostly vacant, as most illegal drug users who surrendered to authorities were placed on community-based rehabilitation.

CEBU CITY, Philippines – Cebu’s annual water shortage could make the potential novel cornavirus (nCoV 2019) outbreak difficult to control, the World Health Organization (WHO) Philippines told Rappler on Friday, January 31.
“Water shortages affect the spread of the pathogenic organisms, such as bacteria and viruses, because lack of water will limit handwashing and compromise the cleaning and sanitation of health care facilities,” the international health body said in a statement. 
WHO Philippines was responding to our question about the impact of water scarcity, particularly in Cebu, on efforts to combat an outbreak of the 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease.    The Department of Health also recommends frequent hand washing and “good hygiene” to combat the spread of the virus. (READ: Novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV: What we know so far) “It is important that communities and health workers have access to safe and adequate water at all times to protect them from the spread of infection,” the WHO said.Water crisisSince the mid-2000s, however, Metro Cebu, an area where over 2.5 million people live, has been grappling with prolonged rotating water interruptions.   Periods of no water flow can last longer hours and affect more barangays going into the summer months, when there is little to no rainfall.  But even during the most recent rainy season, barangays across Metro Cebu experienced long water interruptions in their homes.  A resident of Barangay Kamputhaw in Cebu City told Rappler through direct message that the village often only gets water between 12 am and 5 am daily, but sometimes for less time than that.  Cebu City resident Jann Banguis sent a video to Rappler of Kamputhaw residents lining up with buckets to get water from a truck.

JM dela Mer of San Isidro, Talisay City, said his barangay currently only gets water from 4 am to 6 am daily.A resident of Barangay Luz in Cebu City reported not having water flow entirely since Thursday, January 30.  The WHO said lack of water would threaten infection prevention and control measures and “will have an impact on health.”   In the summer of 2019, over 30 barangays in Metro Cebu experienced up to 22-hour water outages because both the Jaclupan and Buhisan dams in Metro Cebu had completely dried up. (READ: 22-hour water interruptions expected as Jaclupan dam dries up)  Mayor Edgar Labella met with heads of regional government agencies on Friday to assist the city in planning its response to a potential outbreak.   Much of the discussion was focused on the quarantine of possible virus carriers, making sure hospitals were equipped to deal with patients infected by the virus, and the supply of masks.  Multiple attempts to reach Labella to ask if water distribution or sanitizer supply plans were part of the discussion went unanswered. But he is scheduled to discuss the water crisis in a public forum at the Cebu City Sports Complex on Monday, February 3. More water sources to open In January alone, the Metro Cebu Water District (MCWD) announced 15 separate water interruptions for different barangays.
MCWD spokesperson Charmaine Kara Rodriguez said the supply deficit is currently at 10,000 cubic meters per day, with a total production of 223,000 cubic meters per day. The total demand for water in Metro Cebu was an average of 500,000 cubic meters.   “Supply problems were experienced this month in areas due to leaks, non-operation of wells due to power outages, and maintenance of MCWD facilities,” Kara explained.
She said, however, that new wells scheduled to open in February and March should help add to the daily output of water production.   Additional water supply from Pilipinas Water Resources Incorporated in Mambaling is expected to add 5,000 cubic meters per day, while water sourced from Danao City is expected to add an additional 10,000 cubic meters per day.  But even with the additional sources of water, the supply would still be producing only 47% of total water demand in Metro Cebu.
The MCWD, however, acknowledged that the amount of rainfall that will come in the summer months to replenish the water supply in the Buhisan and Jaclupan dams is unpredictable. While they recognized the important of water in combating the spread of viruses, they still encouraged the public to practice water conservation in their homes.
“MCWD is advising the public to use water wisely so everyone can enjoy it. Let’s conserve where we can so we will have enough supply even during the summer months.” Kara said.   
From 2016 to 2019, Cebu City and the Province of Cebu had declared a state of calamity on diffent occasions due to drought, brought about by El Niño.  When water supply is low, the MCWD said they could deliver water to barangays where there is no service. The water district spokesperson said coordination for water deliveries would be done through the barangays and local government units.The World Health Organization declared the outbreak an international emergency. The death is currently at 212 as of Friday. After the first case of nCoV-2019 was confirmed in the Philippines – a woman who traveled to Manila via Cebu and Dumaguete – President Rodrigo Duterte imposed a ban on travelers from the Wuhan City, the epicenter of the outbreak. The ban includes flights from the rest of Hubei province, China. This would last until the 2019-nCoV threat was over. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – Several schools took extra precautionary measures Friday, January 31, to protect its employees and students from the 2019 novel coronavirus (nCoV).
This move to prevent the spread of the virus came a day after the Department of Health (DOH) confirmed the first case of nCoV in the country.   
Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said that the confirmed patient was a 38-year-old woman who came from virus epicenter Wuhan and traveled to Cebu and Dumaguete before she was admitted to a government hospital in Manila. (READ: FAQs: Ano-ano ang alam natin tungkol sa 2019 novel coronavirus?) 
Close coordination 
In a statement, the Department of Education (DepEd) said that it was in close coordination with DOH officials to implement health guidelines in schools, particularly on decisions for  lockdowns in specific communities. It also urged the schools to cooperate with DOH.
Currently, its efforts are focused on promoting awareness and precautionary measures in schools and their immediate communities, using the information materials from DOH.
“We will consolidate available information from official sources, and discuss further actions, measures and mechanisms for readiness and response,” DepEd assured. 
As of Friday, January 31, DOH added that the number of patients being monitored for 2019-nCoV climbed up to 31 from the 29 people cited by the DOH on Thursday. 
Of the 31, 25 were admitted to hospitals, 5 had been discharged but were still being strictly monitored, and one – a man with a preexisting illness – died but it had yet to be determined if he also had 2019-nCoV.
Due to the increasing number of confirmed cases and deaths, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared an international emergency over the deadly novel coronavirus that killed 212 people and infected over 8,000 worldwide as of early Friday, January 31.  
Reducing the risks
Meanwhile, to reduce the risk of infections, schools in Metro Manila and in some provinces took on the necessary steps to promote the antiseptic technique among students and employees. 
It provided hand sanitizers and rubbing alochol at the entrance of the building and in various counters inside the campus. 
According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), practicing hand hygiene is a simple yet effective way to prevent infection. 
Temperature checks were also done at school entrances.
Face masks were also given to students in some public schools. In Araullo High School for example, face masks were distributed to the students by the Manila City local government. 
According to the Philippine Society for Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (PSMID) and Philippine Hospital Infection Control Society (PHICS), face masks or surgical masks are designed to protect users from droplets and splashes that might cause possible infection. 
Both groups also reminded the public that masks are always worn colored side out.

MANILA, Philippines – Philippine Airlines (PAL) and Cebu Pacific said on Friday, January 31, they had pulled out the planes that were boarded by the Philippines' first novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) patient.
The two airlines issued separate statements on Friday, a day after the Department of Health confirmed a 38-year-old woman as the country's first case of 2019-nCoV. The woman, who also visited Cebu and Dumaguete before heading to Manila, took Cebu Pacific flights on January 21 and a PAL flight on January 25.
PAL said it placed two pilots and 4 cabin crew under quarantine. Meanwhile, the cabin crew and pilots on affected Cebu Pacific flights were also informed about the development, but Cebu Pacific said they showed no symptoms of illness.
Cebu Pacific said the planes that the nCoV patient boarded had been pulled out and disinfected. It said it was also implementing the following preventive measures:

Cleaning and disinfection of aircraft between flights
Ensuring that employees, frontline personnel, and cabin crew wear face masks while on duty
Providing face masks to passengers who show symptoms of illness
Isolating passengers who manifest symptoms of illness in empty rows inside the aircraft during the flight
Coordinating with health authorities in the event that there are passengers suspected of carrying the virus for immediate turnover and further observation

PAL said it was conducting these preventive measures:

Intensive cleaning and disinfection of aircraft used on routes to and from China
Assigning specific aircraft to be used only on China routes, arranging for these aircraft to park at designated remote areas of the Ninoy Aquino International Airport
Filtering of cabin air using special filters and air circulation systems that constantly refresh air on board and filter most coronaviruses
Thermal scanning of all arriving passengers; contributing thermal scanners to domestic airports which may not have the latest facilities
Ensuring the use of face masks by cabin crew and providing face masks to passengers upon request
Adjusting inflight service on China flights
Conducting information campaign at airports and onboard flights
reporting medical concerns in coordinating with health authorities and BoQ

The airlines also tracked down the passengers who might have come into contact with the woman who took flights on both airlines.
In coordination with the DOH and the Bureau of Quarantine, the two airlines informed the patient's co-passengers about the confirmed case so they could have themselves checked. The BoQ will handle the medical observation of the concerned passengers and airline crew.
""We are also working to trace any onward journeys made by these passengers and crew on other flights, in case there is a need for BoQ to contact other people for precautionary medical observation,"" PAL said in a statement on Friday.
Cebu Pacific has reduced its flights between the Philippines, mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau.
PAL is set to reduce flights between Manila and mainland China by more than 50%, starting February 1. PAL has canceled all charter flights from China and has also prohibited accepting passengers from the Hubei province of China.

The World Health Organization declared the outbreak an international emergency, as the death toll climbs to 212 as of Friday. In the Philippines, President Rodrigo Duterte imposed a ban on travelers from Wuhan City – the epicenter of the outbreak – and the rest of Hubei province, China, which would last until the 2019-nCoV threat was over.
The Department of the Interior and Local Government also urged local government units to create their respective coronavirus task force, and to cooperate with the DOH in contact-tracing individuals who encountered the confirmed 2019-nCoV patient.
Health officials advised the public to practice proper hygiene and coughing etiquette, including constant washing of hands and coughing into the crook of the elbow. ('Novel coronavirus or 2019 nCoV: What we know so far) – Rappler.com

MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – The Department of Health (DOH) said on Friday, January 31, that it was monitoring 31 patients for the 2019 novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV.
The latest number is up from the 29 people cited by the DOH on Thursday, January 30.
The DOH said the new patients, admitted to hospitals in Metro Manila and Eastern Visayas, were a Chinese and an American. They traveled separately and came from different regions in China, said Epidemiology Bureau Director Ferchito Avelino. (READ: ‘Novel coronavirus' or 2019 nCoV: What we know so far)
Of the 31, 25 were admitted to hospitals, 5 had been discharged but were still being strictly monitored, and 1 – a man with a preexisting illness – died but it had yet to be determined if he also had 2019-nCoV.
The cases being investigated are in the following regions:

Metro Manila - 19
Mimaropa - 1
Western Visayas - 3
Eastern Visayas - 2
Central Visayas - 4
Northern Mindanao - 1
Davao - 1

Contact tracing
Health officials announced the latest number of PUIs a day after the Philippines confirmed its first case of 2019-nCoV, a 38-year-old woman who came from virus epicenter Wuhan and traveled to Cebu and Dumaguete before she was admitted to a government hospital in Manila to be isolated. 
The DOH said it had begun contact tracing or tracking down people who were on the same flight as the patient Once identified, they would also be isolated and monitored. 
The Philippines' first nCoV patient took a Cebu Pacific flight from Hong Kong to Cebu, a CebGo flight from Cebu to Dumaguete, and a Philippine Airlines flight from Dumaguete to Manila, the DOH said. The DOH said the airlines were cooperating with them.
The DOH said it was also in the process of identifying people other people the patient might have interacted with. This would include finding personnel in hotels and other establishments that the patient went to and putting them under monitoring, but not isolation. 
“We are doing this carefully so we may release the proper advice to the contacts. We don’t want them to hide,” epidemiology bureau head Avelino said.  
Travel ban 
Amid the scare, President Rodrigo Duterte banned travel from Wuhan City and the rest of Hubei province. The Department of Foreign Affairs also said it would repatriate Filipinos in Hubei starting next week. 
The inter-agency task force headed by the DOH was set to meet on Friday to discuss a possible expansion of the travel ban to other regions in China with high incidences of the disease, especially after the World Health Organization declared an international emergency over the deadly novel coronavirus from China.
“What we want is to see the magnitude of cases in (other provinces)…. We’re thinking of setting it to at least 100 cases (before we impose a a ban),” said Health Undersecretary Eric Domingo, adding that they were coordinating with WHO for guidance on the matter.  
Lawmakers had called for a travel ban on all of China and not just Hubei province amid fears of more cases reaching the Philippines. 
As of early morning Friday, January 31, the virus has killed 212 people and infected over 8,000 people worldwide. – Rappler.com

COLD HUNTERS. Tourists enjoy the cold weather at Northern Blossom Flower Park in Atok Benguet. Photo by Mau Victa/Rappler

BAGUIO CITY – Usually cold weather is most welcome here in Baguio. 
But when the temperature dipped to 11.2 degrees at 5 am Friday, January 31, it was met with more anxiety than excitement.
It is the coldest temperature for Baguio this year. Last January 4, the temperature dipped to 11.4 degrees.
In the higher reaches of Benguet, the cold reached 10 degrees, this does not even include the wind chill factor which can bring the cold down to 5 degrees.
If the tailend of amihan or easterly winds is at its last blast, the weather might still get colder.
Last year, it reached its coldest at 9.8 degrees on January 28.
This may be good for the cold hunters. But with the first victim of coronavirus in the Philippines identified last Thursday, January 31, and persons under investigation reaching 53, the cold is actually bad news.
Cold weather is known to serve as an ideal ground for viruses like the common cold and the flu. These viruses  have achieved the ability to spread between people, as they are more stable in cold air, and low humidity helps them to “float” for longer. 
Cold weather also decreases the bodily defenses, allowing viruses to enter the body with ease.
But so far, Baguio is safe from the dreaded coronavirus.
Department of Health-Cordillera (Kagawaran Ng Kalusugan - Cordillera) Infectious Disease Cluster Head Dr. Jennifer Joyce Pira said that there are no persons under investigation (PUI) with regards to the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).
Pira said the DOH-CAR only monitored an individual who arrived from Guangzhou, China but has no history of travel to Wuhan, China and without any known contact with a confirmed 2019-nCoV case. The person also has no known contact with individuals with severe acute respiratory illness or sick animals.
She said that although the individual and two of his roommates are under quarantine, they are all doing well and show no signs of illnesses.
The DOH-CAR stressed that there are no cases of 2019-nCoV in the Cordillera region to date. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – A day after the Department of Health (DOH) confirmed the Philippines' first case of novel coronavirus, the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) called on all local government units (LGUs) to create their respective task forces to help contain the spread of the virus.
""All LGUs nationwide are advised to create their respective task forces to implement DOH protocols and guidelines and extend full cooperation to the DOH and other government agencies to meet the world health emergency,"" DILG Undersecretary Jonathan Malaya said in a statement on Friday, January 31.
Malaya said Interior Secretary Eduardo Año was prompted to give the directive after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared an international emergency in relation to the novel coronavirus outbreak that has killed 212  people in China alone as of Friday.
The DILG said the task force will be led either by the governor or the mayor, who will ensure that local health personnel have the necessary equipment and protective gear.
The task force will also handle the referral and transport of constituents suspected of  2019-nCoV infection to a DOH-designated hospital.
Local chief executives,  in coordination with the DOH, are also expected to train health workers on 2019-nCoV prevention, containment, and control. LGUs must also conduct information campaigns on the virus in their areas.
The DILG said that LGUs hosting international airports must coordinate with the Bureau of Immigration and airport authorities to ensure the implementation of quarantine procedures. 
LGUs are expected to cooperate with the DOH in the latter's contact-tracing of individuals who encountered a confirmed 2019-nCoV patient.
""The mayor should immediately inform the DOH should there be reasonable basis to place an individual under quarantine. The DOH needs the support of all LGUs in this important matter and local and police authorities should extend all possible assistance in this regard,"" Malaya said.
On Friday, the WHO declared a public health emergency of international concern, citing ""potential for the virus to spread to countries with weaker health systems.""
In the Philippines, President Rodrigo Duterte imposed a ban on travelers from Wuhan City – the epicenter of the outbreak – and the rest of Hubei province, China, which would last until the 2019-nCoV threat was over.
Other countries have taken their own precautionary measures to stem the disease. Russia had shut its border with China and would stop issuing electronic visas to Chinese nationals. A number of airlines had either halted or reduced flights to China.
The public is advised to practice proper hygiene and coughing etiquette, including constant washing of hands and coughing into the crook of the elbow. ('Novel coronavirus or 2019 nCoV: What we know so far) – Rappler.com "

BATANGAS, Philippines – Vice President Leni Robredo urged President Rodrigo Duterte’s administration to take “immediate action” on recommendations to impose a travel ban on all tourists coming from mainland China as the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a global health emergency  on the novel coronavirus or 2019-nCov.
On Friday, January 31, Robredo said the government should not waste time in ensuring Filipinos are safe, especially after the World Health Organization declaring an international emergency over the deadly new disease. 
“Wala na tayong panahon para sa mahabang usapan. Buhay ng tao ang nakasalalay kaya agarang aksyon, tamang impormasyon at mabilisang desisyon ang kailangan,” the Vice President said.
(We should not waste time by holding long discussions. The lives of people are at stake here, so immediate action, the right information, and fast decision-making are needed.)
As of Friday, the number of confirmed deaths from the coronavirus outbreak has risen to 212  after worst-hit Hubei province reported 42 new fatalities. (READ: What we know so far on the novel coronavirus)
Robredo cited several recommendations to respond to the new disease, including a temporary travel ban on all Chinese mainlanders as well as putting in place the necessary support system for Filipinos in areas with recorded cases, including possible evacuation procedures.
“Bawat minutong ipapagbukas pa ang pag-aksyon sa mga rekomendasyong ito, lalong nailalagay sa panganib ang kapakanan at kalusugan ng ating mga mamamayan,” Robredo said. 
(Every minute we spend delaying actions on these recommendations means further risking the well-being and health of our people.)
What now?
Philippine lawmakers have already urged the government to issue a temporary travel ban to and from China. The country has only temporarily stopped issuing visas to travelers from Hubei, China, the epicenter of the novel coronavirus that has so far killed 212 people there.
The government is calling for the repatriation of Filipino workers in China. On Thursday, January 30, the governor of Iloilo province called on Cebu Pacific airline to stop its flights from Hong Kong to the province's international airport. Boracay Island is considering  a ban on tourists from China. 
But WHO's emergency committee, an advisory body of international experts, said in a statement that evidence had shown that restricting movement of people and goods during public health emergencies ""may be ineffective and may divert resources from other interventions."" 
""Further, restrictions may interrupt needed aid and technical support, may disrupt businesses, and may have negative effects on the economies of countries affected by the emergencies,"" the committee said.
Asked about the proposed travel ban involving China, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said on Wednesday, January 29, that it would be “very tricky” if the Philippines only imposes it on the neighboring giant, as other countries have recorded cases of the novel coronavirus as well.
A day after Duque’s statement before the House, he confirmed the country’s first case of the 2019-nCov: a 38-year-old Chinese national who flew to Cebu, then Dumaguete in the Philippines from Wuhan City, Hubei’s capital. 
She was later admitted at a government hospital in Manila on January 25, though she was no longer showing symptoms. 
Robredo said on Friday that this health crisis means Filipinos need, now more than ever, a government that would prioritize health.
“Sa panahon ng krisis, dapat makaasa ang taumbayan sa kanyang pamahalaan na walang aaksayahing oras para unahin ang kanilang kapakanan,” she said.

'MINIMAL' ECONOMIC EFFECT. Chinese nationals arriving from Guangzhou are seen wearing face masks at the arrival area of the Ninoy Aquino International Airport in Pasay City. File photo by Ben Nabong/Rappler 
MANILA, Philippines – The government's economic managers are confident that the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) scare would have a minimal impact on Philippine growth.
Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III downplayed the possible effects of the 2019-nCov on the economy, saying that the Philippines has not been widely affected by the virus. (READ: Philippines confirms 1st case of novel coronavirus)
""We are a big enough economy that can handle this thing. We are not going into recession because of it,"" Dominguez said.
Socioeconomic Planning Secretary Ernesto Pernia, meanwhile, said the effect on tourism would be ""short-term.""
The Philippines has so far suspended visa upon arrival for Chinese tourists and businessmen, and temporarily stopped issuing visas to travelers from the Chinese province of Hubei. Wuhan, the city where the virus originated, is in Hubei.
There are strong calls to impose a temporary ban on all travel to and from China.
While the Philippine officials said the health scare would not make much of a dent in the economy internally, they acknowledged that it could be among the external factors that may affect growth in the medium term.
The economic team, composed of Dominguez, Pernia, and Budget Secretary Wendel Avisado, met on Thursday to discuss the country's economic performance and to ""forge a strategy"" to achieve the gross domestic product (GDP) growth target of 6.5% to 7.5% in 2020.
Aside from the 2019-nCov, the economic team identified the slowdown in global economic growth, lackluster recovery in trade, protectionist policies, and volatile oil prices, among others, as possible primary downside risks externally.
On the domestic front, the economic team said natural hazards, African swine fever, water supply disruptions, slow implementation of infrastructure projects, and policy ""uncertainties"" – such as the delayed passage of tax reform packages – could hinder the economic growth trajectory in the medium term.
They also said that the implementation of the Supreme Court ruling increasing local government units' share of national taxes may hinder growth, citing inefficient spending by LGUs.
Because of the risks, Dominguez said infrastructure agencies should accelerate the implementation of priority projects.
He added that the agriculture sector should grow at least 2% annually. In 2019, agriculture posted the slowest growth among major sectors at 1.5%.
Digital trade, speeding up the rollout of the 3rd major telecommunications player, and addressing regulatory issues in the e-commerce industry, among others, were seen as part of strategies to address the risks to economic growth.
The Philippines missed its GDP growth target in 2019, growing by 5.9% – the slowest in 8 years.
The economic team largely attributed that to the delayed passage of the national budget, which had stalled infrastructure projects. – Rappler.com "

On Thursday, January 30, Filipinos expressed their dismay over the Philippine government’s refusal to ban travels to and from mainland China. This, after the Department of Health (DOH) confirmed the Philippines’ first case of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).
During the House of Representatives’ question hour on Wednesday, January 29, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III explained that the government is not yet considering imposing a travel ban on tourists coming from mainland China because “confirmed cases are not limited to China.”
“If we do this, then the concerned country – China in this case – might question why we’re not doing the same for all other countries that have reported cases of the new coronavirus. It’s very tricky… but we commit to take this into consideration,” Duque said. 
Netizens slammed the decision, saying that the government’s actions – or the lack of which – would kill Filipinos faster than the virus could.

MANILA, Philippines – As the Philippines confirmed its first case of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), senators are urging the government to issue a temporary travel ban to and from China.
In separate statements, Senate President Pro-Tempore Ralph Recto, senators Risa Hontiveros, Joel Villanueva, and Christopher ""Bong"" Go supported the call.
Hontiveros proposed a temporary travel ban of at least 30 days on all individuals traveling from China, as well as travellers who passed through China within the past two weeks.  (READ: ’Novel coronavirus’ or 2019 nCoV: What we know so far)
""Our travel ban must firmly include both air and sea travel to prevent a local outbreak. This includes a temporary ban on all cruise ships from docking at any of our ports,"" Hontiveros said.
Recto questioned why the Philippines has yet to implement a travel ban, saying that Hong Kong, a special administrative region of China, had already announced plans to slash cross-border travel.
""I think it is time to put a temporary 'Do not enter sign' on our doorstep for visitors from China. Let us explain to them that we are not permanently closing our doors. This is not a permanent Great Wall. This is only during the duration of the coronavirus crisis,"" Recto said.
""If many of their (Chinese) people are not allowed to travel from Point A to B in China, then why are we allowing travel from most points in China to all points in the Philippines?"" Recto added.
The Senate president pro-tempore said that this was not an issue of racism.
""There is no hint of racism or xenophobia in this policy. This is an assertion of the national wellbeing. And an acceptance of the fact that our defenses and capacity to respond to a health emergency is not that strong,"" Recto said.
Go, meanwhile, said that he supports the call for a travel ban but will wait for the recommendation of health officials. Go, the Senate health committee head, will hold a hearing on the novel coronavirus on Tuesday, February 4.
""Antayin lang natin ang kanilang rekomendasyon. Kung sakali, pabor ako diyan para maiwasan po itong pagkalat. (Let's wait for their recommendation. If ever, I am in favor of this call to prevent it from spreading),"" Go said in an interview with Radyo Pilinas.
Deployment to China
Villanueva, the Senate labor committee chairperson, urged overseas Filipino workers to postpone their deployment to China to minimize the risk of getting affected.
For those already in quaratined areas in China, Villanueva said: ""Please follow the health protocol being observed in the area. Help our diplomatic staff there by notifying your status so that every Filipino is accounted for.""
Villanueva also urged the Department of Labor and Employment to issue a labor advisory that would remind private companies of their obligations with labor standards, particulary the Occupational Safety and Health Standards law.
""Our labor officials should seize the moment to reiterate that the health and safety of our workers must be of paramount concern to employers. Our OSHS law states this principal clearly and unequivocally,"" Villanueva said.
Health Secretary Francisco Duque III on Thursday, January 30, announced the first confirmed case of 2019-nCoV in the country. The patient is a 38-year-old woman who traveled from Wuhan, China, the ground zero of the outbreak, via Hong Kong, on January 21. 
The virus has claimed 170 lives in China and infected thousands of people in that country alone.  Travel to and from Wuhan had been restricted, as the government halted the issuance of visas to travelers from Hubei province.
The Philippines on Tuesday, January 28 had already suspended visa upon arrival for Chinese visitors due to health threat. The Civil Aeronautics Board had also suspended all airline operations between Wuhan and any destination in the Philippines. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – The Philippine Stock Exchange index (PSEi) continued to slip on Thursday, January 30, as concerns surrounding the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) lingered globally.
The bellwether PSEi lost over 69 points or 0.9% and fell to 7,392. This is the PSEi’s new one-year low since December 26, 2018. 
Net foreign selling at the local stock market stood at -$10.1 million after the -$6.9 million registered on Wednesday, January 29.

The peso also weakened to P50.96 to $1 on Thursday, the weakest in a week and among the weakest in 3 weeks.
Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation chief economist Michael Ricafort attributed the depreciation to ""increased global risk aversion"" of investors to most Asian currencies due to the novel coronavirus cases.
Ricafort said the following businesses are likely to take a hit due to the coronavirus scare:

Travel
Tourism
MICE (meetings, incentives, conventions, exhibitions)
Airlines
Hotels and accommodation
Leisure
Entertainment
Gaming and casinos
Restaurants
Catering
Retail trade

However, Ricafort noted that the Philippine economy is less dependent on foreign tourism as the main source of economic growth. 
""Thus, the adverse effects of any slowdown in tourism business due to the coronavirus, especially if temporary and eventually contained, could have less or minimal impact on the local economy or GDP (gross domestic product) growth compared to other ASEAN or Asian countries that are more dependent on tourism and exports as major contributors to their respective economies or GDP,"" Ricafort said.

MANILA, Philippines (3rd UPDATE) – The Philippines on Thursday, January 30, confirmed its first case of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).
The Philippines' first 2019-nCoV patient is among the 29 people monitored by the Department of Health (DOH), Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said in a news briefing on Thursday.  (WATCH: DOH updates on 2019 novel coronavirus) 
Duque said the patient is a 38-year-old woman who traveled to the Philippines from Wuhan, China, via Hong Kong on January 21. She is currently in a government hospital, where she was admitted on January 25, but was no longer showing symptoms.
DOH Epidemiology Bureau Director Ferchito Avelino said authorities would check the establishments that she went to and trace employees she had been in contact with.
The samples from the Chinese woman was among the 6 sent to the Victorian Infectious Disease Reference Laboratory in Australia for testing earlier this week. The 5 others tested negative. 
Succeeding tests for 2019-nCoV will now be done by the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM), as the DOH has already acquired the necessary test kit for the procedure, the results of which may be available within 24 hours of testing.
Wuhan is the epicenter of the outbreak that had claimed 170 lives in China and infected thousands of people in that country alone. Other confirmed cases have been reported in several countries. (READ: ’Novel coronavirus’ or 2019 nCoV: What we know so far)
Travel to and from Wuhan had been restricted, as the government halted the issuance of visas to travelers from Hubei province. 
Duque said on Thursday that he would recommend that travel restrictions be expanded in light of the first confirmed case. The Inter-agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases would meet on Friday, January 31, to discuss other government measures. 
'Stay calm'
The Philippine health chief appealed for sobriety amid the country's first case of 2019-nCoV.
“I assure the public that the Department of Health is on top of this evolving situation. We were able to detect the first confirmed case because of our strong surveillance system, close coordination with the World Health Organization and other national agencies,"" he said.
""I advise the public to stay calm and be vigilant at all times,"" Duque added.
The 29 patients under investigation are in the following areas:

Metro Manila - 18
Cental Visayas - 4
Western Visayas - 3
MIMAROPA -1
Eastern Visayas - 1
Northern Mindanao - 1 
Davao - 1

Of these patients, 23 were admitted in hospitals, 5 were discharged but remained under strict monitoring, while 1 died of pneumonia on Wednesday, January 29, at the San Lazaro Hospital but was still being tested for the 2019-nCoV virus.
Health officials reminded the public to practice proper hygiene and constant washing of hands, as well as proper coughing etiquette or coughing into the crook of the elbow, amid the virus scare. They also reassured the public that DOH hospitals, with their respective isolation areas, were ready to respond to the disease.  – Rappler.com

MANILA, Philippines – Health Secretary Francisco Duque III confirmed that the Department of Health (DOH) now has the capability to test samples for the novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV, no longer needing to send them to Australia for confirmation.
The primer needed to identify if suspected cases are positive for 2019 nCoV have been acquired from Japan, Duque said during a question hour before the House of Representatives on Wednesday, January 29. (WATCH: House question hour with health chief Duque on novel coronavirus)
The primer will allow the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM), the health department’s research arm, to determine ""within 48 hours"" whether samples from persons under investigation are positive for 2019-nCoV, which has infected over 6,000 in China and beyond, and killed over 130 in China, most of them in the city of Wuhan.
Initially, the RITM could only test samples for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the coronaviruses that caused outbreaks of SARS or severe acute respiratory syndrome and MERS or Middle East respiratory syndrome. 
The DOH had been sending samples to the Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory in Melbourne, Australia, prior to the acquisition of the 2019-nCoV primer. Duque said the 2019-nCoV primer would cut testing time “by 50%.” 
The Australian laboratory is currently processing 6 samples from the Philippines for 2019-nCoV, the results of which are expected either by Thursday, January 30, or Friday, January 31. All samples after these will be tested by the RITM.
What’s the latest on 2019-nCoV? The DOH confirmed on Wednesday, January 29, that a man under investigation for 2019-nCoV died early that day of complications due to pneumonia. (READ: 'Novel coronavirus' or 2019 nCoV: What we know so far)
The 29-year-old was a man from Yunnan, China, and had “many swollen lymph nodes,” renal warts, and was tested for HIV. The hospital director of San Lazaro Hospital in Manila, where the patient had been admitted since Monday, January 27, said the man tested positive for HIV. The DOH said it would still run tests on samples collected from the deceased patients to confirm if he had 2019-nCoV. 
Meanwhile, the government temporarily stopped issuing visas to travelers not just from Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, but also Hubei province on Tuesday night, January 28. The Department of Foreign Affairs also said it would assist all Filipinos in Wuhan who wish to be repatriated. So far, two have come home and are under self-quarantine, the DOH confirmed. 
The DOH also met with all regional health directors on Wednesday to discuss local response to the emerging threat. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – A man who was among those being monitored for the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in the national capital died of complications due to pneumonia, the Department of Health (DOH) said on Wednesday, January 29. 
San Lazaro Hospital Director Edmundo Lopez said in a news briefing that the 29-year-old man from Yunnan, China, died early Wednesday morning but stressed that he was not yet a confirmed case of 2019-nCoV. Tests would still be conducted on samples to be taken from him.
""Cause of death is pneumonia.... The patient was seen with various symptoms upon admission,"" Lopez said, when asked to confirm if one of the patients under investigation had died.
Lopez said the man was admitted to San Lazaro Hospital in Manila on Monday, January 27. Upon admission, Lopez said the man had ""many swollen lymph nodes,"" renal warts, and was tested for HIV. He said the patient ""tested positive"" twice for HIV during the initial and confirmatory tests. (READ: ’Novel coronavirus’ or 2019 nCoV: What we know so far)

PROTEST. Residents and local leaders ask the Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority to temporarily ban the arrival of cruise ships in Subic. All photos from Randy Datu/Rappler 
ZAMBALES, Philippines – The Subic tour of cruise ship MV World Dream was canceled due to intense pressure from residents and local leaders for the Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority (SBMA) to temporarily stop accepting cruise ships amid the novel coronavirus scare.
The cruise ship from China arrived in Manila on Tuesday, January 28, and its 778 passengers were ""authorized to travel"" by the Bureau of Quarantine.
Scheduled to arrive in Subic on Wednesday, January 29, the ship instead decided to cancel its arrival and head back to Hong Kong.
In a January 28 letter, Olongapo Mayor Rolen Paulino Jr urged SBMA Chairman and Administrator Wilma Eisma to ""temporarily stop accepting cruise ships until the (novel coronavirus) threat has been controlled.""
He cited the ""uncertainty and lack of information"" on the novel coronavirus, the virus that originated from Wuhan, China, and has so far killed at least 106 and sickened thousands across China and several other countries. 
Paulino also noted that ""infected persons do not manifest any of its symptoms until much later.""
He said temporarily stopping cruise ships from docking in Subic ""would not be unprecedented considering that various cities worldwide have implemented lockdowns in response to this disease.""
'Loss of income'
The night before, Eisma issued a statement that said, ""I have personally discussed the Subic situation with Health Secretary Francisco Duque today and confirmed to him that safety protocols are in place at the Port of Subic.""
""He advised that there is not a need just yet to stop the entry of cruise ships in Subic in view of established safety measures in the Freeport,"" she added. 
The SBMA initially highlighted the supposed loss of income that could occur if the arrival of cruise ships was rejected, but this only angered residents even more.
""As an emerging cruise ship destination in Southeast Asia, Subic expects to be adversely affected by this ongoing health emergency,"" Eisma earlier said. 
Eisma was also in the habit of asking SBMA employees to physically welcome passengers of cruise ships at the dock upon their arrival, but none were willing this time. A rumor even circulated that SBMA tourism employees would not report for work if the cruise ship was allowed to dock. 
On Tuesday, as the uproar from residents and Subic workers grew, Paulino pleaded with Eisma to ""please err on the side of caution and put primacy in the health and safety of the residents and workers of SBFZ (Subic Bay Freeport Zone) and the city and municipalities surrounding it.""
Subic Mayor Jonathan John Khonghun also sent a letter to Eisma, saying ""let us join hands to be more cautious, giving priority to the health and safety of the people in our locality.""

Backlash
It was also reported that tourism establishments in the Subic Freeport were pushing behind the scenes and working with the Subic Bay Freeport Chamber of Commerce to temporarily suspend the arrival of cruise ships.
Robert Gonzaga, president and CEO of Subic Bay Marine Exploratorium Inc (SBMEI), said in a statement: ""The SBMA has issued guidelines on how to deal with this, but they should do more to address the core issue of a temporary ban on cruise ship visits. For our part, we will refuse access to our park to cruise ship visitors if they do not comply with SBMA guidelines, and our [government's] health and safety policies."" 
SBMEI is the corporate owner and operator of Ocean Adventure, Adventure Beach Waterpark, and Camayan Beach Resort and Hotel – top attractions in the Freeport.
Gonzaga said that more important considerations should be prioritized over short-term income.
""We have put in place several measures to protect our guests, as well as our employees, from any health risk associated with the coronavirus. We want to reassure the public that safety comes first, last, and always for SBMEI,"" he added.
The backlash to Eisma's stance on the issue culminated in a rally in front of the main gate of the Subic Freeport, where about 200 residents and Freeport workers brandished signs that read: ""No to cruise ships in the meantime,"" ""Konting malasakit naman SBMA,"" and ""Mas mahalaga ba ang kita kesa sa kaligtasan ng mamamayan ng Olongapo?""
While the rally was ongoing, cheers went up as news broke that the MV World Dream has decided to cancel its visit to Subic.
For her part, Eisma immediately took to Facebook and posted a statement saying, in part, that the cruise visit ""has been canceled by Genting Cruise Lines, the operator of the cruise liner, in face of the circumstances on the ground.""
She said that the Subic Bay Freeport community can ""breathe a sigh of relief in the outcome that, we hope, is acceptable and satisfactory to all.""
Despite this announcement, however, the SBMA is still silent on whether or not a temporary ban on cruise ships is already in place in the Subic Bay Freeport. 
Among the groups that exerted pressure on the SBMA were Batang Gapo People's Organization Incorporated, Olongapo City local government units, Aeta leaders, all 17 barangay captains, and other people's organizations.
""Why would we put ourselves in harm's way if we can prevent it? If in their own country, they have already implemented a lockdown, why can't we do the same here?"" Barangay Gordon Heights Captain Priscilla Echie Ponge, one of the 17 barangay captains, said. – Rappler.com "

AKLAN, Philippines – Eleven Chinese tourists – 7 adults and 4 children – tracked down in a resort on Boracay Island are under medical observation by the Provincial Health Office (PHO) of Aklan for possible exposure to the novel coronavirus. 
Four of them were in close contact with an infected coronavirus patient in Hong Kong, Provincial Health Officer I Dr. Cornelio Cuachon Jr said on Tuesday, January 28.  
The 11 Chinese nationals from Hubei province were supposed to spend a one-month vacation in Boracay when Hong Kong authorities alerted the Philippine health officials to conduct intensive contact-tracing. Hubei has been on lockdown, limiting the movements of some 60 million people, since the new coronavirus broke out in its capital city of Wuhan last December.  
The tourists traveled from Hong Kong to Kalibo via Manila on January 22. Seven other Chinese people were traced by health authorities in close contacts with the 4 Chinese tourists in Boracay Island. 
It was not immediately known if the 4 Chinese who were in close contact with a confirmed case in Hong Kong were the family who landed in Manila on January 22 via Cebu Pacific, and which the Bureau of Immigration was supposed to have already tracked.  
The patients were transported to Kalibo town on Friday evening, January 24, for medical observation.  
They are staying in hotel rooms at the government-run Governor Corazon L. Cabagnot Tourism and Training Center in Old Buswang, Kalibo Old Buswang, Kalibo for the next 14 days. 
Cuachon emphasized there is still no confirmed cases of 2019-nCov in the province of Aklan and in the Philippines.   
""They had no flu-like symptoms, no cough or fever. They are made to stay at the training center because they might be at risk of hospital acquired-pneumonia if we admitted them. The 4 Chinese tourists had close contacts with one confirmed coronavirus patient in Hong Kong. The 7 other Chinese who are with these 4 in Boracay are also under medical observation,"" Cuachon said in a mix of English and Filipino. 
“We are monitoring them every day. After the 14-day incubation period, they will be allowed to go back to China, with the help of the Chinese embassy, and will have to cut short their vacation in Boracay,” Cuachon added. 
3 earlier patients discharged 
Meanwhile, the 3 patients were discharged from isolation rooms at the Dr. Rafael S. Tumbokon Memorial Hospital (DRSTMH) in Kalibo were discharged by attending doctors on January 28. 
A 6-year-old boy initially admitted in the Dr. Ciriaco H. Tirol Hospital in Boracay Island was referred to the Aklan provincial hospital on January 23 for exhibiting flu-like symptoms. 
Cuachon said the child, who had a history of travel to Wuhan in Hubei province, yielded negative results on coronavirus infection, based on tests conducted by the Philippines Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM). 
“He had influenza, not novel coronavirus,” Cuachon said. 
Sample specimens were also taken from two female siblings, aged 8 and 6, from Shanghai, China, who had been admitted to the Aklan provincial hospital on January 26. These were sent to RITM for confirmatory tests. 
In efforts to keep coronavirus from spreading, PHO-Aklan is coordinating with the Department of Health and the Bureau of Quarantine in monitoring the arrival of passengers in ports and airports in the province.
Cuachon urged the public to avoid contact with farm and wild animals, going to crowded places, and contact with sick individuals.  
On Saturday, January 25, Aklan health authorities sent back to Wuhan 80 Boracay-bound tourists. They were part of the group which left the epicenter city a few hours before it was locked down by Chinese authorities. 
Since December 2019, the Wuhan coronavirus has been reported in China, France, Australia, Vietnam, South Korea, Singapore, Nepal, Germany, Japan, Macau, Thailand, Taiwan, Malaysia, Canada, Hong Kong, United States, and Sri Lanka.
The World Health Organization said the common symptoms of novel coronavirus include cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties, and fever. – Rappler.com

MANILA, Philippines – The Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) will ""support"" the Philippine National Police in enforcing the lockdown of Metro Manila that will begin at midnight on Sunday, March 15.
An effort to prevent the novel coronavirus from spreading further, the so-called ""community quarantine"" of the capital region may last until April 14, although the government said it may be lifted earlier if the need for it dissipates.
On Saturday afternoon, hours before the start of the lockdown, the AFP shared these videos of its Joint Task Force-National Capital Region (JTF-NCR) rehearsing their procedures in inspecting motorists at checkpoints. One of the videos shows how they would respond to a person who might resist being barred from either entering or leaving the metropolis. (READ: LIST: Who can cross into, exit Metro Manila during coronavirus lockdown)
""This is how it will look like when the community quarantine is implemented for the passenger bus and private vehicles when they enter the borders going to Manila. So we recommend that it is better if they will follow the sitting capacity of the bus on their every journey to avoid stalling at checkpoints,"" said AFP JTF-NCR spokesperson 1st Lieutenant Arrianne Bichara.

In this third video, soldiers demonstrate how they would prevent a person from trying to dodge a checkpoint.

The military task force ""will strictly impose protocols."" Civilians who have a fever or show other possible symptoms of the virus, or those who have no urgent business in Metro Manila will be prohibited by troops from proceeding.

,"March 14, 2020",nCov,[OPINION] Notes from a supermarket on the last day of freedom,Marguerite de Leon,"
 
I write this just minutes after returning from the supermarket. We had headed there to buy ingredients for dinner – just one dinner, tonight’s dinner, just enough sinigang for two – but knew full well the bedlam we were about to face.  
Since last week, and more so now that the coronavirus-borne lockdown is hours away, supermarkets and pharmacies across Metro Manila have been choked with panic-buyers, hoarding canned goods and packed snacks, whole liters of disinfectant and alcohol, and, inexplicably, rolls and rolls and rolls of toilet paper.  
The end times, it seems, asks for maximum absorbency.  
But it’s important to note that we had headed to Rustan’s Supermarket at Shangri-La Plaza mall, a high-end grocery catering to gated village residents and expats (we are neither, but it was the nearest spot to us at the time, and we are admittedly middle-class enough to get by). 
A study in contrasts 
It’s already unnerving to be in any kind of supermarket at the peak of a panic pandemic, but there’s something particularly sinister in the air when you know a lot of the people in these aisles will head back in cars to comfortable homes, to pantries that were full to begin with, to lives where money trouble means a failed business investment and not an empty wallet and a chorus of grumbling stomachs. 
There was a part of me that wanted to stand in front of the checkout aisles and shout at all the folks nursing their loaded carts: “STOP IT! STOP BEING SO SELFISH! Andaming nagugutom sa mundo! I don’t care if you’re just looking out for your family! You should look out for EVERYONE! What the hell are you going to do with all that tuna? How much toilet paper does your ass need? Why can’t we all just calm the fuck down and stop pretending the outdoors is a nuclear hellscape? (READ: [OPINION] Let’s not forget the poor during the coronavirus pandemic)
But there was a part of me – a huge part of me – that also wanted to grab as much food as I could carry before the next wave of Valle Verde titas could get to them.
And it wasn’t exactly because I felt pressured by the chaos, but because I knew what these hoarders were fearing the most. 
The blind leading the blind 
It wasn’t the virus. That was the least of people’s worries. There was something far worse, and that was the crippling uncertainty stretched out before them for who knows how long – an uncertainty over an uncertainty – because we have government officials who would rather baby an old man who literally cannot express a series of coherent thoughts, and were not fit for their positions to begin with, as they were chosen by said old man for their loyalty and not their competence. (READ: IN PHOTOS: Mass exodus before Metro Manila 'lockdown')
And now the rhythm of our lives is at their mercy. And we don’t know what that will mean for us. We don’t know what will come of all this. So we default to thinking only of ourselves, and avert our thoughts and consciences from the poverty and injustice that surrounds us, because it is the only thing we can do in a country that, frankly, has never truly protected any of us from harm. 
And that makes us horrible people. And we are aware of that, and accept that, unconsciously or not.  
So while I was standing there amid empty shelves, staring at the last two cartons of eggs just waiting to be snatched in rabid triumph, I was trying not to cry. 
Because this uncertainty, this chaos, and this selfishness, I realize, is nothing new to any of us. It has always been here, has spread far and burrowed deep, has been a grave illness whose cure we have yet to discover. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – Labor groups have slammed what they called inadequate government measures to cushion the impact of the novel coronavirus outbreak on workers' livelihood and income.
In a statement on Saturday, March 14, the Bukluran ng Manggagawang Pilipino (BMP) said the recommendation of the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) to reduce work hours and work days through the enforcement of a rotational workforce would hurt no-work-no-pay workers the most.
They also chided Trade Secretary Ramon Lopez for suggesting that workers who live outside the region should just rent a place in Metro Manila.
BMP called such measures ""inconsiderate, grossly anti-poor, and arithmetically improbable.""
""To take away our measly incomes for an entire month or ask us to make good with so little is already lethal if not fatal to our well-being,” said BMP vice president Dominic Dilao.
DOLE had recommended the flexible work arrangement in preparation for the Metro Manila lockdown which begins on Sunday, March 15. 
Malacañang had clarified that those who have work in Metro Manila are exempted from the travel restriction, but they would have to present a valid work IDs or to proof of employment. 
DOLE said in a new guideline on Saturday that manufacturing, retail and service establishments are ""advised"" to stay open during the lockdown, but they must observe social distancing and other safety and health measures.
The BMP said this could potentially expose workers to the new coronavirus, as many factories have poor sanitation, and with no running water.
The BMP demanded employers to provide free testing kits to their workers. The Department of Health (DOH) said that the COVID-19 test kit developed by scientists from the University of the Philippines (UP), which gives faster results and are cheaper, may be rolled out on Monday, March 16.
“We have toiled so much and are solely responsible for the profits and success of companies, it's about time we are paid back as part of our fair share of the pie during these trying times,” said Dilao.
No word from management
Labor group Trade Union Congress of the Philippines (TUCP) said workers, both unionized and non-unionized, have come to them complaining that their company managements have yet to issue coronavirus protocols.
""Rank-and-file employees wonder why their employers delay or ignore discussions about workplace policy toward a likely lockdown,"" said TUCP president Raymond Mendoza. 
In the DOLE guideline, those who will file for leaves of absence over COVID-19 would lose actual leave credits.
Mendoza said DOLE must hold a dialogue with workers to come up with beneficial policies.
""The DOLE must step in and not allow dissension swell among the ranks. They must push the employees and employers formulate viable and acceptable mechanics unique to their industry and line of business in keeping productivity competitive without diminution of wages and benefits on the part of workers,"" Mendoza said.
Unemployment benefit
Meanwhile, Surigao sel Sur 2nd District Representative Johnny Pimentel said those who have been retrenched because of the economic impact of the coronavirus may avail of the unemployment insurance benefit by the Social Security System (SSS).
SSS can provide a one-off unemployment insurance benefit that's equivalent to his or her average monthly salary. (FAST FACTS: What is the SSS unemployment benefit?)
“The financial aid may not be much, but it will help. And the benefit is a handout. It is not a loan. The laid off worker does not have to pay it back,” Pimentel said.
Pimentel said this covers even overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) – particularly those working at cruise ships – whose contracts were cut short because of the coronavirus pandemic. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – The UST Junior Growling Tigresses and the Adamson Lady Baby Falcons have been declared co-champions in the inaugural UAAP Season 82 girls basketball tournament on Saturday, March 14. 
This comes after the release of a league memorandum terminating all ongoing or pending high school tournaments following the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdown of Metro Manila.
Led by MVP Cris Padilla and Mythical Team members Kat Agojo and Abegail Amdad, Adamson forced a winner-take-all finals contest after taking down UST, 79-74, in Game 2 last Monday, March 9. 
That same day, the Nazareth-NU Bullpups escaped the incoming league suspension by downing the FEU-Diliman Baby Tamaraws for the boys' title and a rare 16-0 season sweep.

MANILA, Philippines (3rd UPDATE) – The Department of Health (DOH) at 9 pm, Saturday, March 14, announced 13 additional confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus in the country, bringing the total number of cases to 111.
Like in its earlier reports, the DOH said: ""The details of these new cases are currently being validated by our teams and will be provided to the public as soon as the information is available and verified by the Department. In addition, we are also verifying reports of additional cases."" 
The DOH also said that the Rizal Medical Center in Pasig City reported that some of its personnel were exposed to the coronavirus.
""DOH is still verifying data on the exact figures and the updated conditions of the health workers,"" it said.
Health Assistant Secretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said during the press conference on Saturday that they are enforcing strict infection prevention and control procedures in hospitals, including the Philippine Heart Center.
Vergeire said that these hospitals would continue operating.
""'Yung operations ng ating ospital, hindi dapat matigil (Hospital operations must continue),"" she said. 
Death rate 
Eight people have died in the Philippines, so far.
Vergeire said those who died were patients who were considered as most vulnerable because of their age and preexisting illnesses.
""Sila po 'yung mga matatanda, elderly, at 'yun pong mga may underlying condition, maliban sa COVID-19 gaya ng diabetes, sakit sa puso, high blood, cancer, 'yung mga umiinom ng gamot na nakakababa ng resistensya,"" said Vergeire. 
(These are the elderly and those with underlying conditions like diabetes, heart ailment, high blood pressure, cancer and those who take medicines that weaken one's immunity.)  
Vergeire also reacted to Senate Majority Leader Juan Miguel Zubiri's call for the DOH to ""try drugs already in use"" by countries like South Korea, which the senator linked to lesser death rates.
""We now have one of the highest death rates of COVID-19 cases in the region at almost 10%.... Try the drugs already in use by Thailand, Korea, and India where it seems to be working and they have lessened their death rates,"" said Zubiri.
Vergeire said these drugs must undergo stringent regulatory examinations, since their purpose was not originally to treat the novel coronavirus. There is no known cure for the new virus yet.
""Kailangan nating malaman na ito'y magiging safe and effective kapag ginamit natin ito sa ating mga kababayan duon sa paraan other than the original intention of the medicine (We must know if it will be safe and effective if our countrymen use it for a purpose other than intended),"" said Vergeire.
As for the University of the Philippines (UP)-developed test kits, Vergeire said they are constantly following up with the reference laboratories to begin the rollout.
""So ngayon ang last process ay vinavalidate na po ito ng ating reference laboratory sa Pilipinas, pag nakatapos na po tayo niyan, maaari na po nating gamitin (We are now at the last process which is the validation of the reference laboratory in the Philippines, and once that's done we can begin using it),"" said Vergeire.
Self-quarantine
The DOH said that people who will be travelling from Metro Manila, even those without symptoms, should undergo strict home quarantine for 14 days.
""Travelers from NCR who are out of the region will be considered as Persons Under Monitoring (PUMs),"" said the DOH.
Those travelling from Metro Manila with symptoms such as fever and respiratory symptems are considers Persons Under Investigation (PUIs), and they are advised to seek medical attention from a health facility.

AKLAN, Philippines – The overseas Filipino worker listed as the first person under investigation (PUI) in Aklan on possible coronavirus infection was placed in home isolation and closely monitored by a barangay health response team here, the Provincial Health Office (PHO-Aklan) said.
The seafarer voluntarily approached a doctor in Kalibo, Aklan for check-up on March 12 because he was experiencing mild symptoms of possible coronavirus infection.
Provincial Health Officer I Dr. Cornelio Cuachon, Jr said the PUI, had a travel history to a country with confirmed cases of COVID-19, the sickness caused by the novel coronavirus.
The patient was advised to go on home quarantine under close monitoring by the Municipal Health Office.
Specimen samples from the person were extracted and forwarded to Department of Health (DOH) regional office in Iloilo City, which will endorse this to the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) in Muntinlupa City for testing. 
The quarantined person will be checked regularly for 14 days before the task force will issue a medical certificate based on the protocols set by the Department of Health.
Cuachon clarified only the RITM had the facilities to test samples from persons under investigation.
PUIs are patients with symptoms of cough, shortness of breath, fever, cold and difficulty of breathing within 14 days from exposure, closed contact or exposure to a confirmed case and with travel history to countries with local transmission in the last 14 days.
Cuachon added they also established COVID fast lanes in the parking area of Aklan provincial hospital compound in Kalibo, Aklan for patients with flu-like symptoms. Isolation rooms were also set up for PUIs at Dr. Rafael S. Tumbokon Memorial Hospital to protect the public’s health.
He also reminded the public to be always vigilant and observe proper hygiene, particularly the correct coughing etiquette and washing of hands to prevent infection.
Aside from the new PUI, at least 50 persons are also being monitored (PUMs) continuously by Barangay Health Response Emergency Teams (BHRET) and the provincial COVID task force.

BACK ON PRIMETIME. 'On The Wings of Love' is among the programs that are coming back on air as production for new shows are postponed. Screenshot from ABS-CBN 
MANILA, Philippines – ABS-CBN on Saturday, March 14, announced a new lineup for its primetime block after deciding to stop the taping of all its teleseryes. The announcements were made in compliance with government guidelines for a Metro Manila lockdown to manage the coronavirus outbreak.  
""Starting 16 March 2020, we are bringing back our classic teleseryes and airing iWant original series in lieu of our current primetime shows,"" the media giant said in a statement.
Here's the list of programs that will temporarily replace the shows in the primetime lineup:  

Pamilya Ko will be replaced by the heartwarming series 100 Days to Heaven starring Coney Reyes, Jodi Sta. Maria, and Xyriel Manabat.
FPJ’s Ang Probinsyano will be replaced by the phenomenal inspirational series May Bukas Pa starring Zaijian Jaranilla.
Make It With You will be replaced by the hit romantic series On The Wings of Love featuring Nadine Lustre and James Reid.
A Soldier’s Heart will be replaced by the mystery thriller I Am U, an iWant original series topbilled by Julia Barretto, from March 16 to 20.

""We assure our viewers that the changes are only temporary. We will resume our regular programming when conditions improve and the safety and welfare of our people will not be compromised,"" ABS-CBN added. 
Primetime TV series in the Philippines, typically called ""teleseryes,"" are usually filmed as the series progresses. Sometimes, that means the taping for an episode is done just a day – and sometimes hours – before an episode airs on television.   
Metro Manila will be on lockdown beginning March 15, as part of government's response to the global pandemic. The lockdown includes the restriction of movement, including the restriction of inbound and outbound domestic travel to Metro Manila, with some exemptions. Government has also discouraged or banned huge gatherings. Local government units in the megacity are expected to impose curfews in their respective areas. 
ABS-CBN and its rival, GMA 7, had earlier announced a temporary stop to the admission of live studio audiences for several of its shows. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – The Philippines on Saturday, March 14, modified a blanket travel ban earlier imposed on countries with confirmed localized transmissions of the novel coronavirus, restricting it to travelers coming from Iran and Italy.
This backtracks from President Rodrigo Duterte’s earlier announcement that the Philippines would be banning travelers coming from all countries with confirmed localized transmissions of the novel coronavirus.
Duterte's statement caused confusion among countries and prompted some Philippine embassies to issue advisories on the sweeping restriction.  
In a memorandum signed by Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea on Friday night, March 13, and shared with media on Saturday, the new travel restrictions cover only Iran and Italy.
This will be in addition to the existing travel ban for Filipino tourists and non-Filipinos coming from mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, as well as North Gyeongsang Province, including Daegu City and Cheongdo County, in South Korea. 
Medical certificates
Unlike earlier travel bans imposed by the Philippines, the new restrictions do not prohibit the entry of travelers coming from Iran or Italy.
Instead, travelers coming from these countries will be required to present medical certificates which certify they have tested negative for COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.  
Medical certificates will need to be issued by “competent medical authorities” within 48 hours before their departure. 
Exempted from the restrictions are Filipino citizens, permanent resident visa holders, and holders of diplomat visas issued by the Philippines. Foreign spouses and children of Filipino citizens will also be allowed to enter.  
Why Iran and Italy only? Iran and Italy are among the countries hit hardest by the coronavirus disease outside China. 
The two countries account for the second and third largest number of cases in the world.  
As of Saturday in Italy, over 17,000 people have been infected with the disease while the death toll surpassed 1,200 people. Meanwhile, Iran recorded over 11,000 confirmed coronavirus cases and over 500 deaths.  
Thermal screening: Department of Foreign Affairs Assistant Secretary Eduardo Meñez clarified to reporters on Saturday that ""all travelers, regardless of origin will be questioned if thermal screening process is triggered.""
He advised all foreigners coming into the Philippines through Metro Manila to land in airports outside the capital region if their final destination is outside the region.
Duterte earlier declared domestic land, air, and sea travel will be prohibited as Metro Manila is place on lockdown or “community quarantine” from Sunday, March 15 to April 14. 
As of Saturday, the Philippines has recorded 64 confirmed coronavirus cases. The confirmed cases included 6 deaths. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – To prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus in the Philippines, President Rodrigo Duterte ordered the temporary lockdown of Metro Manila which will last from Sunday, March 15, until April 14.  
Referred to as a ""community quarantine"" by government and health officials, the move limits the movement of people going in and out of the mega-city and puts in place stringent protocols on social distancing.  
A curfew in the capital from 8 pm to 5 am will begin on Sunday. Metro Manila mayors are also asking malls to close starting Sunday.
Domestic land, air, and sea travel to and from Metro Manila will be prohibited as a general rule.  
A memorandum signed by Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea, by order of Duterte, on Friday, March 13, and shared with media on Saturday, clarifies the conditions of the lockdown and lists exceptions to the general rule.
Who can and can’t cross into Metro Manila?
THOSE WHO CANNOT ENTER METRO MANILA:  

Persons with ""high risk"" of infection

They include those 60-years-old and above, individuals immunocompromized or with co-morbidities, and pregnant women. 
Experts earlier warned these individuals are more vulnerable to the coronavirus if they do not take extra caution to avoid those infected or sitauations that may put them at risk. 
THOSE WHO CAN TRAVEL TO AND FROM METRO MANILA: 

Workers

Under a general community quarantine – where the movement of people is limited to work and accessing basic necessities – Malacañang said all workers, whether employed or self-employed, will be ""provisionally allowed to travel to and from"" the capital region. 
Individuals will need to present proof of employment and/or business at border checkpoints. 
This will provision may be subject to review and changed by the Inter-Agency Task Force formed to combat the coronavirus if needed.  

Passengers with international travel

All departing passengers will be allowed to transit through Metro Manila, though they must present proof that they have confirmed international travel within 12 hours of entering the capital region.  
This does not apply to areas where current travel restrictions are in place such as mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, where Filipino tourists are barred from traveling to. Filipinos are also restricted from traveling to North Gyeongsang Province, including Daegu City and Cheongdo County in South Korea. 

Cargo

Malacañang said cargo to and from Metro Manila will go unhampered. 
Malacañang listed specific individuals exempted from the domestic travel ban. These people will be allowed to enter and exit Metro Manila:  

Health workers
Authorized government officials 
Persons traveling for medical or humanitarian reasons
Persons transiting to airports for travel abroad 
Persons providing basic services and public utilities 
Essential skeletal workforce (in government offices) 

OTHER MEASURES TAKEN UPON EXIT: All persons granted entry and exiting Metro Manila will be checked for signs and symptoms of the coronavirus at exit checkpoints, Malacañang said.  
They will be issued “appropriate certification” by health authorities, which will endorse to local government units outside Metro Manila that they are safe to exit. 
Those who exit the capital region will need to undergo a 14-day home quarantine, which will be monitored by their respective local government units.
As of Saturday, the Philippines has recorded 64 confirmed coronavirus cases. The confirmed cases included 6 deaths. – Rappler.com "

CORONAVIRUS CONCERNS. Few shoppers are seen at the Greenhills Shopping Center on March 9, 2020. Photo by Inoue Jaena/Rappler 
MANILA, Philippines (4th UPDATE) – All Metro Manila malls and other establishments have been asked to stop operations on the eve of the  30-day lockdown of the national capital region that begins on Sunday, March 15, to stem the spread of the novel coronavirus.
San Juan Mayor Francis Zamora said Metro Manila mayors made the collective call as he read a resolution approved by the Metro Manila Council (MMC) on Saturday, March 14.
The MMC “strongly recommend to all Local Legislative Councils of the NCR to issue ordinary ordinances for the temporary close of malls and establishments of the same kind, except those offering essential services (i.e groceries, supermarkets, pharmacies, restaurants with home deliveries, and establishments offering medical services) from 14 March 2020 until 13 April 2020, subject to day-to-day evaluation and other exemptions that their city or municipality may enact.""
The MMC has among its members all Metro Manila mayors and lawmakers and some Cabinet members.
Ahead of the issuances of the local ordinances, Ayala Malls announced that it would close all its malls in Metro Manila at 7 pm on Saturday, and would adjust mall hours starting Monday, March 16, at Greenbelt 1 (10 am to 8 pm) and Greenbelt 2, 3, 4, and 5 (11 am to 8 pm) until further notice.
SM Supermalls announced adjusted mall hours – from 11 am to 7 pm beginning Sunday, March 15. 
Meanwhile, the Department of Tourism (DOT) urged local governments to “to clarify the guidelines of the curfew so that public and tourism stakeholders are guided accordingly and that the best interests of everyone concerned are considered.” 
""We urge the LGUs to possibly consider that establishments, such as, but not limited to restaurants, hotels, groceries, convenience stores and drugstores, which operate longer than the recommended curfew period, be allowed to operate on a limited scale, as this is to the public's interest,"" the DOT said in a statement on Saturday.
""These establishments must be given sufficient lead time to prepare their personnel as well,"" it added. – Rappler.com "

DRY RUN. Manila police hold a dry run of the metro-wide lockdown on March 13, 2020 
MANILA, Philippines (3rd UPDATE) – Metro Manila would be placed under curfew from 8 pm to 5 am, after Local Legislative Councils in the capital region pass the needed curfew ordinances to enforce it, the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) said.
DILG Undersecretary Jonathan Malaya said on Saturday, March 14, that the ordinances were expected to be passed on Monday, March 16.
Malaya made the clarification in response to reporters' questions on Saturday, March 14, after Metropolitan Manila Development Authority General Manager Jojo Garcia said in a news briefing that the curfew would coincide with the region-wide lockdown and begin on Sunday, March 15.
""The legal basis for the curfew are the ordinances, and the mayors agreed to issue these on Monday,"" Malaya said.
Garcia said that the Metro Manila Council (MMC), which has among its members the 17 Metro Manila mayors, approved the curfew proposal to be imposed beginning Sunday. He said the curfew imposition is meant to keep people at home instead of just hanging out in public places, which would defeat the purpose of the lockdown. (READ: What we know so far: The Metro Manila coronavirus lockdown)
During the news briefing with the MMDA, San Juan Mayor Francis Zamora read the resolution passed by the MMC, but the resolution did not cite any dates for the start and end of the curfew imposition, apparently since this would depend on when the ordinances are passed.
“Mayors of NCR, acting in unity with the National Government, in order to preserve and protect the lives and health of their constituents, do hereby declare and promulgate, acting as one body in the Metro Manila Council, STRONGLY RECOMMEND to all Local Legislative Councils of the NCR to issue ordinances for CURFEW from 8:00 pm to 5:00 am subject to their necessary guidelines as they deem necessary,” read the resolution.
Exemptions
During the same Saturday briefing, Interior Secretary Eduardo Año said the curfew ordinances will ban ""non-essential movements, and that exemptions include workers and ""essential"" movements of supplies and medical teams.
Año said people would be exempted from the curfew if they had to work, if they are seeking medical help, and if they are buying food, supplies, and other essentials.
He urged religious groups who hold ceremonies during the proposed curfew hours to adjust their schedules.
He added that imposing curfew was a necessary measure to prevent the rise of coronavirus cases.
Responding to questions, Año said anyone found during curfew hours would be asked to go home, and if they refuse, they would be arrested. 
""Ganoon lang kasimple (It's that simple),"" Año said. 
During the briefing, the MMC also passed a resolution urging LLCs to pass ordinances ordering the temporary closure of malls to help stem the spread of the disease. 
As of March 13, the Philippines reported a total of 98 confirmed cases. On March 14, the Department of Health said that there are already 8 dead from the confirmed cases.

MANILA, Philippines (4th UPDATE) – The Department of Health (DOH) on Saturday, March 14, confirmed that two more COVID-19 patients died in the country.
The latest DOH confirmation raises to 3 fatalities Saturday, and 8 in the country to date.
The DOH said it would provide more details about the latest deaths as soon as they receive the information. 
Earlier Saturday, a Filipino patient in Mindanao succumbed to the disease.  (READ: Coronavirus patient in Mindanao was a resident of Pasig City)
""PH40 expired late evening of March 13 from Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome due to Severe Pneumoria with concomitant Acute Kidney Injury,"" the DOH said in a press statement on Saturday morning.
""Patient was admitted at the Northern Mindanao Medical Center last March 3 after onset of symptoms last February 24,"" it added.
PH40 was the first COVID-19 patient of Mindanao. He was a Pasig resident who had no history of travel abroad. 
DOH Northern Mindanao (Region 10) Director Adriano Suba-an had earlier said that the patient was a 54-year-old male, a resident of Pasig City since 2017 who went to Cagayan de Oro to return to his home in Lanao del Sur.
He was confined in a hospital in Iligan City prior to the NMMC in Cagayan de Oro. 
The Philippines has 64 COVID-19 cases as of Thursday. 
Burial
Suba-an said on Saturday that Mindanao's first coronavirus victim would be buried according to his religious beliefs.
He said the  DOH regional office coordinated with the family of the patient ""for an immediate burial"" on Saturday.
Suba-an said that for bodies infected with virus, the DOH recommends cremation but in the case of PH40, health officials met with members of his family on a proper burial that still followed their religious and cultural beliefs without risking anyone's health.
He noted that PH40's remains were sealed in a body bag right away to avoid the spread of infection.
""The decision of the family is for the burial, there are practices in their direct burial practices that is   contrary to our guidelines that cannot be done like the washing of the body, family members attending, that we coordinated and negotiated that that cannot be done,"" Suba-an said.
""I think that they have a belief such as Darurah like what is not allowed can be done if the situation warrants  it,"" he added.
Darura is an Islamic concept for ""necessity"" that can justify even violating explicit prohibition.
Suba-an said that they were coordinating with the city government on the burial of PH40 on Saturday or if the family would decide to bring his remains to his hometown in Marawi City. She said that either way, PH40 would be buried in close coordination with the DOH.
Dr Jose Chan, director of the Northern Mindanao Medical Center (NMMC) Director where PH40 was confined, said that the wife and daughter of  the victim where in quarantine and understood that they could not attend the burial ceremony.

""The results of the tests for COVID-19 conducted on President Rodrigo Duterte and I turned out negative. We are fit and healthy to perform our duties,"" Duterte's former aide and now Senator Bong Go said in a statement on Friday, March 13.
Duterte underwent tests for the disease on Thursday, March 12, after several of his Cabinet members, including officials in his inner circle, announced they would isolate themselves after coming into contact with a confirmed COVID-19 patient. 
Before taking the test, Presidential Spokesperson Salvador Panelo gave assurances that the President was not showing symptoms of the disease and was only getting tested as a precautionary measure to ensure he was ""fit and healthy to perform"" his duties.
Experts earlier said that older adults with preexisting health conditions – particularly those over 60 – should take extra precautions against the disease as they were more vulnerable to the coronavirus.
Duterte, who is 74 years old, is considered highly at risk for the disease. Duterte had claimed on several occasions that he suffered from a slew of medical conditions that include myasthenia gravis, Buerger's disease, Barrett's esophagus, and ""spinal issues,"" among others.

DOH Secretary Francisco Duque III has already deployed surveillance teams to work with the concerned local government units to trace all the individuals with whom the new positive cases made contact.  
Duque said data they have gathered so far shows that the most vulnerable to COVID-19 are the elderly, with average age of 66, and those with preexisting medical conditions like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, chronic lung disease, and immunosuppression.
""Hinihikayat namin ang mga immunocompromised at may umiiral ng kondisyong pangkalusugan na mas maging maingat at umiwas sa matataong lugar at mga pagtitipon,"" DOH Secretary Francisco Duque said in a a statement.
(We urge everyone who is immunocompromised and who has exisiting health conditions to be more vigilant and avoid public spaces as well as mass gatherings.)
Anyone who has information that can help the contact tracing activities may call the DOH hotline at (02) 8-651-7800 local 1149-1150. 
Of the 64 COVID-19 cases recorded in the Philippines so far, 5 have died. Four of the deceased patients are Filipinos, while one is a Chinese who came from Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the outbreak that has infected more than 134,000 people and killed over 5,000 worldwide. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – It's the reciprocity rule, according to Pasig Mayor Vico Sotto. What goes around comes around.
Urging citizens to desist from hoarding rubbing alcohol, hand sanitizers, and other disinfectants, Sotto warned that the practice may actually cause the novel coronavirus to spread faster.
""Babalik din po sa atin 'yon. Kapag hindi nakapag-sanitize 'yung ibang tao, eh 'di baka lalong kumalat 'yung virus,"" he told reporters as he led the distribution of disinfectant kits to leaders of Pasig's barangays. (It will come back to us. If other people are unable to sanitize, then the virus might spread even further.)
The Pasig government gave out a total of 500 sets of disinfectant kits that include sprayer canisters, chlorine tablets, hazmat suits, face shields, goggles, boots, and nitrile gloves to its 30 barangays. The number of each items in each set was proportionate to each barangay's population.
The city's professional response team demonstrated the proper use of the equipment to the barangay representatives who were charged to routinely disinfect common areas in every neighborhood.

4-day workweek for city employees
The local government started spraying disinfectant in the city's public areas earlier this week. With classes suspended, all 45 public schools in Pasig were disinfected by the end of Friday.
Places most frequented by people, such as the city hall and the public market, are disinfected daily. The wet market will remain open, Sotto emphasized, but the dry goods bazaar on the market complex's third floor has been closed temporarily.
To decongest the city hall to give room for ""social distancing,"" it will be open for frontline services and transactions from Monday to Saturday, but its employees will only work 4 days in a week.
A numbering system limits the volume of people doing business inside the city hall at any given time.
All big events and gatherings in the city are canceled.
5 cases of infection
Pasig has had 5 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus, one of whom, an 88-year-old woman with a preexisting medical condition, died on Thursday, March 12.
Sotto called for calm and urged people not to panic.
""From the patients who were positive with COVID-19, we conducted extensive contact tracing, and our contact tracing has been very successful,"" Sotto said.

The hospital released a statement confirming the report, adding that 5 cases of persons under investigation or PUIs were also admitted in the hospital.
""The public is advised that JBLMGH is implementing enhanced surveillance mechanisms and strict temperature and symptom monitoring to all individuals prior to entry in the hospital,"" said Dr. Monserrat Chichioco, JBLMGH chief.
The hospital is designated by the Department of Health to treat possible cases in Central Luzon of COVID-19, the sickness caused by the novel coronavirus.
Chichioco said a shortened visitation hour, which 3 pm to 4 pm, was also implemented in the hospital.
The two cases here were the first recorded COVID-19 cases in Pampanga.
As of Thursday, the Philippines has recorded a total of 52 positive cases of COVID-19, including the 5 patients who died.

MANILA, Philippines – The local bourse saw one of its most volatile trading days on Friday, March 13, as the novel coronavirus continued to send jitters over the trading floor. 
The Philippine Stock Exchange index gained 1% and closed at 5,793. Climbing back to the green zone, however, was quite a roller coaster ride.
The PSEi slid over 10% during the morning session, declining to a new low of 5,097 and triggered another circuit breaker or a 15-minute trading halt.
“Panic sellers turned into bargain hunters after triggering circuit breakers early in the session that temporarily halted trading for the second time in this week,” said Luis Limlingan of Regina Capital.
Traders also attributed the recovery to the order of Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III, instructing the Government Service Insurance System and Social Security System to buy stocks and support the market.

MANILA, Philippines – Agriculture Secretary William Dar assured the nearly 14 million residents of Metro Manila that there is enough supply of food, as the capital prepares for the lockdown or so-called “community quarantine” due to the novel coronavirus starting March 15.
At the same time, Dar said on Friday, March 13, that the lockdown is also an “opportune time” for residents to consider gardening or aquaculture in their “respective backyards, verandas, roof tops, and designated areas in the barangay, school or community.”
The Department of Agriculture is still finalizing its food resiliency action plan.
Dar said the plan includes strategic positioning and efficient distribution of basic food commodities, including the monitoring of suggested retail prices in public markets in Metro Manila.
Agriculture Undersecretary Ariel Cayanan reiterated that movement of agricultural goods will not be affected.
Cayanan said that the agency is considering implementing ""fast lanes"" for vehicles carrying agricultural products.
Panic buying
""We call on the general public to buy only their daily or weekly food requirements and refrain from overstocking or panic buying,"" Dar appealed on Friday, March 13. (READ: Hoarding, overpricing would lead to criminal charges, warns DTI)
Current rice inventory at various National Food Authority warehouses nationwide is good for at least 80 days and will be further augmented by the incoming palay harvest this current dry season, providing additional stocks for another 2 to 3 months.
About 929,358 metric tons (MT) of rice will be made available for Metro Manila for the next 9 months. 
The Department of Agriculture estimated demand in Metro Manila to be over 26,000 MT. Over 55,000 MT would come from Cagayan Valley and Central Luzon.
Dar also assured Metro Manila residents that other basic food items like pork, chicken, eggs, other poultry products, fish, vegetables, fruits, sugar, cooking oil, and other coconut by-products are sufficient.
The agency also reminded retailers of suggested retail prices of the following commodities:
Pork- P190/kilo 
Chicken- P130/kilo
Tilapia- P120/kilo
Galunggong- P130/kilo
Sugar (brown)- P45/kilo

MANILA, Philippines – PLDT said on Friday, March 13, that it expects a greater need for bandwidth as companies and schools switch to work- or study-from-home arrangements amid the novel coronavirus threat. 
PLDT spokesperson and head of public affairs Ramon Isberto assured their customers that they have more than sufficient capacity for the additional load the company expects, and said they would be providing a speed boost for fiber customers in Metro Manila, Rizal, Bulacan, Laguna, and Cavite so that the minimum speed will be 25Mbps.
The company expected the technical preparations to be finished next week. By then, users would be able to expect the speed boost. ""That should be enough to serve the needs of several simultaneous users in the household,"" Isberto said. 
In the US and in Italy, telcos AT&T and Vodafone have announced that they will lift their data caps until April 2020. PLDT will not need to as their plans have no data caps. 
For their prepaid fixed wireless service, PLDT said it would extend its current promo to April that would double the data load of their P199 prepaid data pack from 12GB to 24GB.
PLDT's wireless subsidiary Smart will provide free mobile access to key government websites such as the Department of Health's NCOV tracker, the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRMMC), and Philippine Information Agency.

According to Belmonte, barangays have the task of setting up isolation rooms, disinfecting their areas, monitoring persons under investigation (PUIs) and persons under monitoring (PUMs), and training response teams in their respective communities. 
""It is very important that they are empowered, that I give them all the necessary support that they need to be able to carry out this very sensitive, but important task,"" Belmonte said.

MANILA, Philippines – The Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) urged all Filipinos with non-essential trips to refrain from traveling to Israel, following the Middle Eastern country’s travel restrictions imposed in light of the novel coronavirus outbreak.  
The DFA on Friday, March 13, issued the advisory in light of additional travel requirements imposed by Israel. 
The DFA said this included measures requiring Filipinos, who have essential trips to Israel, to obtain clearance from the Israeli Ministry of Interior. This can be done through the consular section of the Embassy of Israel in Manila, prior to their departure.
The consular section of the Israeli embassy can be contacted through their website at +630288839500 or through their Facebook page. 
The DFA advised the public to refrain from going to the Israeli embassy itself as it is not admitting visitors to help quell the spread of the virus.  
The DFA earlier told all Filipinos to postpone upcoming trips to the Holy Land “until further notice” as the Israeli government is implementing measures to restrict all travels to Bethlehem from Israel. 
As of Friday, Israel recorded 131 confirmed coronavirus cases. There were no deaths in the country yet.

BACOLOD, Philippines – The city government of Bacolod has suspended the graduation and moving-up ceremonies for all levels of public and private schools here due to the threat of the novel coronavirus disease COVID-19.
Bacolod City Mayor Evelio Leonardia signed the executive order on Thursday, March 12, after a series of meetings and consultations with school, health, police, social services, and disaster risk reduction officials.
“It is with a heavy heart to make this decision but with the present circumstances, it is the most prudent thing to do,” the mayor said.
In the order, he said it is imperative that the city implements urgent and critical measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
He noted that President Rodrigo Duterte had earlier declared a state of national health emergency. 
“We call it suspension because it might be normalize,” he said.
Moreover, the mayor also issued another executive order implementing heightened precautions against COVID-19 for daycare centers and supervised neighborhood play in the city to safeguard health and safety of the children by shortening their classes, which is until Friday, March 13. 
Classes in all levels in public schools and private schools in this city will also be until March 20 and 27, respectively, he said.
“We will end the school year earlier so that pupils and students can observe social distancing measures to avoid contamination and spread of the virus,” he said.

MANILA, Philippines – Food and Drug Administration (FDA) officer-in-charge Eric Domingo clarified the novel coronavirus test kits developed by University of the Philippines (UP) scientists will not yet be available for the public to buy by Monday, March 16. 
By then what would happen is just the field testing for the UP-National Institute of Health’s (UP-NIH) 2019-nCov detection kits so the government can determine the validity of results, Domingo said in a phone interview with reporters on Friday, March 13.
Domingo said specimens will be used on the locally-produced detection kits for testing, after which results will be confirmed through gene sequencing at the Philippine Genome Center. 
Results of the UP-NIH test kits will also be compared with the findings of the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine, the only laboratory in the country accredited thus far by the World Health Organization (WHO) to test 2019-nCoV samples.
“‘Yung field testing nga nila kasi kailangan munang i-test sa actual test tapos i-va-validate nila ito, titingnan nila ang resulta kung comparable doon sa kanilang ginagamit mula WHO. At the same time, titingnan din natin kung very accurate saka i-ko-confirm by gene sequencing,” Domingo said.
(The results of the field test will have to be validated and compared to the results of the current test kits they are using from the WHO. At the same time, we’re also going to confirm if the results are very accurate through gene sequencing.) 
“At 'pag nakumpleto na ‘yung datos, at mapakita na talagang very valid na ang test na ito, saka siya i-ro-roll out na maaari na iyan, puwedeng gamitin sa mga pasyente at puwede na siyang gamitin sa ibang mga laboratory,” the FDA chief added. 
(Once we complete the data and determine that the tests are very valid, then that's the only time we can roll it out among patients and let other laboratories use it.) 
The FDA has so far issued only a certificate of exemption for field testing to the UP-NIH test kits. A certificate of product registration is the document needed for its commercial use, when the public can purchase the test kits on their own. 
Still, the UP-NIH scientists’ invention gives hope to Filipinos as the number of positive cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by 2019-nCoV, continues to rise at 52 with 5 fatalities. 
This new test kit is capable of detecting in just two hours the presence of 2019-nCoV in samples taken from patients under investigation. It will be reportedly priced at P1,320, or 6 times cheaper than its foreign counterpart, which costs around P8,500. 
On Friday, Domingo also told the public not to buy any home test kits being sold online, as these are still unregistered and have no FDA approval. – Rappler.com "

CAVITE, Philippines – Primary and secondary public schools in the province of Cavite will shorten the current academic year, while graduation ceremonies are “temporarily on hold for all levels.”  
Cavite Governor Jonvic Remulla made this announcement through his Facebook page on Friday afternoon, March 13, after meeting with district superintendents of the Department of Education (DepEd).  
The governor called for meetings as the number of coronavirus infection cases continued to rise in the country – among them, a man from Imus, Cavite – and President Rodrigo Duterte had ordered a lockdown of Metro Manila, which shares a border with Cavite to its south. 
The announcement was made while students had just wrapped up a week of class suspensions. Last week, amid the discovery of more cases of the coronavirus diseases in the National Capital Region, the governor followed the President’s course of action, ordering all classes in the province canceled. 
To finish their academic requirements sooner, kindergarten and Grades 1 to 12 students in Cavite public schools will have to take their final exams in batches for 3 days next week: 

Wednesday, March 18: Grades 4, 5, 6, 11, 12
Thursday, March 19: Kindergarten and Grades 1, 2, 3, 7, 8
Friday, March 20: Grades 9, 10

Social distancing, as advised by health authorities, will be observed during the exams. 
“One meter distance from each student will be observed. That is why we staggered the exam dates to one day per grade, so that the school rooms will be distributed accordingly,” Remulla said. 
Private schools, however, “will have to use their discretion regarding their school calendar adjustments,” the governor added.
DepEd officials gave assurances that they would sterilize the classrooms before the exam days, Remulla said. 
On Friday, Remulla also said classes in the undergraduate and graduate programs of universities in Cavite will suspended. This is to allow university officials to meet with the governor and determine any adjustments in the academic calendar. – Miriam Grace A. Go/Rappler.com  "

MANILA, Philippines – The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Friday, March 13, warned the public against buying home test kits for the novel coronavirus being sold online, as none of these products had been registered and tested by the regulatory agency.
Health Undersecretary Eric Domingo, FDA officer-in-charge, issued the warning in a news briefing on Friday after the FDA received reports that unregistered home test kits supposedly to check for infection with COVID-16, were being sold online.

“Gusto lang naming ipaalam sa publiko na sa ngayon, wala pang registered na testing kit para dito sa COVID-19. So kung anumang binebenta diyan, nakikita nilang mga advertisement, o makikita nila online, ito pong mga produktong ito unregistered,” Domingo said in a phone interview with reporters.
(We just want to let the public to know that for now, there are no registered testing kits here for COVID-19. So if you see anything being sold out there, any advertisements, or any posts online, these products are unregistered.)
The FDA chief said that since the unregistered test kits are untested, the accuracy of their results are questionable.
“Ang babala lang natin, kahit po gamitin ‘nyo ito, hindi naman natin alam kung valid at acceptable ang mga resulta na ito at kung sino naman pong doktor ang maniniwala sa resulta ng mga ito at gagamitin siya to manage a patient. So baka masayang lang ang pera ninyo,” Domingo said. 
(We are just warning that even if you use this, we don't know if the results are valid and acceptable and if any doctor would even believe in the results to manage a patient. So you would just waste your money.)
Currently, there are only two types of test kits in the Philippines that have been approved by the FDA – the sophisticated machine at the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) that takes 24 to 48 hours to confirm a 2019-nCoV case and the new and much faster test kits developed by the University of the Philippines-National Institute for Health (UP-NIH). 
The FDA had issued a certificate of exemption for the UP-NIH test kits, which means that starting March 16, the test kits can be used for field testing coupled with gene sequencing at the Philippine Genome Center. 
The results of this field testing will determine if the UP-NIH test kits will get a certificate of product registration from the FDA – the document needed to allow the mass use of these kits. (READ: #SalamatUP: Netizens laud U.P. scientists for developing coronavirus test kits)

(Once we complete the data and determine that this test is very valid, then that's the only time we can roll it out among patients and let other laboratories use it.)

MANILA, Philippines – The Philippine National Police (PNP) will arrest people who will violate the planned lockdown of Metro Manila, National Capital Region Police Office (NCRPO) Director Major General Debold Sinas said on Friday, March 13.
In defending arrests, Sinas said police cannot let trespassers go without punishment if they violate the government's effort to contain the virus. So far, the government has floated exempting only workers, people seeking medical help, and the media from travel restrictions.
The NCRPO is studying filing a case based on violation of the Revised Penal Code aside from violation of the quarantine law.
There is no lockdown yet. This comes after President Rodrigo Duterte announced that Metro Manila will be locked down beginning Sunday, March 15. In making the announcement, Duterte said the lockdown will be enforced by the police and the military.
It is unclear how this will be enforced since as of Friday afternoon, Duterte has not released an executive order or a memorandum circular as basis for the lockdown. This also means that without clearer guidelines and an executive order, these arrests remain unenforceable.
Government officials concede that some questions from citizens who work outside Metro Manila but live in the metropolis, or even live outside but work inside have to be addressed, along with questions about what constitutes mass gatherings.
Sinas said police will be closing down small roads while establishing checkpoints along major roads and highways. He also said the composition of personnel in these checkpoints have yet to be decided by the Inter-Agency Task Force on the coronavirus outbreak.
As of Friday, March 13, the country has recorded 52 confirmed coronavirus cases. The confirmed cases include 5 deaths. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – The military will not be involved in defining the looming lockdown of Metro Manila over the novel coronavirus, and will only help the police in enforcing it, the country’s national defense chief said on Friday, March 13.
This, as members of the Cabinet rush to draft guidelines to define the parameters of the “community quarantine” President Rodrigo Duterte ordered over the capital region on Thursday night, March 12.
Duterte had said he would rely on the police and military to enforce the “lockdown,” and urged the public to “just obey them.”
On Friday, Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana clarified that “the military will not be involved in the determination of the guidelines to enforce the restricted movement. It is the PNP (Philippine National Police). The military will just be in the support role as they do not have police powers.”
“The AFP (Armed Forces of the Philippines) shall assist the PNP in implementing the community quarantine in certain areas, and will help ensure the availability of units and personnel, critical logistics and supplies, as well as emergency medical teams, among others,” Lorenzana said in a statement.
Throughout the lockdown, the Department of National Defense (DND) will maintain a “skeletal civilian workforce” to operate its frontline services and other “critical office functions.”
The DND ordered its civilian bureaus – the Philippine Veterans Affairs Office, the Office of Civil Defense, the National Defense College, and the Government Arsenal – to maintain workforces to make sure frontline and essential services continue, such as the processing of veterans’ claims, and production of ammunition and other combat materiel.
In an earlier statement, the AFP said it was “ready to assist” the PNP in enforcing the lockdown.
“Our different units were earlier directed to prepare their contingency measures to make this possible without compromising our peace and security operations,” said AFP chief of staff General Felimon Santos Jr.
“This includes the availability of units and personnel, emergency medical teams, availability of critical logistics and supplies, and preparation of personal protective equipment for soldiers and other personnel who will be tapped to assist the PNP,” he added.
AFP Joint Task Force National Capital Region spokesperson 1st Lieutenant Arianne Bichara said plans were on hand and details were “being ironed out” for implementing the lockdown.
The unit is requesting additional personal protective equipment for troops waiting to be deployed, Bichara added.
The “community quarantine” is expected to be enforced for a month, from March 15 to April 15, but it may be lifted anytime if it is no longer needed, the government said.
Travel to and from Metro Manila will be restricted, including domestic and international flights. Classes are suspended, while work in public and private offices are to drawdown to require a minimal workforce. – Rappler.com "

HOW IT WORKS. Maria Carmen Ocampo, Manila Health Technology Inc. sales manager shows a sample of the UP-developed COVID-2019 rRT-PCR Detection Kit at a press briefing held at the Philippine Gerome Center at the UP Diliman in Quezon City on March 12, 2020. Photo by Darren Langit/Rappler  
MANILA, Philippines – One of the ways to slow down the spread of the pandemic COVID-19 is to detect it early and fast to enable professionals to provide proper treatment and trace how it might have spread soon enough.
Scientists at the University of the Philippines (UP) have developed a novel COVID-19 detection kit that could help slow down the spread of the disease and at the same time empower hospitals across the country to test suspected patients earlier and better.
In a press conference at the Philippine Genome Center (PGC) in UP Diliman, Quezon City, PGC deputy executive director and COVID-19 test kit lead developer Dr Raul Destura explained that after the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) greenlighted their field validation studies, his team intends to deploy the test kits soon to the respective hospitals across the country.
Among the hospitals that have agreed to be part of the field validation studies are the Philippine General Hospital in Manila, The Medical City in Pasig City, Vicente Sotto Memorial Medical Center in Cebu City, and the Southern Philippines Medical Center in Davao City.
Before a product such as the detection kit labeled as GenAmplifyTM COVID-19 rRT-PCR (rapid reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction) Detection Kit can be commercialized, it has to undergo two tests: the laboratory performance testing and the field validation study.
Destura and his team have finished the laboratory performance testing and proceeded to apply for a certification for field validation from the FDA.
However, the FDA opted to give the team a Certificate of Exemption in lieu of a product certificate of registration so they could proceed with the field validation studies. The field validation studies are an important phase in testing a medical technology such as the GenAmplifyTM kit as it helps the researchers understand the behavior of the test kit in different locations.
""Ang pagdevelop ng technology kasi may proseso iyan. Hindi p'wedeng bara-bara, hindi p'wedeng shortcut. Our intention is to protect the public by developing the technology na may mga criteria na dapat sundin,"" said Destura, adding that it will take them 2 to 3 weeks to complete the sample size they need to carry out a diagnostic clinical sensitivity testing, the final phase before they could take the product to market.
 
(There is a process in developing a technology. We can't take a shortcut. Our intention is to protect the public by developing the technology with a set of criteria that has to be followed.)
The goal of this phase is to validate the ability of the test to correctly identify those patients with the disease.
All patients who will be tested using the GenAmplifyTM kit will still be tested using the internationally-acquired COVID-19 test kits currently being used by the government. At the same time, the samples will also undergo genome sequencing at PGC to verify the results obtained using the kits.
 Genome sequencing
""The purpose of this is to protect the public. I know we need it very badly. But we have the moral responsibility to make sure that the technology we're putting out there na gawa ng Pinoy, gawa ng Pinoy para sa lahat at para sa buong mundo ang kalidad (that is made by Filipinos for everyone and for the whole world is high-quality technology),"" Destura said.
The GenAmplifyTM kit uses the same PCR technology as with other diagnostic kits for other diseases like HIV and hepatitis. Hospitals categorized as tertiary care centers in the Philippines have the capability to use PCR technology.
However, not all hospitals can acquire the GenAmplifyTM. Once commercialized, the institute requesting for the kits must adhere to certain criteria such as the biosafety level of their laboratories to ensure that they will be able to use them.
Destura also explained the procedure for using the test kit:

Two types of swabbing are done: nasopharyngeal brushing (done through the nose) and throat swabbing (done through the mouth).
The samples obtained are placed in a (viral transport media) solution and placed in a sealed container to avoid contamination.
The samples are brought to the laboratory with classification of safety of at least Biosafety Level 2. These laboratories have biological safety cabinets with controlled air to ensure the safety of the medical technologist when opening the sample.
RNA material is then extracted from the vials of samples obtained.
The RNA material is then mixed with the COVID-19 kit and amplified using the PCR machine.
The PCR machine then analyzes the virus content of the sample and prints out a result saying if the sample is negative or positive from COVID-19. The result is expected to come out within one and a half hours.

PCR testing, like the method used in the GenAmplifyTM, is one of the known ways of detecting COVID-19. Similar tests kits have been developed in South Korea, China, and the United States. Other countries employ other methods such as nucleic acid tests and antibody tests (drawing blood samples).
Destura noted that one of the main purposes of developing GenAmplifyTM and deploying them in hospitals across the country is to empower hospitals to be their own testing centers.
""Ang point kasi ng deployment is ma-create 'yung environment of testing doon sa lugar nila para may empowerment mechanism ang technology. Kasi if we will go for centralized testing, 'yung logistics talaga is crazy. So kung i-empower natin ang lahat ng ospital who [have] been doing PCR for years, basically, magiging mas malaki 'yung reach,"" said Destura.
(The point of the deployment is to create an environment of testing in their areas for empowerment mechanism and technology. Because if we will go for centralized testing, the logistics will really be crazy. If we empower all hospitals who have been doing PCR for years, basically, we will have greater reach.)
Meanwhile, Philippine General Hospital Director Dr Gerardo Legaspi said that the test kit is a huge help for health care workers as well.
""Ang COVID-19 test will greatly help us in rationalizing. Ibig sabihin, maibibigay natin ang atensiyon sa mga nangangailangan ng atensiyon, at maadvise-an natin ang mga pasyente na hindi naman kailangang nasa ospital,"" Legaspi said.
(The COVID-19 test will greatly help us in rationalizing. Meaning, we will be able pay attention to those who need attention, and we can advise patients who don't need to be hospitalized.)
""Kung available ang test, hindi na kailangang maghintay nung mga malalalang mga sakit kasi nakikita sa buong mundo na maaaring hindi kailangang lahat ng sintomas ay lumabas at 'di lahat ay kailangan lahat ng factors ay nasasabi para kailangang mag-positive or mag-negative. So, sa pagka napaigi ang pag-screen ng mga pasyente, maaaring iwasan ang pagkalat nito,"" Legaspi added.
(If the test is available, we don't need to wait for severe symptoms, because as seen worldwide, it's possible that not all symptoms will manifest, and not all factors need to be stated to be positive or negative. So, with better screening of patients, we can avoid the spread of this disease.) – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – Students in Metro Manila whose classes have been suspended for nearly a month will have the option of taking their final exams online, or having their grades from previous semesters averaged for their final mark. 
Department of Education Undersecretary Alain Pascua said these were the two options being considered for students who will be affected by class suspensions in Metro Manila that will last from Sunday, March 15 to April 12.  
During a Malacañang briefing on the government’s response to the coronavirus outbreak, Pascua said students only had two weeks left of school, one of which was supposed to be their final examination week.  
How it will work: Pascua said DepEd would first be releasing an order with a “transmutation formula” for schools to implement when grading affected students. 
The formula will include computing students’ grades from the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd quarters, as well as their remaining standing in the 4th quarter to come up with their final class standing.  
If students are not satisfied with their final average derived from the formula, they will have the option to take online exams. 
The online exams will be administered through the ""DepEd commons,"" an online platform where lessons can be accessed by students and teachers. 
""Isa ito sa mga gagawin ng DepEd dito sa Kamaynilaan on the assumption na ang Kamaynilaan ay 98-99% dito ang penetration ng cellphone at ang penetration ng Wi-Fi or internet,"" Pascua said. 
(This is one option DepEd is taking in Metro Manilla, on the assumption that Metro Manila has a 98 to 99% penetration rate for cellphones, internet, or Wi-Fi.) 
The same measures will also be available for areas where there are class suspensions outside Metro Manila.  
If classes not suspended: Pascua said social distancing measures will likewise be in place in schools were classes are not suspended. 
This will be done by having students take their exams on a “staggered” basis, which means they will only be allowed in school when they are scheduled to take their tests. 
And after that? As for graduations, Pascua said graduation rites outside Metro Manila have been scheduled for April 13 to 17, or after the suspension period to be safe. 
In Metro Manila, Pascua said DepEd was still discussing a possible period for rescheduling.  
The Philippines has so far 52 confirmed coronavirus cases. The confirmed cases include 5 deaths. – Rappler.com

MANILA, Philippines – Several commuters complained of limited entry to Metro Rail Transit Line 3  stations on Friday morning, March 13, as the MRT3 management conducted a dry run of social distancing on the train to prevent the spread of COVID-19.
In a Twitter post, MRT3 said that it was ""already implementing"" social distancing in its stations and trains, following the order of President Rodrigo Duterte on containing the novel coronavirus outbreak.
Responding to reporters, MRT3 Director for Operations Michael Capati clarified that what happened at the stations on Friday morning was merely a ""simulation.""
""This is just a simulation in preparation for social distancing while we are waiting for the official guidelines,"" Capati said in a mix of Filipino and English.
The Philippines declared a ""community quarantine"" – which in effect is similar to a lockdown – in Metro Manila from March 15 to April 14 to contain the spread of COVID-19. The government has yet to finalize the guidelines on this. 
As of Thursday, the Philippines had 52 coronavirus patients, mostly in Metro Manila. Five of the COVID-19 patients died, 3 of them just on Thursday, when Duterte approved the resolution on the lockdown and other recommendations of the Inter-Agency Task Force on COVID-19.
Commuters have posted photos of their morning commute on Twitter, showing train coaches that were not packed, contrary to their usual experience.

The following piece was written on March 11, a day before President Rodrigo Duterte announced that Metro Manila would be placed on lockdown to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus. 
This country needs a surgical knife to avert a looming epidemic of unimaginable proportions. The National Capital Region (NCR) is densely populated. It might cause a centrifugal spread of the coronavirus – from NCR to peripheral areas. Worse, the DOH has already recorded its first coronavirus cases in Dumaguete and Cagayan de Oro City. 
We need to act given rising cases, and we have not seen the peak of this disease yet. 
A proactive lockdown of NCR is needed for our weak healthcare system to stop an epidemic, given the shortage of testing kits, face masks, and healthcare staff in our hospitals. 
Furthermore, there are many vulnerable Filipinos. More than 7 million are over 60 years old. 25 million have hypertension, 6 million are diabetic, and scores are in need of dialysis.   
There’s no systematic plan of when a city should close schools, when they should tell businesses that they have to telework, when they should close movie theaters and cancel large gatherings. But we must discuss the scenario with the agencies concerned. (READ: Questions Filipinos are asking about the coronavirus lockdown)
Yes, people get afraid when they see that powerful governments – South Korea, China, Italy – lock down millions of people. These governments have more resources, and yet they seem to be overly fearful. But self-preservation is a natural reaction to a genuine crisis. (READ: Every government for itself? Virus poses difficult dilemmas)
South Korea has carried out more than 190,000 tests as part of a free nationwide screening program, and managed to record its lowest number of daily confirmed cases of the virus in weeks. (Sadly, we are not in the same caliber as the Koreans in terms of technology, funding, and discipline.)
A lockdown is going to be unpopular, I know. The drastic measures include blanket travel restrictions, a ban on all public events, the closure of schools and public spaces, and the suspension of religious services. But how do we solve with urgency given the situation that we have now?  
The health crisis can lead to an economic crisis if we do not think ahead and decide with sense of urgency. Our new plan has to be more aggressive now.  
However, these are only symptoms of the real problem.
True leaders accept personal responsibility, and do not obsess themselves over past failures or wrong results in their original plans.  
True leaders go only where their better selves are willing to tread. That’s where our leaders' own values come in. They must want to do something with their power, and not just be powerful. – Rappler.com

CEBU CITY, Philippines – Governor Arthur Yap announced on Friday, March 13, that Bohol will be under ""community quarantine"" from March 16 to 20 even if no confirmed COVID-19 cases have been recorded in the province.
Yap announced in a livestreamed press conference that he signed on Friday morning the executive order on the community quarantine which will take effect at 12:01 am on March 16.
He said the quarantine was meant to better prepare Boholanos in fighting the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.
""To help us organize into work teams, we need time to meet and to divide ourselves among the mayors, the local officials, national and local agencies,  and civic, business and religious organizations. For that to happen, I am declaring a community quarantine of the island of Bohol within 48 hours of the signing of the EO. That day will be from midnight of Monday, up to Friday,"" he said.
Yap clarified that Bohol will be on community quarantine and not on lockdown as those who wish to leave Bohol can do so for the duration of the quarantine period, but the province will not allow the entry of any visitors during that time.
“A lockdown means nobody comes in and out,” he added.
Yap said that the 5-day quarantine will be a a “dry run” to see how prepared the province is for a possible outbreak. As of Friday, Bohol had no confirmed cases but had two persons under investigation (PUIs)
Yap said he had identified two places with a total of 120 beds to accommodate those who need to g into quarantine – the old Tagbilaran airport and the annex in the Bohol Provincial Capital Building.   
The Barangay Health Response Teams and the province’s Tarsier 117 emergency response teams will also be on full-alert for reports of anyone needing to be placed under monitoring.  While the quarantine will only last for 5 days, the province may extend it as needed, Yap said.
 Yap is the latest local official to declare a quarantine in his area, following President Rodrigo Duterte's decision to put Metro Manila on 30-day lockdown beginning March 15. (READ: Metro Manila to be placed on lockdown due to coronavirus outbreak)
Mayor Kit Nieto has placed Cainta, Rizal – where 3 confirmed COVID-19 cases were recorded – under community quarantine starting March 15.
The resolution of the Inter-Agency Task Force on COVID-19 Duterte approved on Thursday allows the declaration of province-wide quarantines, but only when there are at least two positive coronavirus cases living in different municipalities, component cities, or independent component cities in the province.  
As of March 12, 52 persons were under investigation for possible COVID-19 infection in Central Visayas. The first case in the region was confirmed in Dumaguete City,  a municipal councilor who had returned from a conference in Manila.

DIPOLOG CITY – The National Historical Commission of the Philippines (NHCP) has closed to the public indefinitely the Rizal National Shrine, the biggest tourist drawer in nearby Dapitan City.
Dapitan's economy is largely driven by tourism, but local officials are implementing the preemptive measure despite the heavy financial costs as a preemptive measure to stop the spread of the novel coronavirus.
“Right now, Dapitan has no COVID-19 infection. we are implementing precautionary measures anyway,” said City Information Officer Randy Cabasag.
COVID-19, the sickness caused by the novel coronavirus, was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. 
Meanwhile, Bishop Severo Caermare of the Diocese of Dipolog  called for “calm, prayers” but be “cautious” as the entire diocese joined in the fight against the onslaught of the novel virus.
The Diocese of Dipolog has ecclesiastical jurisdiction over the province of Zamboanga del Norte.
There is no confirmed COVID-19 infection in Zamboanga del Norte, but restrictions and precautions against the disease have been strictly implemented.
 
In neighboring Dipolog, the 15 teachers, learners and a supervisor who visited South Korea last February ended their 14-day self-quarantine March 12 with no symptoms of COVID-19.
Meanwhile, Dakak Park and Beach Resort in Dapitan is hardest hit by the pandemic scare as its number of guests have declined sharply. There have been no foreign tourists arriving in over a month,
“We are now relying on local tourists. Anyway the sun is one of the best shield against COVID-19 than night life,” says Chembeelyn Alpeche-Balucan, Dakak corporate lawyer. “But we have to reduce work days per week and those in the management have salary cuts.”
As the residents brace to prevent COVID-19 from entering the province, Bishop Caermare through a pastoral letter released March 13 also announced steps to be implemented, including the draining off of holy water in founts at church entrances.
During mass, refrain from holding of hands while singing The Lord’s Prayer; to bow instead of shaking hands during the “kiss of peace”; to receive communion through their hands ,and those who are ill are advised to hear mass on television or radio.
If mass goers have to cough, the bishop said they have to cover their mouth with handkerchief or with their arms.
The traditionally popular kissing, touching or wiping of handkerchief on images are also discouraged.
The bishop is yet to issue guidelines on how to observe the coming Holy Week, which traditionally draws huge crowds in processions and masses. – Rappler.com "

SINGAPORE – The Singaporean government cautioned its nationals on Friday, March 13, against traveling to the Philippines and other countries that have exported cases of the novel coronavirus to Singapore.
At least 4 Filipinos who tested positive for COVID-19 in Singapore recently traveled to the Philippines. One of them, who is linked to another coronavirus patient, is classified by Singapore as an imported case.
At least 7 of Singapore’s 187 coronavirus cases are Filipinos. (READ: Coronavirus sa Singapore: Tips para sa mga Pilipino)
This precaution against trips to the Philippines is not as strong as the city-state’s advisory to defer all non-essential trips to Italy, France, Spain, and Germany, but it reflects growing concern about imported coronavirus cases from Singapore’s neighbors. 
The World Health Organization on Wednesday, March 11, declared the novel coronavirus disease called COVID-19 as a pandemic.
Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong announced on Thursday night, March 12, that he was ruling out a lockdown of the city-state even as Singapore would tighten precautionary measures against COVID-19. 
“In light of the rapid spread of the virus across Europe, the Ministry of Health (MOH) advises Singaporeans to defer all non-essential travel to Italy, France, Spain, and Germany,” the ministry said in a press release Friday. 
The ministry added that it maintained the earlier advisory to defer all travel to China’s Hubei province, from which the new coronavirus was said to have originated, and to defer non-essential travel to the rest of mainland China, Iran, Japan, and South Korea.
“Singaporeans are also advised to exercise caution when traveling to all countries affected by COVID-19, especially those which have exported cases. These include our neighboring countries, like Indonesia and the Philippines, and those further afield, like the United Kingdom. The global picture is evolving, and there could be other countries that may be affected,” said the MOH.
The MOH said that as of Friday, the following countries have exported coronavirus cases to Singapore: China, France, Germany, Italy, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, the Philippines, the United Kingdom, and the United States. 
Other measures implemented by Singapore include a ban on all new visitors with travel histories to Italy, France, Spain, and Germany within the last 14 days. The prohibition begins at 11:59 pm on Sunday, March 15, and covers visitors seeking to enter or transit through Singapore.
Social distancing
The Singaporean government also required the deferral or cancellation of all ticketed sports, cultural, and entertainment events that have 250 or more participants. 
If tickets had already been sold, “organizers must demonstrate that satisfactory precautionary measures have been put in place before they can proceed.”
For religious services and other private functions, Singapore has advised organizers, among other things, to “reduce the scale of events to below 250 participants where possible.”
Singapore also recommended that participants in such mass gatherings be seated one meter apart.
In line with the government’s precautionary measures, the Roman Catholic archbishop of Singapore, William Goh, on Thursday withdrew his earlier plan to resume Masses in Singapore. He cited the WHO’s declaration of COVID-19 as a pandemic. 
Muslim authorities in Singapore also decided to close all mosques in the city-state for disinfection for 5 days starting Friday. This was after Singaporeans attended a mass event in Kuala Lumpur where a number of participants tested positive for COVID-19. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – Government agencies will continue to provide “frontline services” even if President Rodrigo Duterte suspended work in the executive branch in Metro Manila to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus disease called COVID-19.
Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles made the announcement on Friday, March 13, saying the government will continue to work despite social distancing measures implemented to combat the coronavirus. 
“Yung frontline services po ng gobyerno ay tuloy-tuloy pa rin po (The government’s frontline services will continue),” Nograles said at a Malacañang briefing on the government’s response to the outbreak. 
Nograles said government agencies have been directed to implement skeletal staffing and consider telecommuting options for the duration of work suspension in Metro Manila which will last from Sunday, March 15 to April 12. 
The details of skelatal workforces – such as how many workers this will entail and who will be included – will depend on each agency, Nograles said. What’s imperative, he added, is that services will continue uninterrupted while measures to prevent the spread of the coronavirus are in place. 
What this includes: Under Republic Act No. 9485 or the Anti-Red Tape Act of 2007, “frontline services” is defined as the following: 
“The transactions between clients and government officers “involving applications for any privilege, right, permit, reward, license, concession, or for any modification, renewal, or extension of the enumerated applications and/or requests which are acted upon in the ordinary course of business of the agency or office concerned.”
Why this matters. Concerns over functions of government services were among the several questions raised after President Rodrigo Duterte delivered a briefing on government’s response to the coronavirus crisis on Thursday night, March 12.

While work in the executive branches will be suspended, health and emergency will remain in full operation.

President Rodrigo Duterte said on Thursday that as provided in the Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF) resolution that he had approved, local chief executives can announce municipality or city-wide quarantines when there are at least two positive coronavirus cases living in different barangays. 
Under the resolution, Metro Manila will be on 30-day lockdown beginning March 15. Nieto said he has followed the date set by the government for the localized quarantine, and indicated that it would also last for 30 days, or until April 14.
“March 15 po magkakabisa ang deklarasyong ito. Sasabay na natin sa petsa na itinakda ng ating Pangulo,” the Cainta mayor said. 
(This declaration will take effect on March 15. We will follow the dates set by the President.)

In another Facebook post on Friday, March 13, Nieto outlined measures the municipal government is taking before the quarantine takes effect:

Senior citizens will be provided with vitamins to help protect them against COVID-19.
The town-wide cleansing of public streets will continue, including misting and spraying activities.
The purchase control team of the Business Permits Office will go around Cainta to stop residents from panic-buying in groceries.
The municipal government will continue giving bottles of rubbing alcohol for those who need it.


Nieto said no stores wiould be shut down during the entire quarantine period in his town. All public events in Cainta are also canceled until the quarantine is lifted. – Rappler.com "

For most of us in Corporate Philippines, life goes like clockwork and often for good reasons. Being creatures of habit and natural allocators, we have most likely optimized our routines so as to allot a bigger slice of our finite 24 hours for things that makes us feel alive – relationships, hobbies, and interests. If this intentionally designed daily grind machine is threatened with even the slightest disruption, we are quick to deter, dismiss, downplay, or ignore.
Until we can no longer.
When initial reports of the coronavirus flooded everybody’s newsfeeds back in January, my “doomsday prepper” wife promptly took her action, starting with ordering the reusable face masks I am wearing today. She restricted her activities, pulled back on socials, and withdrew our daughter from Sunday school, resorting to live streaming Sunday worship services instead.
As a good husband who chooses his battles, I complied. But in my mind: ""The virus is far away from here, the sea should stop it the way it stopped the bubonic plague on European shores. Of all places in the globe, the virus surely can’t get to a certain Pasig City.""
That was, until last Monday, when I dropped off my wife for the office as usual. I marveled at the eery fact that only St. Luke’s thick walls were standing between me and the virus, which was at that moment probably just some 200 meters away. Earlier I passed by TriCity Medical Center, closer to home, where there were two other cases. The official tally of the DOH quickly rose from 4 to 24 to 33 as of March 10. Now it has everybody’s attention.
We are naturally uncomfortable with two things: change and uncertainty. The coronavirus is pressing these two down hard on us all.  We are now forced to change the routines we have diligently nursed all this time. While it is still in my power to decide to wear a face mask or not, there are some things that we can’t help but act in accordance with.
The menial ones are less important but irritating. The badminton courts religiously graced by my group have now started to refuse entry. The gardening raid scheduled one weekend had been canceled, and our weekly grocery is now taking twice as much time due to longer lines from panic buying.
Then comes the tougher bit to members of the workforce. Companies started to break off teams into smaller units and scatter them across several locations as a business continuity contingency. In case a part of the team gets infected or has to be quarantined, there would still be a functioning unit somewhere. That means I would have to report in a location outside my route. (READ: Depth of economic slowdown depends on response – IMF)
Fortunately, working from home, previously frowned upon, is now being invoked by the few capable offices such as my wife’s, so I don’t have to go way off as much just to drop her off. My sister who took time off from her UAE job will have to self-quarantine first for two weeks when she returns there, at her own expense, before she can finish the remaining one month of her contract.
The business shakedown is very real. There are few businesses, especially the small ones, that can stay solvent longer than the scare of the virus. For instance, people I know from the hospitality industries are now forced to only take 3 shifts a week instead of the usual 5, as tourism grinds to a halt. Executives are forced to take their vacation leaves to help meet the quarterly targets that cannot be helped operationally.
The decrease in economic activity seems to have rattled investors also, whose pendulum has swung from the optimistic January where it valued PSEI an all-time high of 9078.37, to the pessimistic outlook now, where it is valued at 5,946.66 – slashed by an astounding 33%. (By the way, this is the best time to buy stocks.) (READ: Global stocks suffer historic rout, shrugging off central bank steps)
Businesses are still trying hard, though. In Makati, Landmark, SM, and Rustan’s are simultaneously holding ""sales"" to stimulate consumption and purchases. It will be a sort of natural selection in the businesscape. Allow the scare to go on long enough and only the businesses with adequate capital and little debt will be able to see the end of the tunnel.
While change is inconvenient and nagging, it is not as wearying as uncertainty. It then becomes a test of stamina. How long can you wear the face mask (if you are on the camp that believes it helps)? How long can you stay away from the malls? How long can you keep your hands away from your eyes, nose, and mouth? How long can you keep a dispersed team safe and functioning?
My solution is to once again build a routine around it. Find a less crowded marketplace and carefully source groceries from there. Then prepare food at home for the day’s intake – not just lunch, but also breakfast, snacks, and dinner, so you won’t have to go anywhere else. Wear the mask when traveling from home to office. Alcohol down upon arrival at the office, and at home go straight to the bath before your toddler's hugs and kisses. Keep your hands in your pockets as much as you can. And pray, pray and pray!
An ounce of prevention is not worth a pound of cure. An ounce of prevention is not worth a ton of cure.

MANILA, Philippines – Just hold it for a month, the government is telling couples whose wedding plans may be affected by a looming lockdown of Metro Manila aimed at preventing the spread of the novel coronavirus.
Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles and Trade Secretary Ramon Lopez admitted there were no particular guidelines yet for weddings. But because the guiding principle of the lockdown is “social distancing,” couples should consider postponing weddings until after April 15, or else cut the number of guests, the two Cabinet members said in the Laging Handa media briefing on Friday, March 13.
The lockdown order bans mass gatherings of people, which may include weddings.
“Prohibited po. Pasensya na po (It’s prohibited. I’m sorry). They’ll have to…” Nograles failed to finish his sentence as the briefing room broke into laughter.
Lopez said the Cabinet should include weddings when they draft guidelines for the lockdown later in the day.
“Hindi ho mapipigilan ang pag-ibig. Bawasan na lang nila ‘yung guests…makakatipid pa sila (There’s no stopping love, They should just cut back on the guests…they’ll end up saving money),” Lopez suggested.
Depends on the size of the room
Because social distancing means people staying at least one meter away from one another, couples should decide the number of guests based on the size of the hall where they plan to hold the ceremony and the reception, Nograles said.
“An informal estimate would be 50 guests, but it really depends on the size of the room,” he added.
And if the idea is to keep each other at least an arm’s length, “Paano magki-kiss yung couple? Paano yung distansya nung couple?” Nograles jested. (How can the couple kiss? How about the couples’ distance?)
In the time of the coronavirus, love must prove itself ""timeless and boundless,"" Nograles said. 
“What is one month’s postponement for love?”
Force majeur
Lopez looked at the more practical concern: what about those who’ve placed reservations at hotels and restaurants, and have already made down payments?
“Dapat ho may refund, kasi force majeur po ‘yon. So huwag sila matakot,” the trade secretary said. (They should be refunded because that’s force majeur. They shouldn’t worry.)
If the establishments give them a hard time, couples may file a consumer complaint with the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) through its hotline 1384.
The DTI will take the customers’ side and ensure they get their refund, Lopez said.

In a statement on Friday, March 13, Quezon City Mayor Joy Belmonte provided guidelines on what the city's different sectors should do during the lockdown.
The immediate response of the city government was to continue citywide disinfection, including the closure of public spaces such as parks, covered courts, buildings, and other facilities. 
In an interview with ANC, Belmonte said that they would also intensify contact tracing.
""In the past, while we would contact-trace close contacts and relatives of those who are positive, now we would like to require that these positive patients would recall every single person they have had contact with for the past week, and all of these individuals we would require to be quarantined,"" Belmonte said.
To augment quarantine facilities, Belmonte said empty buildings would be converted into isolation rooms to accommodate people who might be placed under quarantine. 
Persons under investigation and persons under monitoring within the city are also being monitored continuously.
The city government was also implementing a 4-day workweek for local government employees  to continue service delivery.
Barangay officials and policemen will be monitoring public spaces strictly, covering malls, computer shops, and community spaces. Belmonte also asked all barangays to have isolation rooms.
Meanwhile, the private sector was encouraged to implement flexible work arrangements to mitigate the risk of infection. They were also told to monitor the health of their employees.
Retail and commercial establishments must sanitize facilities regularly and keep transactions orderly, equitable, and fair. Belmonte also asked these establishments to ensure that supplies are ""democratized"" among shoppers to prevent hoarding and panic buying. (READ: Hoarding, overpricing would lead to criminal charges, warns DTI)

MANILA, Philippines – Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles on Friday, March 13, assured the public that the transport and supply of basic necessities and essential goods into Metro Manila will continue unhampered despite a lockdown of the mega-city.
Nograles said the Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF) on Emerging Infectious Diseases will likewise be drafting guidelines on how this will take place specifically, given that domestic land, sea, and air travel will not be allowed to and from the Metro Manila starting Sunday, March 15. 

""We would like to stress that the transport of goods to Metro Manila from the provinces and vice-versa will remain subject to guidelines. This means that residents of NCR should not worry about the supplies of produce, foods, and other goods in our markets, groceries, and retailers,"" Nograles said at a Malacañang briefing on the government measures against the coronavirus outbreak. 
Nograles made the announcement the morning after President Rodrigo Duterte delivered a briefing on measures taken to combat the coronavirus crisis in the Philippines. 
With assurances goods will remain available to residents of Metro Manila, Nograles appealed to the public to refrain from panic buying and wiping store shelves. 
 ""Ulitin natin, huwag po tayong maghoard…. 'Di po tao mauubusan. Tuloy-tuloy po ang supplies natin dito sa Metro Manila,"" he said. 
(We repeat, please do not hoard…. We will not run out (of goods). Supplies will continue to be transported to Metro Manila.) 
Duterte earlier declared “community quarantine” measures will be imposed on the entirety of Metro Manila starting midnight of Sunday, March 15. It will last until April 14.   
The measure was imposed to prevent the further spread of the novel coronavirus disease called COVID-19.
Nograles said details of how this will be enforced will still be drafted by the IATF during its scheduled meeting later on Friday. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – Trade Secretary Ramon Lopez on Friday, March 13, said that informal sector workers, who are generally not registered to do business in Metro Manila, should sell outside the capital region in the meantime.
At the Laging Handa press briefing in Malacañang, Lopez was asked what would happen to informal sector workers, when the government implements the impending precautionary lockdown of Metro Manila against the spread of the coronavirus disease.
According to Lopez, it's either they register as informal sector members or they sell outside Metro Manila. (READ: What you need to know about PH's informal sector workers)
""I-encourage na lang natin sila na either magregister sila or 'do'n na lang sila sa lugar nanggagaling, 'wag na pumasok sa Metro Manila. Kasi 'yung general princple po, sabi na nga ng ating CabSec (Cabinet Secretary), talagang ma-minimize 'yung movement,"" Lopez said.
(We encourage them to either register or just do business where they are from and not enter Metro Manila. Because the general principle, as mentioned by our CabSec, is to minimize the movement.)
Lopez said that informal sector workers are not registered in LGUs, in general.
""Generally speaking, pagka-informal sector, 'pag sila mismo ang negosyante, do'n na lang sila sa ibang lugar muna na lang magnegosyo, 'wag na lang sa Metro Manila. Hindi naman sila registered eh. Technically, puwede silang magnegosyo kahit saan,"" Lopez said.
(Generally speaking, for informal sector workers, if they are the seller, it's better if they do business in other places in the meantime, and not in Metro Manila. They are usually not registered. Technically, they can do business anywhere.)
But Lopez qualified that some informal sectors are indeed registered in some local governments, so they will still be allowed entry for business.
""Kaya dapat magregister sila. Tapos gano'n na rin sa workers na 'yon kasi importante may ID eh. Kasi limit talaga natin 'yung movement within one month,"" Lopez said.
(It's really important that they register. It's important for the workers to have an ID. Because we are really limiting the movement within one month.)
The Philippines declared a ""community quarantine"" – which in effect is similar to a lockdown – that will be restricting land, air, and water travel from Metro Manila to any point of the country from March 15 to April 14.
Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles said that the lockdown of Metro Manila can be lifted anytime the Duterte government sees it fit, or be extended if needed.

MANILA, Philippines – The impending precautionary lockdown of Metro Manila against the spread of the novel coronavirus can be lifted anytime if the Duterte government sees it fit, Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles said on Friday, March 13. It can also be extended if needed.
""The suspension of domestic travel will be reviewed on a daily basis, and may be lifted earlier if the situation allows it, or extended further if the situation requires it,"" Nograles said during a briefing in Malacañang.
Why does this matter? President Rodrigo Duterte announced on Thursday night that the lockdown will last from March 15 to April 14, basing on the resolution of the Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF) on the coronavirus outbreak.
The evaluation will be based on the spread and containment of the coronavirus in the region of more than 12 million people.
The exceptions: According to Interior Secretary Eduardo Año, workers from the provinces will be allowed to come in and out of Metro Manila as long as they present their IDs or proof of working in the National Capital Region.
Other exceptions to the lockdown will be fleshed out, Nograles said, during the meeting of the IATF after the Palace briefing. President Duterte earlier said he will issue an executive order to provide an enforcible basis for the IATF's resolution. – Rappler.com "

AKLAN, Philippines – The Boracay Inter-Agency Tak Force (BIATF) has decided to cancel the LoveBoracay 2.0 celebration and other scheduled crowd-drawing events in light of possible person-to-person transmission of the novel coronavirus.
The cancellation comes in the wake of Executive Order No. 18 issued on March 12 by Aklan Governor Florencio Miraflores scrapping large gatherings in public places including the 64th Aklan Day festivities to reduce risk of exposure to the coronavirus.
So far, as of March 12, Aklan has no recorded case of COVID-19, the sickness caused by the coronavirus. There are also no positive cases of transmission of the virus here.
The other events in the island resort that were scheduled for April 26 to May 2 but now shelved are:

Skim Boarding Contest,
Pinta Layag,
Local Kite Boarding and Wind Surfing Tournament,
Drone Film Festival,
Water Festival,
National Life Guards Olympics,
Beach Futsal and Volleyball,
Aklan Hammock Festival 3.0,
Sabor Boracay,

Boracay Clean Up,
and Toy Boat Racing.

 “Once this health pandemic is over, they agreed to hold the events even better as planned... we hope the full cooperation of everyone to safeguard the well-being of the whole Boracay community,” said BIATF deputy ground commandeer Al Orolfo.
The governor signed the EO No. 18 after a meeting on March 9 with the Aklan Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases.
Miraflores said travellers coming from affected countries to Aklan are also advised to undergo home care quarantine if they develop symptoms. All bus terminals, department stores and malls are directed to conduct health screenings with handheld thermal scanners and to provide hand sanitizers to passengers and customers.
The governor said the measures are being put in place to tackle the threat of coronavirus to the health and safety of residents and the communities.
In other developments, the deadly impact of coronavirus has gripped health authorities in the Philippines with 52 new infections as of March 12. In Aklan, no confirmed cases or people tested positive of the killer infection.

MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – Batangas province reported on Friday, March 13, its first two confirmed cases of the COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.
According to the Batangas Public Information Office, the two cases are from Batangas City and are currently isolated in a medical facility in Metro Manila.
Earlier on Friday morning, Governor Hermilando Mandanas confirmed the first case of COVID-19 in the province, advising Batangueños to take preventive measures against the virus.
“Tayo sa Batangas ay kakayanin ang [mga] sakuna na ito, kapares na rin ang ginagawang pangangalaga dahil naman sa pagputok ng Taal Volcano at pagsisimula ng African Swine Fever sa bayan ng Laurel,” Mandanas said.

On Thursday night, March 12, President Rodrigo Duterte announced that Metro Manila – a region of over 12 million people – will be placed on lockdown for at least a month to contain the spread of the virus in the country.
The announcement came shortly after the President declared that the alert level for the coronavirus has been raised to its maximum level of Code Red Sublevel 2.
“Ang lalawigan ng Batangas ay hindi lang sapat sa pagkain, tayo rin po ang inaasahang mag-supply ng tilapia, baboy, manok, baka, at iba pang pagkain pang araw-araw hindi lamang sa Metro Manila kundi sa iba pang bahagi ng Pilipinas,” Mandanas said.

To ensure the safety of students, Mandanas has also suspended classes in all levels, public and private, in the province starting today, March 13, until March 31.
“Ang kapakanan ng ating mga ka-lalawigan ay lalo nating itataguyod lalo na ang ating mga kabataaan.

MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – A Filipino diplomat at the Philippines’ Permanent Mission to the United Nations tested positive for COVID-19, said to be the first known coronavirus case at the UN in New York.
Department of Foreign Affairs Assistant Secretary Eduardo Meñez said this on Friday, March 13, when asked to confirm a Reuters report that a diplomat from the Philippine mission to the UN tested positive for COVID-19. 
""Yes, one of our diplomats at the Philippine Mission to the UN in New York has tested positive for COVID,"" Meñez said in a text message.
""The necessary health and safety protocols have been implemented,"" he added.
In a statement on Friday, March 13, the Philippine Mission to the UN said Deputy Permanent Representative Kira Azucena informed other UN missions about the development on Thursday and notified the UN medical director’s office and the New York City health department. The latter advised them to ""self-isolate.""
""As of today, the Philippine Center in New York housing the Philippine Mission is on lockdown until further notice and its employees have been instructed to self-quarantine and to seek medical attention should they develop the symptoms,"" it said.
The mission said the staff, who was diagnosed with COVID-19 on Thursday, ""is in good condition.""
""She last visited the United Nations last Monday, March 9, for about 30 minutes – from 12.50 to 1.20 pm. She was asymptomatic then,"" it said.
""The following day, Tuesday, March 10, she came down with flu-like symptoms and, in accordance with the Mission’s office protocol, did not report for work that day and saw her doctor. She tested positive for flu and was prescribed Tamiflu. She got the call today that she tested positive for COVID-19,"" it added.
The Philippine mission said it was closely coordinating with the New York health department.

Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr also commented on the case through Twitter on Friday, in response to a Reuters reporter who tweeted about the report.
""The infected is doing well; she's young, spritely, smart and taking some doctor prescribed meds. Thank you. I just talked to Kira,"" he said, referring to Acting Philippine Ambassador to the UN Kira Azucena who is in charge of the diplomat.
Locsin said the Filipino diplomat came from Florida before going back to New York. 
At least 103 Filipinos abroad have contracted the virus.

MANILA, Philippines (3rd UPDATE) – Leaders of the Catholic Church, the predominant religion in the Philippines, suspended Masses in parts of Metro Manila starting Saturday, March 14, after the Duterte government announced it is placing the capital region on lockdown due to the novel coronavirus.
Masses have been suspended in the following parts of the Philippines’ capital region: Manila, Makati, Pasay, San Juan, Mandaluyong, Pasig, Taguig, Pateros, Parañaque, Las Piñas, Muntinlupa, Quezon City, and northern Caloocan City. 
The Archdiocese of Manila has suspended public Masses for 7 days starting Saturday, according to its temporary head Bishop Broderick Pabillo on Friday, March 13.
The Archdiocese of Manila covers the cities of Manila, Makati, Pasay, San Juan, and Mandaluyong.
His directive does not apply to other dioceses or Catholic territories in Metro Manila, each of which has its own bishop.
Later on Friday, the Diocese of Cubao, which covers the southern part of Quezon City, also announced the indefinite suspension of Masses starting March 14.
The decision was made by Cubao Bishop Honesto Ongtioco, who meanwhile allowed the diocese's priests to say Masses in private and to air these via livestream.
Pasig Bishop Mylo Hubert Vergara also suspended public Masses in his diocese starting March 14. The Diocese of Pasig covers Pasig, Taguig, and Pateros.
The Diocese of Parañaque, led by Bishop Jesse Mercado, meanwhile said there will be no public Masses from March 15 to 21. This diocese covers Parañaque, Las Piñas, and Muntinlupa.
The Diocese of Novaliches, which covers the northern parts of Quezon City and Caloocan City, has had no public Masses since Friday. The suspension will last until April 12, said Novaliches Bishop Roberto Gaa. 
In a pastoral letter on Friday, Pabillo cited the government’s decision to raise Code Red Sublevel 2, the highest alert level for disease outbreaks, in the Philippines’ capital region.
“We are enjoined to avoid large gatherings of people to avert the further spread of the virus. We heed this call not with panic but with care for charity to others and the common good,” said Pabillo.
“Hence in the Archdiocese of Manila I dispense all the faithful from the obligation of going to Mass this Sunday. There will be no public celebration of the Holy Mass and no public activities in all the churches in the Archdiocese for 7 days, starting Saturday, March 14, till Friday, March 20,” the bishop added.
This is the first time in recent history that Masses have been suspended in a major part of the Philippines, a predominantly Catholic country.
Roughly 8 out of 10 Filipinos belong to the Catholic Church, and Sunday Masses have been part of Filipinos’ lives for centuries.
The suspension of public Masses is one of the major disruptions caused by the government’s lockdown of Metro Manila, which lasts from March 15 to April 14. 
Metro Manila is a region of more than 12 million people, but this number swells to up to 15 million at daytime, when Filipinos from nearby provinces such as Laguna and Bulacan flock to the metro to work. 
While Masses are suspended in the Archdiocese of Manila, Pabillo advised Catholics to watch online Masses on church-run stations Radio Veritas and TV Maria, and on the social media pages of Quiapo Church and other Catholic churches. 
Pabillo also called for the tolling of church bells at noon and at 8 pm every day, from March 14 onwards, to call on Catholics to pray to fight the coronavirus. 
“In the spirit of Lent let us accompany our prayer with acts of penance and charity,” Pabillo added. “Let not fear run our lives. Hence we avoid panic buying. We should not consider only our needs but also the needs of others.” – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – The Philippine National Police (PNP) has placed its cops in Metro Manila, Central Luzon, Calabarzon, and Bicol on full alert beginning Friday, March 13.
The PNP Directorate for Operations issued the order citing President Rodrigo Duterte's declaration of a public health emergency in the country and the ""community quarantine"" of Metro Manila from March 15 to April 14, to stem the COVID-19 outbreak.
After Duterte announced the lockdown, Interior Secretary Eduardo Año said cops would enforce it through checkpoints. The Armed Forces of the Philippines, meanwhile, is on standby to augment police forces.
Placing cops on full alert means that their vacation leaves are canceled and that they would have to work overtime. The PNP earlier banned foreign travel for cops to prevent them from getting the novel coronavirus abroad.
National Capital Region Police Office Director Major General Debold Sinas earlier said at least 40,000 cops would be deployed to enforce the Metro Manila lockdown.
Duterte approved the resolution of the Inter-Agency Task Force on the coronavirus crisis on Thursday night that recommended, among others, that Metro Manila be placed on a 30-day lockdown, but the Presdient said he would issue an executive order to make sure  that the recommendations are followed. Agencies have yet to issued their respective memoranda on how to enforce the resolution. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – A staff member of the Printing Service office in the House of Representatives tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.
House Secretary-General Luis Montales sent a message to House employees late Thursday night, March 12, saying he “received word that a staff from Printing Service tested positive for COVID-19.” 
The patient has not traveled to any country with COVID-19 cases nor has the patient made contact with a confirmed case.  
The patient had been in and out of the hospital since last year due to various ailments and was recently confined for community-acquired pneumonia. The patient last reported for work in the House on March 3.
It is still unclear, however, if the Printing Service office staff member is already part of the 52 positive cases already confirmed by the Department of Health (DOH) as of Thursday evening. 
All personnel from the Printing Service office, as well as all other employees and House members with whom the patient made contact, will be undergoing quarantine.  
At least 3 lawmakers and one House official confirmed to Rappler on Friday, March 13, that Montales had sent the message, where the House Secretary-General said it is the “DOH [that] will make the official announcement. “ 
Rappler already sought Montales for comment, but he has yet to reply as of posting time. The office of Speaker Alan Peter Cayetano also said to wait for the DOH’s announcement. 
The Senate is currently under ""restricted access"" after a resource person in a March 5 hearing tested positive for COVID-19. This prompted several senators, House members, and Cabinet officials to undergo self-quarantine.
President Rodrigo Duterte already declared a state of public health emergency and raised the Code Red Sublevel 2 in the country due to the COVID-19 outbreak, which has killed 5 so far in the Philippines.
Metro Manila will be put on a month-long lockdown starting March 15, while classes and government offices will also be suspended. – Rappler.com "

PUBLIC ADDRESS. President Rodrigo Duterte addresses the public about the novel coronavirus in a live broadcast on March 12, 2020. Behind him are Armed Forces of the Philippines chief General Felimon Santos Jr (R) and Army chief Lieutenant General Gilbert Gapay (L). Screencap from RTVM 
When President Rodrigo Duterte addressed the nation in a live broadcast on Thursday night, March 12, the master shot showed Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) chief of staff General Felimon Santos Jr in the background to his left, and Philippine Army chief Lieutenant General Gilbert Gapay to his right.
Wider shots taken from other angles showed other members of the uniformed services seated in array along the walls of the cavernous Malacañang hall from where the President spoke.
It was clear right away that what he was going to announce will involve government muscle, and indeed Duterte then ordered a lockdown of Metro Manila to prevent the novel coronavirus from spreading further.
It was hardly a surprise for people in the metropolis. Leaked copies of the unsigned order went viral earlier in the day, and they headed to supermarkets and drugstores to stock up on food and supplies, anticipating that lockdown.
In fact, people have been “panic buying” ever since the first local transmission of the virus was reported over the weekend.
By the time the President addressed the public two hours behind schedule on Thursday night, the number of cases had exceeded 50.
Reassurance?
If the goal was to reassure the public that things were under control, then it was Duterte himself who painted a grim picture of what the lockdown could lead to – not because the police and military were involved, but because of what he imagined he would need them to do if worse comes to worst.
“Mayroon po kami, itong Inter-Agency Task Force, kasali na ang military pati police, kasi kailangan namin ang tulong nila kung sakali man lalala talaga ‘to,” he said. (We have this Inter-Agency Task Force, now including the military and police, because we need their help in case this really gets out of hand.)
“Maybe this would create a public disturbance, disorder, pero ang tingin ko hanggang diyan lang naman (but I think that’s all) because I know you want to follow because you want to help everybody including yourself and your family,” he also said.
Midway into the broadcast, Duterte got more vivid:
“I do not want anybody interfering in your enjoyment as a citizen of this republic. Ayaw ko na masita kayo ng police pati ng military (I don’t want you to get accosted by the police or the military). It could be messy kasi yung mga iba sa inyo, soplado (because some of you are snooty). And these police and military, they have their orders to enforce.” 
“So that if you are in this category of a, grupo kayo tapos pag malapit, yung social distancing is no longer obeyed, and you, you are violating the rules, and if you insist, it is one of just mere confrontation to something like disobedience, which is punishable under the Revised Penal Code,” Duterte said, describing an imagined tussle between civilians and law enforcers.
“Kung makipag-away ka…baka masuntok mo o ano (If you pick a fight…you might hit them or something), then it becomes an assault on an agent of a person in authority. In which case, from a simple violation of a rule, it will now ripen into a crime that is punishable by law and you can go to prison. That’s the problem.”
So just do what the police or military officer tells you, to stay out of trouble, Duterte concluded.
On the defensive
Then he went on with the broad strokes of the lockdown: classes suspended, government and private offices to wind down operations, no outsiders coming into the metropolis unless necessary, restrictions on domestic and international travel.
Again, Duterte went on the defensive:
“But it’s a lockdown. There is no struggle of power here…. It’s just a matter of protecting and defending you from COVID-19. That’s about it. It has nothing to do with the power of the military nor the power of the police nor my power and these guys beside me. It’s just an issue of protecting public interest and public health. ‘Yun lang (That’s it).”
Saying he did not have enough military and police personnel to cover every inch of the country, Duterte planned to enlist barangay captains to help enforce the lockdown.
At this point, the picture was clear, and again, the President defended his vision:
“Hindi ito martial law. It is not a martial law. It’s not even something extraordinary. But what is sought to be solved here is the, again, walang iba (nothing else) except to fight the virus and to exact compliance.”
“Mas mabuti talaga yung maniwala kayo (You’re better off believing),” he added.
‘Total breakdown’
The Philippines had its first confirmed case of the virus on January 30. Containing the virus is difficult, and even countries with efficient governments and health care systems are struggling to quell it. Naturally, Filipinos are afraid.
Somehow, Duterte sensed that his military approach to the matter was adding to that fear.
Military presence is a touchy subject among Filipinos still traumatized by martial law under Ferdinand Marcos, the dictator who cracked down on all dissent and criticism through intimidation, torture, and murder, as he and his cronies ransacked the public treasury.
More recently, Mindanao just came out of two-and-a-half years of martial law following the terrorist siege of Marawi City in May 2017. It was a time of heightened tension as police and military went after extremists and communist rebels in a region long battered by armed conflict.
In so-called “imperial Metro Manila,” where people are more used to relative order and comfort, the idea of a lockdown might be alarming to some.
But for Duterte, it is the only way to fix the problem and already, he anticipates a “total breakdown.”
“Because in a total breakdown, I would need their help to carry on with the governance…. Do not try to play with ‘martial law-martial law, military.’ Pero ang sa totoo (But the truth is), in a total breakdown, public disturbance…. It’s always the military who keep things in the country in order,” he said.
He explained further:
“To do that, if things deteriorate, I said, the military and the police will maintain order. Kaya nga tawag diyan (That’s why it’s called), peace and order. There has to be peace, and that peace, nakalagay na (has to be), orderly. There has to be order in the country and that is all.”
From these words, the nation is expected to draw a sense of security and assurance that the situation will not devolve into chaos. Otherwise, they know what course of action the President has in mind. – Rappler.com "

AKLAN, Philippines – Aklan Governor Florencio Miraflores issued an order on Thursday, March 12, to cancel or postpone all public events and large community gatherings amid rising cases of the coronavirus disease in the country. 
Although there are no positive cases in Aklan, a tourist destination, Miraflores said added measures were needed to safeguard residents in the province, as recommended by Aklan’s Inter-agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases on March 9.
Miraflores also cancelled activities lined up for the 64th Aklan Day celebration on April 25. He said this was to reduce the risks of community transmission of the virus.
He signed Executive Order 18 on March 12, directing big transportation companies to check the body temperature of passengers at their terminals with handheld thermal scanners. Malls, department stores, and other establishments are required to provide hand sanitizers to their customers. 
The order is effective immediately and enforceable within 45 days.
The governor also cited the public health emergency proclamation of President Rodrigo Duterte on March 8 and the code red alert issued by the Department of Health.
For now, health authorities also advise Aklanon residents arriving at or returning to Aklan from affected countries to observe home care quarantine, monitor symptoms, and coordinate with health response teams in the barangays. 
The Provincial Health Office earlier reported 82 persons under monitoring and 9 persons under investigations in Aklan from January 17 to March 12. All 9 cases were discharged from the Aklan provincial hospital after they tested negative for the virus, according to results from the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine. – Rappler.com

MANILA, Philippines – As he was set to address Filipinos amid the growing novel coronavirus crisis in the Philippines, President Rodrigo Duterte on Thursday, March 12, spared some time to praise Chinese President Xi Jinping. 
“You know President Xi Jinping for all of his goodness to us, wrote me a letter and said that he is willing to help. All we have to do is to ask,” Duterte said in a televised briefing as he veered from a prepared speech that included urgent recommendations of the Philippines’ Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases. The task force was created to combat the virulent coronavirus.
After announcing Filipino workers will be allowed to return to mainland China, Duterte also said, “Maybe there will be time if things deteriorate that I have to call on China to help. He said that they have managed the crisis very well in his country and he is very much willing to help kung kailangan (if needed),” he added. 
“So to the Chinese government, the people, especially to President Xi Jinping, thank you for the consoling words and maybe I hope it would not reach to that point, but maybe we will need your help. Salamat po (Thank you),” Duterte said. 
Model example? Since the coronavirus crisis began in January 2020, the Chinese government has been widely criticized both in China and abroad, for its handling of the outbreak.  
The reputation of Xi and other Chinese officials took a hit after reports showed a lack of transparency delayed critical response by health officials to the public health emergency.  
With cases now tapering in China, Xi recently made a visit to Wuhan – ground zero of the outbreak – in a bid to show the disease was “under control.”  
Other measures taken: Duterte’s public address at past 8 pm on Thursday was the first briefing he made since international health officials announced the outbreak had become a pandemic and additional cases of COVID-19 were reported in the Philippines. 
During his address, Duterte announced he would be implementing a lockdown on Metro Manila starting March 15, suspending classes and government work until April 12, and banning non-Filipinos coming directly from countries where there were locally transmitted cases of the coronavirus. 
The Philippines has recorded at least 52 confirmed coronavirus cases as of Thursday, 5 of whom have died.
Worldwide, the virus has infected more than 125,000 people and killed 4,600 across 115 countries. More than 62,000 people have recovered from the virus. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – The Davao City government is prohibiting residents from leaving its borders as the country deals with an increasing number of novel coronavirus cases.
In a Facebook post on Thursday, March 12, the city government said all residents are prohibited from going out of Davao City. 
All short-term visitors are also “advised” to leave Davao City immediately.
The city government “requested” those planning to visit the city to postpone their trip until after President Rodrigo Duterte, the father of Davao City Mayor Sara Duterte, lifts the state of public health emergency.
Despite the strict travel restrictions to and from Davao City, its local government said it is “not on lockdown.” 

Before imposing this sweeping local travel ban, Mayor Duterte already temporarily closed off the Night Market along Roxas Avenue starting Thursday. All parks and playgrounds were ordered shut as well. 
The city government said it may soon have the capability to test samples of the novel coronavirus at the Southern Philippines Medical Center later this month.  
“We are waiting for the materials to be sent here, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). It will be the molecular laboratory that will be doing the tests,” said Dr Marie Yvette Barez, the hospital’s Infection Control and Prevention Unit chair.
On Thursday evening, the President said he will place Metro Manila under lockdown from March 15 to April 14. Local government units outside Metro Manila may also declare localized lockdowns within their respective jurisdictions. 
A city-wide quarantine, like the one being implemented in Davao City, may be imposed when there are at least two positive coronavirus cases living in different barangays.

MANILA, Philippines – More than 600 stranded overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) are now allowed to go back to their jobs in all of mainland China except Hubei province, the epicenter of the novel coronavirus outbreak.
President Rodrigo Duterte announced this late Thursday, March 12, after approving the recommendations under Resolution No. 11, Series of 2020 of the Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF) for the Management of Emerging Infectious Disease.
OFWs who wish to return to mainland China will be allowed to fly there upon signing a declaration “signifying their knowledge and understanding of the risks involved,"" according to the the IATF resolution.
President Duterte read from the resolution submitted by the task force, with the premise that he would turn the resolution into an executive order to make it enforceable.
A health advisory pamphlet will be also given to the OFWs upon their departure from the Philippines. 
The Philippines had imposed a travel ban on China and its administrative regions Hong Kong and Macau after the cases of COVID-19 – the disease caused by 2019-nCoV – started spreading worldwide.
The Philippines already allowed OFWs to return to their jobs in Macau and Hong Kong on February 18. 
Wuhan City, the capital of Hubei province in China, is the epicenter of the new disease which has infected more than 80,700 people and killed at least 3,169. 
As of Thursday afternoon, the Philippines has confirmed 52 cases of COVID-19, two of which were fatal.

MANILA, Philippines – San Miguel Alab Pilipinas has asked the ASEAN Basketball League to suspend operations amid the worsening COVID-19 pandemic, per a statement by team owner Charlie Dy on Thursday, March 12. 
Alab is joined by 3 Chinese teams, namely Hong Kong Eastern, Formosa Dreamers of Taiwan and the Macau Black Bears, in asking the league to stand down amid the global health crisis.
“With the World Health Organization declaring COVID-19 as a pandemic, Alab Pilipinas wishes to put the safety of our fans and our team first,” the statement read. 
“Since the ABL is a regional league and travel will be difficult and risky, Alab Pilipinas together with Hong Kong Eastern, Macau Black Bears, and Formosa Dreamers deem it appropriate to request the ABL to follow the NBA and other sporting leagues in suspending our season.”
Macau, Hong Kong and Formosa have all posted similarly-worded statements on their Facebook pages.
The Philippine team has not played a game since February 23 as the league underwent a ravaging chain of postponements for multiple teams involved due to the COVID scare.
However, some teams have continued to play amid the health crisis including the Singapore Slingers, whose import reportedly boarded a plane with a COVID-positive individual. (READ: ABL import quarantined due to coronavirus scare)
Incidentally, they played the league’s most recent game last March 6.
“Alab Pilipinas believes that our fans and supporters will understand this move as it is for the best interest of everyone to take precaution,” Dy’s statement continued.
“Many experts have shared that social distancing is the best way to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 and we wish to take part of this solution.”

MANILA, Philippines – President Rodrigo Duterte suspended classes in all levels and government work in the executive branch for one month or until April 12, in a bid to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus in the Philippines. 
Duterte announced the measure in a televised public address on Thursday night, March 12.
The measure was based on the recommendation of the Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases, which met earlier on Thursday to discuss urgent measures to combat the coronavirus crisis.
The President read from the resolution submitted by the task force, with the premise that he would turn the resolution into an executive order to make it enforceable.
What to expect: Schools are covered by the pronouncement, but all students will still be made to continue their educational requirements during the one-month period.  
The latest move is an expansion of Duterte's earlier pronouncement to suspend classes in the mega-city from March 10 to 14. 
Suspension of classes and work in government will take effect on Sunday, March 15.
Local government units outside the National Capital Region may exercise “sound discretion” on determining whether or not to suspend classes in their areas. If they choose to do so, local officials must ensure students will continue to fulfill academic requirements and remain in their homes for the measure to be effective. 
For government work in the executive branch, suspension will likewise be in place for a period of 30 days, though agencies may form skeletal workforces to ensure government services continue. Only offices in Metro Manila are covered by the order. 
Health and emergency services are not covered by the pronouncement, and will continue in full operation. 
Legislative and judicial offices are ""encouraged"" to adopt the policy. 
What about workers in the private sector? The task force encouraged all private business in Metro Manila to observe flexible working arrangements. The labor department earlier issued guidelines for these arrangements. 
However, all manufacturing, retail, and service establishments were advised to remain operational, provided employers put in place strict social distancing measures.  
Why this matters. Sweeping measures set in place were drafted by a technical advisory group led by infectious disease experts to quell the spread of the virus in the Philippines. 
Duterte on Monday, March 9, earlier declared a state of public health emergency after the health officials announced more confirmed coronavirus cases, including the first case of local transmission in the Philippines. 
The Philippines has recorded at least 52 confirmed coronavirus cases as of Thursday. Two people have died.

The governor noted in his order that the national government has already reported the rise of locally transmitted cases of COVID-19 in the country and that President Rodrigo Duterte has  declared a state of a public health emergency.
For private schools, the suspension of classes is under the discretion of the school administrators, Bimbo Miraflor, provincial public information officer, said.
For Negros Oriental, aside from the confirmed case, 3 persons are still under investigation, while 20 persons are under monitoring, he said.
He said the three PUIs are improving, while the 20 PUMs have a travel history in Hong Kong, China, and South Korea.
Commitment
Miraflor said that provincial officials also met with the administrators of the 3 private hospitals and one public hospital in the province on Thursday, March 12.
During the meeting, the hospitals committed to help the provincial government in case there will be a surge of patients, he said. The hospitals committed around 60 beds should there be additional cases, he added.
Hospital officials of Silliman University Medical Center and ACE Dumaguete Doctors Hospital have also talked regarding the alleged non-disclosure of the condition of the confirmed patient by the latter.
Miraflor said, “there was a shaking of hand after and they are all professionals.”
In a statement on Thursday, ACE Dumaguete Doctors said that on the dawn of March 10, the patient deteriorated and that his family insisted he be transferred to another healthcare institution.
The statement said they communicated with various medical personnel of the other healthcare institution to facilitate the transfer, adding that ACE Dumaguete Doctors did not hide anything when the patient was transferred.
It added that before the result of the throat swab was released, the hospital has already taken all measures and followed the Department of Health guidelines and protocol to isolate, contain the spread, and limit exposure to its health workers.
“It is understandable that this incident has created fear and anxiety among Dumagueteneous and Negrenses. Moving forward, ACE Dumaguete Doctors would like to assure the public that we will continue to strictly adhere with DOH guidelines and protocol regarding patient care,” the statement said. – Rappler.com "

Gaya ng ating panata, patuloy ang pagdaloy ng makabuluhang impormasyon mula sa Tanggapan ng Pangalawang Pangulo. Patuloy ang pagkonsulta natin sa mga eksperto. Patuloy ang ating pagsubaybay sa nagbabagong situwasyon ukol sa COVID-19, at patuloy ang ating mga rekomendasyon at panawagan.
Sinabi na ng World Health Organization: May mga katangian ng isang pandemic ang pandaigdigang situwasyon. Ibig sabihin, kumalat na ang virus sa iba’t ibang bansa. Sa pagkakataong ito, kailangan kong idiin: Panahon nang ipatupad ang areglong work-from-home. Huwag na nating ipilit pumasok pa sa opisina ang ating mga empleyado, maliban na lang ang mga nakatutok sa pagpapaabot ng kaukulang serbisyo na maaaring umampat sa pagkalat ng virus. Hindi sapat ang four-day workweek lang; hanapin natin ang mga alternatibong paraan para ipagpatuloy ang inyong operasyon. Kung talagang kailangan, magpatupad na lamang tayo ng skeletal staffing sa ating mga tanggapan. Walang dahilan na maibilad pa sa peligro ang sino man, lalo pa’t may dalang dagdag na panganib para sa lahat ang bawat bagong makakasagap ng sakit na ito. (READ: WHO labels coronavirus a 'pandemic' as Europe scrambles to contain it)
Malinaw ang posisyon ng mga eksperto: Social distancing ang isa sa mga pinakamabisang paraan para maampat ang pagkalat ng virus. Paraan din ito para hindi ma-overload ang ating mga sistemang pangkalusugan. Bawat sandaling mapabagal ang pagkalat ng virus ay sandaling naibibigay natin sa mga eksperto upang makahanap ng bakuna at lunas sa sakit na ito. Kaya nga kailangan nating idiin at ulit-ulitin ang panawagan para sa work-from-home arrangement. (READ: LIST: Philippine government officials under quarantine for coronavirus risks)
Ukol naman sa mga testing kits: Madaliin na natin ang pag-aambagan upang makapag-produce at maprocure na ang mga ito sa lalong madaling panahon. Tukuyin na agad ang kinakailangang pondo, ang pagkukunan nito, at ang pinakamabilis na paraan para ma-source ang mga kits. Ilabas na ang mga karampatang atas. Hindi ngayon ang panahon para magpahadlang sa mga alitan at burukrasya.
Nasa disaster mindset dapat tayo ngayon. Nananawagan tayo sa mga ahensya ng gobyerno, partikular ang mga frontliners: Pandayin, linawin, isiwalat, at ipatupad na ang mga karampatang protocols para sa mga apektado. Maging ispesipiko rin sa mga hakbang nilang gagawin sakaling kumalat ang sakit sa mga high-density areas, lalo na sa mga lugar na maraming maralita. Marami sa ating kababayan ang nakaasa sa pagpasok araw-araw para may maihain sa kanilang hapag. Ipaabot natin sa kanila ang financial assistance at iba pang ayuda, lalo na para sa mga mapipilitang lumiban sa trabaho at mawawalan ng kita dahil sa suliraning ito.
Isadiwa natin ang layuning “protect the vulnerable.” Gaya ng lagi, ang mga mahihirap ang pinakaapektado sa mga ganitong pagkakataon. Siguruhin natin na angkop ang pansin at pagpapahalagang maipapaabot sa kanila.
Alam po natin: Marami sa ating mga kababayan ang walang sapat na salapi para magpatingin sa mga pribadong ospital. Sa harap nito, dapat na ring tukuyin, italaga, at ipaalam sa publiko ang mga pampublikong ospital na kakayaning tumanggap ng mga may malalang sintomas. Ayon sa mga konsultasyon sa DOH, hindi pa aabot sa 400 ang pinagsamang mga isolation rooms at negative pressure facilities sa mga pampublikong ospital. Maganda na rin po sigurong kumilos ang pambansang pamahaalan para makapagset-up ng mga temporary isolation facilities. Bukod sa mga aparato at kagamitan para sa treatment, siguruhin din nating sapat ang protective equipment ng ating mga frontliner sa public health sector.
Dadami pa po ang bilang ng mga maysakit. Hindi ito haka-haka; nakabase ito sa mga pag-aaral at karanasan ng ibang bansa. Kailangang maging agaran ang pagkilos upang masigurong sapat ang mga kagamitan, sapat ang mga healthcare workers, at sapat ang mga tanggapan para matugunan ang posibilidad ng pagdami ng mga mahahawa.
Alam din nating pinag-aaralan na ng mga awtoridad ang posibilidad ng isang lock-down sa National Capital Region. Naniniwala tayo: Magiging mabisa lamang ang anumang lockdown kung mayroong sapat na probisyon sa mga komunidad, lalo na para sa mga mahihirap.
Tiyakin din sana ng gobyerno na sapat ang mga pangunahing pangangailangan, tulad ng pagkain sa food banks at mga gamit para sa sanitasyon. Ngayon pa lang, dapat nang mag-imbak ang mga komunidad, ayon sa isang pambansang direksyon, ng mga basic needs. Isa itong paraan para hindi na dumagdag ang pangamba ng ating mga kababayan: Kung alam nating magiging sapat ang supplies sa ating mga komunidad, papanatag ang ating loob, at hindi na natin kakailanganing lumabas pa.
Iisang komunidad tayo; walang paraang malagpasan ito kundi ang isaisip ang kapakanan ng lahat. Huwag makipag-unahan sa mga ospital at testing center; kung may sintomas tulad ng lagnat at ubo, mag-self-quarantine at obserbahan ang sarili ng dalawang araw bago sumugod sa ospital. Hindi rin po nakakatulong ang panic buying at hoarding. Ang bawat bote ng alkohol na iniimbak natin at di nagagamit ay isang boteng ipinagkakait natin sa ating mga kapitbahay. Sa huli, kung magkasakit sila, lahat tayo madadamay, gaano man karami ang maiimbak nating mga gamit o pagkain. (READ: Hoarding, overpricing would lead to criminal charges, warns DTI)
Mulat tayo na kakailanganin ng sakripisyo upang matugunan ang anumang suliranin. Pero ito ang paraan para masiguro ang kaligtasan ng mas nakararami. Nais kong ipaalala sa lahat: Narito pa rin ang pambansang pamunuan, sa kabila ng mga self-quarantine measures na isinasagawa ng ilan sa amin. Makinig at magkaisa tayo; sumubaybay sa mga pahayag at bulletin tulad nito, at sundin ang payo ng mga eksperto. Patuloy nating bigyang-pugay ang mga frontliners; suportahan natin sila, at tiyaking sapat ang kanilang kagamitan. Personal ko silang pinapasalamatan sa pahayag na ito. Huwag po sana kayong panghinaan ng loob. Sa bawat araw na lumilipas, lumalalim ang pag-unawa ng mga siyentista sa sakit na ito, at lumalapit ang pandaigdigang komunidad sa isang solusyon.
Inuulit ko po: Maiiwasan ang pagkakasakit. Maaampat ang pagkalat ng virus. Kaya nating pangasiwaan ang situwasyon. Maging malinaw lamang tayo sa pag-iisip, kalmado sa pagkilos, at may paninindigan sa pambansang direksyon.
Pilipino tayo; sanay tayo sa sakuna.
Palagi, sa harap ng ganitong uring krisis din natin naipapakita ang pagbabayanihang diwa ng ating pagka-Pilipino. Hindi tayo napapaluhod ng bagyo; nakakabangon tayo mula sa mga lindol. Mas malakas pa rin ang Pilipino sa COVID-19; kayang daigin ng ating pagkakaisa ang suliraning ito. Pilipino tayo, at sama-sama nating malalagpasan ito. – Rappler.com "

MANAGING THE OUTBREAK. Vice President Leni Robredo addresses the public through her Facebook account on March 12, 2020. Screenshot from Robredo's Facebook account 
MANILA, Philippines – In a Facebook video at past 6 pm on Thursday, March 12, Vice President Leni Robredo urged companies to begin implementing a work-from-home scheme for its employees now that the novel coronavirus outbreak has turned into a pandemic. 
She also asked the Duterte administration to prioritize protecting the country's most vulnerable sectors.
“Sinabi na ng World Health Organization: May mga katangian ng isang pandemic ang pandaigdigang situwasyon. Ibig sabihin, kumalat na ang virus sa iba’t ibang bansa. Sa pagkakataong ito, kailangan kong idiin: Panahon nang ipatupad ang areglong work-from-home,” Robredo said in a public address ahead of President Rodrigo Duterte's scheduled coronavirus-related announcement also on Thursday.
(This is what the World Health Organization said: The circumstance of the global situation point to a pandemic. That means the virus already spread to different countries. I want to emphasize now: It’s time we implement a work-from-home scheme.)
The Vice President said companies could instead have a skeletal workforce to keep vital operations ongoing. Otherwise, there’s no reason to put their employees’ lives at risk. 
“Walang dahilan na maibilad pa sa peligro ang sino man, lalo pa’t may dalang dagdag na panganib para sa lahat ang bawat bagong makakasagap ng sakit na ito,” Robredo said. (There is no reason to risk the lives of anyone, especially now that there is an added risk because of this new disease.)
The Vice President released the video to help allay the public’s fear over the growing number of 2019-nCoV cases in the Philippines. She addressed the public ahead of President Rodrigo Duterte’s scheduled announcement on the COVID-19 situation on Thursday evening.
So far, a total of 52 patients tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by 2019-nCoV. Two cases already died.  
‘Protect the vulnerable' 
Robredo called on the Duterte government to follow a “protect the vulnerable” mindset during the health crisis.
She said the administration should ensure that poor Filipinos will have easy access to government hospitals should they begin to show symptoms of COVID-19. If the government decides to impose any lockdown, then there must be enough supplies available for the poor as well.
“Isadiwa natin ang layuning ‘protect the vulnerable.’ Gaya ng lagi, ang mga mahihirap ang pinakaapektado sa mga ganitong pagkakataon. Siguruhin natin na angkop ang pansin at pagpapahalagang maipapaabot sa kanila,” Robredo said.  
(May we follow a policy of ‘protect the vulnerable.’ As always, the poor will be the most affected in times like this. Let us make sure we give them the response due to them.) 
The Vice President advised the public to stop panic-buying and refrain from trooping to hospitals if they are not exhibiting severe symptoms of the disease.  
“Iisang komunidad tayo. Walang paraang malagpasan ito kundi ang isaisip ang kapakanan ng lahat (We are one community. There is no other way to get through but to think about everyone’s welfare),” said the Vice Preident. 
Robredo previously called on the Duterte administration to be “very transparent” in its response to the COVID-19 outbreak, as doing so would help dispel speculations of alleged “underreporting"" of positive cases.
Health Secretary Francisco Duque III admitted that “problems” in their reporting system led to the delayed disclosure of 2019-nCoV patients’ details. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – The Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) warned that criminal charges would be filed against those suspected of overpricing and hoarding medical devices and products like alcohol, medicines, and face masks.
Trade Secretary Ramon Lopez said on Thursday, March 12, that he recommended to President Rodrigo Duterte the issuance of an executive order, arming the DTI, along with the Philippine National Police and the National Bureau of Investigation, with ""visitorial powers"" to quickly address profiteering.

Under the Consumer Act or Republic Act (RA) No. 7394, overpricing may be considered as an unfair and unconscionable sales act or practice since it involves taking advantage of consumers in this time of need. The Price Act or RA No. 7581 also considers this as an act of profiteering.
""Both of these laws provide criminal and administrative penalties and sanctions. Under the Consumer Act, if found to have committed an unfair and unconscionable sales act or practice, an administrative sanction of up to P300,000 may be imposed and/or imprisonment of up to one year,"" the DTI said.

MANILA, Philippines – President Rodrigo Duterte’s foreign trips will be suspended amid fears over the continued increase of novel coronavirus cases worldwide, the Presidential Security Group (PSG) announced on Thursday, March 12. 
The PSG said the measure was based on the recommendation of the Department of Health and would apply ""especially to countries where there are confirmed cases of COVID-19,"" the disease caused by the coronavirus. 
Duterte was tested for the coronavirus on Thursday afternoon, after several of his Cabinet members, including officials in his inner circle, announced they would isolate themselves following contact with a confirmed COVID-19 patient.
Presidential Spokesperson Salvador Panelo said Duterte’s testing was only a “precautionary measure” and the President was not showing symptoms as of posting. 
Duterte’s former aide-turned-Senator Bong Go, who got tested with Duterte, said results will be available in 48 hours or on Saturday, March 14. 
Experts have warned adults 60 years old and above to take extra precaution against the disease as they were more vulnerable to it.

CAGAYAN DE ORO CITY, Philippines – The first COVID-19 patient of Mindanao has been confined at the Northern Mindanao Medical Center (NMMC) here since March 3  but was just confirmed as positive of the disease by the Department of Health (DOH) on Wednesday, March 11.
COVID-19 is the illness caused by the novel coronavirus.
DoH Northern Mindanao (Region 10) Director Adriano Suba-an said that the patient was a 54-year-old male who was a resident of Pasig City since 2017 and went back here to return to his home in Lanao del Sur.
Suba-an said that the patient decided to come home to seek treatment here which resulted in his confinement in a hospital in Iligan City.
""His symptoms started last February 24, 2020 and was admitted at a hospital in lligan City last March 3, 2020 for pneumonia. He was subsequently referred to Northern Mindanao Medical Center (NMMC) on March 8, 2020. Specimens were taken and sent to the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM). On March 11, 2020, the result was confirmed to be positive for SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of Coronavirus Disease - 2019 (COVID-19),"" Suba-an said.
Suba-an said that the patient was being monitored by infectious diseases specialists according to the latest WHO Guidelines.
""The DOH is conducting contact tracing and heightened disease surveillance through the Barangay Health Emergency Response Team (BHERT) in the community and through Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI) surveillance in the hospital,"" Suba-an said.
Dr. Jose Chan, NMMC Chief of Hospital said: ""This is a viral infection so the usual protocol for treating viral infection are observed, for now it is about supportive (medicine).""
Chan said that the patient is being supported by ventilator since he was complaining of shortness of breath.
Local transmission
Chan said that the patient may have contracted the virus in Pasig City where he lived since 2017.
Suba-an said, the patient ""has no history of travel abroad, maybe transmitted locally in the National Capital Region where he works before,"" Suba-an said.
""When he came home, he was immediately brought to the hospital and isolated accordingly and referred also to NMMC to be properly managed as well,"" Suba-an added.
Suba-an added that the country cannot afford to have a 2nd generation of local transmission.
 
 
""We are preparing other areas in Region 10 as well for what could possibly happen,"" Suba-an said.
""What we are avoiding is people to start overcrowding hospital because they want medical consultation or laboratory test. Let's simplify, if you have symptoms like fever, cough, or diarrhea, but you have no exposure or travel to places with the virus, do not go to NMMC, seek consultation to your regular physician,"" Suba-an said.
""Now if you have no symptoms but you have travel history to those with confirmed case, now do not go to the ER of NMMC, do self quarantine,"" Suba-an added.
""Now if you started feeling something and you have exposure, then that's the time you really have to go to the ER to seek consultation and laboratory testing, so we can prioritize and triage who are our priority,"" Suba-an said.
Suba-an said reminded the public that virus is transmitted through droplets and not airborne. ""We enjoin the public to continue practicing handwashing regularly, avoid crowds and wild animals, never cough without a handkerchief or tissue,  wear a mask if you are sick or in healthcare settings, seek early consultation. – Rappler.com "

St Agnes Academy (SAA), Albay’s oldest Catholic school, also suspended classes from grade school to high school on Friday, March 13, until March 25, as a precautionary measure.
“We have decided to quarantine the grades 11 to 12 HUMMS (Humanities and Social Sciences Strand) and teacher-chaperones who went to Manila and visited the Senate.

MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – Investors clearly wanted out as the Philippine Stock Exchange index (PSEi) fell over 10% on Thursday, March 12, amid fears of the novel coronavirus' economic impact.
This triggered the circuit breaker or the 15-minute trading halt for investors to compose themselves.
This is the second time that the circuit breaker was implemented. The first instance was on October 27, 2008, during the global financial crisis.
The PSEi eventually closed at 5,736 on Thursday, down by 9.7%. This is the lowest percentage drop since October 27, 2008, when the index fell by 12.3%.
Thursday's close was also the lowest since December 2012, when it fell to 5,636.
The most actively traded stocks were SM Prime (down 11.2%), Ayala Land (down 11.3%), SM Investments (down 12.2%), BDO (down 11.8%), and Ayala Corporation (down 6.3%).
If you invested in the PSEi on the first trading day of the year, you have lost over P2,000 per share you bought.
The broader all shares fell by 8.3% to 3,492.
All other subindices were also in the red, with mining and oil suffering the steepest decline at 12.8%. Property, holding firms, and financials slipped by over 10%.
Luis Limlingan of Regina Capital said the next support level may be at 5,300. A support is a price level where the decline in stock prices is expected to pause as investors start buying the losing shares.
After the local bourse closed, the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the Philippines rose further from 49 to 52.
Japhet Tantiangco of Philstocks said the rising number of confirmed cases weighed down on the market.
""We're already seeing the initial effects in the form of weakening tourism, job losses, and office shutdowns. And things could get worse since the disease has no cure yet and is not contained,"" Tantiangco said.

MANILA, Philippines – The Philippine Sports Commission (PSC) ordered the evacuation of national athletes in its facilities as the coronavirus was declared a pandemic on Thursday, March 12.
Except for the athletes still preparing for qualifying tournaments for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, all national team members in senior and junior levels have been ordered to go home as all dormitories need to be vacated as part of the PSC's prevention plan.
PSC declared its two majors faciilites – Rizal Memorial Sports Complex (RMSC) in Manila and the Philsports Complex in Pasig – under restricted access. 
""We have to be pro-active in this situation and take these hard decisions for the safety of our athletes and employees,"" said PSC chairman William ""Butch"" Ramirez during the management committee meeting on Thursday, March 12.
Some of the national team members billeted in the dormitories are from boxing, weightlifting, muay, athletics, fencing, and Paralympic sports. 
Ramirez also instructed national sports associations to assess and give advice how to proceed with the athletes' training and cope with the spiking confirmed coronavirus cases in the Philippines. 
As for airport arrivals, athletes coming back to the country from competitions will be received at the airport by PSC personnel to assist them back to their respective residences.
They will be allowed to do preventive rest and monitoring for 14 days at the RMSC North Tower under the supervision of the medical team of the agency.
Foreign travel, though, will be suspended for all athletes, coaches, officials and employees from March 14 to April 14  to lower the risk of contracting the illness or spreading it locally as announced in an advisory from PSC commissioner officer-in-charge Celia Kiram.  
""Only those who get an endorsement to proceed from Olympics chef de mission Nonong Araneta will be allowed to travel overseas,"" said Ramirez. (READ: PH travel ban due to virus 'top concern' in Tokyo 2020 Olympics preparation)
The same advisory also informed that all bookings and reservations for the use of its facilities are revoked or canceled. 
It also reiterated a previous announcement that PSC projects, programs, and events including those sponsored and organized in cooperation with NSAs or LGUs are postponed indefinitely.
The agency has also advised the public that work is suspended on Friday, March 13, to give way to sanitation efforts to be undertaken by its Operations Department.
PSC chief of staff Marc Edward Velasco disclosed that the agency’s medical and scientific athletes services will issue self-quarantine guidelines for athletes and employees.
As of Wednesday, March 11, the Philippines has recorded a total of 49 confirmed cases of COVID-19.
The novel coronavirus has infected more than 118,000 people and killed over 4,200 across 110 countries. Still, more than 61,000 people have recovered from the virus. – Rappler.com

MANILA, Philippines – The Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) on Thursday, March 12, imposed a nationwide price freeze on basic necessities amid the spread of the novel coronavirus.
""The DTI is closely coordinating with other government agencies, manufacturers, and retailers of basic goods to ensure availability and continuous supply in the market,"" said Trade Secretary Ramon Lopez.
""Retailers are reminded that there should be no price movement on these goods while the price freeze is in effect."" (READ: Novel coronavirus: What makes an outbreak a pandemic?)
Basic goods that are under the jurisdiction of the DTI include canned fish and other marine products, locally manufactured instant noodles, bottled water, bread, processed milk, coffee, candles, laundry soap and detergent, and salt.
The Department of Agriculture will monitor prices of basic agricultural goods such as rice, corn, cooking oil, marine products, fresh eggs, fresh meat (pork, beef, and poultry), fresh milk, fresh vegetables, root crops, sugar, and fresh fruits.
Essential drugs are under the Department of Health, while firewood and charcoal are monitored by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources. Household liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and kerosene are under the Department of Energy.
""All these basic goods are placed under price freeze for 60 days with the exception of household LPG and kerosene whose prices shall be frozen for 15 days only as provided in the Amended Price Act or [Republic Act No.] 10623,"" the DTI said.
Trade Undersecretary Ruth Castelo also assured the public that they continue to intensify monitoring of the prices of basic goods in the market, including face masks.

Business establishments found to have violated the price freeze would face a fine ranging from P5,000 to P1 million, and imprisonment up to 10 years. – Rappler.com "

It is now accurate to say that the country is facing a crisis amid the COVID-19 outbreak. From having only 3 cases last week, it has now jumped to 33 – and counting. From the claim made by the health secretary himself that the Philippines was a model country for COVID-19 response, it is now a country that has just declared a state of public health emergency. 
As it seems, the Philippine health sector is ill-prepared for the COVID-19 outbreak. This is not surprising after budget cuts, corruption allegations, politicization of health governance, and the political leadership’s focus on security – going after opposition politicians, activists, and poor drug offenders. 
Health services deteriorating even before COVID-19
Late last year, it was reported that the health budget was cut by 10 billion in the 2020 general appropriations. This is despite emerging threats of measles, polio, and dengue outbreaks, which could be serious health emergencies. Last year too, there have been reports that health services in the Philippines have become more unaffordable and inaccessible to citizens. 
It is therefore not a surprise that the first Global Health Security Index showed that the Philippines scored zero in a total of 5 health security indicators, namely: (1) linking public health and security authorities, (2) communication with healthcare workers during public health emergencies, (3) dual-use research and culture of responsible science, (4) biosafety, and (5) joint external evaluations and performance of veterinary services.  
Yesterday, Duque admitted that the inadequacy of supplies and test kits negatively affects the country’s ability to effectively respond to COVID-19. Lack of proper and up-to-date health facilities and equipment, as well as serious understaffing, are putting a strain on the health care system. 
The estimated ratio of health care workers in the Philippines is 1 doctor per 33,000 patients and 1 hospital bed for every 1,121 patients. This is way lower than the recommended 1 doctor per 1,000 people and 5 beds per 1,000 people ratio by the World Health Organization. (READ: Philippines to borrow more than planned to combat coronavirus impact)
An Al Jazeera report summarized it well: “The already low health budget was further cut resulting in less (sic) medical supplies, poorly maintained medical equipment, and understaffing. Even before COVID-19, the public health systems was (sic) already deteriorating."" As it seems so far, how the government has responded to the COVID-19 outbreak is real-time evidence of why the Philippines scored 0 in the said Global Security Index. 
While we are not surprised by the news about the deteriorating quality of health services in the country, we are nonetheless puzzled. This is because the health budget was supposedly benefiting immensely from a so-claimed successful fiscal reform called the Sin Tax Law that has added a whopping P348.2 billion to the health budget since 2014.  
Sin tax’s significant addition to the health budget 
In 2012, the Sin Tax Law (or RA 10351) was enacted (1) to generate additional revenue for health and (2) curb smoking and alcohol consumption by simplifying and increasing the excise tax system on tobacco and alcohol. (READ: Duterte signs new taxes on alcohol, e-cigarettes into law)
Generally, all assessments show that the law has achieved its intended objectives. Positive gains have been reported by government and civil society so far on the impact of the sin tax. There has been an increase in the health budget due to sin tax. The DOH reports that 43% of its budget in 2018 was contributed by the sin tax. 
Increased revenues from the Sin Tax Law in 2013 have facilitated an unprecedented 57.3% increase in the 2014 national health budget, from P53.23 billion in 2013 to P83.72 billion in 2014. The bulk of the additional budget (P22.7 billion) was allocated for PhilHealth insurance coverage of the poorest families, benefitting around 24 million Filipinos. As a result, according to reports, there are more Filipinos, especially indigents, covered by PhilHealth.
The sin tax has been hailed as an effective tool to support health or a successful fiscal policy to achieve improved health outcomes. The Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids (CFTK) concludes in its 2017 study that, “The Sin Tax Law has successfully reached its purpose of significantly simplifying the tax system, quickly reducing tobacco use, and raising high incremental revenue needed to fund universal health coverage – especially among the poor – as well as additional revenue for health and economic development programs.” 
Data from the 2019 Sin Tax Law Annual Report shows that 55% of the DOH budget comes from sin tax revenues alone. This seems to mean that the decline in the health budget from the national government (on top of sin tax) has been dramatically decreasing, kept afloat only by funds from sin tax.
Funds from sin tax should have helped Philippines prepare for COVID-19
Revenues from sin tax are earmarked for specific programs: 15% to LGUs, 85% to DOH and PhilHealth. From that 85%, 80% goes to universal health care (UHC) expenditures (i.e. PhilHealth coverage; strengthening of preventive health programs towards attainment of MDGs/SDGs; health awareness programs; and implementation research to support UHC). On the other hand, 20% is meant for medical assistance; health facilities enhancement program (HFEP); and service delivery networks. 
Some of the programs where sin tax revenues are supposed to go to are (1) health emergency preparedness and response, (2) epidemiology and surveillance (3) prevention and control of other infectious disease, and (4) health facilities enhancement program (HFEP) that primarily aims to upgrade health facilities and equipment. These are the very programs needed by the Philippine health sector in preparing well for health emergencies like COVID-19.  
Source: Department of Health. (2019) Sin Tax Law Incremental Revenue for Health Annual Report 2019.
The deteriorating state of the public health sector, despite increases in its budget from a fiscal reform measure (such as sin tax), invites important empirical questions: What happened to the health sector? Where did the health budget from sin tax go? 
An emerging lesson is that the success of fiscal reform measures (such as sin tax) are only certain to be true once tested. Its development impact must be seen and proven at the service delivery or citizen-beneficiary level. Fiscal reform outcomes can only come into fruition, such as the impact of sin tax on health services, if budget increases are ensured to have resulted in better quality received by citizens. This needs a monitoring and assessment system from the national level (budget allocation) down to the beneficiary level. 
Without a working multi-level accountability system on public health service delivery, any additional budget (note: DOH/DOF is asking for loans to effectively respond to COVID-19) could just go down the drain without making lives better for Filipinos. Worse is if the success claims will catch us off-guard. 
In the case of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak, one indicative evidence of the success of the Sin Tax Law should have been a health system responding well to the COVID-19 emergency, providing quality health services and protection for Filipinos now that they need it most. Unfortunately, COVID-19 has unnecessarily caught us off-guard. – Rappler.com

MANILA, Philippines – The Commission on Higher Education (CHED) called on state universities and colleges to prepare for possible community-level transmission of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. 
In a memorandum order released on Wednesday, March 10, CHED chairman Prospero de Vera III reiterated that schools should have protocols in place to stop the spread of the novel coronavirus within the campus in coordination with the Department of Health. 
These include creating screening procedures for symptomatic students, faculty, staff and administrators; preparing health clinics to accommodate and isolate patients potentially infected with the novel coronavirus; and performing decontamination and disinfection of buildings in schools. (READ :DepEd says proceeding with graduation ceremony 'up to school's discretion')
President Rodrigo Duterte suspended classes in all levels in Metro Manila from March 10 to 14 following the spike of confirmed cases in the Philppines. 
Schools are advised to coordinate with their affiliated training establishments for any adjustment on training hours; and consider alternative modes for on-the-job training, practicum and internships. (READ: How Metro schools continue lessons amid coronavirus threat)
But based on the assessment in their areas, all schools should be flexible in adjusting the academic calendar, foregoing other curricular activities for the semester and exercising discretion to possibly postpone graduation ceremonies.
CHED also advised schools to report the status of their students, faculty and staff. These include those who are now abroad, specially in areas affected by the virus.
Identified cases of COVID-19 within the campus should immediately be coordinated with DOH regional office or local government offices. 
“All plans and decisions by the Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) should be focused on ensuring the safety of all students, faculty, staff and administrators,” CHED added in its memorandum. – Rappler.com  "

MANILA, Philippines – Several Cabinet members of the Duterte government are placing themselves under quarantine in an effort to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus, while serving as the country’s top officials closest to President Rodrigo Duterte. 
On Wednesday night, March 11, Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III was the first Cabinet official to announce he would undergo self-quarantine after he shook the hand of a patient who tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.  
Transportation Secretary Arthur Tugade followed suit and announced he would also undergo self-quarantine after he was ""exposed"" to a patient confirmed to have the coronavirus last week. 
Department of Public Works and Highways Secretary Mark Villar also announced on Thursday, March 12, that he would be isolating himself, as he was with Dominguez and Tugade last week.  
All officials were at the North Luzon Expressway (NLEX) Harbor Link inspection ceremony last March 5. (READ: Coronavirus exposure prompts PH economic officials to self-quarantine)
Aside from this, Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea confirmed to Rappler he would also place himself under quarantine. He said he may have had ""possible exposure"" to a patient confirmed to have the coronavirus but that he had no symptoms as of posting. 
""I just want to be sure,"" he said.
Department of Education Secretary Leonor Briones likewise announced she would self-quarantine as an ""extra precautionary measure"" after some education officials were ""exposed"" to a confirmed COVID-19 patient last February 28 and March 5. 
All officials were showing no symptoms of the illness as of posting. Medialdea gave assurances they would continue to work and that the Palace was exploring telecommuting options.  
Efforts of Cabinet members to isolate themselves come as Duterte is scheduled to be tested for COVID-19 on Thursday. 
Presidential Spokesperson Salvador Panelo gave assurances the President was not showing symptoms of the disease and was only getting tested as a precautionary measure to ensure he was ""fit and healthy to perform"" his duties. 
Experts earlier said that older adults with preexisting health conditions were more vulnerable to the coronavirus, particularly those aged over 60-years-old. Duterte, 74, earlier claimed he suffered from a slew of medical conditions that include myasthenia gravis, Buerger's disease, Barrett's esophagus, and ""spinal issues,"" among others.
As of Thursday, the Philippines has so far recorded 49 confirmed coronavirus cases, two of whom have died. – Rappler.com "

With the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the Philippines rising nearly tenfold (5 to 49) in just 6 days, it’s clear the disease won’t go away any time soon.
Data suggest there should be a lot more cases by now. When there were only 3 confirmed cases in the Philippines, a statistical model developed by The Economist predicted there should’ve been about 200 already.
The Department of Health (DOH) admitted to “unintentional” underreporting of cases due to the inadequacy of testing kits.
On March 7, President Rodrigo Duterte reportedly agreed to declare a public health emergency, but he formally announced it two days later. On March 11, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III admitted he himself should’ve declared a public health emergency sooner.
COVID-19 is sickening not just Filipinos but huge swaths of the Philippine economy as well. What can the Duterte government do to ward off an impending economic slump?
Slump
The National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) foresees that our nation’s income, as measured by gross domestic product (GDP) will grow slower this year.
Growth might even fall to as low as 5.5%, well below the 6.5% target.
Tourism will take a big hit: lost revenues there could be as large as P93-187 billion. If the outbreak lasts till June, as many as 1.42 million passengers will not arrive and some 30,000-60,000 jobs will likely be destroyed.
But other sectors will fall sick as well.
A new study by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) shows the Philippine economy may lose somewhere between P34 billion and P99 billion, not just on account of weaker tourism but also weaker trade, business services, manufacturing, transportation, and even agriculture (see Figure 1 for a breakdown).
In the event of a “significant outbreak,” ADB thinks our economic losses may even balloon to a whopping P280 billion. This will hack away a full 1.67 percentage points off GDP growth – more than a quarter of our growth in 2018.

Figure 1.
 
All in all, NEDA and ADB's numbers both suggest growth this year is set to reach its lowest level since 2011.
Even before this, growth has already been declining steadily since 2016. (READ: Why did Philippine growth drop to an 8-year low?)
Demand and supply
Duterte’s economic team is not helpless. But they will have to go beyond textbook remedies because COVID-19 is not your run-off-the-mill economic shock.
First, the downturn is obviously induced by a widespread drop in people’s demand for goods and services throughout the economy (also called an “aggregate demand shock”).
Tourists are canceling their flights and hotel bookings. Mallgoers are shunning malls. Students have stayed at home following a weeklong cancellation of classes.
On the other hand, this downturn is caused, too, by a widespread reduction in the economy’s production and, hence, supply of goods and services (also called an “aggregate supply shock”).
Factories and firms around the world, especially in China, are shutting down. Global supply chains are breaking up left and right, impeding our ability to import and export. More and more workers are being told to work at home or, worse, being laid off.
One assistant secretary of the Department of Labor and Employment reported that since February some 66 firms in tourism have already closed down due to reduced tourist arrivals.
Hence, COVID-19 is likely causing a decline in both aggregate demand and aggregate supply. The government must address both with a comprehensive stimulus package.
Stimulus
As for aggregate supply, there’s little Duterte can do to revitalize damaged global supply chains.
But some form of temporary tax relief for cash-strapped businesses, as well as paid sick leaves, wage subsidies, or cash transfers for workers, might work to tide them over – at least until the global economy finds its footing again.
As for aggregate demand, the government can prop it up with a mix of monetary and fiscal policies.
For its part, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) can lower its key policy rate. In doing so, interest rates throughout the economy will also drop, making it more attractive for consumers to take out housing or car loans, and for entrepreneurs to take out business loans.
BSP Governor Benjamin Diokno hinted they’re open to cutting its key policy rate if “things deteriorate.”
By itself, however, monetary policy will not induce people to go out and do business as usual. Hence, it will have to be paired with fiscal policies such as tax cuts or aggressive spending.
Incidentally, the Duterte government is moving to lower corporate income tax rates with the Citira bill, recently certified as urgent by Duterte. But such tax cuts will be implemented over a period of 10 years, and what we need right now is a more immediate stimulus.
Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III said they’ll continue rolling out Build, Build, Build as a way to pump prime the economy. But infrastructure projects also take a while to complete, and until long-standing bottlenecks are ironed out it will not boost demand in the short run.
There is, however, one sector where aggressive spending might help tremendously: our public health system.
Aside from pouring money on much-needed COVID-19 testing kits, government could also employ more frontline hospital workers (doctors, nurses, etc.) and provide for their masks, gloves, overall gowns, and other protective gear. Government might also build more quarantine facilities.
This policy hits two birds with a stone: the health of our people and the economy.
To effectively respond to COVID-19, the DOH said they will need an additional P3.1 billion. But the Treasury said only P1.65 billion was on hand.
I wrote last week that the Duterte administration imprudently allowed their budget deficit (or revenue shortfall) to skyrocket to 6.8% (see Figure 2). That’s the highest deficit since 1998 and way above target. (READ: How the budget deficit exploded under Duterte’s watch)
Secretary Dominguez admitted they expect government revenues to drop this year by as much as P91 billion. This will inevitably raise the deficit further and force us to borrow more.
If only the Duterte government didn’t act squander last year its “fiscal space,” they could have more leg room this year for a COVID-19 stimulus.

Figure 2.
 
Health before wealth
Some experts think an economic stimulus might work best once the epidemic eases.
Therefore, even before the economic managers rummage through their policy toolkit, the first order of business is for them to support efforts of our health agencies to contain COVID-19 and mitigate its impact.
The longer it takes for government to identify cases and implement measures such as quarantines, contact tracing, and social distancing, the higher the risk our hospitals will be overwhelmed and run to the ground.
But we should ask: Is the Duterte government doing enough to contain COVID-19? Do we trust they’ll be able to do it? Are they treating this pandemic seriously?
If you just listen to Duterte’s incoherent and dismissive public statements, you might say no to all of these. Beyond a fiscal deficit, we should address as well a gaping and growing trust deficit. – Rappler.com

MANILA, Philippines – Saudi Arabia on Thursday, March 12, announced it was temporarily suspending flights to and from the Philippines and 38 other countries amid growing fears over the continued increase in coronavirus cases. 
In a statement, the Saudi Ministry of Interior said the measure would cover the Philippines, European Union countries, Switzerland, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Ethiopia, South Sudan, Eritrea, Kenya, Djibouti, and Somalia. 
The Saudi government will suspend the entry of travelers coming directly from these countries or had a history of travel to these areas within the last 14 days. 
Exempted from the travel restrictions were health workers from the Philippines and India, as well as those involved in evacuation, shipping, and trading trips though they would need to take “required precautions.” 
According to an Arab News report, the Saudi government said it was giving 72 hours to all its citizens and permanent residents to return to the Gulf state. Saudi citizens and residents were also banned from traveling to the 38 countries.  
Latest measures taken by the Saudi government widen the scope of earlier restrictions taken to ban tourists from countries, including the Philippines, judged to pose ""a particularly high risk"" of spreading the coronavirus. 
Saudi Arabia had earlier announced the unprecedented decision to ban ""umrah"" pilgrims from visiting Islam's holiest sites to try to contain the spread of the coronavirus. It had also suspended visas for tourists and “umrah” pilgrims visiting from countries where the new virus is a ""danger.""
As of Thursday, Saudi Arabia recorded 54 confirmed COVID-19 cases.

MANILA, Philippines – The Philippines' crucifixion reenactments will be canceled this year as coronavirus cases climb, said authorities in the city where the annual tourist spectacle is held.
About a dozen Catholics regularly have themselves nailed to wooden crosses on Good Friday as penance for their sins. The event attracts thousands of tourists.
This year's rituals were planned for farming villages around San Fernando city, north of the capital Manila on April 10, but local officials have stopped the event to prevent mass gatherings and a potential spread of the virus.
""We are not disrespecting religious beliefs and practices, but we actually are protecting them from the disease that may put them and their family at risk,"" San Fernando Mayor Edwin Santiago said in a statement.
Philippine health authorities said Wednesday, March 11, 49 people have tested positive for the virus in the country, up by 16 from a day earlier. A Chinese traveler, one of the country's earliest cases, later died.
""I'm disappointed,"" said resident Ruben Enaje, who was aiming to be crucified for the 34th straight year as part of a religious vow to atone for his sins, told AFP.
""I talked with the village chairman and he said we should postpone it because of the worries that many foreign tourists might come here and we might get infected if some of them have the virus,"" the 59-year-old added.
Enaje, a decorator, said he still plans to carry a cross across town to fulfil his religious vow.
The coronavirus outbreak has infected more than 118,000 globally with over 4,200 deaths, according to a tally compiled by AFP.

DAVAO CITY, Philippines – Davao City Mayor Sara Duterte has gone on self-quarantine as a precautionary measure against the spread of COVID-19 even if she had no symptoms,  her office said on Thursday, March 12.
The city government said in a statement that President Rodrigo Duterte's daughter signed up as a person under monitoring (PUM) with the Davao City Health Office after one of her staff at her house became unwell. The staff also got listed as a PUM.
Another reason for her decision was that she met Senator Sherwin Gatchalian over lunch in Manila on Wednesday. Sara was in the Senate for the confirmation hearing on her promotion as a reservist military colonel.
Gatchalian and Senator Nancy Binay placed themselves under self-quarantine beginning Wednesday, after they found out that one of the resource persons in a Senate hearing tested positive for COVID-19. The Senate was on lockdown starting Thursday, because of this.
""While Mayor Sara has not suffered from flu-like symptoms, she chose to undergo self-quarantine to protect others if she may be found to be sick in the next few days,"" it added,"" the city government said in a statement released by city information officer Jefry Tupas.

MANILA, Philippines (4th UPDATE) – Some members of President Rodrigo Duterte's economic team are undergoing self-quarantine, following exposure to a patient who tested positive for the novel coronavirus.
These officials include Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III, Budget Secretary Wendel Avisado, and Socioeconomic Planning Secretary Ernesto Pernia, as well as Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) Governor Benjamin Diokno.
Vince Dizon, presidential adviser for flagship programs and projects as well as president of the Bases Conversion and Development Authority, is under self-quarantine as well.
None of them have reported any symptoms, so far.
Dominguez earlier told reporters on Wednesday night, March 11, that he would be imposing self-quarantine, after shaking the hand of a COVID-19 patient last week.
""You may wish to follow suit,"" Dominguez advised beat reporters.
Avisado also placed himself under quarantine after he attended the government's economic cluster meeting last Tuesday, March 10.
""The protocol requires that I go on self-quarantine so I am doing it,"" Avisado told reporters on Thursday.
In a statement on Thursday afternoon, March 12, the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) said Pernia ""has gone on self-quarantine as a precautionary measure,"" even if ""he had no close contact"" with COVID-19 patients.
""The NEDA management is tracing officials and employees who were with the persons confirmed to have tested positive for COVID-19 during two separate meetings held last March 5 and 6, 2020,"" the agency said.
""All concerned NEDA officials and employees who came in close contact with (were within one meter from) the said virus-infected persons were also advised to go on self-quarantine.""
Work at the NEDA Central Office was suspended from Thursday to Friday, March 13, for disinfection and sanitation procedures.
Meanwhile, Diokno also announced on Thursday that he would be isolating himself, as he was with Dominguez and Transportation Secretary Arthur Tugade last week. Tugade is also under self-quarantine.
They were at the North Luzon Expressway (NLEX) Harbor Link inspection ceremony last March 5.
""I am glad to share that I am well and not manifesting any symptoms, although I also decided to go on self-quarantine as a precautionary measure,"" Diokno said in a statement on Thursday.
The BSP also suspended work at its head office and Security Plant Complex from Thursday to Friday for ""thorough preventive sanitation.""
""We have ensured, however, that vital BSP services needed by the financial system continue. Hence, open market operations, PhilPass settlement, as well as the servicing of bank withdrawals are being performed business as usual,"" Diokno added.
The Department of Public Works and Highways likewise said on Thursday that Secretary Mark Villar will go on self-quarantine.
Villar was at the same NLEX Harbor Link event. Duterte, Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea, and Senator Bong Go were also there.

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates – Visa runners in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) now have to spend a few hundred dirhams more to have their documents renewed or face possible deportation. This, following the temporary closure of the Oman border over new coronavirus concerns.
Consul General Marford Angeles of the Philippine Embassy in Abu Dhabi urged Filipinos staying in the country on expiring visit visas to follow the law.
He said the embassy and the consulate “are always ready to help those needing assistance.”
“We all have to follow the immigration regulations of the host country. That means one cannot overstay. Otherwise, there are fines and legal consequences,"" he explained.
“The embassy welcomes requests for assistance and we will do our best to provide help.... Our kababayans are advised to always be aware of ongoing developments.""
What is a visa run?
Visit visa holders need to exit the UAE to have their visas renewed or changed to employment status. The most convenient places for a visa run have been Sohar and Buraimi in neighboring Oman.
Land routes to these cities go through the border in Musandam, Oman, and Hatta in the UAE, which have been closed since last week until further notice due to the coronavirus outbreak. (READ: WHO labels coronavirus a 'pandemic' as Europe scrambles to contain it)
According to Malou Prado, CEO of MPQ Tourism, the remaining option is to go “airport-to-airport,” where the visa runner flies to Muscat, the capital of Oman, stays in the plane, and flies back to Dubai, where the new visa can be sent online via Whatsapp and shown to Immigration.
The industry rate for an airport-to-airport visa run costs approximately Dh1,450, whereas taking the land route costs Dh1,100.
Prado, who has been in the travel business for the past 10 years, said some 50 Filipino visa runners leave the UAE for Sohar or Buraimi every day.
She said they received a message on March 4 from their tour operator in Oman, who facilitates the issuance of Oman visas, saying the border-to-border (land route) visa change has been suspended.
“We regret to announce that the border-to-border visa change is temporarily closed. Kindly advise all passengers scheduled on this date that there is no trip and they can reschedule or transfer for airport-to-airport to avoid overstay.
“As of now, there is still no confirmation when this will resume, so please advise all passengers accordingly,” read the tour operator’s message, shared by Prado to Rappler.
Ordered back
Sid Rivera, marketing manager at Al Qadi Tourism, another travel agency, told Rappler that 5 of their visa runners were ordered to return to the UAE upon arrival at the Oman border post in Musandam.
He said the group was part of 13 busloads of visa runners.
“Pagdating nila sa border sa Musandam, may mga police sa Immigration post. Hindi na sila pinapasok ng Musandam at sinabihan na bumalik na lang,” Rivera said.
(When they got to the border at Musandam, there were police at the Immigration post. They weren't allowed to ender Musandam and were told to just head back.)
Rivera said travel agencies are also offering a “no exit” visa change, which is more pricey, and urges visa runners to act fast as the situation is very fluid.
“Hindi natin masabi kasi baka pati flights ma-apektuhan (We can't be sure, since even flights may get affected),” he said. – Rappler.com "

Belmonte said the patient was initially diagnosed as having dengue, and was only confirmed to be a COVID-19 case on Thursday.
She said the patient went to two private hospitals. The second private hospital confirmed that he was carrying the virus, but reportedly told him to go home because they could not accommodate him.
“Nagpunta po siya sa dalawang private hospitals na po. At sa second private hospital lang po siya nasabihan na ito po ay nCoV or COVID-19, tapos wala na pong lugar kaya pinauwi pa. Medyo nakakatakot din kasi alam na pala pero pinauwi pa. Tapos kanina sinundo ng DOH,"" she said.

The DOH already transported the patient to a hospital as of Thursday morning, said Belmonte. She did not disclose the hospital where the patient was confined.
She said the patient was ""doing okay"" and that a city government team would test his family, and interview the members.
Belmonte said that according to the patient's mother, they did not know how the patient got the virus.

MANILA, Philippines – The Department of Health (DOH) said on Wednesday, March 11, that the COVID-19 test kit developed by scientists from the University of the Philippines (UP) may be rolled out on Monday, March 16.
“The commitment is to start it within a week after it was approved. Their target is to start accepting testings by Monday next week, and they have committed to 1,000 tests every week,"" DOH Undersecretary Eric Domingo, officer-in-charge of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), said. 
The FDA has approved the UP test kit, but it needs ""emergency use listing"" with the World Health Organization before it can be rolled out. 
The test kit is capable of fast detection of the novel coronavirus in samples taken from patients. The results can be ready in two hours. It will be reportedly priced at P1,320, or 6 times cheaper than its foreign counterpart, which costs around P8,500. (READ: #SalamatUP: Netizens laud U.P. scientists for developing coronavirus test kits)

In a span of 6 days, the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the Philippines rose to 46 from 3.
DOH Assistant Secretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine has the capacity to perform 300 tests per day.
“Kaya pa naman pong tugunan ang mga request for tests. Kapag dumating po tayo sa punto na tataas pa ang mga kaso, kaya nga po mino-mobilize ang ating partnership with UP-NIH and also the testing kits that have been locally-produced, para po ma-expand ang capacity ng ating laboratoryo,” Vergeire said.
(We can still respond to requests for testing. We can still attend to testing requests. When we reach the point where cases continue to increase, this is why we're mobilizing our partnership with the UP National Institute of Health. Also, the testing kits have been locally produced to expand our laboratory's capacity.)
As of Wednesday, the DOH has probed 763 patients for possible infections. Of the 49 confirmed cases, 45 are currently admitted to hospitals, two have been discharged, and two have died.

They later confirmed the patient was admitted at Silliman University Medical Center.“He is suffering severe pneumonia, and is on a ventilator,” she said. She said the patient went to Manila for a convention. Upon his return to the province, he consulted at ACE Dumaguete Doctors Hospital on March 7. “That’s the time we were alerted. There was a request for a throat swab after,” she added. Dr. Socrates Villamor, the DOH provincial chief, said a second confirmatory test will be done 48 hours after the first test. Lapse? Meanwhile, the Silliman University Medical Center, in a press statement on Wednesday, said that a patient from ACE Dumaguete Doctors Hospital was transferred to their care at 2:32 am on March 10.“While the transfer of one patient to another hospital usually happens for better management and care, there may have been a lapse in the manner this particular patient was transferred, there being no full disclosure and transparency on the condition of the patient to the receiving hospital,” the statement said.It stressed the health facility immediately instituted stringent measures following the principles of isolation, containment, and crowd control.“As of noon yesterday, no new admissions to the ICU will be entertained in the meantime. If really necessary, ICU-bound patients will be referred to other hospitals,” it said. It also said that all staff and watchers taking care of current ICU patients are on hospital-imposed quarantined as a preventive measure. “All of them have been provided with adequate sleeping quarters, and meals for the duration of the quarantine,” it added. The hospital also reminded the public to be properly screened when coming to SUMC and to fully disclose their health condition, especially those who have a history of travel in affected areas. Cause for concernMiraflor, when sought for reaction, said there was cause for concern, but he didn't want to speculate if there was a lapse on the part of the other hospital. “We will ask them what happened. I think they have their own explanation” he said.He said hospitals know there are protocols that need to be followed. He added they will meet with the administrators of the hospital on Thursday, March 12. – Rappler.com  "

MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – Manila Mayor Isko Moreno is placing himself under quarantine at Manila City Hall after travelling to London on an official trip, in a bid to prevent the possible spread of the novel coronavirus while working as the Philippine capital's local chief executive.
""I will submit myself to self-quarantine. I will stay in City Hall,"" a face mask-wearing Moreno said on Wednesday evening, March 11, in a roundtable meeting with Manila health and hospital officials, and his vice mayor Honey Lacuna, who were all also wearing face masks.
Why the quarantine? Moreno recently came from an official trip to the United Kingdom, which had confirmed 382 cases in its territory as of March 11.
Self-quarantine is recommended by health authorities for people who have been to areas with reported cases of the coronavirus.
How will it work? Moreno's chief of staff Cesar Chavez said the mayor would stay in his ""secured office"" at city hall, and would have limited interactions with Manila officials. 
The Manila mayor is also known to use Facebook to reach Manila citizens and call out underperforming government officials and employees. Both did not disclose the duration of the quarantine, but health officials usually advise a period of at least 14 days.
Moreno's call for calm: True to form, Moreno went live at around 1:30 am on Thursday, March12, beside Lacuna at his office, just minutes after the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus outbreak as a pandemic.  
Both local executives alled for sobriety amid the panic sparked by the coronavirus outbreak, saying residents should refrain from the practice of ""panic-buying"" or the practice of hoarding food and supplies at the expense of others.
""I want you to live normally. 'Wag natin hayaang manalo ang virus over our normal lives. Kaya natin 'to mga kababayan,"" Moreno said. (Let's not allow the virus to win over our normal lives. We can do this.) 
He was seconded by Lacuna, who said: ""'Wag po tayong mag-panic. Kami po sa pamahalaan ng lungsod ng Maynila, makakasiguro po kayo na lalabanan natin 'to (Let us not panic. We at the government of the City of Manila assure you that we will fight this).""
The mayor, however, said he needed the public's help. He reminded viewers to wash their hands, to avoid crowded spaces, and to reach out to the local government for information on the outbreak. Beginning on Thursday morning, the hotline will be activated at 8527-5174. 
Moreno concluded his speech telling Manila government employees to hold fast to their vow to public service, especially amid the outbreak. The mayor then vowed to the public that the city would be transparent with all developments related to the coronavirus.
""We will be honest and true enough to you [about] the state and the situation of our city,"" Moreno said. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – A day after the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the coronavirus test kits developed by scientists from University of the Philippines (UP), #SalamatUP trends on Twitter.
Price of a #COVID19 testing kitImported: P8,500UP-made: P1,320#SalamatUP— Tonyo Cruz (@tonyocruz) March 10, 2020
The FDA said on Tuesday, March 10, it issued a Certificate of Exemption for the SARS CoV-2 PCR Detection Kit of the UP National Institute of Health.
Priced at P1,320, the kit is said to be 6 times cheaper than its foreign counterpart, which costs around P8,500. The kit provides results in two hours. 
The kit, funded by the Department of Science and Technology, will be used for field testing coupled with gene sequencing at the Philippine Genome Center, the FDA said in a statement.
Netizens took to Twitter to show their appreciation for UP for having developed the test kits.
#SalamatUP Please don't allow anyone to make this a business opportunity. These scientists need to be recognized and our government must take care of them. Imagine #COVID19 tests kits for Php 1,320.00, that's only around $26. Mabuhay!— Grace in Lines (@GraceInLines) March 11, 2020

Health Undersecretary Eric Domingo, who heads the FDA, said the development of test kits was a response to the ""increasing number of reported COVID-19 cases.""
The health department had been under fire for underreporting cases in the country, which was attributed to the limited number of test kits – only 2,000 were available. Now, the UP National Institute of Health has committed to conducting 1,000 tests every week, said Domingo. 
Online, Filipinos praised the state university for ""rightfully criticizing"" the administration while being able to contribute to the prevention of more coronavirus cases.
UP has been a target of hate speech and red-tagging by state forces and administration supporters for championing advocacies and exacting accountability from our government. (Read: Activism as the foundation of the university)

SINGAPORE – Three more Filipinos, all of whom recently visited the Philippines, were diagnosed with the novel coronavirus in Singapore on Wednesday, March 11. 
This brings to 6 the number of COVID-19 patients in Singapore. 
One of the new Filipino patients is classified by Singapore as an imported case. Identified only as Case 178, he is a 37-year-old Singapore work pass holder. 
Case 178 was in the Philippines from February 11 to 19 and from February 23 to March 2 “to visit a relative with pneumonia who has since passed on,” said the Singapore Ministry of Health (MOH) on Wednesday. 
He was diagnosed with the novel coronavirus disease, called COVID-19, on Wednesday. He is confined in an isolation room at Ng Teng Fong General Hospital (NTFGH). 
His Filipino family member in Singapore, a 35-year-old staff nurse at NTFGH, also contracted the novel coronavirus. The Filipina, who is Case 167, is now confined in the same hospital where she works. 
Case 167 was in the Philippines from February 11 to 17. She was at work in NTFGH before she was diagnosed with COVID-19. 
The other Filipina case of COVID-19 on Wednesday is a 42-year-old Singapore work pass holder. Known as Case 172, she was in the Philippines from February 27 to March 2. 
She was diagnosed with COVID-19 on Wednesday and is confined at the National Center for Infectious Diseases. 
Earlier Filipino cases involved two domestic helpers, aged 34 and 41, under the same employer, who also contracted the disease; and a 41-year-old Singapore permanent resident from the Philippines. The last one has been discharged. 
There have been 178 coronavirus cases in Singapore as of Wednesday, said the MOH. Of this number, 93 patients have been discharged from the hospital. Singapore has recorded zero deaths. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – The government can impose “localized lockdowns” due to the novel coronavirus only when the alert is raised to Code Red Sublevel 2, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said. 
On Wednesday, March 11, Duque explained to lawmakers that this highest alert level is raised when there is sustained community transmission beyond the capacity of the government to trace cases of 2019-nCoV. (WATCH: House briefing on PH coronavirus status)
This is the only time mayors or governors can declare a lockdown in their respective jurisdictions. 
""They need to follow the declaration of Code Red Sublevel 2. This happens when there is sustained human-to-human transmission in the community. This can be declared if there is evidence of transmission that we can no longer link, we can no longer identify the source of infection,"" Duque said in a mix of English and Filipino. 
The Philippines is currently under Code Red Sublevel 1 after the country recorded its first case of local transmission: a 62-year-old Filipino male with no travel history outside the Philippines infecting his 59-year-old Filipina wife.  
Should the situation worsen to a Code Red Sublevel 2, Duque would prefer localized lockdowns first than immediately imposing sweeping restrictions limiting people’s movements in the entire National Capital Region (NCR).
""The lockdown may be imposed only where the localized transmission or localized cases are recorded, so that you wouldn't need to lock down the entire NCR if the sustained transmission is only within a  small community. It's not ripe for any draconian measures,"" the health chief said.
President Rodrigo Duterte himself has rejected calls to place Metro Manila on lockdown due to the outbreak of COVID-19, the disease caused by the 2019-nCoV that has infected 49 people in the Philippines as of Wednesday afternoon. 
The President already raised a public health emergency due to the novel coronavirus.
On Wednesday, Duque admitted that “problems” in the DOH’s reporting system led to their delayed disclosure of coronavirus cases. 
The DOH is also “transitioning” its quarantine strategy, with mild cases being asked to undergo home quarantine so that hospitals will not be packed with patients. Those with severe symptoms will be prioritized.
Duque said hospitals that wouldl refuse to admit suspected 2019-nCoV cases may have their licensed revoked or their PhilHealth accreditation removed. – Rappler.com  "

REMOTE LEARNING. A medical school student refers to online materials provided by her professor. Photo sourced by Rappler 
MANILA, Philippines – Following the recent spike of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases in Metro Manila the past week, President Rodrigo Duterte ordered the suspension of classes in Metro Manila from March 10 to 14.
As of this writing, there have been at least 49 cases of the coronavirus in the Philippines – with those who have not yet recovered confined in hospitals in and around the National Capital Region (NCR).
The Department of Education (DepEd) ordered NCR schools on Tuesday evening after the President's announcement to implement “social distancing measures” amid the COVID-19 threat. By then, it had already suspended national activities requiring travel and congregation, such as Palaro Regional Meets.
With the uncertainty surrounding the incubation of the disease, schools are resorting to creative measures to keep classes running outside the classroom. Here are some of their practices:
Using online platforms
Here is a list of some online platforms some teachers have reported using or are encouraged to use to conduct their classes:

Google Classroom
Google Hangouts
Moodle (short for Modular Object-Oriented Dynamic Learning Environment)
Edmodo
Schoology
Turnitin
Skype
Zoom
Telegram
Facebook groups and Messenger

Ramon Avanceña High School (RAHS) principal Danilo Estavillo encouraged teachers in their Quiapo-based school to make use of Google Classroom to interact with students. In this platform, teachers can post announcements and assignments that students can accomplish online. 
In Pasig Elementary and Sta Ana Elementary, some teachers post slideshows of their lessons in Facebook groups and allow students to ask their questions and share insights through comments. Some also give assignments via Facebook Messenger.
Ateneo de Manila University lists Moodle, a free and open-sourced learning platform, as among online venues for learning.
Multimedia lectures. At the Ateneo School of Medicine and Public Health, some professors have opted for the following options on Facebook:

Livestreamed lectures
Audio lectures
Video lectures of a PowerPoint, along with an audio track of a discussion

Students can also comment on the multimedia lectures for questions. Professors provide links to supplementary learning materials, like YouTube videos.
Other online practices. The University of the Philippines (UP) and Ateneo suggested the following practices for faculty members in conducting remote lessons:

Adjusting syllabi and providing more detail on expectations of each session
Holding online classes on the same schedules as appointed course periods
Uploading learning materials or links to them in existing platforms
Adapting requirements to make them more compatible to an online delivery mode (e.g. essays instead of an exam)
Taking inventory of students' access to the internet, and matching students without access with those with access for peer learning opportunities
Conducting thesis defenses online
Determining contingency plans for laboratory classes, internships, and field immersion, among other out-of-classroom requirements

UP also made their Open University’s Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) accessible via their website for easy transition of lessons from face-to-face to online. According to the website, all educational institutions looking to do e-learning may avail of the MOOCs for free. (READ: [OPINION] A few possible benefits of the coronavirus outbreak)
RAHS principal Estavillo said there are no concerns about access to internet in their school. Meanwhile, for Sta Ana Elementary, principal Leo Pabaruan said that even if some students do not have access to the internet, they can just review their hard-copy lessons and modules for their postponed exams. The same is done in RAHS.
If teachers are unable to hold online class sessions, Ateneo advised them to break down the remainder of the course into modules, assign reading materials, and prepare an assessment to go with each module. Students would submit their requirements for the modules through email.
Ateneo decided that should the suspension of classes be announced within 3 weeks of the end of the 2nd semester, the semester would be deemed ended, and the final grades would be based on the latest class standing.
Staggered exams upon return
The week of March 10 to 14 coincides with the exam periods of some public elementary and high schools. The principals of the mentioned public schools said that this makes it easier for alternative learning, since lessons scheduled this week are not as heavy.
Pasig Elementary principal Emelita Medina said that once the students come back for their 4th quarter exams on March 16 to 20, they will come on a staggered basis – meaning students will come in batches at different times of the day to avoid too much contact.
This is also in line with the DepEd advisory for all basic educational institutions in the National Capital Region (NCR).
Postponement or cancellation of non-academic events
The University Athletic Association of the Philippines (UAAP) suspended all events until March 14.
A theater organization in Ateneo canceled its shows from March 11 to March 18, beyond the President’s suspension period.
Some high schools like Xavier School canceled its upcoming proms after the President’s suspension. Xavier also canceled off-campus retreats.
Advice dissemination
UP released a set of COVID-19 guidelines for its students through an online pamphlet. It contains answers to questions like, “I think I’m sick. What should I do?” It also contains illustrated guidelines of proper handwashing, how to use face masks, receiving letters and packages, and interacting with animals. 
At the end of the pamphlet is a list of contact numbers for each UP campus’ University Health Service. There are also QR codes for the official websites of the Department of Health and the World Health Organization.

ALBAY, Philippines – The provincial government of Albay is fast-tracking the rehabilitation of the Mayon Skyline Hotel in Tabaco City to set it up as quarantine center for cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.  
Located in Tabaco's Barangay Buang, the former commercial hotel near the active Mayon volcano can accommodate 24 patients. 
Trained medics will be assigned to the quarantine center, said Dr Cedric Daep, who heads the Albay Public Safety and Emergency Management Office. 
The Mayon Skyline Hotel is owned by the provincial government. Also known as the Mayon Rest House, it ceased commercial operations in the late 1990s due to the unpredictable outbursts of Mount Mayon, whose crater is around 4 kilometers away. The place has since been converted into a nature park.  
The area is accessible via Sabloyon area in Tabaco City or about two hours drive from Legazpi City but not via public transportation.
As of March 11, the Department of Health had reported 15 persons who were placed under investigation for coronavirus symptoms in the Bicol region, but they have all been discharged. – Rappler.com

MANILA, Philippines – The Department of Education (DepEd) on Wednesday, March 11, said that it would be up to public schools to decide on whether or not to push through with graduation ceremonies amid the novel coronavirus outbreak.
“Kung kaya ng schools i-implement strictly ang Department of Health (DOH) guidelines sa health eh magpatuloy sila ng graduation at saka gagawa sila ng paraan para mako-contain ang size ng crowds kasi ang sabi ni DOH, iko-control ang mass gatherings,” DepEd Secretary Leonor Briones said in a press conference. 
(If schools can strictly implement the guidelines set by the DOH, they may proceed with the graduation and they must find a way to control the size of the crowd following DOH’s protocols on mass gatherings.)
The DepEd reiterated that schools have the discretion to choose the date for conducting moving up and graduation rites within the week of April 13 to 17, 2020, provided that they follow the  DOH guidelines.
“We trust the schools, we trust the parents, and we trust their capacity to assess if they can implement the guidelines which are publicly known,” Briones stressed. 
Briones said that schools may opt to limit the number of parents or relatives who will be attending the ceremony in order to control the size of the crowd.
She added that she was not worried since students were being taught about health and personal hygiene protocols with or without the threat of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new virus.
However, if schools decide not to push through with the ceremony within the said week, they may, upon consultation with the parents and teachers, choose to reschedule the event.
Staggered exam schedule
With class suspensions in Metro Manila this week affecting the schedule of examinations for graduating students, DepEd said that all teachers are set to schedule all remaining 4th quarter examinations in the week of March 16 to 20 on a staggered basis to reduce the number of students in the school per day. 
Briones also reiterated that no mass promotion or passing of students would be done.
""No mass passing, no automatic or mass promotion because that is not the policy of the Duterte administration,"" she said.
In extreme conditions when suspension of work and classes ensue, DepEd Undersecretary Nepomuceno Malaluan said the department has outlined its alternative plan. 
“Sa tingin namin ay dahil nasa yugto na kami ng school year ay may sapat na na batayan para bigyan ng grado doon sa 4th quarter even in the absence of final test. Ang pinag-uusapan ngayon, paano ang transmutation na gagawin – only for extreme cases,"" Malaluan stressed. 
(As we see it, because the school year is now on its last period, schools have enough basis for giving grades for the fourth quarter even in the absence of a final test. What we are considering now is how the transmutation of grades will be done if extreme cases happen.)
DepEd has also encouraged private schools in basic education to adopt its guidelines as well. 
“Ang private sector dahil sila ay may autonomy na mag-isip ng anong paraan para ma-achieve din ang goals nila...pero ang purpose ay ibalanse ang safety ng learners, containment of COVID-19, and hindi madisrupt ang buhay ng mga bata sa kanilang learning process,” Briones said. 
(Although the private sector may have autonomy to think of ways to achieve their goals to prevent and control the disease in schools, the purpose should focus on striking a balance regarding the safety of the learners, containment of COVID-19, and not to disrupt the lives of the students in their learning process.)  
Briones added that conducting ""online classes are alright"" but may not be applicable in all areas due to possible internet connectivity issues. – Rappler.com  "

Since the outbreak began, at least 98 Filipinos outside the Philippines have contracted the virus. These include 80 from a cruise ship docked in Japan, 3 in Singapore, 5 in Hong Kong, 2 in the United Arab Emirates, 2 in Lebanon, and 6 onboard a luxury cruise ship docked in California, United States. 
But 40 from the cruise ship in Japan, 1 in Singapore, and 1 in Hong Kong have since recovered, leaving 56 still infected as of Wednesday.
The World Health Organization warned on March 10 that there is now a ""very real"" threat that the new coronavirus outbreak will become a pandemic, but stressed the virus could still be controlled.
The global death toll has reached 4,281, with 3,158 of the fatalities in China. The number of cases worldwide has risen to 118,554, with 80,778 of the infections in China. The virus has spread to 110 countries. – with reports from Agence France-Presse/Rappler.com "
,"March 11, 2020",nCov,Medical City says it will 'remain open to all patients',JC Gotinga,"
THE MEDICAL CITY. The Medical City's main hospital is in Ortigas Center in Pasig City. Photo from The Medical City's website   
MANILA, Philippines – The Medical City (TMC), an upscale private hospital, said it “will remain open to all patients"" for as long as the hospital can accommodate them, following the leakage of an internal memo telling its staff to “temporarily stop admitting” confirmed and suspected COVID-19 patients.
In the internal memo dated March 10, Tuesday, TMC Hospital Infection Control and Epidemiology Center Director Karl Evans Henson said the hospital’s main facility in Ortigas Center in Pasig City had already reached “full capacity” with 3 confirmed cases and several persons under investigation (PUIs) for the disease in its care.
“Currently available manpower will be unable to care for any additional patients. While our patients are our primary concern, we cannot ignore the fact that a healthy and safe workplace is imperative to sustain the level and quality of care that we provide to our currently admitted patients,” the memo stated.
In an official statement on Wednesday, March 11, TMC President and CEO Eugenio Jose Ramos explained that the internal memo issued on Tuesday night, March 10, was just a stopgap measure to control the inflow of new patients.
Ramos jabbed at critics, saying “they make things worse than they should be, contributing to the problem but offering no solution.” He called the leakage of the memo “a malicious virus that spreads faster than COVID-19.”
“Let it be clear, therefore, that as this epidemic evolves in ways that we cannot but anticipate, The Medical City, ever so proud of its Epidemic Rapid Response Team as well as its entire hospital staff, will remain open to all patients who deserve our care, for as long as our capacity to do so allows it,"" he said.
“This is a social responsibility that our enterprise – all 6 hospitals – does not shy away from. In fact, we intend to play a bigger role in this worldwide crisis in the days to come,” Ramos added.
He said that at present, the hospital already had 8 confirmed COVID-19 cases under its care, and that its Emergency Department handled 31 PUIs the previous night.
Worried that taking in more PUIs would overstretch the hospital staff and resources, the management decided to “temporarily control the inflow of new cases” and issued the internal memo on Tuesday night.
Wearing protective gear and following prescribed protocols do not guarantee the hospital staff 100% protection from the virus, and those exposed to confirmed cases are strictly placed on quarantine for 14 days, Ramos said.
“The impact of this on our hospital manpower base and other resources, plus the fear, uncertainty, and the onset of fatigue and burn-out is serious and very worrisome,” he added.

The TMC chief capped off his statement by saying that fear and misinformation are “the bigger enemy” than the novel coronavirus.
The mayor’s visit
Pasig Mayor Vico Sotto visited the TMC hospital in Ortigas Center before noon on Wednesday to clarify the matter.
“Partially because of several rumors, I went to The Medical City Pasig to meet with their officials. We are reassuring the public: TMC is not refusing patients. Even if they reach capacity, they will test and properly refer patients,” Sotto said in a post on his official Facebook and Twitter accounts after his meeting with the hospital’s executives.

Operations at TMC were “continuing as normal,” the mayor added.
Sotto then reiterated his call to spread only true and useful information, verified by legitimate sources.
Health Secretary’s take
At a House panel hearing on the novel coronavirus on Wednesday, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III faced questions on TMC’s alleged plan to turn down COVID-19 patients.
“Ang protocol diyan ay (The protocol there is) ‘not allowed to refuse patients. Unless the reasons are cogent, the reasons are clear, we cannot allow it. So we will have to look into this report. So I'm sending my regional director to make the assessment vis-a-vis the claim of the hospital of reasons why they are no longer accepting patients,” Duque told the congressional panel.
If any hospital is found to have unlawfully refused to admit patients, the government may revoke its Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth) accreditation, and its license issued by the Bureau of Health Facility Services Regulatory Board, Duque said. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – The Department of Health (DOH) on Wednesday, March 11, confirmed 16 more positive cases of COVID-19, raising the total number of cases in the country to 49.
The DOH said they were now conducting extensive information-gathering and contact tracing activities on the new confirmed cases.
According to the DOH, they also have yet to determine if these were cases of community transmission.
 
“Pumasok na po lahat most of the numbers at datos para sa contact tracing. Napapansin na po natin at nakikita na natin ang relasyon ng cases right now,” Health Assistant Secretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said in a press briefing on Wednesday, March 11.
(All the numbers and data are already up for contact tracing. We can already see the relationship of each case now.)
Meanwhile, Vergeire also said that the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) at present has a capacity to perform 300 tests per day.
“Kaya pa naman pong tugunan ang mga request for tests. Kapag dumating po tayo sa punto na tataas pa ang mga kaso kaya nga po minomobilize ang ating partnership with UPNIH and also the testing kits that have been locally produced para po ma expand ang capacity ng ating laboratoryo,” Vergeire said.
(We can still respond to requests for testing. We can still attend to testing requests. When we reach the point where cases continue to increase, we will mobilize our partnership with UPNIH. Also the testing kits have been locally produced to expand our laboratory's capacity.)
The test kit developed by the University of the Philippines National Institutes of Health is capable of faster detection of the novel coronavirus in samples taken from patients.
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has already approved the UP test kit, but it needs to get the nod of the World Health Organization's (WHO) ""emergency use listing” before this can be rolled out.
On virus-hit Japanese cruise ship
The health department also reported that together with the Overseas Workers Welfare Administration (OWWA), they have  sent home 442 of the 445 repatriates from Japan who were quarantined at the New Clark City.
Of those 445 repatriates, two tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus. The DOH said that rooms used by these patients were disinfected thoroughly.
“Close contacts of the 2 confirmed cases shall undergo additional 14-day home quarantine and will be continuously monitored by their respective municipal health offices,” the DOH added.
As of Wednesday, the global death toll of COVID-19 has reached 4,292 with 3,046 of the fatalities in China. The number of cases worldwide has risen to 119,541, with 80,967 of the infections in China. The virus has spread to more than 100 countries.
The DOH will release details of the new cases to media late Wednesday. – Rappler.com

MANILA, Philippines – The Liberian government has asked all travelers from the Philippines to monitor themselves for symptoms of the novel coronavirus disease to help quell the spread of the virus in the African country. 
The Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) urged Filipinos to take note of Liberia’s travel restrictions on self monitoring, which is being imposed on travelers from countries where there are less than 50 cases. 
Travelers should also report immediately to concerned health authorities in Liberia should they experience fever, cough, or respiratory distress. 
As of Wednesday, March 11, the Philippines recorded 33  COVID-19 cases, including two  in “critical condition” and the first death outside China – a Chinese tourist from Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak. 
The DFA also  urged travelers from the Philippines to be mindful of Liberia’s other measures that will take effect if cases rise in the Philippines.  
The measures include the following:

For those arriving from countries where there are over 200 cases: They will immediately be placed at the Liberian government’s designated precautionary center for a mandatory 14-day monitoring. 


For those arriving from countries where there are over 50 to 100 cases: They will be evaluated upon entry into Liberia. If coming from places with over 100 cases, they will be placed under observation.


For new passport holders: They will be immediately taken for a second round of screening at a designated screening center. If found to be circumventing existing travel restrictions, they will be subject to 14-day monitoring at a designated monitoring center.

The DFA said Filipinos en route to Liberia who encounter any issues with the restrictions may contact the Philippine Embassy in Abuja, Nigeria, at +2349053244916 or +2348102541252. 
“The DFA likewise advises the Filipino public to remain vigilant and continue to be accurately informed as countries impose and/or adjust travel restrictions that may suddenly affect Filipino travelers,” it said. 
There are currently no confirmed COVID-19 cases in Liberia.  
Worldwide, the death toll due to the disease surpassed 4,200 while over 117,000 cases were recorded in over 100 countries. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – The summer heat and the spread of the novel coronavirus are likely to increase water consumption in the coming weeks.
Moreover, the National Water Resources Board has kept raw water allocation for concessionaires at limited levels until April to preserve the water supply of the Angat Dam.
Despite these, Metro Manila concessionaires Manila Water and Maynilad Water Services assured customers that there is sufficient supply.
In a text message to Rappler, Maynilad said it has been implementing the following measures to cushion the impact of the reduced allocation:

Getting additional raw water from Laguna Lake through two treatment plants in Muntinlupa City that now produce 300 million liters per day
Sustained pipe replacement and leak repairs
Cloud seeding in partnership with the Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System and the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical, and Astronomical Services Administration 
Reactivation of several deep wells
Tapping small rivers in Cavite using modular treatment plants

Manila Water said its supply outlook is ""better this year compared to last year,"" as it has put in place several augmentation measures.
Manila Water has been implementing service interruptions since 2019, but only at reduced pressure at nighttime until recently.
""We do assure our customers in the East Zone that water is still available during daytime, so we have safe, clean water to use for hygiene in the face of the COVID-19 concerns. We will proceed with operational adjustments which may result to no water but only at nighttime, except for emergency leak repairs at daytime,"" Manila Water said.
""We still encourage the public to use water responsibly and wisely to help preserve the level of the dams,"" the company added.
On Monday, March 9, President Rodrigo Duterte once again warned of a government takeover of Metro Manila's water sector, should it experience another crisis amid the coronavirus scare.
""I'm warning you, I will industrialize the water industry and government will do the construction and we will force the issue,"" Duterte said.
The government is currently reviewing the concession agreements of Manila Water and Maynilad over supposedly onerous provisions. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – PBA commissioner Willie Marcial and the board of governors all agreed to indefinitely suspend the ongoing season due to the threat of the novel coronavirus in the country.
Starting Wednesday, March 11, the league has canceled all games and activities, including the PBA D-League and the inaugural PBA 3x3. 
""It was a unanimous decision by the board,"" Marcial said in Filipino a day after the special board meeting on Tuesday, March 10. 
The 45th season successfully kicked off on Sunday, March 8, with the traditional opening ceremonies at the Araneta Coliseum before reigning five-time Philippine Cup champion San Miguel crushed Magnolia. 
But since then, the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the country has risen dramatically, with the total spiking to 33 as of Tuesday. 
Marcial said the cancelation may last for at least 3 weeks. 
""We don't think of the impact on the league anymore, be it on the schedule or money. Our priority is the welfare of everybody involved."" 
But if the situation permits, closed-door games are a possibility.
""We'll see. We're on a day-to-day basis. If it worsens, we will have a longer season. This is for the sake of everybody,"" Marcial said.

MANILA, Philippines – Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said any hospital that will refuse to admit suspected cases of COVID-19 without valid reasons may face sanctions. 
Duque said in a chance interview on Wednesday, March 11, that hospitals are “not allowed” to close their doors on patients suspected to have COVID-19, the disease caused by novel coronavirus. (WATCH: House briefing on coronavirus status)
“Ang protocol diyan eh (The protocol there is that they are) not allowed to refuse patients. Unless the reasons are cogent, the reasons are clear, we cannot allow it. So we will have to look into this report,” Duque said.
Asked what possible sanctions the government may impose, Duque said the hospitals may be stripped of their license and accreditation.
“I’m sure there are [sanctions]. So we can probably impose some of the sanctions [like removing their] accreditation by PhilHealth [or] the licensing by the Health Facility [and] Services Regulatory Bureau,” Duque said.  
Duque was sought for comment on reports that The Medical City (TMC) in Pasig would temporarily stop admitting patients under investigation (PUI) fr COVID-19 since the hospital was supposedly at full capacity already with 3 PUIs already under its care. 
Duque said he would sending the Deparment of Health regional director to verify this information with TMC, but Pasig City Mayor Vico Sotto already said the private hospital “is not refusing patients.”
With the total confirmed cases in the Philippines at 33 so far, the health department is now “transitioning” its quarantine strategy, with mild cases being asked to undergo home quarantine so that hospitals will not be packed with patients. Those with severe symptoms will be prioritized. 
Due to limited supplies, DOH will also only test patients already showing respiratory symptoms and who have either traveled to countries with recorded cases of the coronavirus or were exposed to those who already have COVID-19. (READ: Duque: 'Problems' in reporting system delayed disclosure of coronavirus cases)

MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – Pasig Mayor Vico Sotto called for calm and cautioned against panic buying, as his local government responds to the threat of the novel coronavirus.
Sotto on Wednesday, March 11, addressed concerns that people have been trooping to markets and grocery stores to stock up on food and supplies, and that face masks, sanitizers, and rubbing alcohol were running out due to hoarders.
“Kawawa naman ‘yung mga mauubusan (How unfortunate for those who won’t have any left),” Sotto said in a media interview.
“Safe po tayo. ‘Wag po tayo magpanic (We’re safe. Let’s not panic),” he added.
Sotto urged his constituents to be considerate, and reminded them that neither the World Health Organization nor the Department of Health recommends wearing face masks to avoid infection. Only people with a cough or cold are encouraged to wear face masks.
Stores in Pasig will not close and there is “no problem at all” when it comes to the availability of food items, he added.
‘Very prepared’
Sotto on Wednesday oversaw efforts to spray disinfectant in the city’s school campuses, as classes and all major public gatherings were canceled.
Pasig has 45 public schools, all of which were routinely disinfected once a month before the viral outbreak. Sotto said the city plans to disinfect campuses twice a week when classes resume. Teams will be sent to disinfect private schools upon their request.
Much-frequented public places like the city hall and wet market will be disinfected daily, and the city government will distribute disinfectant kits to Pasig’s 30 barangays.

“We’re very prepared,” Sotto told reporters, adding that the local government is working closely with the DOH on efforts to combat the virus.
The city has dedicated response teams trained to handle suspected cases of infection. Areas have been designated for isolating suspected cases, and the city’s responders observe the right protocols on triage and referral of patients to the proper health facilities, the mayor added.
11 persons under investigation
Three Pasig residents were earlier diagnosed with COVID-19, which is caused by the new virus; two of them are a couple.
Health officials have traced the patients’ close contacts and identified 11 people as “persons under investigation (PUI)” for the virus. They were placed on home quarantine for 14 days, during which they are isolated and not allowed to leave their houses.
The city government has checked on the 11 PUIs and made sure they had everything they need while they are prohibited from stepping out out of their homes, Sotto said.
A private hospital in Pasig, The Medical City, said it had 8 confirmed novel coronavirus cases under its care as of Wednesday.
Go to health centers first
Anyone with flu-like symptoms or who suspects infection must immediately go to their barangay health center – not hospitals – to be checked.
If all people experiencing symptoms were to go to hospitals right away, it could “overload” Pasig’s hospital system and even increase the risk of infection, Sotto said.
Although Pasig is currently hiring new nurses, the medical staff on hand are so far able to keep up with the demands of responding to the viral threat, he added.
For any questions, Pasig residents may call the city’s health hotline at 8-643-0000. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles on Wednesday, March 11, said the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth) will shoulder costs for the testing of the novel coronavirus disease called COVID-19 in hospitals. 
Nograles said this will be on top of PhilHealth’s coverage of expenses for quarantine and isolation of patients infected with the disease. 
He added PhilHealth president and chief executive officer Ricardo Morales said the agency was ""in the process of formalizing and operationalizing"" the new measure. 
Nograles said the move was done in line with President Rodrigo Duterte’s orders for government to combat the coronavirus crisis. The measure, he added, would also be done to aid citizens in getting tested, as procedures may cost some P3,000 to P5,000 each. 
Coping with the outbreak: As the number of coronavirus cases in the Philippines continues to rise, health officials have been placed under scrutiny for the lack of test kits.  
The Research Institute on Tropical Medicine (RITM), which is the Philippines' sole laboratory accredited by the World Health Organization (WHO) to test novel coronavirus samples, earlier said there were only some only 2,000 kits available on hand. 
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has since approved the use of COVID-19 test kits developed by University of the Philippines (UP) scientists. The additional kits are expected to aid in field testing for the disease. 
The kits developed by UP will also be coupled with gene sequencing at the Philippine Genome Center.  
Nograles gave assurances the government was “working overtime” to ensure there would be enough tests to quickly identify those infected with the coronavirus. 
Specifically, he said research and development company Manila Healthtek was developing a “rapid diagnostic test kit” for COVID-19, which set for for a field validation study. The Philippine General Hospital, Nograles added, has also agreed to support the study. 
“At this point, they just need to conduct validation of 500 tests for COVID-19 to enable them to conduct clinical sensitivity analysis as a pre-condition set by the FDA. Once it passes the clinical tests, the FDA will grant full access by all hospitals, as guided by the DOH,” Nograles said. 
Aside from this, Nograles said private hospitals have also signaled interest to join field validation studies, though this would be subject to the approval of an ethics committee, which may come by Friday, March 13.
As of Wednesday, the Philippines recorded 33 confirmed coronavirus cases. The confirmed cases include two patients who were in ""very critical condition"" and the first death recorded outside China – a Chinese tourist from Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said on Wednesday, March 11, that ""problems"" in the Department of Health's reporting system caused the delay in the disclosure of new COVID-19 cases in the country.
Duque told lawmakers on Wednesday, March 11, that the DOH had no intention to hide any information to the public related to the cases. (WATCH: House briefing on PH coronavirus status) 
“‘Yon pong sinasabi ninyong hindi nagdisclose, nagkaroon lang po ng konting aberya sa reporting system (About your statement that we’re not disclosing, we just had some problems in our reporting system). But I assure you, there is no deliberate, there was no deliberate intention on the part of the DOH to not disclose important pieces of information as can be legally allowed under the law,” Duque said.  
This was his response to ACT-CIS Representative Nina Taduran, who asked during the House health committee hearing if the “delayed disclosure” of the confirmed cases would account for the recent spike in local transmission of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new virus.
From just 10 cases on Sunday, March 8, the Philippines reported 23 new cases between Monday, March 9, and Tuesday night, March 10, bringing the total to 33.  (READ: LIST: Confirmed coronavirus cases in the Philippines as of March 10)
The DOH has since drawn flak for failing to immediately announce these additional cases, as several local government units and the management of several hospitals where the patients were admitted issued statements ahead of the the health department. 
During the House hearing, Muntinlupa Representative Ruffy Biazon criticized the clear lack of communication lines even within the government’s Inter-Agency Task Force on the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases – the body tasked to manage the coronavirus outbreak.
Biazon said Duque should insist more on his authority as “incident commander” of this health crisis.  
“With due respect to the good Secretary whom I have a great respect for…personally I have some observations that the inter-agency task force was not fully functioning as it should be…. There are aspects of this crisis that could have been handled a better way in light of the DOH being incident commander,” Biazon said. 
“There was an appearance that there was no proper communication coordination between the secretary of health and the private hospitals and likewise with the LGUs,” the Muntinlupa congressman added. 
Biazon hoped that other member-agencies of the IATF would recognize Duque’s authority to lead the government's response to the outbreak. 
“I am fully behind the Secretary of Health and I make this statement because I want him to be recognized by everyone as the incident commander in this crisis,” Biazon said. 
In a press conference on Monday, Duque already said the DOH would disclose the names of the hospitals where the COVID-19 cases are admitted “to combat unverified or fake news.” 
The DOH will also inform mayors about positive cases in their areas, who can then make announcements to their respective constituencies. – Rappler.com

MANILA, Philippines – The lack of supply of face masks in the Philippines has reached “grave” levels that some private hospitals have been forced to improvise with old linen to help protect their health personnel from the novel coronavirus.
Philippine Hospital Association Dr Jaime Almora raised the alarm on Wednesday, March 11, as the Department of Health (DOH) briefed  he House committee on health on the status of the COVID-19 outbreak in the country. (WATCH: House briefing on coronavirus status)
“There is, there is, madam, danger, a grave deficit in the number of PPEs (personal protective equipment). We are resorting actually to improvising, like we turn our old linen into cloth masks,” Almora said when House panel chair Angelina Tan asked if they had enough supplies. 
This is in stark contrast to the steady supply of face masks and PPEs the DOH is getting from Bataan-based manufacturer Philippine International Trading Corporation (PITC) for government health workers. 
Undersecretary for Procurement and Supply Chain Carolina Vidal Taiño said the DOH currently has 59,000 pieces of N-95 masks in stock for public health workers nationwide, enough for a month’s supply. She said the PITC has committed to provide them at least 30,000 pieces every week.
Health Secretary Francisco Duque III explained that the demand for face masks has increased not just in the Philippines but across the globe, where more than 100 countries have recorded a positive case of COVID-19, the disease caused by 2019-nCoV. 
Still, Duque said the DOH was willing to give extra face masks to private hospitals in need, but government health workers would still be the top priority.  
“We are told also that the need has become so acute that the global supply chain is really under pressure. Hindi talaga nila ma-supplyan dahil (They really can't supply all because) 104 countries have COVID infection, almost 50 have local transmissions, and so they just have to ramp up their supply chains, Madame Chair,” Duque said.  
“But if we have some extras, we would be certainly willing to let the private hospitals have some. But we cannot promise that what they need we will be able to respond to because our priority is the public health workers,” the DOH chief added.  
In the Philippines, citizens had been panic-buying face masks in the past weeks as the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases rose to 33 as of Tuesday evening, March 10.  
This is despite the World Health Organization’s reminder that face masks should be reserve for high-risk people like the elderly and health workers who have to take care of confirmed cases. 
On February 3, President Rodrigo Duterte said the government would procure more surgical face masks for Filipinos as stockpiles continue to be depleted. He has already declared a state of public health emergency due to the novel coronavirus. – Rappler.com

MANILA, Philippines – The Philippine government will be borrowing even more this year, as revenue collection is expected to drop by as much as P91 billion due to the economic slowdown triggered by the novel coronavirus.
In a press briefing on Tuesday, March 10, Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III said the budget deficit may hit as high as 3.6% of the country's gross domestic product (GDP), assuming that the economic impact of the virus would last until June. 
Dominguez said the increased borrowings would help sustain President Rodrigo Duterte's ambitious Build, Build, Build infrastructure program. 
Socioeconomic Planning Secretary Ernesto Pernia said the economic team programmed the ceiling for the budget deficit to hit a maximum of 3% for 2020.
Pernia added that economic growth may fall by a full percentage point due to the economic slowdown. This means that the government may miss its GDP target of 6.5% to 7.5% for this year. (READ: 'A mess': Coronavirus economic impact on Philippines worse than projected)
Lower tourism-related activities and weaker trade are the main contributors for the economic slowdown.
Why does this matter? A budget deficit shows the government is spending beyond its means.
In 2019, the budget deficit exploded to 3.5%, higher than the target of 3.25%. It was the second time in Philippine history that the annual deficit surpassed the ceiling set by the government.
The rise was due to the aggressive increase in spending in the 4th quarter, with the budget deficit soaring to 6.8%. (READ: [ANALYSIS] How the budget deficit exploded under Duterte's watch)
Meanwhile, the Bureau of Internal Revenue did not reach the tax collection target last year. It only collected P2.17 trillion, which was below the P2.33-trillion target.
As the government fails to reach its revenue targets, it will have little option but to borrow and incur more debt.
The deficit figure is also dependent on GDP growth. Simply put, the lower the GDP, the less room for government to borrow in the future.
Will the Philippines' debt be too much? Data from the Bureau of the Treasury showed that the country's debt soared to P7.7 trillion in 2019. 
But so far, the debt-to-GDP ratio is at 41.9%, still within the government target of 42%.
The ratio simply compares what the country owes with what it produces, and indicates the country's ability to pay back its debts.
""Our credit rating is quite robust and we don't expect any difficulty in covering for potential deficit that might occur because of the expected drop in economic activity because of this COVID,"" Dominguez said. – Rappler.com "

In compliance to Proclamation No. 922 signed by President Rodrigo Duterte declaring a State of Public Health Emergency throughout the Philippines and calling for the implementation of urgent, critical measures to contain the spread of COVID-19, the Civil Service Commission (CSC) suspends the conduct of the March 15 Career Service Examination-Pen and Paper Test (CSE-PPT) nationwide until further notice.  The CS exams were supposed to be held in 66 testing locations nationwide, with an estimated total of 293,845 individuals nationwide registered to take the test. Of the figure, an estimated 253,419 will take the Professional Level exam, while an estimated 40,426 will attempt to hurdle the Subprofessional Level.
Thus, it is necessary to suspend the exams as a preemptive health measure to mitigate the rise in the number of COVID-19 cases and to support the national and local government units in undertaking appropriate response and measures in a timely manner to curtail and eliminate the COVID-19 threat.

As of Tuesday, the Philippines has 33 confirmed cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. Of this number, 30 are currently admitted to hospitals, two have been discharged, and one has died.
On UP testing kit
On Tuesday, Vergeire said that even though the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) already approved the COVID-19 test kit developed by University of the Philippines (UP) scientists, it still needs to get listed in the World Health Organization's (WHO) ""emergency use listing.""
""Kailangan kasi na mailista siya doon sa emergency use listing ng WHO. Mayroon silang kailangan i-comply na kailangan pang kunin sa ibang bansa bago mai-approve ng WHO. That's a step na pinag-uusapan ngayon na both ng WHO at ng mga gumagawa ng rapid testing kit na ito,"" Vergeire said. 
(It needs to be listed in the emergency use listing of the WHO. Before it can be approved by WHO, they need to comply with a requirement that needs to be accomplished abroad. That's a step that the WHO and the UP scientists are discussing now.)
The kit, funded by the Department of Science and Technology, will be used for field testing coupled with gene sequencing at the Philippine Genome Center, the FDA said in a statement.
Heath Undersecretary Eric Domingo, FDA chief, said that the use of the locally-developed test kits would help address the ""increasing number of reported COVID-19 cases"" that ""require immediate diagnosis and monitoring.""
Vergeire, however, said that the DOH has enough testing kits.
As of Tuesday, the DOH said it has probed a total of 725 patients for possible infection. 
The global death toll has reached 4,012, with 3,136 of the fatalities in China. The number of cases worldwide has risen to 114,151, with 80,754 of the infections in China. The virus has spread to 105 countries. – with reports from Agence France-Presse/Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – The number of confirmed novel coronavirus cases in the Philippines started spiking on the second week of March – a month after health officials confirmed the country's third case.
According to the Department of Health, the spike in the number of positive cases was supposedly due to their “heightened surveillance” efforts. (READ: Novel coronavirus cases in the Philippines now at 52)
The DOH said they were conducting comprehensive contact tracing for all cases. They are also in coordination with concerned local government units and Centers for Health Development for the implementation of infection prevention and control measures.

MANILA, Philippines – The Philippine Azkals will have to wait for another chance to pick up a win in the FIFA World Cup Asian qualifiers, while Ceres-Negros FC will be without its home crowd in their upcoming 2020 AFC Cup match.
In a statement released on Monday, March 9, FIFA and the Asian Football Confederation have agreed to postpone the World Cup qualifying matches in March and in June due to the coronavirus outbreak, but games can still go ahead if both sides agree and safety standards are met. 
But according to Philippine Football Federation (PFF) secretary-general Edwin Gastanes, Guam – which was slated to play against the Philippines on March 26 – did not allow its team to travel to the host country. 
""Like this month, the Philippines Azkals were supposed to go against Guam, but two weeks ago, Guam said: ‘Sorry, we cannot go because of our coach and team management doesn’t want to get this [coronavirus] problem,"" said Gastanes in the chef de mission to the Tokyo 2020 Olympics press conference in the Philippine Sports Commission (PSC). 
""World Cup qualifying matches will be rescheduled to a later month this year according to FIFA and AFC."" 
Philippines is bunched with group topper Syria, China, Guam and Maldives in Group A where the Azkals are running in 3rd. 
The team will not host nor travel for friendlies, either. 
Gastanes also said that the PFF will follow up on the World Cup qualifying home matches on June 4 against China and June 9 against Maldives, as well as the arrangement friendlies. 
""With regards to friendlies, it’s safe to say that by March, we have no friendlies, we’ll see about June. We have to keep following up. We have to see about the World Cup qualifying matches in June if the teams will come here to play,"" added Gastanes. 
The 2020 AFC Cup match between Ceres-Negros FC and Bali United hosted in the Rizal Memorial Stadium on Wednesday, March 11, will not be open for public. 
Football is one of the sports worst affected by the epidemic and especially in Asia, where the AFC Champions League and domestic competitions in China, Japan and South Korea are all on hold.
Some World Cup qualifying games, though, will go ahead during the upcoming international windows, when dozens of fixtures were planned across the Middle East and Asia.
The women's Olympic qualifying playoff between China and South Korea has been moved to June 1 and 9, while the AFC Futsal Championship in Turkmenistan has been postponed to August, the statement added.
""FIFA and the AFC will continue to assess the situation in relation to COVID-19 and will decide whether further changes to the schedule of Asian FIFA World Cup 2022 qualifiers are required,"" read the FIFA statement.
Philippines has 33 confirmed coronavirus cases as of Tuesday afternoon, while the global death toll passes 4,000.  – with reports from Agence France-Presse/Rappler.com

CEBU, Philippines – Starting Wednesday, March 11, the Cebu provincial government will require travellers coming Iran and Italy to undergo a mandatory fourteen-day quarantine if they want to enter the province. 
Governor Gwendolyn Garcia announced the latest health order Monday, March 9, during a meeting with Capitol reporters.
""The Bureau of Quarantine, the Bureau of Immigration, the Department of Health agree with me and so I shall be issuing that Executive Order today,"" she said.
She said her EO was effective two days later to spare incoming passengers from both countries who were in their flights going here.
Cebu province's mandatory quarantine imposition is on top of the DOH directive of implementing the same 14-day quarantine on all Filipinos coming from China, and those who arrived from Japan after their quarantine on the cruise ship Diamond Princess.
Garcia justified Cebu's stricter rules after noting the large number of COVID-19 cases from Iran and Italy.
 
Italy has recorded 7375 COVID-19 cases with 463 deaths on Monday. While in Iran has had 6566 cases with 237 deaths, also on Monday.
Garcia's order gives incoming travellers who have been to Iran and Italy in the past 15 days two options – undergo a mandatory quarantine or go back from their country of origin.
""This is the additional quarantine that I believe is within my authority to declare for those that may have visited Italy and Iran,"" she said.
The Provincial Inter-agency Task Force on COVID-19 convened in the Capitol to the impact of  President Rodrigo Duterte's declaration of a national public health emergency.
Present in the meeting were Governor Gwendolyn Garcia, Dr. Jaime Bernadas Department of Health Central Visayas Regional Director; Terence Bermejo, Bureau of Quarantine (BOQ)- Cebu Head; Dr. Christina Giango, Provincial Health Officer; members of the Philippine National Police (PNP); representatives from the airport and Bureau of Immigration (BOI).

MANILA, Philippines – No more holy water by the church entrance. Communion should be received by the hand. Instead of the traditional pagmamano, a bow with a smile will do.
The Archdiocese of Manila, the most influential Catholic territory in the Philippines, released a list of precautionary measures for churches and church-run institutions against the novel coronavirus disease called COVID-19.
The list was contained in a pastoral letter dated Monday, March 9, signed by Bishop Broderick Pabillo, temporary head of the archdiocese while Pope Francis is yet to pick the replacement of Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle, who now heads a powerful Vatican office.
Strictly speaking, these precautionary measures apply only to the Archdiocese of Manila's jurisdiction: the cities of Manila, Makati, Pasay, San Juan, and Mandaluyong. Bishops of other places act on their own and report directly to the Pope. The Archdiocese of Manila is, however, traditionally considered the first among equals in the Philippine Catholic Church, and its actions can influence other Catholic territories across the country.
Here are the Archdiocese of Manila's 12 precautionary measures against the coronavirus, quoted verbatim from Pabillo’s pastoral letter:
1. Suspend the practice of dipping of hands in the holy water font or stoup. Empty all fonts and let the faithful be informed that such practice will be temporarily suspended. Holy water can be made available for people to take home or sprinkling of the holy water can be done before or after liturgical gatherings.
2. Let containers of 70% ethyl alcohol be located at various entrance doors accessible to the public in our church institutions.
3. Advise the faithful to stay home when they are sick with flu-like symptoms and cough. They should get medical attention for their good and the good of their family members. Signages may be posted to this effect in prominent places. They can sanctify the Lord’s Day by praying in their homes and reading the Scriptures. TV Masses are available for them to watch at the Quiapo Church Facebook and website as well as TV Maria. Radio Veritas also airs Masses regularly and other parishes have their own video streaming facilities. Priests and lay ministers who have flu-like symptoms should also refrain from serving. This is an act of charity that we can offer to the people.
4. Routinely clean with disinfectants the high-touch areas, pews, benches, and door knobs, as well as microphone covers.
5. All should take care to observe cough etiquette (like covering their mouth with their sleeves or napkins which they should immediately dispose in safe places). Frequent hand washing is to be promoted to all.
6. Remind all that we need not hold hands when praying the Lord’s Prayer and when giving the sign of peace. For the time being, the beautiful Filipino sign of reverence in holding the hands of the priests and the elderly (the “mano po”) can be substituted by a slight bow with a smile or by a slight touch on the head for the giving of the blessing.
7. Until the virus is overcome all should refrain from the kissing and holding of statues and sacred images, and even the glass frames that protect them. Let barriers be installed so that people do not get near them to touch them.
8. Let ministers and priests thoroughly wash their hands before they serve. For the time being, holy communion is to be received by the faithful by hand.
9. Those parishioners who are weak or have non-communicable diseases like diabetes, cancer, etc. are encouraged to wear masks even during Holy Mass.
10. Churches and adoration chapels with air-conditioning and hardly any windows should be biomisted. Air purifier perhaps may be of help but it will be very expensive and there is no clear evidence of its effectiveness in large areas like churches. Open windows and doors after Mass and shut off the air conditioning in order for the air, heat and sunlight to circulate.
11. The World Health Organization (WHO) confirms that the coronavirus may spread through money. Those who count the money must wear mask and use alcohol after counting. It is good that they be provided with latex gloves.
12. Let the parishes be prepared for the economic effects of the COVID-19 phenomenon. Worst case scenario would be the suspension of public gatherings. We need to save at this time of impending crisis. Let us make our church institutions resilient. At this time, let expenses be made only in what is essential in order to save for any eventualities. Let us suspend purchases on capital expenditures and make our programs frugal. What we can save, let us put in a disaster resiliency fund. In this way, in case we have no collections, we may sustain the salaries of our employees maintain our religious institutions.
State of public health emergency
The Archdiocese of Manila released these guidelines as the Philippine government is under a state of public health emergency due to the coronavirus. The Philippine Department of Health said there are at least 33 novel coronavirus cases in the Philippines, including one death, as of Tuesday, March 10. Around the world, COVID-19 has affected at least 109,577 people and killed 3,809 as of Monday.
Pabillo said: “I encourage all to intensify our prayers to ask for Divine protection and intervention. Faith can avert evil. While we pray, let us also exercise good stewardship over our health. In the spirit of Lent let us keep a healthy lifestyle so that our bodies may be strong enough to resist infections. Thus eat healthy food, have enough rest, keep clean, get enough exercise, and avoid unnecessary travels and gatherings of large crowds.”
These guidelines show how the coronavirus has changed even the way people around the world practice their faith. Many of these measures, such as the advisory to receive communion by the hand and not by the mouth, have attracted theological debates, but church leaders defend these measures as necessary to contain COVID-19.
Pope Francis himself on Sunday, March 8, started delivering his weekly Angelus prayer via livestream, not in person, to avoid the spread of the virus. The Vatican also started livestreaming his daily Masses at his residence. (READ: 'Caged' Pope Francis receives guests – from afar)
Other religious groups around the world have implemented their own precautionary measures. 
In Singapore, the Catholic Church suspended public Masses from February 15 to March 13 as they installed thermal scanners and organized contact tracing methods for parishioners. Public Masses in other affected countries, such as Italy, however remain suspended.
The Islamic community in Singapore also implemented its own rules, including an advisory against shaking hands in prayer services.
Like ""communion by the hand"" advisory for Catholics, the guideline against shaking hands for Singapore's Muslim community also drew controversy, as critics said it goes against the teaching of the Prophet Muhammad. Muslim leaders however stood by this reminder, as the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore said it's not enough to trust in God without humans doing their part. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – If the novel coronavirus continues to spread in Metro Manila, the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) may cancel its first ever Metro Manila Summer Film Festival (MMSFF) from April 11 to 21.
MMDA General Manager Jojo Garcia told reporters on Tuesday, March 10, that canceling the film festival was a possibility when he was asked about the impact of the rising cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new virus, in Metro Manila. 
""It depends, but we are looking at that direction if there are still cases. It will gather a lot of people, and that's what we are trying to avoid,"" Garcia said, referring to the crowds who are expected to flock to the theaters to watch the film fest entries.
The MMSFF is the first summer film festival in Metro Manila and the Philippines, which is organized by the MMDA and the Cinema Exhibitors Association of the Philippines.
It is a spinoff to the Christmas-season Metro Manila Film Festival (MMFF), which attracts hundreds of thousands of movie goers. In 2020, the MMFF raked in P955 million.
Like the original MMFF, the MMSFF has a parade of stars planned to promote the films.

MANILA, Philippines – At least 6 Filipinos onboard a luxury cruise ship now docked in Oakland, California, tested positive for the novel coronavirus, a Department of Health (DOH) official said on Tuesday, March 10.
Joel Buenaventura, chief health program officer of the DOH's Migrant Health Unit, confirmed this development in a House of Representatives committee hearing.
Buenaventura said the confirmation was based on a report from the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
It is not yet clear if the 6 infected Filipinos are all crew members, or if some are passengers.
The Department of Foreign Affairs earlier said there are 518 Filipino crew members aboard the Grand Princess, while there was no confirmation yet if there are Filipino passengers.
What happened to the cruise ship? The Grand Princess, carrying some 3,533 passengers and crew, had been stranded off the coast of San Francisco since Wednesday, March 4, after two people who had been on the ship during its previous voyage contracted the virus. One later died.
Health authorities sounded the alarm after several passengers who were on the Grand Princess' earlier voyage and remained on the cruise ship for its next stop to Hawaii developed flu-like symptoms.
The United States started testing people onboard the ship last Thursday, March 5, with passengers confined to their cabins to help quell the spread of the virus.
US Vice President Mike Pence earlier announced that as of Saturday, March 7, 21 people out of the 45 tested were found to have the coronavirus disease called COVID-19. They consisted of 19 crew members and 2 American passengers.
The ship finally docked at the port in Oakland on Monday, March 9, and the first passengers started disembarking.
The Grand Princess is operated by Princess Cruises, the same company that runs the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which was quarantined in the port of Yokohama, Japan, last February.
The company as well as Japanese health authorities were widely criticized for their handling of cases after more than 700 people, including 80 Filipino crew members, tested positive for COVID-19. – with reports from Agence France-Presse/Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – The first Filipino coronavirus patient in Hong Kong has recovered and was discharged from the hospital, the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) announced on Tuesday, March 10. 
The DFA confirmed the Filipino, identified as Hong Kong’s 61st case, left the hospital on Friday, March 6, some two weeks after she tested positive for the novel coronavirus disease called COVID-19. 
The Filipino, who remains anonymous, is a 32-year-old domestic worker who contracted the virus after taking care of her employer, a 67-year-old woman who tested positive for virus. 
As for the other 3 Filipinos in Hong Kong infected with the virus, DFA said all patients were still confined in the hospital. 
Like the first coronavirus case, other Filipinos contracted the disease from their employers. 
The DFA gave assurances the Philippine consulate was closely monitoring affected Filipinos and would provide assistance as needed.  
At least 91 Filipinos outside the Philippines have contracted the virus since the outbreak began. This included the 4 cases in Hong Kong, 80 from a cruise ship docked in Japan, 3 in Singapore, 2 in the United Arab Emirates, and 2 in Lebanon. 
 As of Tuesday, the Philippines has recorded 24 confirmed cases of coronavirus. The confirmed cases included two patients who were in “very critical condition” and the first death outside China – a Chinese tourist from Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak. 
Worldwide, the death toll has exceeded 3,800, while more than 111,000 people have been infected in over 100 countries. – Rappler.com

MANILA, Philippines – The 86-year-old American COVID-19 patient in the Philippines is in “critical” condition, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said on Tuesday, March 10.
Duque relayed the condition of the patient – who had a history of travel to the United States and South Korea prior to his arrival in the country – in a chance interview at the Batasang Pambansa on Tuesday, when he was asked for an update about the 24 who tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.
He said that the 62-year-old Filipino man, the first case of local transmission in the Philippines,  was still in critical condition and was intubated.
""'Yung isa naman is the [86]-year-old American. Critical, critical [‘yong sitwasyon nila] (The other is the 86-year-old American. Their situation is critical),"" Duque said.
The 86-year-old American has preexisting hypertension. He had a history of travel to the US and South Korea, where more than 700 and 7,400 people, respectively, tested positive.
The American was admitted in the Medical City-Ortigas in Pasig City, while the 62-year-old Filipino was under observation at the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM)
The 62-year-old Filipino patient had been in a “very critical” condition since Saturday, March 7. He has preexisting hypertension and diabetes. 
On Tuesday, Duque was in the House of Representatives to attend the hearing of the committee on appropriations, which approved the bill allocating a P1.6 billion supplemental budget for the agency’s anti-coronavirus efforts.  
This happened a day after President Rodrigo Duterte declared a state of public health emergency. Classes in Metro Manila were suspended from March 10 to 14.
The DOH has probed a total of 725 patients in the country for possible infection, but only 44 of them remain admitted in medical facilities nationwide. The other 657 have already been discharged. 
Outside the country, at least 91 Filipinos caught 2019-nCoV overseas, including Singapore, Hong Kong, United Arab Emirates, Lebanon, and the M/V Diamond Princess Cruise ship that had been docked in Yokohama, Japan. – Rappler.com  "

MANILA, Philippines – With transportation options usually bursting at the seams, how can commuters evade the coronavirus with the prescribed “social distancing”?
According to Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) Secretary Eduardo Año, they must at least wear face masks and use hand sanitizers.
“We really need preventive measures: to wear face masks, and to have hand sanitizers in place in entance and exits,” Año said in an interview with reporters on Tuesday, March 10, after a meeting with Metro Manila mayors convened as the Metro Manila Council.
Año said mayors would have to agree on how these would be implemented. He added that, if these measures will not suffice, local government units should resort to “special precautionary measures.” He did not elaborate.
On Tuesday morning, Año ordered Metro Manila local officials and cops to bar students from staying in public spaces. The night before, President Rodrigo Duterte ordered the suspension of classes in Metro Manila in all levels, both in public and private schools from March 10 to 14.
The virus has infected at least 24 people in the Philippines, and has placed hundreds more under investigation. The confirmed cases include one death – a Chinese tourist who came from Wuhan in China, the epicenter of the outbreak – the first fatality to be recorded outside of China.

MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – The House committee on appropriations approved reallocating P1.65 billion from the National Treasury to the Department of Health (DOH) to help combat the novel coronavirus outbreak.
Lawmakers unanimously passed the still-unnumbered bill giving additional funds to the DOH on Tuesday, March 10. 
The approved amount, however, is much less than the P3.1 billion the DOH needs to purchase surgical masks and personal protective equipment of some 5,000 health workers on the frontlines of the fight against 2019-nCoV. (READ: 'Coronavirus testing kits must be available in all hospitals' – Zubiri)
The two bills previously filed in the House of Representatives originally sought to give an additional P2 billion to the DOH for its campaign against COVID-19, the disease caused by 2019-nCoV. 
But the National Treasury said during the hearing that only P1.65 billion in excess funds are available to be realigned to the DOH. 
This means the health department will have to source the remaining supplemental funds from its own savings as well as contributions from Pagcor and PCSO. 
Duque told reporters after the hearing that Pagcor has committed to give P2 billion while the PCSO will be providing DOH with P420 million. 
""Okay naman 'yon, dahil karagdagan 'yan, dahil mayroon namang P2 billion na commitment ang (That's okay because those are additional funds on top of the P2 billion committed by) Pagcor. So, so far, that will satisfy our requirement for the personal protective equipment, about P2.25 billion thereabouts. So the other needs, which some congressmen have manifested to take a look at the inventory of respiratories, so hopefully it's enough,"" Duque said
""But if it's not, then the P1.6 billion may be used for procurement,"" he added.
The committee approved the supplemental budget despite being informed by House committee on health chair Angelina Tan that President Rodrigo Duterte refuses to certify the bill as urgent for now. This means the supplemental budget may not be approved this week, as the 18th Congress only has two session days left before it takes a two-month break starting Saturday, March 14.

MANILA, Philippines – The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the use of COVID-19 test kits developed by University of the Philippines (UP) scientists.
The FDA said on Tuesday, March 10, that it issued a Certificate of Exemption for the SARS CoV-2 PCR Detection Kit of the University of the Philippines-National Institute of Health (UP-NIH).
The kit, funded by the Department of Science and Technology, will be used for field testing coupled with gene sequencing at the Philippine Genome Center, the FDA said in a statement.
Heath Undersecretary Eric Domingo, FDA chief, said that the use of the locally-developed test kits would help address the ""increasing number of reported COVID-19 cases"" that ""require immediate diagnosis and monitoring.""
“This will provide our laboratories with technological reinforcement to accommodate the growing number of patients to be tested and aid in early screening of positive cases. Furthermore, this will provide greater access to a less costly diagnostic procedure,” Domingo added.
The FDA said the locally-developed kits supports the Code Red status raised by the Department of Health, and the recent declaration of a state of public health emergency in the country over the threat of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. 
The FDA approved the use of the test kits more than a month after UP-NIH scientists announced the development of the test kit that would help the DOH confirm more COVID-19 cases in the country. 
The total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the Philippines was at 24 as of Monday night, March 9. Of this number, one died – a Chinese tourist who came from Wuhan, China – the first death outside China. – Rappler.com

MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – Students in Metro Manila will be sent home if they are spotted in public spaces to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus, the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) announced on Tuesday, March 10.
“The President has directed all local officials in NCR (National Capital Region) from mayor down to Punong Barangays (village captains) as well as all units of the Philippine National Police to ensure that no children are seen loitering around and, if they are seen, they are to be immediately sent home to do their homework,” said Interior Secretary Eduardo Año.

The DILG has not set a definite period for the implementation of the order.
These places include the following:

Movie houses
Malls
Public markets
Other crowded places

The virus spreads from person to person through sneeze or cough droplets in close contact. As it is a new virus, scientists are still studying how easy the virus spreads.
Other measures: On Monday evening, President Rodrigo Duterte ordered the suspension of classes in Metro Manila in all levels, both in public and private schools from March 10 to 14 also in a bid to prevent any transmission of the virus.
Malacañang issued the directives as the Philippines races to stem the spread of the new virus, which has so far infected at least 24 people, and has placed hundreds more under investigation. The confirmed cases include one death – a Chinese tourist who came from Wuhan in China, the epicenter of the outbreak – the first fatality to be recorded outside of China.
Worldwide, the death toll has exceeded 3,800, while more than 109,000 people have been infected in over 100 countries.
How it will be enforced: The government is counting on cops and barangay officials to send the students home. Año also emphasized the role of parents in helping enforce the order, as they can  keep their kids inside their homes.
""We have no choice but to undertake these measures because public health demands it. Together with sustained hygiene, suspensions of classes and mass gathering will enable us to defeat this virus faster,"" Año added.
Under Section 6 Article III of the Constitution, the government has the power to limit the right of people to travel if it is ""in the interest of national security, public safety, or public health, as may be provided by law."" – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – President Rodrigo Duterte on Monday night, March 9, rejected calls to place Metro Manila on lockdown after health officials recorded a spike in novel coronavirus cases. 
In a late night press conference, Duterte said it was still ""too early"" to implement the sweeping restrictions that would limit people's movements. 
""We have not reached that kind of contamination,"" Duterte said in a late night press conference.
Duterte stressed the need to strike a ""balance"" in response measures to combat the coronavirus crisis as this could affect the transport of and access to necessities like rice and oil. 
Duterte earlier declared a state of public health emergency due to concerns over the virus, which has infected at least 24 people in the Philippines.  
Calls for a lockdown covering the National Capital Region echo China’s and Italy’s unprecedented decision to shutdown large parts of their territory in an effort to quell the spread of the virus. 
China and Italy are among the countries with the highest number of confirmed cases and deaths due to COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. 
For one, China – ground zero for the coronavirus – has the largest number of cases with over 80,000 infected so far. Italy is likewise the country with the third largest number of cases as it recorded over 7,400 who tested positive for the virus.

MANILA, Philippines – Senators on Monday, March 9, expressed dismay over the low number of available novel coronavirus testing kits, with Senate Majority Leader Juan Miguel pointing out that kits must be available in ""all hospitals.""
In a privilege speech on Monday, Zubiri cited a post from social platform Reddit where an unknown user said that a woman was denied testing at a hospital in Bonifacio Global City for not having a history of travel outside the Philippines nor close contact with a confirmed case.
""They should now allow all facilities, both private and public, to utilize and prepare and ready for such an outbreak. The key here is allowing DOH to make testing kits available at all hospitals,"" Zubiri said, as the number of patients with coronavirus disease (Covid-19) spiked to 20.
""So anyone with coughs or colds will be tested. I don't think this is excessive, Mr President. Let's not be complacent. Imagine the superpowers…if they cannot control it, what more we?"" the majority leader added.
So far, the Research Institute on Tropical Medicine (RITM) is the Philippines' sole laboratory accredited by the World Health Organization (WHO) to test novel coronavirus samples.
At the Senate hearing on the economic impact of the virus, Rosanna Ditangco of the RITM said that there are only 2,000 kits available stock on hand.
Because of the limited testing kit supplies, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III on Monday acknowledged that there is a possibility of underreporting, although not intentionally.
""As soon as we get more, then we will be able to expand the coverage of who will be tested. Kasi ngayon ang tinitingnan natin ‘yong mga may sintomas, (Now, we are just looking at those who have the symptoms). Later on, we will do a calibrated approach in expanding who should be prioritized,"" Duque said in a media briefing.
On Monday, the Senate adopted an unnumbered resolution urging the government to release all available funds, including those in the 2019 national budget, as part of an ""economic stimulus"" package to counter the effects of COVID-19.
'Alarming'
At Monday's Senate hearing, the Department of Health's (DOH's) Alethea de Guzman said that there will be some 4,500 extraction kits from the WHO that would be ""good for 2,000 individuals."" Extraction kits are used to check whether the virus is present in an individual.
Senator Nancy Binay chided DOH for the low supply of testing kits in a Senate hearing.
""I don't want to panic but you're making me panic,"" Binay said, referring to Duque's earlier remarks about local transmission being just a question of ""when.""
""Then maririnig namin sa inyo na we only have 2,000 testing kits out of our 100 million population. Hindi ba nakakatakot?"" Binay asked. (Then we hear from you that we only have 2,000 testing kits out of our 100 million population. Isn't this scary?)
De Guzman said that this is exactly the reason why DOH is requesting for a supplemental budget of at least P43 million, but she did not expound on whether it would be used to buy additional testing kits.
Binay said in response: ""Kung 'di tayo nagte-test, hindi natin malalaman."" (If we don't test, then we won't know if there are new cases.) 
In total, Duque had asked for P2 billion for the procurement of protective gear for health workers and another P10 million for face masks in the country. 
Senator Imee Marcos, at a media interview, expressed frustration over DOH, saying that the embattled department has a lot of issues to deal with, yet it has failed to procure testing kits now that they are needed.
""Asan ba ang listahan na paggagamitan na naman ng P2 billion na 'yan? 'Yung P43 million wala raw testing kit ni isa kaya nasa 2,000 na lang sila.… Ano bang mas urgent kaysa sa testing kit? Pambihira naman sila,"" Marcos said.
(Where is the list of items where the P2 billion will be used? I was told that the P43 million will not be used for testing kits but they only have 2,000 in stock. What is more urgent than testing kits? What a shame.)
Marcos added that the department should submit the breakdown of their supplemental budget request so that Congress can act on it.

MANILA, Philippines – Labor group Trade Union Congress of the Philippines (TUCP) on Monday, March 9, urged employers to refrain from using the novel coronavirus outbreak as an ""excuse"" to fire workers.
TUCP made the call over growing fears of ""massive unemployment"" spurred by the rising number of coronavirus cases in the Philippines.
The group appealed to the government for support, particularly for workers who are forced to stay at home or have difficulty going to work.
""Layoffs should be the last option in all of this,"" TUCP spokesperson Alan Tanjusay told reporters in a press conference on Monday.
TUCP earlier estimated some 7,000 layoffs could take place in the next 6 months as the coronavirus crisis deepens. It made the forecast after Philippine Airlines terminated 300 employees, citing losses incurred because of canceled flights due to travel bans, which have severely impacted businesses.
The group said other industries may follow suit and lay off non-essential workers. In particular, it expressed concern for workers in the manufacturing sector, which often observes a ""no work, no pay"" policy.
Aside from manufacturing, TUCP warned that the country's agriculture and logistics sectors may also be hit hard as exports could decrease following the rise in coronavirus cases in the Philippines. (READ: 'A mess': Coronavirus economic impact on Philippines worse than projected)
""Let's hope these are not self-fulfilling numbers.... If you expose workers to wage loss, they will be at the mercy of COVID-19 and poverty,"" Tanjusay said.
He added that while TUCP has not yet received reports of layoffs, some workers reported they were made to observe flexible work arrangements.
What DOLE, employers can do: TUCP urged the labor department to convene all national and regional industry tripartite councils to conduct rapid assessments and risk analyses, as well as craft guidelines to help workers cope.
Tripartite councils – composed of employers, workers, and labor officials – should immediately meet, TUCP said, as they are most familiar with problems faced by businesses and workers, and can come up with preventive measures to save jobs. (READ: Cebu Pacific execs take pay cut to save jobs as coronavirus hurts profits)
Aside from this, TUCP appealed to employers to provide free protective equipment like masks and alcohol for workers in frontline services, such as retail and fast-food chains. The group also advised employers to continuously sanitize business premises.
As of Monday, the Philippines has recorded 20 confirmed coronavirus cases. These include one death – a Chinese tourist – which was the first fatality to be recorded outside of China.

MANILA, Philippines – Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said that despite the rise of novel coronavirus in the country, it is still safe for the public to visit hospitals if they need to see a doctor.  
In a press briefing on Monday, March 9, Duque said that hospitals nationwide ""have infection prevention and control practices in place.""
“We would like to take this opportunity to reassure the public that our hospitals have infection prevention and control practices in place so there is no need to avoid going to these hospitals, especially if you feel unwell,” the Department of Health (DOH) chief said. 
Duque advised those who have gone to places often visited by the 20 confirmed cases of COVID-19 – the disease caused by 2019-nCoV – not to panic. Rather, they should monitor themselves first for possible signs and symptoms of the virus.  
“Let me clarify that all others who have visited places frequented by confirmed cases of COVID-19 are not required to seek medical consultation and subject themselves to COVID-19 laboratory testing. They are advised to self-monitor and if with symptoms, consult health centers or rural health units for appropriate management and monitoring,” Duque said.  
President Rodrigo Duterte already declared a state of public health emergency which paves the way for a more efficient government response to contain the spread of 2019-nCoV.
The DOH, however, has been drawing flak for being too slow to disclose information about patients who tested positive for COVID-19, including the places they frequented and the location of the hospitals they were admitted to.
Duque announced on Monday that the DOH will now be publicizing hospital names “to combat unverified or fake news.” 
Still, the DOH will only test patients already showing respiratory symptoms and who have either traveled to countries with recorded cases of the coronavirus or were exposed to those who already have COVID-19. 
The Philippines now has a total of 20 confirmed cases after the DOH reported that 10 additional patients – all of whom are Filipinos – tested positive for 2019-nCoV. They are all admitted in various hospitals across Metro Manila. (READ: Makati, Pasig, Quezon City take precautions vs novel coronavirus) 
Stay home if showing symptoms
World Health Organization (WHO) Country Representative to the Philippines Dr Rabindra Abeyasinghe also advised people already experiencing respiratory symptoms to stay home, even if they likely do not have COVID-19.  
“We want to reiterate again for people having respiratory signs and symptoms to practice social distancing. Do not go to work, do not go to school, do not go to crowded places if you are having signs of respiratory infection. This may not be largely COVID-19 but it is rational to follow the advise in view of the fact that we are having localized transmission,” Abeyasinghe said during the press conference. 
He said that doing so would help protect the elderly, especially those with pre-existing medical conditions. 
""We recognize the vulnerability of the elderly population in this scenario and we encourage especially those groups to refrain from going to crowded places as much as possible and to ensure that they protect themselves. For this, we need a community-wide reponse. Family members need to support the eldelrly to protect them and minimize their risk of infection,"" Abeyasinghe said.
Worldwide, 2019-nCoV has infected more than 111,200 people and killed over 3,800, majority of whom are from Hubei, China, the epicenter of the outbreak. But more than half or over 62,300 people have already recovered from COVID-19 across the world. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – The Department of Health (DOH) on Monday, March 9, said that isolation hospitals in the Philippines have enough bed capacities for cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. 
“Actually, pinagplanuhan at pinaghanda [natin] ating mga ospital, especially our government hospitals, for these isolation rooms in case that surge capacity ang ating ipapatupad, where 'yung kanilang original bed capacity ay ma-e-exceed nung ating sitwasyon ngayon. So meron ho tao sa ngayon existing. It is enough,” DOH Assistant Secretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said. 
(Actually, we have planned this out and we made sure that our hospitals, especially our government hospitals, have prepared isolation rooms in case we need to implement the surge capacity, where their original bed capacities exceed the needs for the current situation. We have existing [resources]. They are enough.)
Vergiere said the DOH was now changing its quarantine strategy for persons under investigation (PUI). According to her, the DOH was “transitioning to having home quarantine for individuals” with mild cases so hospitals would not be packed with patients. 
“So sa ngayon, 'yon pong ating nakikita na mga tao na mag-e-exhibit ng sintomas, may history of known exposure or history of travel to [countries] with local transmission, ay ina-advise natin ng home quarantine kung mild lang naman po ang sintomas,” said Vergeire. 
(As of now, for those individuals who exhibit symptoms, and have history of known exposure or history of travel to other countries with local transmission, we advise them to do home quarantine if they experience only mild symptoms.)
Vergeire said the quarantine facilities like the one at the New Clark City would not be utilized as much as before now that the DOH’s strategy would start focusing on “early detection, isolation, and management of cases because of our high alert level this time.”
However, if the case is severe, that will be the time the patient will be brought to a referral hospital, said Vergeire. 
On Monday, the DOH confirmed 10 new cases of COVID-19, bringing the total number of cases in the country to 20. This was less than a day after the health department announced 4 new confirmed cases of the disease across 4 cities in Metro Manila late Sunday night, March 8. 
In a press conference last week, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said that the DOH budget of P530 million to help contain the spread of virus would be enough for now while waiting for Congress' approval of the department's proposed P2-billion supplemental budget.
Duque also said the Philippine government was working to have 4 more laboratories across the country accredited by the World Health Organization (WHO) as official testing centers for the coronavirus.

Since the outbreak began, at least 91 Filipinos outside the Philippines have contracted the virus. These include 80 from a cruise ship docked in Japan, 3 in Singapore, 4 in Hong Kong, 2 in the United Arab Emirates, and 2 in Lebanon.
But 40 from the cruise ship, 1 in Singapore, and 2 in Hong Kong have since recovered, leaving 48 still infected as of Monday.
The World Health Organization raised its global risk assessment of the virus to the maximum level. It earlier declared the outbreak an international emergency.
The global death toll has reached 3,819, with 3,119 of the fatalities in China. The number of cases worldwide has risen to 109,946, with 80,735 of the infections in China. The virus has spread to at least 99 countries. – with reports from Agence France-Presse/Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – The Philippines now has a total of 20 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus, after the Department of Health (DOH) reported 10 additional patients who tested positive on Monday, March 9.
This was announced by DOH Assistant Secretary Maria Rosario Vergeire in a press conference on Monday, less than a day after the health department confirmed 4 patients across 4 cities in Metro Manila caught COVID-2019, the disease caused by the virus.  
“The Department of Health reported 10 new confirmed cases of the coronavirus disease 2019 or COVID-19, on top of the 4 new cases announced yesterday, March 8, 2020. This brings the total number of confirmed cases in the country to 20,” Vergeire said. 
All of the new coronavirus patients are Filipinos, at least 3 of whom had not traveled outside the Philippines:

Patient 11: 72-year-old male with no history of travel outside the Philippines
Patient 12: 56-year-old male who traveled to the United Arab Emirates
Patient 13: 34-year-old male who traveled to Australia
Patient 14: 46-year-old male with no travel history outside the Philippines
Patient 15: 24-year-old male, travel history still to be determined
Patient 16: 70-year-old male who got exposed to a COVID-19 case
Patient 17: 69-year-old female who got exposed to a COVID-19 case
Patient 18: 41-year-old male who traveled to Taiwan
Patient 19: 46-year-old female with no travel history outside the Philippines
Patient 20: 48-year-old male who traveled to Japan

They are all admitted to hospitals across Metro Manila. Patient 11 is currently at The Medical Center in Pasig City, while Patients 12 to 15 are admitted to the Makati Medical Center in Makati City.
The 16th and 17th positive cases, meanwhile, are under the care of the UniHealth Parañaque Hospital in Parañaque City, while Patients 18 and 19 are under observation at the Tricity Medical Center in Pasig.
Only the 20th case, the 48-year-old male with travel history to Japan, has been referred to the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM).
Vergeire said samples were taken from the 10 new cases between Friday, March 6, to Sunday, March 8, and the results were released only on Monday. The Research Institute for Tropical Medicine, the DOH’s research arm, is the Philippines' sole laboratory accredited by the WHO that can test novel coronavirus samples.  
Vergeire said the huge jump in the positive cases was supposedly due to the “heightened surveillance” efforts of the DOH. The government is now coordinating with local government units to trace all individuals with whom the 10 patients have made contact. 
The DOH has been drawing flak for being too slow in disclosing important information about the patients who tested positive in the country, with local government units and even companies where the positive cases have been employed announcing ahead of the government.  
DOH said it will only test patients already showing respiratory symptoms and who have either traveled to countries with recorded cases, or who have been exposed to those who tested positive for the virus.  
“DOH urges all individuals who will be [contacted] by surveillance teams to fully cooperate in the investigation and contact-tracing activities. Individuals with history of known exposure to a positive patient and/or history of travel to areas with local transmission, with mild symptoms such as fever, dry cough, fatigue, productive phlegm, sore throat, [and] headache are advised to self-isolate and be home quarantined for 14 days,” Vergeire said.  
Vergeire said patients presenting “severe and critical symptoms” are the ones who need to be immediately admitted to a health facility. 
Of the 20 confirmed cases, the country has recorded one death: a 44-year-old man who traveled to the Philippines from Wuhan, China – the epicenter of the worldwide outbreak. It was the first coronavirus-related death recorded outside China. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – The spread of the novel coronavirus pushed Philippine shares off a cliff, suffering their steepest one-day percentage drop since the 2008 global financial crisis.
On Monday, March 9, the Philippine Stock Exchange index (PSEi) plunged 6.8% and closed at 6,312.61. This is also the biggest one-day point drop since August 2015 and the lowest close since January 2016.
""The main culprit for the major sell-off is the mounting COVID-19 infections in the Philippines.... Worries have escalated on the negative economic impact of the epidemic from tourism, to foreign trade and investments, to supply chains, to possible work suspensions, to consumption, and ultimately, to the laborers who will be the No. 1 victims once the spread worsens,"" said Japhet Tantiangco of Philstocks.
A total of 204 companies suffered losses on Monday, while only 30 companies advanced and 23 remained unchanged.
The most actively traded stocks were in the red. Ayala Land (down 4.7%), Ayala Corporation (down 6.4%), SM Prime (down 6.4%), BDO (down 7.4%), and SM Investments (down 4.3%) all lost value on the first trading day of the week.
The government's economic team has already projected that they are likely to miss their economic growth target in 2020 due to the virus. – Rappler.com "

AKLAN, Philippines – Businesses in Boracay have slashed prices by as much as 50%, just to stay open and attract local tourists as the novel coronavirus spooks the foreign market.
One can now enjoy a sumptuous buffet under P300. Some luxury hotels offer rooms for as low as P3,800 a night (before taxes) from the normal rate of P8,000 to P10,000.
Boracay is now hoping for a surge in local tourists to offset losses from the decline in foreign visitors.
Total tourists in January dwindled by 40% from 172,695 visitors to just 103,834, according to the Malay Municipal Tourism Office.
Bulk of the tourists that visit Boracay are from China. With the travel ban in place, businesses relying mostly on the Chinese market have shut down.
Domestic boost
Domestic tourists increased by 6% to 117,359 in the first two months of 2020. However, this rate is still not enough to keep businesses open.
While prices have gone down, businesses are relying on volume just to break even. So far, the strategy has not worked.
""It's probably the most empty I've seen in almost 20 years of coming to the island,"" said Nowie Potenciano, a local business owner.
He has already closed one restaurant and moved the staff there to his 5 other shops that are struggling to remain open.
""We've heard businesses ask their staff to go on leave for a large amount of time. And when they come back, they don't have long duty days either,"" Potenciano said.
""We're lucky that we haven't reached that point yet. But at the rate that it has been going down, the situation is not looking good,"" he added.

Health Secretary Francisco Duque III clarified on Monday, March 9, that prior to the Philippines declaring local transmission of the virus, it was alright to visit crowded places like malls and hotels, as long as precautionary measures are in place.
He said establishments should have sufficient disinfectants and thermal machines at entry points.
However, government agencies will have to further refine their messaging and protocols now, as local transmission has been confirmed.

MANILA, Philippines – Aviation officials announced on Monday, March 9, that payment of charges for takeoff, landing, and parking will be deferred for local airlines, as the novel coronavirus cripples the industry.
In a press briefing on Monday, Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines Director General Jim Sydiongco said the payment will be deferred for one year.
""We have considered the deferring [of] payment [for] landing and parking while the impact of COVID-19 is present, or even up to a year. Deferment or payable after one year,"" Sydiongco said, referring to the disease caused by the virus.
""Our timeline is, we look at it up to a point of a year of deferment, and payment after one year,"" he added.
Manila International Airport Authority General Manager Ed Monreal clarified that the announcement does not mean waiver of fees. Guidelines will be released on the matter.
Monreal added that recovery is seen to slowly build up after the COVID-19 threat wanes.
""Kahit naman wala nang COVID-19, siyempre ang confidence kasi ng traveling public will still slowly go back. So kailangan natin tantiyahin kung kailan babalik at kailan katagal,"" he said.
(Even if the threat of COVID-19 is no longer there, of course the confidence of the traveling public will still slowly go back. So we need to consider when the demand will go up and when.)
The move would cause at least P58 million worth of deferred payments to the government per month, solely coming from the main gateway, the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA).
""We're seeing around P58 million a month in terms of expenses that cover takeoff and landing, parking, and tracking fees here in NAIA,"" Monreal said.
Despite that, Monreal explained that airports will be able to survive the deferment of fees, as it only covers local airlines.
""Meron po kaming recovery fund so we can still survive. Kasi 'di naman lahat, so we're just deferring payments for landing, takeoff, and parking. Mga terminal fee, babayad pa rin sila. So may portion pa rin to keep us afloat,"" he said.
(We still have a recovery fund so we can still survive. The deferment isn't for everything, just deferring payments for landing, takeoff, and parking. Terminal fees will still be paid. So there's still a portion that will keep us afloat.)
Sydiongco said regional airports have suffered from a 20% to 30% decrease in passengers, while Monreal said NAIA has seen around a 30% drop in passengers or about 476,000 passengers, mostly foreigners.
Monreal hopes local carriers will use their aircraft slots to boost local tourism.
The airline industry has taken a huge hit because of the virus, with flag carrier Philippine Airlines terminating some 300 employees due to losses.
As of Monday, the Philippines has had 10 confirmed cases of the virus. Of the total, 7 are confined, 2 have recovered, while a Chinese tourist died.

In various public addresses, Duterte, who is 74-years-old, claimed he suffered from a slew of medical conditions that include myasthenia gravis, Buerger's disease, Barrett's esophagus, and ""spinal issues,"" among others. In October 2018, Duterte also said he tested for cancer but that it came back negative.
Experts earlier said that older adults with preexisting health conditions were more vulnerable to the coronavirus, particularly those aged over 60-years-old.
The Philippines has so far recorded 10 confirmed cases of coronavirus, including the first death outside of China. Of the remaining 9, two have since recovered and left the country, while the others were being treated.
One patient, a 62-year-old man, was in ""very critical condition"" as of early Saturday morning, March 7, the DOH said. Having no recent history of travel, he is considered the first case of local transmission in the Philippines. 
Meanwhile, the health department said it has probed a total of 700 patients for possible infection, 48 of whom remain admitted in health facilities across the country while 646 have already been discharged.
Duterte has declared a state of public health emergency in the Philippines amid the rising number of cases.

MANILA, Philippines – The government of Cook Islands is prohibiting travelers from the Philippines and 13 other countries from entering its borders due to the outbreak of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. 
“We also have information that the Cook Islands has also restricted travel from certain COVID-affected countries,” said Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) Assistant Secretary Eduardo Meñez, in a press conference in Malacañang on Monday, March 9.
As he was speaking, the DFA official flashed a presentation listing Cook Islands among the foreign countries that have imposed travel restrictions on the Philippines. The others are Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Qatar.  
Apart from the Philippines, Cook Islands is also imposing a travel ban on passengers who have been to the following countries within the last 14 days:

China and its administrative regions Hong Kong and Macau
Taiwan
 Japan
Singapore
South Korea
Malaysia
Thailand
Indonesia
Vietnam
Cambodia
Laos
Italy
Iran

Cook Islands, an associate state of New Zealand, is a self-governed island country located in the South Pacific Ocean. 
In the same press conference, Meñez announced that two Filipinos tested positive for 2019-nCoV in Lebanon, increasing the total number of Filipinos who caught the virus outside the Philippines to 91.  
Locally, the Philippines has reported 10 positive cases so far, including 5 Filipinos, 3 Chinese, one Taiwanese, and one American. One of the 3 Chinese patients died, but the other two have already recovered from COVID-19.

ECONOMIC IMPACT. A shopper wears a mask at the Greenhills Shopping Center in San Juan City. Photo by Inoue Jaena/Rappler  
MANILA, Philippines – The novel coronavirus is seen to spoil the Philippines' economic growth rate in 2020, said Socioeconomic Planning Undersecretary Rosemarie Edillon, which would make the country miss its target.
Speaking at the Senate inquiry on the economic impact of the virus, Edillon said on Monday, March 9, that it may bring down the gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate to the range of 5.5% to 6.5% this year.
""Kung ang target natin (If our target) is 6.5% to 7.5%, then we're looking at 5.5% to 6.5% for the year,"" Edillon said.
Senator Imee Marcos, chairperson of the Senate committee on economic affairs, said the upper-range estimate of the government's economic team may not be feasible anymore.
""Wala na 'yung 6.5%, 5.9% sabihin na lang natin. 'Wag na tayo magtawaran sa numero, masakit sa bulsa 'yan,"" Marcos said.
(6.5% is unrealistic, let's just say 5.9%. Let's not bargain on the numbers, it will hurt our coffers.)
The economic team previously projected that growth would be slashed by 0.2% if the virus would not be contained within a quarter, and up to 0.4% if it drags on until the 1st half of the year.
If China continues to be crippled by the outbreak until June, the Philippine economic team estimates that around 30,000 to 50,000 jobs in manufacturing and tourism would be lost.
The Philippine economic team also expects around 1.42 million tourist arrivals lost, which would amount to foregone gross value added (GVA) of around P93 billion to P187 billion. GVA is the value of goods and services produced in a sector or municipality that contributes to the economy.
Besides that, Edillon said the country may face a wider fiscal deficit of 3.3% to 3.4% of GDP, or equivalent to around P680 billion, higher than the current cap of 3.2%. (READ: [ANALYSIS] How the budget deficit exploded under Duterte's watch)
The deficit ceiling was initially raised to 3% from the Aquino administration's 2%, when the Duterte administration pushed for infrastructure growth. The cap was later revised to 3.2% in 2019.
The Philippines has had 10 confirmed cases of the virus. Of the total, 7 are confined, 2 have recovered, while a Chinese tourist died.

MANILA, Phlippines (UPDATED) – President Rodrigo Duterte declared a state of public health emergency on Monday, March 9, after health officials recorded additional cases of the 2019 novel coronavirus, including the first case of local transmission in the Philippines.
In Proclamation No. 922 signed on Sunday, March 8, and released to media on Monday, Duterte ordered all government agencies and local government units to cooperate and mobilize necessary resources to combat the coronavirus.
Duterte's declaration was based on the recommendation of Health Secretary Francisco Duque III, who earlier raised the Philippines' coronavirus alert system to Code Red-Sublevel 1, due to the first case of local transmission.
Duque earlier said that a state of public health emergency ""will facilitate the mobilization of resources, ease processes including procurement of critical logistics and supplies, and intensify reporting and quarantine measures.""
The Philippines has so far recorded 10 confirmed cases of coronavirus, including the first death outside of China. Of the remaining 9, two have since recovered and left the country, while the others were being treated. One patient, a 62-year-old man, was in ""very critical condition"" as of early Saturday morning, March 7.
The 62-year-old patient, who was reported to frequent a Muslim prayer hall in Barangay Greenhills, is the considered the first case of local transmission in the Philippines.
What to expect: Under a state of public health emergency, Health Assistant Secretary Maria Rosario Vergeire earlier said patients suspected to have the novel coronavirus could face sanctions if they refuse to undergo quarantine.
""Itong (This) state of public health emergency would give the government more authority with regards to this procedure,"" she said.
In the proclamation, Duterte said Duque ""may tap the Philippine National Police and other law enforcement agencies to assist in responding to the outbreak.”
Duterte also urged all citizens, residents, tourists, and business owners to “act within the bounds of the law” and comply with advisories issued by the government to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. 
Duque earlier said that the government was conducting intensified contact tracing, while health officials were preparing for ""possible sustained community transmission.""
""Once there is sustained community transmission or increasing number of local cases whose links cannot be established, the strategy will be shifted from intensive contact tracing, to the implementation of community level quarantine or lockdown and possible suspension of work or school,"" Duque said.
As of Monday, the DOH has probed a total of 700 patients for possible infection, 48 of whom remain admitted in health facilities across the country while 646 have already been discharged.
Meanwhile, at least 89 Filipinos outside the Philippines have contracted the virus since the outbreak began. This included 4 cases in Hong Kong, 80 from a cruise ship docked in Japan, 3 in Singapore, and 2 in the United Arab Emirates. 
As of Sunday, March 8, 40 Filipinos from the cruise ship,1 in Singapore, and 2 in Hong Kong have since recovered.

MANILA, Philippines – Department of Health (DOH) Secretary Francisco Duque III confirmed that the 4 new patients who tested positive for the novel coronavirus are all admitted in private hospitals across Metro Manila.
In an interview with CNN Philippines on Monday, March 9, Duque said that the 4 positive cases are currently admitted in the following cities:

38-year-old Taiwanese male (7th case): Makati Medical Center in Makati City
32-year-old Filipino male (8th case): St Luke’s Medical Center in Taguig City
86-year-old American male (9th case): Medical City-Ortigas in Pasig City
57-year-old Filipino male (10th case) St Luke’s Medical Center in Quezon City

Only patients deemed by doctors as “severe” cases of 2019-nCoV would  be referred to the government’s official referral hospitals like the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) in Muntinlupa City, the Lung Center of the Philippines in Quezon City, and the San Lazaro Hospital in Manila, said DOH Assistant Secretary Maria Rosario Vergeire in a press conference on Monday.
Quezon City Mayor Joy Belmonte said in a speech at city hall on Monday morning that a coronavirus-positive patient is hospitalized in the city’s 1st District.
Vergeire clarified that the patient Belmonte mentioned was among the 10 cases already announced by the Health Department. 
Marikina City Mayor Marcelino Teodoro also confirmed in a statement that the 86-year-old American male is a resident of the city.
Vergeire reminded the public that only persons exhibiting flu-like symptoms after traveling to countries with 2019-nCoV cases or being exposed to confirmed cases should be tested for possible infection.
She explained that the coronavirus symptoms like cough and colds are similar to the symptoms of the common flu. Vergeire said that people who have not been exposed to a positive patient are “at very low risk” of getting COVID-19, the disease caused by 2019-nCoV. 
“But for those people who exhibit signs and symptoms like fever, sore throat, cough and colds without any history of travel at all to those affected areas or without history of known exposure to those positive cases, they don’t need to worry. They [should] just monitor themselves and if symptoms progress, they can consult their doctor. But they are the ones at [ a ] very low risk of contracting this disease,” Vergeire said.
The Philippines now has 10 confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV , including 5 Filipinos, a Taiwanese, an American. The country’s first 3 cases were all Chinese, one of whom died while the other two have already recovered from COVID-19.
The country has also recorded its first local transmission of COVID-19 after a 62-year-old Filipino man with no travel history outside the Phililppines infected his 59-year-old wife. The couple is the country’s 5th and 6th positive cases.
President Rodrigo Duterte is set to issue on Monday an Executive Order formally declaring a state of public health emergency, under which patients suspected to have 2019-nCoV will be required to undergo the 14-day quarantine period. 
The DOH has probed a total of 700 patients for possible infection, 48 of whom remain admitted in health facilities across the country while 646 have already been discharged.
Worldwide, the novel coronavirus has infected more than 109,800 people and killed 3,803, with most deaths still being recorded in Hubei, China, the epicenter of the outbreak. Still, over 60,700 have already recovered from COVID-19. – Rappler.com

MANILA, Philippines (3rd UPDATE) – President Rodrigo Duterte has approved the recommendation of Health Secretary Francisco Duque III to declare a state of public health emergency after the Department of Health (DOH) confirmed the local transmission of COVID-19.
Senator Bong Go was the first to announce this to media on Saturday, March 7. Hours before Go made the announcement, Duque said he had recommended the issuance of the declaration to the Chief Executive in anticipation of the possible sustained community spread of the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.
""Pursuant to the recommendation of the DOH and my suggestion as Chair of the Senate Committee on Health, President Rodrigo Duterte has agreed to issue a declaration of a State of Public Health Emergency due to the confirmation of a local transmission of COVID-19 in our country,"" said Go.
Malacañang issued a similar announcement over an hour later.
""The Office of the President also notes the recommendation of the DOH to declare a State of Public Health Emergency. The said proposal has been raised to the attention of the President who has agreed to issue such declaration after considering all critical factors with the aim of safeguarding the health of the Filipino public,"" said Presidential Spokesman Salvador Panelo.
Duque announced at a news briefing that the DOH raised the conoravirus alert system to Code Red-Sublevel 1 after it ascertained that the country's 5th case of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, got infected locally as he had no history of travel abroad.
""With this Code Red, the DOH has recommended to the Office of the President for the declaration of a state of public health emergency which will facilitate the mobilization of resources, ease processes including procurement of critical logistics and supplies, and intensifying reporting and quarantine measures,"" Duque said.
The DOH raised the COVID-19 alert system as it confirmed the Philippines' 6th case of COVID-19 – the wife of the 5th case, a 62-year-old Filipino man known to frequent a prayer hall at the Greenhills shopping mall in San Juan.
Duque assuaged fears about the raising of the alert level, saying it was just ""a preemptive measure"" that served as a ""signal to all concerned agencies, local governments, health care providers to be ready to [implement] planned response measures.""
At this stage, Duque said, the government will be conducting intensified contact tracing, as well as activation of other laboratories that can diagnose COVID-19. 
""Activation of other labs outside of Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) to increase capacity to diagnose are now being implemented,"" Duque said.
But Duque said that the DOH was also preparing for ""possible sustained community transmission.""
""However, once there is sustained community transmission or increasing number of local cases whose links cannot be established, the strategy will be shifted from intensive contact tracing, to the implementation of community level quarantine or lockdown and possible suspension of work or school,"" Duque said.
""This will be implemented in municipal, city or provincial scale as maybe warranted,"" he added.
He said that if this should happen, health staff and uniformed personnel from unaffected would be tapped. – Rappler.com  "

MANILA, Philippines (3rd UPDATE) – Multinational professional services network Deloitte Philippines confirmed on Saturday, March 7, that one of its employees tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.
Deloitte Philippines, which made the statement in a  Facebook post on Saturday, said the employee was being treated at a hospital.
""The colleague is currently in hospital receiving treatment and further tests, and Deloitte is supporting the colleague and family in every way we can,"" it said.

The company said that ""the health and safety of our people, our clients, and out community is our highest priority, and our immediate response has been to take all necessary actions to manage the situation.""
""Deloitte Philippines continues to comply with the instruction and directions from the Department of Health. All necessary actions were promptly taken to inform those who might have come into contact with the colleague for the appropriate checks and provide any possible form of support,"" it added.
Close coordination
The company did not say in its statement whether the employee was one of the two new COVID-19 patients in the country but Taguig Mayor Lino Cayetano confirmed this in a Facebook post on Saturday.
Cayetano said that the patient, whose office is located in Bonifacio Global City, was put under surveillance of the City Epidemiology and Disease Surveillance Unit (CEDSU) and was admitted to RITM the following day.
“He is currently receiving treatment there and his condition is stable. We continue to monitor his medical status while our CEDSU and city officials have been in close coordination with the concerned property managers. Contact tracing and proper management are ongoing,” he said.
The patient visited Japan and returned to Manila on February 25.
The Taguig mayor also said that local government unit has been in constant communication with the DOH and has been aggressive in reinforcing a two-pronged approach of fighting the virus – through prevention and protection, and monitoring and reporting. 
“The City Government encourages everyone to source their information only from reliable channels and stay calm,” Cayetano said. (LIST: Where to get official, reliable info on novel coronavirus)
DOH reminder
The Deloitte Philippines announcement was apparently made without the knowledge of the Department of Health (DOH).
Following the announcement, the DOH reminded the public that any official announcement regarding COVID-19 cases in the country should only be made by the government, and that anyone with such information should immediately relay it to the DOH for proper handling.
""Only the Secretary of Health has the authority to release such details,"" Health Assistant Secretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said in an interview on DZMM, citing protocols observed by the government in announcing new cases.
She said the DOH is “very careful with the personal information of our patients” as provided under the Data Privacy Act.
Health Secretary Francisco Duque III reiterated this in a press briefing on Saturday, saying that any official announcements on COVID-19 cases in the country should come from the DOH, and urged those with such information to coordinate with the department.
“Our objectives for sharing information are two-pronged: ensure the public's health and safety by facilitating contact tracing and ensure that the individual’s right to privacy is not impinged. Hence, we appeal to all to coordinate closely with the Department of Health when disseminating information to the public and within their respective institutions,"" he said.
""Let us make sure the information sharing process will yield the utmost benefit, and avoid unnecessary stress and stigma to individuals and institutions. The DOH commits to be more circumspect in reporting confirmed cases, to balance interests of public health and privacy. To this end only pertinent information necessary to facilitate contact tracing will be provided to the public, i.e. activity, location and time, if available,"" he added.

MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – The first batch of Filipinos who were repatriated from Macau arrived in Manila late Saturday afternoon, March 7.
A total of 163 ""stranded and distressed"" Filipinos arrived at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport Terminal 1 via a chartered Air Macau flight that landed  at around 4:30 pm on Saturday.
The Department of Foreign Affairs earlier announced that 167 Filipinos were due to arrive, but the total number was 163, composed of 130 adults, 5 children, and, 28 Overseas Workers Welfare Administration members.
Upon arrival at the airport, the repatriates were given a health briefing to guide them on their 14-day self-quarantine. Some of the pointers include wearing a mask when talking to others, disposing of the used mask properly after 8 hours of use, and alerting barangay health workers if they experience any flu symptoms such as cold, cough, and fever.
They also received financial assistance from the government.
The Macau repatriates were among the first batch repatriated from the area amid the continued global spread of the 2019 novel coronavirus. The Philippine government had been coordinating with the Macau government for their return after travel restrictions resulted in lack of direct flights back to Manila.
Health Assistant Secretary Maria Rosario Vergeire earlier said repatriated Filipinos will not be brought to the New Clark City (NCC) in Capas, Tarlac, for quarantine upon landing since they will be subject to home-based quarantine and considered persons-under-monitoring. The DFA gave assurances that all Filipinos coming from Macau were asymptomatic.
Despite this, the DFA said that if some displayed symptoms of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new virus, ""they will be immediately brought to a medical facility for further investigation and treatment if necessary.""
Filipinos repatriated from Macau will comprise the 3rd batch of Filipinos returning to the country as COVID-19 cases of continued to increase worldwide.
The DFA, along with officials from the Department of Health, repatriated on Februrary 9, 30 Filipinos from from China’s Hubei province, the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak. On February 25, a total of 445 Filipinos also returned home from the coronavirus-hit  M/V Diamond Princess cruise ship from Japan.
The Philippines has recorded 5 confirmed cases of coronavirus, including the first death outside of China. Of the remaining 4, two have since recovered and left the country, while the other were being treated. One was in ""very critical condition"" as of early Saturday morning.
Worldwide, the COVID-19 death toll stood at over 3,400 as of Saturday, while over 101,000 people were infected across 84 countries. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – The Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) on Saturday, March 7, urged all Filipinos to postpone upcoming trips to the Holy Land “until further notice” as the 2019 novel coronavirus continues to spread worldwide. The DFA issued the travel advisory as it announced that the Palestinian Authority was implementing a temporary ban prohibiting the entry of tourists to the West Bank, Bethlehem, and Jericho. The sites are among those frequented by tourists and hold significance for participants of prayer pilgrimages. The DFA advised also the public to take note that the Israeli government is implementing measures to restrict all travels to Bethlehem from Israel. “Prospective travelers are therefore advised to coordinate with their tour operators to avoid any inconvenience,” DFA said in an advisory.Israel and the Palestinian Authority are the latest to impose sweeping travel restrictions on holy sites to stem the spread of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus. The sites see thousands of tourists and pilgrims each year, as it holds significance for Jews, Christians, and Muslims. The restrictions can be likened to those recently imposed by Saudi Arabia on “umrah” pilgrims who were set to visit Islam's holiest sites. Worldwide, the COVID-19 death toll stood at over 3,400 as of Saturday, while over 101,000 people had been infected across 84 countries. The Philippines has recorded 5 confirmed cases of coronavirus, including the first death outside of China. Of the remaining 4, two have since recovered and left the country while one is currently being treated and another, in critical condition as of early Saturday morning. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – An elderly Filipino man who tested positive for the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is “in a very critical condition,” Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said on Saturday, March 7
Asked about the condition of the patient amid concerns that the senior citizen, who had preexisting illnesses, was more vulnerable to the new virus, Duque said in a text message to Rappler early Saturday morning, ""As of 1 am, March 7, [he] is still alive but in a very critical condition.""
The 62-year-old man was among the two Filipinos who tested positive for the virus in the country.
Duque was citing the latest update he received from Director Celia Carlos of the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM), where the two COVID-19 patients are currently admitted. 
Even before catching COVID-19, the disease caused by 2019-nCoV, the 62-year-old male was already known to have hypertension and diabetes mellitus. 
He started experiencing cough with phlegm on February 25 and was confined at the Cardinal Santos Medical Center for severe pneumonia on March 1. His specimen was collected for testing on March 4 and he tested positive for the new virus the next day. He was then transferred to the RITM.
The senior Filipino patient had often visited a Muslim prayer room in Barangay Greenhills, San Juan City, prompting Mayor Francis Zamora to temporarily shut down the area to disinfect it.  
Though the patient had no known travel history outside the Philippines, Duque had arlier said previously said it was “premature” to describe him as the country's first local transmission of 2019-nCoV, as the government was still tracing all individuals with whom he had made contact in the past days. 
As of Saturday morning, the Philippines has reported 5 positive cases of COVID-19 – 3 foreigners from China and two Filipinos.  Of the Chinese patients, one died and the other two had recovered.
The DOH has probed a total of 678 patients for possible infection, but only 41 remain admitted in medical facilities nationwide while 634 have already been discharged. – Rappler.com "

CEBU CITY, Philippines – Room occupancies in the Philippines have taken a hit due to the novel coronavirus travel bans, according to the Department of Tourism Central VIsayas.   There was about a 20% reduction in hotel occupancies across Cebu compared to the same period in 2019, the DOT-7 reported.
Shalimar Tamano, DOT-7 regional director, said on Friday, March 6, that this data does not include Air BNB properties.   Hotels in Bohol were hit even harder with a 35% reduction in hotel occupancies compared to the same period in 2019.   Some of the top visitors to the region include countries with known novel coronavirus with 37% of visitors coming from South Korea, 17.63% from China, and 12.85% from Japan. Central Visayas, home to the 2nd largest international airport in the country, received a total of 4.2 million visitors from other countries in 2019.Tourism is a sizeable contributor to the economy of Central Visayas. In 2019, tourism generated about P97 billion in revenues.   Tamano said that he expected the travel bans due to the novel coronavirus would hinder the DOT from hitting its 2020 targets.   “Best case scenario is that we can make up for the loss in the 3rd or 4th quarters,” Tamano said during Friday's press conference.   The first confirmed COVID-19 case traveled through Central Visayas, including Cebu and Dumaguete, before going to Manila.   The 26 South Koreans from virus-hit Daegu City, South Korea, were also quarantined here in Cebu.  According to national data from the Department of Tourism, the Philippines stands to lose P42 billion in revenues due to the coronavirus.
Tamano said they are continuing dialogue with the tourism sector to find short-term solutions for businesses suffering revenue losses.
Some solutions, he said, include tax breaks for hotels, special rates for regional tourists who patronize local hotels, and financial aid from the government.   “Financial aid would be the most challenging because we’re dealing with the BIR (Bureau of Internal Revenue), DBM (Department of Budget and Management), and other agencies,” Tamano said.   While the average occupancy drop was at 20% in Cebu, several higher end hotels which did not want to be named told Rappler they reported up to 40% to 60% reduction in occupancy compared to the same period in 2019.   “But the upside to this is sales and discounts for the local tourists,” the DOT-7 director said.
The Department of Health (DOH) also confirmed on Friday that two Filipinos tested positive locally for the 2019-nCoV. 
Prior to the Filipino cases, the Philippines had 3 confirmed cases who were Chinese tourists. Two of them have already recovered and the other died. As of Friday, the DOH has probed a total of 678 patients for possible infection. Of this number, only 41 remain admitted in hospitals nationwide while 634 have already been discharged. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – Afraid of losing their jobs in China, more than 600 stranded overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) appealed to the Philippine government to lift the travel ban on “safe areas” there so they could go back to work.
The government imposed the travel ban on February 2 as the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak worsened worldwide.
The virus was discovered in the city of Wuhan in China, capital of Hubei province, prompting the lockdown of several provinces, and several countries' travel ban covering the mainland and its special administrative regions.
""We wish the government to review the travel ban and start thinking about our situation. China is a big country and most of the areas have a very few new cases,"" the petitioners said in a statement. 
Reggie Medestomas, 45, who works as a brand director in a consultant firm in Shenzhen, China, started the petition. According to him, some offices in China – which have few recorded cases – have already resumed normal operations.
“Ang office namin nag start na ulit normal operations last February 24. ‘Yung position ko kasi ay kailangan na nandoon ako. Kapag hindi ako makabalik agad, baka mawalan na ako ng trabaho,” he added. 
(Our office has resumed normal operations last February 24. My position in the compnay requires me to be physically there. If I won’t be able to return to China immediately, I might lose my job.)
‘No work, no pay’
As the total ban in mainland China remains in place, OFWs with contracts there worry about making both ends meet, especially since most of them are in a “no work, no pay” arrangement with their employers.

“Ang amortization ko sa bahay buwan-buwan at tution ng mga bata ang magiging problema ko sa mga susunod na buwan (My monthly house amortization and my children’s tuition fees would be a problem in the next months),” said Medestomas. 

The Overseas Workers Welfare Administration (OWWA) has provided P10,000 to each OFW who was supposed to travel back to mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau, but was instead stranded in Manila airports after the announcement of the travel ban. 
The amount, according to the petitioners, is not enough. “Dumadami ang expenses pero wala naman kami income. Wala naman provision ang gobyerno na tutulungan kami sa mga pangangailangan namin habang andito kami (Our expenses are piling up, but we have no source of income. The government has no provision in helping us for our needs while we're here in the Philippines.),” Medestomas said. 
Asked for his message to the government, Medestomas said: “Hayaan lang kami na bumalik kasi may assurance naman na ang employer namin na kami ay iingatan kami kasi part kami ng organization nila.”
(Allow us to go back to China because our employers assured us that they would take care of us since we are part of their organization.) 
On February 18, the Philippine government’s Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID) allowed OFWs to return to their jobs in Hong Kong and Macau. This was after some 25,000 stranded OFWs and Hong Kong residents organized themselves and urged the government to exempt them from the ban. 
Medestomas told Rappler that Migrante International will be organizing a press conference on Monday, March 9, to urge the government to allow OFWs to return to “safe areas” in mainland China. 
Over 80,500 have been infected by 2019-nCoV in mainland China as of Friday, March 6. A total of 3,042 have died from COVID-19 – the disease caused by the virus – nationwide.
The Department of Health (DOH) also confirmed on Friday that two Filipinos tested positive for the 2019-nCoV locally. 
Prior to the Filipino cases, the Philippines had 3 confirmed cases who were Chinese tourists. Two of them have already recovered and the other died. 
As of Friday, the DOH has probed a total of 678 patients for possible infection. Of this number, only 41 remain admitted in health facilities nationwide while 634 have already been discharged. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – San Juan City Mayor Francis Zamora has temporarily shut down  the Muslim prayer hall in Barangay Greenhills that was frequently visited by a Filipino man who tested positive for the novel coronavirus (2019-nCov).
The prayer hall will be disinfected and sanitized, said Zamora in a statement around two hours after the Department of Health (DOH) confirmed two Filipinos caught the virus locally, bringing the number of confirmed cases in the Philippines to 5. 
One of the two positive cases is a 62-year-old male who often visited the Muslim prayer hall while the other is a 48-year-old Filipino who traveled to Japan.
“I have already instructed the San Juan City Health Office, with the support of the Department of Health, to immediately disinfect, sanitize, and close to the public temporarily the prayer room in Barangay Greenhills, which was frequented by a patient who lives in a municipality near Metro Manila whom the DOH has confirmed positive with coronavirus,” Zamora said.
The mayor said San Juan is working closely with the DOH to trace all the people with whom the COVID-19 patient had contact with in the past days. 
He then advised the public to exercise all safety precautions against COVID-19, the disease caused by 2019-nCoV. 
“I encourage the public to stay calm, practice proper hand washing using soap and water or alcohol, and executive proper cough etiquette. Finally, avoid going to crowded places, keeping at least a one-meter distance from other people,” said Zamora. 
The 62-year-old coronavirus patient has no known travel history outside of the country, but the DOH said it was not yet recognizing him as a positive case of local transmission in the Philippines.
In a separate statement, the Cardinal Santos Medical Center (CSMC) located in San Juan also confirmed that it had nursed the 62-year-old man before he was transferred to the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine in Muntinlupa.
""Cardinal Santos Medical Center took care of a male patient who had no history of travels or contact with those who traveled to the countries enumerated to have experienced positive COVID-19,"" the hospital management said.
The patient, who continued showing symptoms, was transferred to RITM so he could have the ""best care.""
The CSMC management then assured the public that they have taken ""all the precautionary measures"" necessary for all personnel who had been exposed to the coronavirus-positive case. None of them have shown flu-like symptoms so far.
Prior to the two Filipino cases, the Philippines previously reported that 3 Chinese nationals tested positive for COVID-19. One died, while the other two already recovered.
Three foreigners from Taiwan, Japan, and Australia also caught the virus after traveling to the Philippines. 
As of Friday, the DOH has probed a total of 678 patients for possible infection. Of that number, only 41 remain admitted in health facilities nationwide while 634 have already been discharged. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines (3rd UPDATE) – The Department of Health (DOH) confirmed that two Filipinos tested positive for the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) for the first time in the Philippines, bringing the total confirmed cases in the country to 5.
In a press conference on Friday, March 6, DOH Secretary Francisco Duque III said the 4th positive case in the Philippines is a 48-year-old male Filipino who visited Japan and returned to Manila on February 25.  
He started experiencing symptoms such as chills and fever on March 3, but is currently in a ""stable"" condition.The second new confirmed case is a 62-year-old Filipino male with known pre-existing conditions of hypertension and diabetes mellitus who started experiencing cough with phlegm on February 25. 
He sought medical consultation at a hospital in Metro Manila on March 1 and was admitted with severe pneumonia. The man frequented a Muslim prayer hall in San Juan City. 
Both cases are admitted at the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM).
This 5th case has no known travel history, but Duque said it cannot be treated as a confirmed local transmission of COVID-19 – the disease caused by 2019-nCoV – for now.“There is no transmission to speak of as of [now]. There’s only one. That’s why we’re doing contact tracing…But now it’s premature to say that there’s local transmission,” Duque said. 
Contact tracing
The DOH and concerned local government units are now tracing all the individuals the two additional confirmed cases came in contact with.
“These recent developments are significant, but we are prepared to respond to its potential consequences. Our priority is to protect our health workers and the most vulnerable populations,” Duque said. 
“We can still contain the spread of the virus in the country, which is why we are encouraging the public to practice proper handwashing, social distancing, and cough etiquette. We call on the public to be vigilant and continue doing their part in containing the disease,” he added.
Prior to the two Filipino cases, the Philippines previously reported that 3 Chinese nationals tested positive for COVID-19. One died, while the other two already recovered. 
The Philippine government has long been criticized for not testing a larger part of the population for possible infection. 
The RITM is the country’s sole laboratory accredited by the World Health Organization (WHO) to test 2019-nCoV samples. It uses a testing method that yields results within 24 to 48 hours, much slower compared to the speed of the rapid diagnostic testing (RDT) kits that countries like South Korea is using. The DOH is now eyeing 4 more hospitals across the country to be accredited by the WHO as official testing centers for 2019-nCoV.
Duque, however, still does not want to use the RDTs to expand the Philippines' testing samples, arguing these have not been accredited by the WHO yet. 
‘Wake up call’
Senator Risa Hontiveros said the latest COVID-19 cases in the country, as well as confirmed cases abroad involving people who traveled to the Philippines, should be a “wake up call” to Philippine health officials.
“This is a cause for concern and a wake-up call for our health officials. We should not give the public a false sense of security because the danger of local transmission is real,” Hontiveros said in a statement on Friday.
She urged the Doh to review its screening and testing protocols, following the latest cases.
“Parang hindi sapat (It seems that it is inadequate). DOH should intensify its monitoring and surveillance to include all travelers, not just those who come from countries with high prevalence of COVID-19,” the senator said.
“A weak health system poses a risk to public health. We need the DOH to be hawk-eyed and transparent with the public every step of the way,” she added.
Worldwide, a total of 90 Filipinos caught the novel coronavirus in the past weeks, including the two new cases recorded in the Philippines on Friday.Of this number, 80 were infected with 2019-nCoV while aboard the cruise ship Diamond Princess that was docked for days at the port of Yokohama in Japan. Another two Filipinos tested positive in the United Arab Emirates, while Singapore reported 3 cases. Another 3 Filipinos got 2019-nCoV in Hong Kong.Still, 40 of the Filipinos from Diamond Princess and one case from Singapore already recovered from the coronavirus.– Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – The Philippine Department of Health (DOH) just opened an account on Chinese-owned video-sharing platform TikTok as part of its campaign to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which also originated from China. 
On Thursday, March 5, the DOH’s official Facebook account shared a video of 3 of its personnel dancing to the song “The Weekend” while tips on how to prevent COVID-19 – the disease caused by 2019-nCoV – flashed on the screen. 
The health department’s 6-minute TikTok video advised its viewers to wash their hands, maintain a one-meter distance from their neighbors, avoid touching their face, and follow proper cough etiquette.

The video was an instant hit among Facebook users, garnering 68,000 views and 2,300 shares as of 8:20 pm on Thursday. (READ: PH coronavirus watch: Suspected cases per region, as of March 5, 2020)
The DOH post then asked the public to “join the #covidance challenge” and follow their official TikTok account.
“DOH is officially on Tiktok! Learn protective measures against COVID-19 in this TikTok video! Join the #covidance challenge!” the post read.
The DOH is not alone in tapping the video-sharing app widely popular among teens worldwide to help stop the spread of COVID-19. The Department of Tourism has also started encouraging Filipino millennials addicted to TikTok to help address the economic impact of the novel coronavirus.  
But United States lawmakers and intelligence officials already expressed concern over TikTok’s connections with Beijing, arguing the video-sharing app could become another tool exploited by China for espionage activities. 
As of 8:30 pm Thursday, the Philippines has recorded only 3 positive cases of COVID-19, all of whom were Chinese nationals who traveled from Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak that has so far killed 2,902 people in that province alone. 
Of the 3 positive cases in the Philippines, one died while the other two already recovered. There are also 669 patients under investigation by the DOH for possible infection. Only 37 of them remain admitted to hospitals, while 629 have already been discharged.  
Worldwide, the death toll due to the coronavirus stood at over 3,200, while over 95,000 people were infected across at least 84 countries. – Rappler.com  "

Since the outbreak began, 88 Filipinos have contracted the virus, all based outside the Philippines. These include 80 from a cruise ship docked in Japan, 3 in Singapore, 3 in Hong Kong, and 2 in the United Arab Emirates.
But 40 from the cruise ship and 1 in Singapore have since recovered, leaving 47 still infected as of Thursday
The World Health Organization raised its global risk assessment of the virus to the maximum level. It earlier declared the outbreak an international emergency.
The global death toll has reached 3,279, with 3,015 of the fatalities in China. The number of cases worldwide has risen to 95,265, with 80,565 of the infections in China. The virus has spread to more than 70 countries. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – Saudi Arabia is imposing a travel ban on tourists from countries, including the Philippines, judged to pose ""a particularly high risk"" of spreading the 2019 novel coronavirus, the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) announced late Wednesday night, March 4.
Aside from tourist visa holders, the Saudi government is also banning the entry of ""umrah"" pilgrimage visa holders to quell the spread of the virus.
The advisory follows days of confusion over the exact scope of the Saudi government's travel restrictions first implemented last February 27.
Saudi Arabia earlier announced the unprecedented decision to ban ""umrah"" pilgrims from visiting Islam's holiest sites to try to contain the spread of the coronavirus. The kingdom added it was also suspending visas for tourists visiting from countries where the new virus is a ""danger.""
But despite restrictions limited to pilgrims and tourist visas, the Philippine government sought to clarify the full scope of the Saudi government's travel ban, following reports that some Filipinos traveling to Saudi Arabia were unable to enter the country for other purposes.
Following this, the DFA said among Filipinos exempted from the Saudi government's ban are those who hold visas for the following purposes:

Employment
Work visit
Business visit
Family visit

Filipinos holding these types of visas will still be allowed entry into Saudi Arabia, the DFA said.
Aside from this, the Saudi government announced it is suspending the issuance of entry visas for the ""umrah"" pilgirms, visits to the Prophet's mosque in Medina, as well as tourist visas ""indefinitely"" due to the coronavirus crisis.
The DFA gave assurances the Philippine Embassy in Riyadh and the Philippine Consulate General in Jeddah are closely monitoring the situation and are coordinating with the concerned agencies of the Saudi government.
Filipinos on their way to Saudi Arabia who experience problems related to these travel restrictions can call the embassy at (+966-11) 482-0507, or the consulate at (+966-12) 667-0925 and (+966-12) 669-6303.
As of Wednesday night, Saudi Arabia recorded one confirmed case of the novel coronavirus.
Worldwide, the death toll due to the coronavirus stood at over 3,200 as of Wednesday, while over 93,000 people were infected across 81 countries.
The Philippines, meanwhile, earlier recorded 3 confirmed cases of coronavirus – all Chinese tourists – including the first death due outside China. The other two cases have since recovered and left the country. – Rappler.com "

MORE LABS. Health Secretary Francisco Duque III gives an update on the status of the novel coronavirus in the Philippines. File photo by Inoue Jaena/Rappler  
MANILA, Philippines – Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said the Philippine government is working to have 4 more laboratories across the country accredited by the World Health Organization (WHO) as official testing centers for the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). 
""We are now expanding our testing capacity. We have 5 sub-national laboratories that are up for accreditation by RITM (Research Institute for Tropical Medicine). These are one in Visayas, one in Mindanao, one in Northern Luzon, and another one in Metro Manila. So we will have 5,"" Duque said in a press conference on Wednesday, March 4. 
He said specialists from the WHO are currently in the country to help set up the capacities of the following hospitals so they will soon be ready to test 2019-nCoV samples: 

Vicente Sotto Memorial Medical Center in Cebu City
Southern Philippines Medical Center in Davao City
Baguio General Hospital in Baguio City
Lung Center of the Philippines in Quezon City

The RITM – the health department's research arm – is the Philippines' sole laboratory accredited by the WHO that can test 2019-nCoV samples. But if all goes well, Duque hopes the 4 other laboratories would also get accredited within a month or two. 
""Mayroong timeline 'yan. In fact sabi sa akin parang 8 weeks. Pero sabi ko baka puwedeng 4 weeks lang. Kasi 'yung 8 weeks parang ang tagal kako, so 4 weeks. So susubukan,"" the DOH chief said. 
(We have a timeline for that. In fact I was told the process will take about 8 weeks. But I said perhaps we can do it in just 4 weeks because 8 weeks just seem too long. So we'll try.)
Currently, the RITM is running tests with primers from a referral laboratory in Japan, of which it has a limited supply. 
Duque explained the machine used in this testing method tends to yield results between 24 to 48 hours – a longer process compared to the rapid diagnostic testing (RDT) kits used by countries like South Korea to identify 2019-nCoV cases.
He then addressed criticisms hurled at the Department of Health for not testing a larger part of the population for possible infection. 
In comparison, South Korea – where a total of 5,621 people have caught the 2019-nCoV – has been testing its residents by the thousands every day, a feat the Philippines just isn't capable of doing for now.  
Duque, however, is unfazed, arguing the DOH would rather stick to a WHO-accredited process that will not yield ""false negative"" results. 
The DOH chief said he had even talked to the ambassadors of South Korea and Japan to ask if their RDTs have already been vetted by the WHO. (READ: Test kits for novel coronavirus need WHO validation before use – DOH)
""Because the last thing I want to have is a rapid diagnostic test where it might produce false negatives. Nakakatakot 'yon! I'll say negative ka (That's scary! I'll say you tested negative), then I'll let you go out, then you're really positive…. I'm not into just using RDT that has not been vetted by a third party, a credible third party,"" Duque said.  
As of Wednesday, the Philippines has recorded no local transmission of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. A total of 39 persons under investigation are still admitted to hospitals, while the other 620 have already been discharged.  
Only 3 confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV have been recorded in the Philippines, all of whom were Chinese nationals who traveled from Hubei province, the epicenter of the outbreak. One died, but the other two recovered from the disease.

MANILA, Philippines – Labor Secretary Silvestre Bello III on Wednesday, March 4, denied the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak had a severe impact on overseas Filipino workers' employment, as he asserted cases of domestic workers displaced in Hong Kong were only ""isolated"" incidents.
Bello issued the remarks in a press conference with reporters at the Department of Labor and Employment's headquarters in Manila, saying there was ""no alarming rate of unemployment to our overseas workers.""
""That’s not true, we’re not losing workers overseas except for some few requests for repatriation. Wala naman ganung (There is no) loss of work if you’re talking of Hong Kong, Japan, and even Taiwan,"" Bello said.
""There are no incidents of unemployment. There are isolated cases, but by and large, there is no alarming rate of unemployment to our overseas workers,"" he added.
At least 40 Filipino domestic workers in Hong Kong were displaced from work as of Tuesday, March 3, according to figures from the Philippine Consulate in Hong Kong, Philippine Overseas Labor Office, and Overseas Workers Welfare Administration (OWWA).
According to OWWA Administrator Hans Cacdac, 35 of the 40 were let go by their employers, who had plans to relocate from the city. Others, he added, were fired in relation to issues regarding days off.
This came after the Hong Kong City’s labor department earlier urged domestic workers not to leave their employers’ homes for their days off, saying it could reduce the risk of transmission. Some employers misunderstood the advisory as mandatory, leaving many workers unable to take days off or punished if they did.
Meanwhile, Bello downplayed challenges that may be faced by affected overseas Filipino workers when looking for new employers. He expressed confidence that many would find work as Filipino workers have become ""very indispensable.""
""We're not alarmed of any employment loss,"" he said.
Despite this, Bello assured workers the Philippine government was ready to repatriate them and provide aid in case they returned to the Philippines.
Cacdac earlier said the Philippine government was helping affected Filipino workers in filing complaints related to their right to take days off. Efforts were also being carried out to assist displaced workers in claiming settlements against their employers. – Rappler.com "

FLEXIBLE WORK. Metro Manila commuters wear face mask as protection from the coronavirus on February 3, 2020. Photo by Jire Carreon/Rappler 
MANILA, Philippines – The Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) on Wednesday, March 4, issued guidelines that employers should follow when implementing flexible working hours in response to the ongoing 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak. “The objective (of flexible working hours) is to help both employer and employees to get over the hump (caused by the coronavirus),” DOLE Undersecretary Ana Dione told reporters in a press conference on Wednesday. DOLE said implementing flexible working hours was among the measures taken by the department to avoid “outright termination of employees” or “total closure” of establishments. (READ: A mess': Coronavirus economic impact on Philippines worse than projected)According to Dione, implementing flexible working arrangements will not be mandatory for employers, who will have full say on whether or not to take such measures. “The effectivity and implementation of any of the flexible work arrangements shall be temporary in nature, subject to the prevailing conditions of the company,” DOLE said.
Why this matters. Labor group Trade Union Congress of the Philippines (TUCP) earlier estimated some 7,000 layoffs and retrenchments could take place in the next 6 months amid the growing coronavirus outbreak crisis. 
TUCP made the forecast after Philippine Airlines terminated 300 employees, citing losses incurred because of canceled flights due to coronavirus travel bans, which have severely impacted businesses. The group said other industries may follow suit and lay off non-essential workers.
Aside from flexible working arrangements, Labor Secretary Silvestre Bello said the department will also require regional and overseas labor offices to submit daily reports on workers displaced by the coronavirus outbreak. He likewise gave assurances affected workers will be provided livelihood and financial assistance.

What employers need to know. DOLE Department Advisory No. 1 series of 2020, issued on Wednesday, listed the following arrangements employers may consider:

Reduction of work hours and/or work days: Normal work hours or work days per week are reduced
Reduction of workers: Employees are rotated or alternately provided work within the week 
Forced leave: Employees are required to go on leave for several days or weeks using leave credits

Meanwhile, DOLE urged employers and employees to discuss other possible alternative work arrangements to ease the effects of loss of income on employees. Employers and employees will be responsible for administering and supervising flexible work arrangements should they opt to implement it, DOLE added. If employers and employees disagree on the interpretation of the arrangements, DOLE said differences can be tackled under the company’s grievance system.In cases where no system for dealing with grievances is in place, regional labor offices where workplaces are registered will have jurisdiction over conciliatory talks. DOLE said employers who will implement flexible working arrangements must ensure documents are kept on record as proof the measure was adopted. Employers will also need to inform regional or provincial labor offices if flexible work arrangements are adopted. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – The Philippines is tapping millennials addicted to popular video-sharing social networking app TikTok to address the economic impact of the novel coronavirus.
On Wednesday, March 4, Tourism Assistant Secretary Howard Lance Uyking said that the campaign, which uses the hashtag #GoCreatePH, invites Filipinos to dance while featuring their hometown’s tourism spots.
“It’s a crowdsourcing initiative for people to promote where they are in order to entice people to travel,” Uyking said. 
The campaign has over 15 million views on TikTok as of writing.

The effort is reminiscent of the Department of Tourism's (DOT) award-winning ""It's more fun in the Philippines"" campaign, where the promotions also banked on crowdsourced content to amplify its messaging.
Will President Rodrigo Duterte be featured on the campaign? Tourism officials are keeping other details of the campaign under wraps, but they said that this is a possibility.
Duterte is set to visit Boracay in March to encourage Filipinos to travel.
The Philippines stands to lose at least P42.9 billion in tourism revenues due to the threat of the novel coronavirus.
Tourist arrivals in popular destinations like Boracay, Cebu, and Bohol declined significantly in February.
The DOT will be spending P6 billion to support local tourism. 
Hotels and airlines have slashed prices just to encourage travel.
The DOT said that travelling around the country is safe, as the Philippines has not recorded domestic transmission. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines –  Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said the Department of Health (DOH) can use P530 million of its 2020 budget to help contain the spread of the novel coronavirus while waiting for Congress approval of its proposed P2-billion supplemental budget.
Duque gave the assurance in a press conference, when asked if the DOH had enough funds to sustain government efforts to stem the spread of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new virus, without a supplemental budget.
“Yes! We have enough budget. I just received a guidance from the DBM (Department of Budget and Management) during our Cabinet meeting last Monday and he (DBM Secretary Wendel Avisado) has pointed out to us that we have about close to P530 million available budget of the DOH that we can use in the meantime that we are waiting the P2-plus billion,” Duque said. 
He stressed the importance of the the DOH's requested supplemental budget, which would be used  to purchase surgical masks and personal protective equipment of some 5,000 health workers in the frontlines of the fight against the new coronavirus.
Two bills were filed at the House of Representatives seeking to give an additional P2 billion to the DOH for its campaign against COVID-19.
The House committee on appropriations has yet to approve the measures due to the ongoing power struggle in the House. Davao City 3rd District Representative Isidro Ungab was sacked as House appropriations panel chairman on Tuesday, March 3, and was replaced by ACT-CIS Representative Eric Yap. 
Under the 1987 Constitution, all bills on the national budget must first be passed by the House before they can be voted upon by the Senate.
When asked, Duque declined to comment on whether he thought the alleged coup against Speaker Alan Peter Cayetano was delaying the approval of DOH’s additional funds. 
“Wala akong inside information [tungkol sa] nagpalitan ng mga chairmanships so I don’t know how that one is affecting [our budget proposal]. But we have been writing follow-up letters,” Duque said. 
(I have no inside information about the changing of chairmanships so I don’t know how that one is affecting our budget proposal. But we have been writing follow-up letters.) 
The DOH chief planned to write a new follow-up letter addressed to Yap to expedite the approval of the  supplemental fund. 
Of the total of 662 patients probed by the DOH for possible infection, only 39 remain admitted in hospitals nationwide as of Wednesday afternoon. The other 620 patients under investigation have been discharged.

MANILA, Philippines – The Department of Tourism (DOT) will be spending some P6 billion to boost the tourism industry, which is heavily hit by the global spread of the novel coronavirus.
On Wednesday, March 4, Tourism Secretary Bernadette Romulo Puyat said the DOT's tourism resiliency program will focus on promoting domestic destinations and on assuring the public that it is safe to travel in the Philippines.
The money for the program will come from a pooled fund from various agencies.
Of the amount, P2.2 billion will be allocated for infrastructure development and expansion, which will be determined together with local government units of top tourist destinations.
P1.6 billion will be used to improve secondary airports.
Some P500 million is allocated for a sewerage treatment plant in Coron, Palawan, while P300 million will go to various projects in Puerto Galera, Oriental Mindoro.
P725 million will be used to mount tactical programs, international events, and market initiatives.
P421 million will be spent on developing new campaigns, while P467 million will be used to create ""engaging content"" tailored for countries that are not affected by the novel coronavirus.
P85 million is earmarked for orientation and emergency response protocols training.
The Philippines stands to lose at least P42.9 billion in tourism revenues due to the threat of the novel coronavirus.
Tourist arrivals in Boracay declined significantly in February, amid travel restrictions imposed to prevent the spread of the virus. From the 172,695 visitors in January, the number dwindled by 40% to 103,834.
Hotel occupancy rates have also declined by 27% in Cebu and 40% in Bohol, according to Puyat.
Aside from additional funding, Puyat said President Rodrigo Duterte is set to visit Boracay in March to encourage tourists to visit the rehabilitated island. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines  – Fifteen of the 16 Filipino repatriates from the Diamond Princess cruise ship who showed flu-like symptoms while quarantined at New Clark City (NCC) have tested negative for the coronavirus.
The Department of Health (DOH) on Wednesday, March 4, said that the 15 repatriates have already recovered from their symptoms and were asked to return to New Clark City to finish their 14-day quarantine.
 “Labing-lima po sa kanila ay nakabalik na sa New Clark City dahil ang kanilang mga test ay negative na (Fifteen of them have already returned to New Clark City because they tested negative for the disease),"" said DOH Assistant Secretary Maria Rosario Vergeire.
Vergeire said the one remaining case at NCC is experiencing diarrhea. 
The 16 repatriates are among the 538 Filipinos who had been quarantined aboard the Diamond Princess docked at the port of Yokohama, Japan, since the outbreak of the novel coronavirus, which infected a total of 763 people aboard the ship.
As of Wednesday, the DOH said it has probed into 662 cases for possible infection. Of this number, 620 have been discharged and 39 remain in hospitals. There had been 3 confirmed cases who were Chinese tourists. Two of them have already recovered and the other died. There is still no recorded local transmission in the country.
No definite time yet
Meanwhile, the DOH said that there is no definite time yet this week for the repatriation of Filipinos in Macau. The repatriates from Macau will be categorized as persons under monitoring (PUM).
PUMs are individuals who have not shown any symptoms of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), but have traveled in the past 14 days to areas with issued travel restrictions, or have been in contact with a confirmed or probable case of COVID-19.
The Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) on Tuesday, March 3, announced it will repatriate 148 Filipinos from Macau amid the continued global spread of the novel coronavirus.
The Overseas Workers Welfare Administration (OWWA) said it will repatriate 48 of its active members from the area. The repatriated Filipinos will return to the Philippines via a chartered flight, while OWWA members will arrive via one commercial flight.
The DOH said that the DFA and the OWWA will have separate repatriation intiatives. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – Half of the 80 Filipinos who caught the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) while aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship docked in Yokohama, Japan, have already recovered.
Department of Health (DOH) Assistant Secretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said that as of Wednesday, March 4, 40 out of the 80 Filipinos no longer have COVID-19, the disease caused by 2019-nCoV, and will now be allowed to go back to the Philippines.
The rest remain admitted in hospitals in Tokyo, Japan.
""'Yung sa Japan, we had a total of 80 positive cases. So sa ngayon po, 40 na lang po 'yung naka-admit sa mga different facilities or ospital sa Tokyo tapos naka-recover na 'yung 40,"" Vergeire said. 
(For those in Japan, we had a total of 80 positive cases. So now, only 40 of them remain admitted in different facilities or hospitals in Tokyo while the other 40 already recovered.) 
Of the 40 Filipinos who recovered, 21 have already been repatriated to the Philippines and are being treated as ""persons under monitoring"" by the government.
This means they are required to undergo another 14 days of quarantine at their respective homes. The DOH and the local government units where their residences are located will then regularly monitor their health during the self-quarantine period.
Another 19 Filipinos who recovered from COVID-19 are still in Japan, but their repatriation is already being processed by the Philippine government.
The Diamond Princess cruise ship carried about 3,700 people – among them 531 Filipino crew members and 7 Filipino passengers – when it reached the port of Yokohama in January.
The Japanese government then quarantined the cruise ship after an 80-year-old passenger who disembarked on January 25 in Hong Kong tested positive for the deadly virus. (READ: All crew members have left virus-hit ship in Japan – minister)
Since then, 705 cruise ship passengers and crew members of different nationalities have been found to have COVID-19, including the 80 Filipinos.
The Philippine government already repatriated another 458 Filipinos from Diamond Princess who did not catch the virus while inside the cruise ship.
They are currently finishing their 14-day mandatory quarantine period – set to end on March 11 – at the New Clark City in Capas, Tarlac, the country's designated national quarantine facility for COVID-19.
Aside from those who were aboard the cruise ship, 7 other Filipinos abroad tested positive for the virus: 2 each in the United Arab Emirates and Hong Kong, and 3 in Singapore. One of the Filipinos in Singapore has since recovered. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – As the 2019 novel coronavirus continues to spread worldwide, an increasing number of Filipino domestic workers in Hong Kong have lost their jobs after employers fired them over mounting concerns spurred by the global health crisis.
The Philippine Consulate in Hong Kong, Philippine Overseas Labor Office, and Overseas Workers Welfare Administration (OWWA) received reports some 40 Filipino domestic workers from the city were displaced as of Tuesday, March 3.
Of the 40, 35 were let go by their employers, OWWA Administrator Hans Cacdac announced on Twitter.
Why are workers losing their jobs? The reasons for firing domestic workers range form employers' supposed relocation amid slowing business operations to issues regarding days off taken by workers.
According to Cacdac, 16 out of 35 Filipinos reported being fired after employers claimed they were leaving the city, where 100 confirmed coronavirus cases have been found as of Tuesday afternoon. Among those infected were two Filipino domestic workers. 
Meanwhile, 12 of the 35 employer-initiated terminations were due to issues regarding rest days.
Hong Kong City’s labor department earlier urged domestic workers not to leave their employers’ homes for their days off, saying it could reduce the risk of transmission. But a report by the South China Morning Post, based on accounts from migrant groups, said employers have taken the suggestion too far as they misinterpreted the government’s advisory as a mandatory measure.
The situation has left many domestic workers prohibited from leaving their homes on days off, but still made to carry out work errands such as going to the market and buying supplies outside.
How did the Philippines respond? Upon hearing of reports of fired workers, Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr said he was ""deeply disgusted"" with the city, which ""begged"" the Philippines to allow domestic workers to return.
""When the West turned on China for COVID-19 I stood up for her before the vicious West at the ASEAN-COVID 19 MEETING. I said that I begged my President to let Filipino domestic workers return to their jobs in HK showing my trust in the Chinese city. This I guess is thank you,"" Locsin said.

We'll prepare for their repatriation pronto. Deeply disgusted with HK wch begged us to let domestic workers return to work. I extracted promise from Chinese ambassador that they'd be given same protection from COVID-19 as HK residents. I shoulda specified ""from Hongkongers."" https://t.co/3Ly1CHCfCm— Teddy Locsin Jr. (@teddyboylocsin) March 3, 2020

Locsin was referring to the Philippines' earlier decision to allow stranded OFWs to return to work in Hong Kong and Macau, provided they sign a declaration stating they know and understand the risks involved.
Cacdac said the Philippine government is now helping concerned overseas Filipino workers in filing complaints related to workers' rights to take days off. Efforts are also underway, he added, to assist displaced workers in claiming settlements against their employers.
Aside from this, OWWA will also provide aid to displaced OFWs who decide to permanently return to the Philippines.
Cacdac said majority of domestic workers displaced due to their employers' relocation have returned to the Philippines to await their new job visas. – Rappler.com "

The World Health Organization raised its global risk assessment of the virus to the maximum level. It earlier declared the outbreak an international emergency.
The global death toll has reached 3,116, with 2,943 of the fatalities in China. The number of cases worldwide has risen to 90,914, with 80,151 of the infections in China. The virus has spread to more than 70 countries. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – The Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) on Tuesday, March 3, announced it will repatriate 148 Filipinos from Macau amid the continued global spread of the 2019 novel coronavirus.
The Overseas Workers Welfare Administration said it will repatriate 48 of its active members from the area. The repatriated Filipinos will return to the Philippines via a chartered flight, while OWWA members will arrive via one commercial flight.
No date had been set for the arrival of the Filpinos from Macau.
In a statement on Tuesday, the Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF) on Emerging Infectious Diseases said it approved the DFA and OWWA's repatriation plans during a meeting held on Tuesday afternoon. The IATF assured the public that returning Filipinos would undergo the required screening and quarantine measures being implemented by the Philippine government.
As of Tuesday, Macau has recorded 10 confirmed cases of coronavirus. 
Filipinos repatriated from Macau will comprise the 3rd batch of Filipinos returning to the country as cases of coronavirus continues to increase worldwide.
The DFA, along with officials from the Department of Health, earlier repatriated on Feburary 9, 30 Filipinos from from China’s Hubei province, the epicenter of deadly novel coronavirus' outbreak. On February 25, a total of 445 Filipinos also returned home from the coronavirus-hit Japanese cruise ship M/V Diamond Princess.
All repatriates were placed under quarantine in the New Clark City Center in Capas, Tarlac – the Philippines' national quarantine facility for the novel coronavirus outbreak.
The Philippines earlier recorded 3 confirmed cases of the coronavirus, all Chinese tourists, including the first death outside China. The other two already recovered and have returned to China.
As of 12:10 am on Tuesday, the worldwide death toll due to the coronavirus stood at 3,048, while over 89,000 cases were recorded across 68 countries. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – The Philippine government eased restrictions on Filipino tourists traveling to South Korea, limiting the ban it imposed only to areas where the novel coronavirus outbreak is concentrated, instead of the whole country.
Presidential Spokesperson Salvador Panelo told reporters on Tuesday, March 3, that only North Gyeongsang Province, including Daegu City and Cheongdo County, are included in the travel ban.
Before leaving the Philippines, Filipinos visiting other areas in South Korea will be made to sign a declaration stating they know and understand the risks involved in traveling to the country. A health advisory pamphlet will also be given to them upon departure.
""The IATF (Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases) has resolved to partially lift travel restrictions to South Korea as their government has implemented stringent infection control measures to contain the spread of COVID-19,"" Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said.
""South Korea has also reported a low case fatality rate of only 0.5%, and the successful containment of local transmission to only certain areas.""
Last Wednesday, February 26, the Philippines banned Filipino tourists from traveling to South Korea, but allowed permanent residents, overseas Filipino workers, and students based in that country to leave.
Non-Filipinos coming from North Gyeongsang were also barred from entering the Philippines. Exemptions were only granted to Filipinos and their foreign spouses and children, as well as holders of permanent resident cards and diplomatic visas.
Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles earlier said the Philippines decided to impose only a partial travel ban on those arriving from North Gyeongsang since the South Korean government gave assurances it will be able to isolate coronavirus cases.
As of 2:46 pm on Tuesday, South Korea has registered the highest number of coronavirus cases outside China, with 4,812. The death toll there stands at 28.
The vast majority of cases were seen in Daegu, South Korea's 4th largest city and the epicenter of the outbreak, and the rest of North Gyeongsang, Agence France-Presse reported.
No new bans, for now
As for other areas, Panelo said no new travel restrictions have been imposed on countries where a high number of coronavirus cases have been found.
The IATF, he added, has also agreed to maintain existing travel bans on China, Macau, and Hong Kong.
""The IATF assures [the public] that the review concerning travel restrictions and protocols to and from the Philippines shall be regularly conducted,"" Panelo said.
But travel exemptions are now granted, ""allowing dependents of permanent residents of South Korea, Hong Kong, and Macau to travel to these areas as long as they also sign a risk-acknowledgement declaration,"" said Duque on Tuesday.
The Philippines earlier recorded 3 confirmed cases of the coronavirus, all Chinese tourists, including the first death outside China. The other two already recovered and have returned to China. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – The government's economic managers are set to issue a more dire assessment of the novel coronavirus' impact on the Philippine economy, as the deadly virus further spreads around the globe.
""The whole world is in a mess [due to the virus],"" said Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas Governor Benjamin Diokno in The Manila Times business forum on Tuesday, March 3.
The economic team previously projected that growth would be slashed by 0.2% if the virus would not be contained within a quarter, and up to 0.4% if it drags on until the 1st half of the year.
However, Diokno noted that they were basing the figures on the ""wrong assumption.""
The calculations were based on how the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) affected the global economy over 16 years ago.
""This is not SARS, this is different.... Slightly worse than recent computation,"" Diokno said. (READ: How does COVID-19 compare to SARS and MERS?)
In February, the novel coronavirus overtook SARS in terms of the number of deaths.
During the 2002-2003 SARS outbreak, 774 died, while the novel coronavirus has killed more than 3,100 people and infected over 90,000, with figures still rising.
The Philippines' revised economic estimates are likely to be out by late March or early April.
As the public continues to avoid crowded spaces like malls, Diokno is banking on government spending to shore up the economy.
Less collections
The Bureau of Customs (BOC) is expected to post lower collections due to less imports from China amid the outbreak.
Finance Undersecretary Antonette Tionko said in the same forum that imports from China plummeted by 44% in February, while overall imports are down by 22%.
""We have to work to find ways to recover,"" Tionko said.
However, she noted that the amount of collections ""didn't go down much"" because of higher taxes from oil imports.
The BOC fell short of its collection target for January by at least P2 billion, collecting some P56 billion for the month. 
The tourism sector is among those hardest hit by the virus. The Department of Tourism estimated that the country is set to lose some 1.2 million Chinese tourists due to the novel coronavirus.
In February alone, tourists arrivals in world-famous Boracay declined by 40%, resulting in the closure of some 20 establishments on the island and in the airport. From an average of 4,100 Chinese tourists, only 1,400 came to visit the island.
The Philippines has had 3 confirmed cases of the virus, so far, all of them Chinese tourists. One died, while the other two recovered. There is still no recorded case of local transmission in the country.
At least 87 Filipinos were found to have the virus, but all are based outside the Philippines, including 80 from a cruise ship docked in Japan, 3 in Singapore, and 2 each in the United Arab Emirates and Hong Kong. – Rappler.com "

Photo courtesy of Cebu City Public Information Office CEBU CITY, Philippines – The Cebu Chinese Chamber of Commerce donated 5,000 face masks to help prepare for a possible outbreak of COVID-19 in the Philippines.   The masks were delivered by local businessman Francisco Benedicto.  The donation comes after it was reported that at least 26 Koreans from coronavirus-hit Daegu City traveled to Cebu. All except one have been accounted for, but none exhibited symptoms of the virus. 
Cities around the world have been dealing with mask shortages due to panic buying.  Shortly after news of infections spreading in China began, pharmacies in Cebu started implementing a ""one box per person"" policy in the purchase of face masks to prevent hoarding.

This means they are not symptomatic, but came from areas with known outbreaks.   If there are young children, elderly, or other vulnerable persons in their homes, they will be placed under quarantine in a newly-built facility in Barangay Taptap.""

SINGAPORE (UPDATED) – A Filipina maid, a coworker of another patient from the Philippines, contracted the novel coronavirus disease called COVID-19 in Singapore, said the city-state’s Ministry of Health (MOH) on Monday, March 2.
The 34-year-old domestic worker is the 3rd Filipino coronavirus patient in Singapore. She is the city-state’s 108th case of the novel coronavirus.
“Case 108 is a 34-year-old female Filipino national who is a Singapore Work Pass holder, and has no recent travel history to China, Daegu, and Cheongdo. She is a foreign domestic worker employed by Case 101, and works in the same household as Case 102,” said the MOH.
“She was confirmed to have COVID-19 infection on 2 March morning and is currently warded in an isolation room at Ng Teng Fong General Hospital,” the ministry added.
The Filipina is among two new COVID-19 cases reported by the MOH on Monday, as 4 other patients have been discharged. Of Singapore’s 108 cases of the novel coronavirus, 78 have completely recovered and have been discharged from the hospital as of Monday, said the MOH.
Like her Filipino coworker and their employer, the 3rd Filipino novel coronavirus patient in Singapore is linked to a cluster of cases involving the Singapore e-learning company Wizlearn Technologies. (READ: Filipina linked to coronavirus cases in Singapore firm)
The second Filipino coronavirus patient is a 41-year-old domestic worker with no recent travel history to China, Daegu, and Cheongdo. She tested positive for COVID-19 on Saturday, February 29.
Their employer is an anonymous 61-year-old Singaporean who, also on Saturday, was confirmed to have contracted COVID-19.
The Singaporean employer is linked to Case 93, who had earlier been linked to the COVID-19 cases involving Wizlearn Technologies. The MOH said 12 of Singapore’s 108 novel coronavirus patients are linked to this e-learning company.
Earlier, the first Filipino coronavirus case in Singapore was discharged from the hospital. Identified only as Case 89, he was a 41-year-old Singapore permanent resident who was allowed to leave the hospital on Friday, February 28,nearly a week after he tested positive for COVID-19.

MANILA, Philippines – One of the 26 South Koreans in Cebu who flew in from Daegu, South Korea is still being tracked by the Department of Health (DOH), Assistant Secretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said on Monday, March 2.
Daegu, South Korea's fourth-largest city, is the center of the country's coronavirus outbreak. The 26 flew to Cebu on a direct flight from Daegu on February 25, a day before the government imposed a travel ban on South Korea after it saw a sudden spike in coronavirus cases. (READ: South Korea wages 'all-out responses' to virus with 586 new cases)
The following is the status of the 26 South Korean tourists, according to Vergeire:

15 went home to South Korea on Sunday, March 1
2 are going home on Monday, March 2
1 has gone to Angeles City, and is endorsed to the DOH Central Luzon office
7 are still quarantined in Cebu in their respective hotels
1 is ""for verification""

By ""verification,"" Vergeire said that this meant health authorities are still trying to trace him. The man told port officials that he was staying at a particular hotel in Cebu but when the DOH went to look for him, he was not there.
In the regional press conference in Cebu also held on Monday, DOH Region 7 Director Jaime Bernadas said ""everyone is accounted for"" despite the unverified location of one of the 26 Korean tourists.
Bernadas said that there were ""a lot of ways"" the person can be traced. He said that this included the help of local governments, the provincial health office, the different branches of the Philippine National Police, the Bureaus of Investigation and Quarantine, and the private sector including hotel operators.
Bernadas said that 6 of the South Koreans still in Cebu are tourists and have expressed intention to stay longer after the 14-day quarantine period lapses.
Contact tracing
Vergeire explained that contact tracing refers to tracking down the people who came in contact with confirmed coronavirus cases.
The Health official said that since the 26 South Koreans were not showing signs and symptoms of COVID-19, the disease caused by the 2019-nCoV, contact tracing was not required. However, since they came from a coronavirus-hit area, they still have to be monitored by the DOH as a precaution.
As of Monday, there have been 638 cases monitored in the country, although only 43 remain admitted and 592 others have already been discharged. Even with the significant decrease, the DOH said it ""won't let their guard down."" – with reports from Ryan Macasero/Rappler.com

MANILA, Philippines – Ten Filipinos from the coronavirus-hit Diamond Princess cruise ship who showed flu-like symptoms at the New Clark City (NCC) quarantine facility tested negative for the virus, the Department of Health (DOH) said Monday, March 2.
They are among the 14 patients under investigation (PUIs) in NCC. Ten of them manifested sore throat, 3 had a cough, and one had a fever.
The four others are still waiting for the results of their novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) test. 
""We are more than ready to cater to the needs of our kababayans (countrymen) should they test positive for COVID-19. We are also geared up for the possibility of local transmission,"" said Health Secretary Francisco Duque III. 
COVID-19 is the disease caused by the 2019-nCoV, which originated in Wuhan, China. So far, the virus has killed more than 3,000 people worldwide, with 2,912 fatalities in China alone.

There are 458 individuals currently quarantined in the Clark facility, nearly all of whom were from the virus-hit Diamond Princess and were repatriated by the government to the Philippines last week.
The cruise ship was placed under quarantine since February 5 in Yokohama, Japan after passengers tested positive for the new virus, six of whom had died from the disease.

MANILA, Philippines – The Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) said it was seeking clarification on the full scope of the Saudi government's travel ban, following reports that some Filipinos traveling to Saudi Arabia were denied entry over restrictions put in place due to the 2019 novel coronavirus.
""We're quite concerned about reports of the Saudi government's actions with regard to this particular COVID-19 issue.... We are clarifying the scope and existing policy and if there are those negatively affected we will bring (such) cases to the attention of Saudi government,"" DFA Assistant Secretary Eduardo Meñez told reporters in a press briefing in Malacañang on Monday, March 2.
In an unprecedented move, Saudi Arabia earlier announced it was banning ""umrah"" pilgrims from visiting Islam's holiest sites to try to contain the spread of the coronavirus as the number of cases and deaths soared in neighboring Iran.
The kingdom – which hosts millions of pilgrims every year – added it was also suspending visas for tourists visiting from countries where the new virus is a ""danger."" (READ: World 'simply not ready' for virus spread – WHO China mission chief)
But despite restrictions limited to pilgirms and tourist visas, Meñez said the Philippine embassy was monitoring reports of some Filipinos who were supposedly unable to enter the country for other purposes.  
Among those affected by the Saudi government's travel restrictions was House Minority Leader Bienvenido Abante Jr who was supposed to visit and meet with overseas Filipino workers. Abante was in transit in Dubai when his airline informed him he would not be allowed to enter Saudi Arabia due to restrictions barring Filipino tourists from entering due to the coronavirus.
At the time, Meñez said the Philippine government was confirming the “exact details” of the Saudi government's travel ban.
Following the outbreak of the coronavirus, several countries have imposed sweeping travel restrictions in an effort to quell the spread of the virus. The Philippines is so far imposing travel bans with varying degrees of restrictions on China, its administrative regions Macau and Hong Kong, and South Korea.

MANILA, Philippines – The Overseas Workers Welfare Administration (OWWA) said the government has distributed some P84 million in aid to overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) who were stranded in the Philippines due to travel restrictions imposed over the novel coronavirus outbreak.
OWWA Administrator Hans Cacdac gave the figure during a press conference at Malacañang on Monday, March 2.
He said the assistance was given to 8,448 OFWs who were stationed mostly in China, Hong Kong, and Macau.
The Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) earlier announced that each affected worker would receive P10,000. Repatriated OFWs coming from China will also get at least P20,000 from DOLE.
Last February 2, the Philippine government had banned travel to and from China and its administrative regions Hong Kong and Macau. All Filipinos were not allowed to go to the 3 areas, while only Filipinos and permanent resident card holders could enter the Philippines.
The situation left thousands of OFWs stranded in the Philippines, including those who were set to return to work after Chinese New Year and those who were newly deployed. They feared losing their source of income.
The Philippine government later lifted the ban on OFWs, permanent residents, and Filipinos leaving abroad for study in China, Hong Kong, and Macau on February 18.
'No negative signals'
Aside from this, Cacdac said OWWA is ready to assist Filipino workers from the Diamond Princess cruise ship quarantined in Japan, should they wish to permanently stay and work in the Philippines.
But he added that the workers' manning agent assured the government that all workers will be rehired when they are cleared to return to work.
Cacdac also said there have been ""no negative signals"" on possible effects of the coronavirus on the overseas hiring of Filipinos.
""No negative signals in the sense na magbabawas sila o ayaw na nila ng Filipino (that they will lay off workers or will no longer hire Filipinos),"" he said.
Cacdac likewise assured the public that the government has enough funds to continue helping OFWs affected by the coronavirus outbreak.

Health Assistant Secretary Maria Rosario Vergeire told reporters that as of Monday morning, March 2, there have been 638 cases monitored in the Philippines, but only 43 remain admitted while the 592 others have already been discharged.
""This may be attributed to our strengthened surveillance, early travel restrictions, and enhanced laboratory process. But this is not enough reason to let our guard down,"" Vergeire said in a press briefing in Malacañang on Monday.
Vergeire said the DOH is continuously assessing the situation and working to improve health surveillance protocols based on evidence and latest developments related to the coronavirus.
She added that the DOH has geared up for the possibility of local transmission.
Aside from this, Vergeire said the DOH is adopting contingency plans as the World Health Organization raised its risk assessment for the virus to its maximum level of ""very high"" worldwide.
Meanwhile, of the 458 individuals quarantined at New Clark City in Tarlac, 14 have been admitted to health facilities. Of this number, 10 have tested negative for the coronavirus, while health officials are waiting for the results of 4 individuals.
The Philippines earlier recorded 3 confirmed cases of the coronavirus, all Chinese tourists, including the first death outside of China. The other two already recovered and have returned to China.
As for Filipinos abroad, the DOH has recorded 86 Filipinos confirmed to have the coronavirus. This includes 80 from the Diamond Princess cruise ship docked in Japan, 2 in Hong Kong, 2 in Singapore, and 2 in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).
Of the 80 Filipinos in Japan, 48 remain admitted in hospitals while 32 have been discharged. A Filipino remains admitted in both Hong Kong and Singapore. In the UAE, both Filipinos are still in the hospital.

CEBU, Philippines – Cebu Governor Gwendolyn Garcia said that she is against any huge gathering of students in Cebu province so as not to expose the children to risks amid the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak.
Garcia is set to meet with local government units to consult whether or not to go on with scheduled inter-school activities.
“I don’t think it’s really the right time,” Garcia told reporters on Friday, February 28. ""Is it worth the risk? I shall be calling the mayors as soon as I can… next week.”  
Delegates from Cebu province are set to participate in a number of inter-school activities, including the Central Visayas Athletics Association regional meet on March 15 to 12, and the National Schools Press Conference on March 9 to 13.  
Cebu Schools Division Superintendent Marilyn Andales, co-chairperson of the Provincial School Board, said that the final decision whether to let the province participate lies with the regional office of the Department of Education. 
But the province already complied with the prior suggestion of Garcia, which is to bypass elimination and choose delegates among winning athletes from previous years. 
DepEd has already cancelled several scheduled events amid the outbreak. 
Originating from Wuhan, China, the novel coronavirus so far killed over 2,976 and infected over 86,927 people globally.

AKLAN, Philippines – The 11 tourists from South Korea were allowed to return home to Incheon via Kalibo International Airport on February 28 and 29 after they were monitored in Boracay Island without flu-like symptoms.
Madel Joy Tayco, deputy information manager of Malay inter-agency task force against COVID-19, said no people have been diagnosed with the 2019 novel coronavirus (Covid-19) in Malay, Aklan and Boracay Island.
Tayco said that the Koreans were classified as persons under monitoring (PUMs) after the Philippine government banned the entry of visitors on Wednesday, February 26 from South Korea’s North Gyeongsang province.
The Koreans - 6 males and 5 females - were not under mandatory quarantine since they arrived in Boracay Island for vacation on Tuesday, February 25. But Tayco said that the tourists had been medically cleared and took the direct flight out of Aklan to South Korea.
“Zero na tayo sa PUMs na South Koreans, nag check out na sila sa Boracay at bumalik sa South Korea. No PUMs na ibang nationalities, so far (We have zero PUM South Koreans because they have checked out of Boracay and returned to South Korea. We have no PUMs of other nationalities, so far),” Tayco said.
North Gyeongsang province and Daegu, South Korea’s epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak, have tallied over 2,300 confirmed cases of coronavirus, with 13 casualties. (READ: South Korea reports 376 more coronavirus cases, total 3,526)

MANILA, Philippines –  Thousands of workers may lose their jobs in the next 6 months as businesses take a hit from the novel coronavirus disease COVID-19 outbreak, a labor group said on Saturday, February 29.
""TUCP sees 7,000 more layoffs and retrenchments in 6 months amid the growing corona virus outbreak crisis,"" the Trade Union Congress of the Philippines  said in a statement on Saturday.
It made the forecast after Philippine Airlines (PAL)  terminated 300 employees, citing losses incurred because of canceled flights due to the COVID-19 travel bans.
""In TUCP discussions with unions leaders in other industries, they said the PAL retrenchment is just the beginning of the bigger adverse economic effect of the escalating outbreak of COVID-19 phenomenon,"" the labor group said.
TUCP Representative Raymond Mendoza said that based on their assessment, other industries would follow suit and lay off non-essential workers.
""The PAL retrenchment program and the travel bans will trigger more layoffs in several of its supply chains that includes hotels, restaurants, land transport service, logistics, catering and other suppliers of the airlines,"" Mendoza said.
""It is now inevitable that other airlines, to cope with the crisis, will also make similar retrenchments of non-essential jobs which will also affect workers down their supply chains,"" he added.
Mendoza said they would call to reconvene the National Tripartite Industrial Peace Council composed of labor, business and the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE), the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), and the Department of Finance to come up with mitigating measures for the labor impact of COVID-19. 
The TUCP also expected layoffs of Filipino workers in cruise ships, especially cruise lines  hard-hit by the virus.
The labor group said that it is in discussions with shipowners and manning agencies to honor unions' collective bargaining agreements (CBA). In the worst-case scenario, the TUCP said it reminded agencies to ""make a reasonable retrenchment and separation package with those crew who do not have contracts and collective bargaining agreement with them."" – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – The Quezon City government is training its health workers and volunteers on handling biosecurity risks in communities amid the COVID-19 scare.
Following the directive of Mayor Joy Belmonte,  the Quezon City Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Office (QCDRRMC) and the City Health Department taught barangay-based health workers and first responders to prepare the city in the event of an outbreak of the disease caused by the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)
During the training sessions of the  Quezon City Epidemiology and Disease Surveillance Section, members of the city’s Barangay Health Emergency Response Teams (BHERT) would be given instructions on how to properly wear personal protective equipment (PPEs) before directly handling patients under investigation.
“Wearing PPEs involves a tedious process to make sure that the responder is fully protected from possible contamination,” said city epidemiologist Dr Rolando Cruz.
The PPE kits contain anti-fog goggles, disposable latex gloves, disposable plastic shoe cover, disposable coverall, disposable surgical gown, N95 face mask, disposable surgical mask, and disposable head cap.
The QCDRRMC said that so far, more than a hundred BHERT members from 20 out of the city’s 142 barangays have been training. The first training session was held at Barangay Batasan Hills with over 30 participants, and was followed by another session at the newly-opened Regional Evacuation Center in Barangay Fairview.
“Nakakamangha na sa barangay level pa lang may traning na ganito. Handa na tayo sakaling magkaroon ng case na ganito (It’s amazing that we already have these measures starting at the barangay level. We are ready if ever a case hits our area),” Barangay Batasan Hills captain Jojo Abad said after participating in a session.

DIPOLOG CITY, Philippines – As parents threatened to pull out their children from schools after learning of teachers coming home from vacation in Seoul, South Korea, the Dipolog City Schools Division immediately ordered the teachers to go on 14-day self-quarantine. 
“In all, 8 school teachers, a supervisor, and 6 other companions are now on mandatory self-quarantine,” provincial health officer Esmeralda A. Nadela told Rappler on Saturday, February 29.
“We are now coordinating with the Dipolog City Schools Division as we sent surveillance personnel to visit and investigate our persons under monitoring (PUM),” Nadela added.
On February 26, the Philippine government imposed travel restrictions on North Gyeongsang Province in South Korea after detecting a rise of COVID-19 infections. Exempted by the travel restriction are permanent residents in South Korea, those leaving for study, and overseas Filipino workers.
Nadela said she only knew of the teachers from Korea after parents had raised apprehension of sending their children to school.
“Some of the teachers arrived in Cebu on February 26, took a ship and arrived in Dipolog the following day. Some also took the Manila-Dipolog route air travel also on February 26,” Nadela said.
A parent commented: “Dangag kayo aning taga-Dipolog ga-travel anang lugar nga positive sa COVID-19, wala gyud sila gahuna-huna sa atong safety… pwede ra man unta i-postpone bisag nakapalit na silag promo tickets (These teachers from Dipolog are careless, they travel to a place that is positive of COVID-19, they did not think of our safety… They could have postponed their travel even if they already have bought promo tickets).”
Virgilio P. Batan Jr., Dipolog Schools Division assistant superintendent and officer-in-charge of the division, issued Division Order to the teachers and officials concerned to go on mandatory self-quarantine for 14-days.
“As of now, these teachers are not showing symptoms. In case they will – God forbid – they will be immediately transferred to our isolation facility,” Nadela said.
Dipolog City Mayor Darel Dexter Uy also issued a statement on February 29 assuring the people that the city is safe from COVID-19, and that “measures are in place following established protocols issued by the Department of Health, other government agencies, and concerned authorities."" – Rappler.com

AKLAN, Philippines – The inter-agency task force in Malay, Aklan said 11 tourists from South Korea were being closely monitored in case they were infected with the novel coronavirus (COVID-19).
The 11 Koreans – 10 adults and a child – arrived in Boracay Island on February 25 via Kalibo International Airport before the national government imposed a ban against travellers to and from North Gyeongsang province in South Korea.
The tourists came from Daegu, a city in North Gyeongsang province and the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak in South Korea.
The ban also took effect on February 26 for visitors coming from Gyeongbuk, including Cheongdu County. Aside from the South Korean travel ban, the country has an existing travel ban on China and special administrative regions Macau and Hong Kong. 
“Mga persons under monitoring sila (They are persons under monitoring) based on guidelines of Department of Health, but not necessarily quarantine,” said Madel Joy Tayco, deputy information manager of Malay inter-agency task force against COVID-19.
Tayco said the Koreans – comprised of 6 males and 5 females – are the only persons under monitoring (PUMs) in Boracay Island and were being closely monitored by the task force and the Municipal Health Office in their hotels for any signs of the deadly virus.
Majority of South Koreans classified as PUMs left Boracay Island for Incheon, South Korea via Kalibo International Airport on February 28, after undergoing health screenings with the local Bureau of Quarantine.
“Safe na tayo sa mga persons with history of travel in China kasi more than 14 days na from the lockdown. Unless kung galing ang mga turista sa mga bansang affected ng coronavirus case at may fever, cough or cold. So far, walang reports na may signs or symptoms,” Tayco added.

 Central Visayas' Department of Health (DOH) Regional Director Jaime Bernadas said they would also need to track where the persons from Daegu have been in the country so far.  
The task force said the patients were not in the hotels where they said they would be as listed in their health cards.   Because of this, the task force proposed penalties of P5,000 for not putting the correct information in their health cards. 
""This should be a warning. With the help of the GMR (Cebu airport management), we shall be revising the health declaration forms for all international arrivals as well as domestic arrivals,"" Garcia said.
She said that in addition to the fine, she wants prison time as well for health card misrepresentation.
 The 19 Koreans already tracked by the local government are currently under quarantine in their hotel rooms. 
According to the task force, they are being monitored by the Philippine National Police, barangay tanods, hotel management, and DOH personnel.   The persons being monitored were also given the option to return to Daegu instead of completing the quarantine period.
  So far, the 19 are asymptomatic. Once they start showing symptoms, they will immediately be sent to a hospital.   
Garcia also signed a new executive order implementing a 14-day quarantine for Philippine citizens and visa holders who have been to Daegu or North Gyeongsang province in South Korea.   This is in addition to the existing mandatory quarantine on passengers from mainland China and its special administrative regions.

CANCELED. Sara Duterte announces ""with heavy heart"" the cancelation of activities for the 83rd Araw ng Davao, which was slated on March 1-31, 2020. Screengrab from CIO video 
MANILA, Philippines – Mayor Sara Duterte placed Davao City on community quarantine to prevent the spread of the 2019 novel coronavirus through an executive order signed on Sunday, March 15.
The order is “effective immediately,” but it did not specify until when it should take effect.
In an interview with the Davao City Disaster Radio DCDR 87.5 FM, Duterte explained the decision to put the city under quarantine was due to the challenges in coronavirus testing. 
She said that tests are sent to Manila from Davao, and the results take about 2 days to come out.
“I don’t think we should wait (for a patient to test positive) before we declare a community quarantine,” Duterte said.
Under the executive order, community quarantine rules require people to stay in their homes and only leave for work, food or medicine, take out garbage, or go to the hospital.
Mass gatherings are suspended as well, including religious activities and classes from kindergarten to postgraduate studies.
Private companies are required to prepare and implement flexible working arrangements for their employees. Online meetings and online bank transactions are likewise required. Government work, however, is not suspended.
Employees coming from other areas may enter the city, provided that they undergo the necessary screening procedures. 
Moreover, residents are required to get services and buy goods online from local suppliers only.
Public transportation and cargo deliveries, meanwhile, are allowed.
One step away from lockdown
Duterte also said that a community quarantine was ""one step away from a lockdown"". She said that an infectious diseases expert explained to the Davao City government that a lockdown is imposed when there is already a confirmed COVID-19 case in the area.
""She [infections diseases expert] said that a lockdown means controlling the spread of the disease to other areas,"" Duterte said, adding that this was why the national government had to make the ""difficult decision"" of controling land, sea, and air travel in and out of Metro Manila where there are confirmed COVID-19 cases.

MANILA, Philippines – Pasig City will begin enforcing a curfew Sunday night, March 15, as part of efforts to prevent the novel coronavirus from further spreading.
The nightly curfew will be from 8 pm to 5 am the following morning.
Pasig Mayor Vico Sotto announced this on Sunday morning through a live social media broadcast as he inspected checkpoints along the city’s border with the municipality of Taytay, Rizal.
Sotto inspected other entry points to the city, which lies along the eastern flank of Metro Manila, now on community quarantine following a sudden spike in the number of confirmed cases of the coronavirus.
Everyone in Pasig is expected to stay indoors during the curfew hours, but Sotto said there will be exemptions for:

People going to work or returning home from work
People buying food or essential supplies
People responding to emergencies
People traveling for medical or health reasons

“If you can stay home, please stay home,” Sotto urged his constituents.
Sotto said the Pasig City Council had already passed the curfew ordinance, and he was returning to city hall after inspecting the checkpoints to sign it.
The cities of Manila and Muntinlupa have also passed similar ordinances.
On Saturday, March 14, the Metro Manila Council (MMC) agreed to enforce a curfew throughout the metropolis to accompany the community quarantine imposed by the national government. The MMC includes the capital region’s 17 mayors.
Interior Secretary Eduardo Año said curfew violators who refuse to go home or stay indoors when ordered could be arrested. Justice Secretary Menardo Guevarra however said such a rule cannot be enforced unless the local government legislates the curfew through an ordinance.
Even then, a local government ordinance normally only takes effect 15 days after it is published in newspapers or other media generally accessible to the constituency concerned.
This means although a curfew may be implemented, authorities cannot yet arrest and detain violators. – Rappler.com "

,"March 15, 2020",nCov,[OPINION] We have to support our health workers,Tristan Lugod,"
 
 
It’s been 9 years since I last wore my nurse’s uniform. Though I left this profession a long time ago, I feel that my instincts as a nurse have somewhat remained. This is why after learning of the widespread measures implemented in response to the new coronavirus outbreak, I couldn’t help but worry about the immediate future. I worry for my personal health, my family, my friends, my job, the health workers battling the outbreak, the economy. I worry about the general state of our country, really.
The health of a person is ultimately tied to the realities of his country. I realized this the hard way when back in college I witnessed firsthand the sad state of our health system. I had my training in a number of public hospitals and signs of the harsh reality were ubiquitous: doctors and nurses with their heavy workload, inadequate compensation, low supplies, heightened occupational risk, emotional and psychological burnout. I still recall how in some parts patients could not afford basics like disposable syringes and gloves while hospitals had limited stocks. Health workers had to be creative and resourceful, keeping their hands and minds busy for ways to bridge gaps. Whatever policies in place were not enough, and both health worker and patient suffered. The pain of my patient who couldn’t buy her medicine and the fatigue of my mentors can be ultimately traced to the problems that beset our health institutions.
Now that Filipinos scramble to brace themselves against the outbreak, these memories come back to haunt me. If on any given day our public hospitals are at risk of being overwhelmed, what more if the number of patients rises to the thousands? The health system has improved in some ways over the last years. An increase in government nurses’ salary has been mandated, for instance. But such victories were hard-fought and fraught with new setbacks. New nurses are inducted every year, but many also leave for better prospects on foreign shores. Just last year, the country’s health fund for 2020 was slashed by P10 billion, which undoubtedly further burdened our already beleaguered health system. The budget cut was criticized then when the country faced outbreaks of polio, measles, and dengue. But this misstep seems glaring in light of the current outbreak. It can be argued that no one could have foretold a pandemic was imminent, but prudence dictates that skimping on public health is always a risky move.
We Filipinos are resilient. We’ve endured conflicts, plagues, and disasters throughout history. Still here we are, looking forward to tomorrow with high hopes, our resolute morale our defining trait. But as we face this challenge, one that may turn out to be our greatest in many years, can we really bank on just our resilience? Will our fighting spirit suffice? This country cannot thrive if its health system is fragile by default. Each health crisis like the one in our midst today could leave the country reeling and weaker. It’s a very dangerous game we play when resiliency is our only card. The day may come when we encounter a crisis where the odds are stacked against us and the numbers are less forgiving.
A strong and efficient health system is by no means the only key to a flourishing country. But it certainly is one of its foundations. The fact that we now look to our experts, health workers, and institutions for guidance and solutions emphasizes the crucial role they play in our lives. But how will the health system serve the people if it is weighed down?
As I write this, I do my best to allay my fears. I tell myself that there is hope and that we shall overcome. Good news helps, including the development of more affordable test kits by Filipino scientists from the University of the Philippines. But I’m also reminded of the sacrifices of our health workers and experts  – the long hours they bear, the risks they brave, the exhaustion they feel, their race against time, and it leads me to a single conclusion: things must change for our health system not just for the current outbreak but for all crises to come.
I do not pretend to know the answer to this predicament, but perhaps part of it is showing our support to our health workers. We must bear in mind that health workers’ struggle is everyone’s struggle, and we must find ways big and small to advocate for their welfare, from sincere expressions of gratitude to supporting concrete policies that improve their working conditions. The government and those in positions of power, in particular, must take the long view and prioritize the provision of essential resources. Uplifting our health workers uplifts our health system, and uplifting our health system uplifts our country. – Rappler.com

MANILA, Philippines – Vehicle traffic began to build up near some government checkpoints on roads connecting Metro Manila to neighboring provinces, as a ""community quarantine"" or lockdown of the megacity began on Sunday morning, March 15.
The measure is meant to prevent the novel coronavirus from spreading further. Most confirmed cases of the disease were recorded in the capital region.
Health workers, police, the military, and barangay patrols are the frontliners in the effort that began at midnight. By morning, the inroads to Metro Manila started getting congested as inspectors struggled to keep up with the number of people passing by checkpoints.
Of the relatively few temperature scanners inspectors had at midnight, some had lost power or stopped working by morning. The point of the inspections is to detect fevers – one of the primary symptoms of the coronavirus.

At the border between San Pedro, Laguna and Tunasan, Muntinlupa, commuters pile up as police conduct identification checks and ask people their purpose for traveling. The first few hours of the lockdown is largely seen as a dry run for guidelines, to limit the movement of people into and out of the Metro Manila until April 14. 
Although commuters are inconvenienced, some share they are willing to cooperate to keep one another safe.

AWARENESS. Officers from the Bureau of Jail Management and Penology conducts an awareness seminar regarding novel coronavirus to detainees in Manila City Jail on March 12, 2020. Photo by Lisa Marie David/Rappler 
MANILA, Philippines – Families of political prisoners appeal to the Duterte administration to mass release inmates and detainees inside congested facilities in the face of the novel coronavirus outbreak in the Philippines. 
In an open letter, KAPATID spokesperson Fides Lim said that the government should adopt the ""Iran solution"" for Philippine prisons as the number of confirmed coronavirus cases increases by the day. 
Iran said it will temporarily release 54,000 people from prisons in a bid to stop the spread of virus. 
According to KAPATID, prisoners who are low-offenders, elderlies, sick, and ""accidental victims of political arrests,"" among others, should be released.
""This is not only an urgent matter of life and death but also of justice,"" Lim said, adding that the group is ready to cooperate and dialogue with authorities to move forward with the proposal. 
The Philippines' prison system has long been the picture of overcrowded facilities, and groups are afraid that the dire situation will make persons deprived of liberty (PDLs) vulnerable to the coronavirus. 
As of January 2020, the Bureau of Corrections has a 310% congestion rate, with 49,114 PDLs scattered across its 7 facilities that only have a total maximum capacity of 11,981. 
Data from the Bureau of Jail Management and Penology (BJMP) as of October 2019, meanwhile, shows that 380 out of its 467 jails are congested, posing a 450% congestion rate which translates to 6 detainees occupying space only meant for one. 
As of Saturday, March 14, the Department of Health (DOH) confirmed a total of 111 cases in the country, with 8 people dying so far. 
""While we recognize the health basis for the lockdown of jails, we maintain that NO prison is a closed environment because prison personnel come and go inside the facilities, exposing the already most vulnerable to the spread of infection,"" Lim said. 
Below is the full open letter, with emphases provided by Kapatid.
OPEN LETTER OF APPEAL FOR AN “IRAN SOLUTION” FOR PHILIPPINE PRISONS 
To:Executive Secretary Salvador MedialdeaDepartment of Justice Secretary Menardo GuevarraBureau of Corrections Director General Gerald Bantag 
Bureau of Jail Management and Penology Director Allan Iral

The Philippine prison system has the highest congestion rate in the world at 605%. Overcrowded cells and the direst lack of the barest essentials for health—nutritious food, clean drinking water, adequate medical care, and even soap—have resulted in steep death rates in the country’s 933 prisons that house a total population of 188,278 inmates, where 75.1% are pre-trial detainees.
The Bureau of Jail Management and Penology (BJMP), which supervises jails for those undergoing investigation and trial, said its death rate is 300 to 800 inmates a year. This means 1 to 2 prisoners die every day in BJMP jails. The Bureau of Corrections (BuCor) said about 20% percent of the 26,000 inmates at the New Bilibid Prison (NBP), Muntinlupa die annually, a situation which the NBP hospital head during Senate hearings last October described as “critical” when compared to global standards. The BuCor says this amounts to 1 death every day at the NBP but the BuCor’s own figures in fact indicate that 5,200 inmates at the NBP die every year or 14 every day.
GIVEN THE HIGH CONGESTION AND MORTALITY RATES OF THE PRISON SYSTEM, SHOULD THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT WAIT BEFORE THE DEADLY COVID-19 UNLEASHES EVEN MORE CATASTROPHIC CONSEQUENCES INSIDE PHILIPPINE JAILS?
KAPATID, the support organization of political prisoners in the Philippines, calls on the national government to immediately adopt the IRAN SOLUTION wherein the Iranian government has been releasing en masse thousands of prisoners to control the rising death toll from the new coronavirus. As of March 9, the Iranian government has already released 70,000 prisoners. Meantime, we cannot turn a blind eye to the prison riots spreading in Italy as prisoners in desperation decry the impact of the lockdown on prison facilities, which they fear puts their lives in greater danger of contamination because of poor prison conditions.
KAPATID appeals to the Philippine government, in particular the Office of the President, the Department of Justice, the BuCor and the BJMP, to initiate immediate steps for the MASS RELEASE of low-level offenders as in the Iran example, plus the very elderly and the very sick, the accidental victims of political arrests or what GRP Peace Panel head Sec. Silvestre Bello terms as “riders” (sabit), and one spouse from each of the ten political prisoner couples to allow one to care for the other and many of whom are also mere “riders” in political arrests. 
We are ready to dialogue with you at the soonest time. The regulations, mechanics, and procedure for this forward measure, whether on temporary release as in the Iran solution, can be defined by the Department of Justice as the lead agency. As we have proposed, the KAPATID network of support from among university human rights centers and legal and paralegal volunteers can readily be harnessed to immediately fast-track this effort to secure the lives of Filipino prisoners. 
This is not only an urgent matter of life and death but also of justice. Let us note the Supreme Court’s own data of a 71.77% judicial error rate on death penalty cases—wrongful convictions by courts, affecting especially prisoners belonging to the lowest socioeconomic class. A Free Legal Assistance Group study also reports a high judicial error rate of illegal arrests, ranging from 73% to 90%. This simply means that over half of the prison population should not even be in jail because of the broken judicial system. And they especially include the 601 political prisoners, who are victims of manufactured charges such as planted firearms and explosives and baseless common crimes designed to criminalize them and lock them up in indefinite detention.   
KAPATID likewise appeals to the BuCor and BJMP to immediately and regularly supply prisoners with soap to help battle COVID-19, ensure clean water especially drinking water and nutritious food, and immediately upgrade health facilities, resources, and protocols, especially the number of medical doctors and nurses and the provision of medicines as well as maintenance medicines for prisoners with chronic illnesses. 
While we recognize the health basis for the lockdown of jails, we maintain that NO prison is a closed environment because prison personnel come and go inside the facilities, exposing the already most vulnerable to the spread of infection. We thus press the BuCor and the BJMP to (1) adopt procedures per prison facility to allow families of political prisoners and common prisoners to pass on maintenance medicines, soap and detergent, and food to help our loved ones SURVIVE this public health crisis, and (2) issue regular bulletins about the status of prisoners, including political prisoners who are particularly most vulnerable because of repeated measures singling them out for harassment.  
Yet we stress, only a forward-looking strategy like the Iran solution of MASS RELEASE of prisoners as enumerated can protect congested, ill-equipped prisons from the rapid spread of COVID-19. Implement this NOW, please, before more lives are exposed and succumb to its contagion.

MANILA, Philippines – At most boundaries surrounding Metro Manila, crossing from one city to another means leaving a quarantined area and moving into a space where movement is generally unrestricted and the daily grind remains as is, save for extra precautions against the coronavirus.
But it was a different scenario when pedestrians or motorists crossed the border between Metro Manila and the town of Cainta in Rizal. The first-class municipality is also under quarantine after it recorded at least 3 cases – 2 of which resulted in death – of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.
The town’s quarantine started on March 15, coinciding with the implementation of a lockdown on Metro Manila.
It took a few minutes before personnel – a mix of policemen, barangay officials, and barangay health workers – sprang into action past midnight at the border of Marikina City and Cainta along the Marikina-Infanta Highway. No less than Police Major Carlo Caceres, the town’s acting police chief, and Barangay San Isidro chief Ricardo Licup, manned this checkpoint into Cainta.
Municipal Mayor Kit Nieto dropped by later on, completing the all-star cast of officials manning the main entry point from Marikina to Cainta.
The process was straightforward: police, the checkpoint frontliners, flagged vehicles and asked drivers and passengers for their IDs and purpose for entering Cainta. Once it was established that their movement was necessary – because they either live in Cainta or had important business there – they were let in, but not before a temperature check by the barangay’s health workers. Anyone with a fever was supposed to be referred to a nearby doctor for further evaluation.
It was a simple process that somehow got cut short on vehicles with more than two wheels. Passengers of trucks, and jeepneys, for some reason, didn't get their temperatures checked. It was a strange quirk, considering the quarantines – over both Metro Manila and Cainta – are meant to prevent the spread of the virus.

According to Nieto, the checkpoint wasn’t there to screen people coming in and going out of Cainta, but to determine the purpose of their movement. “Kasi if we do the thermal scanning sa lahat ng pasahero baka hindi na matapos yung ginagawa natin, baka mag umaga siya na ‘di natin nachecheck. There’s another group that handles that. Pero primarily ang pagpunta rito nila ang tinatanong namin – what is your purpose for entering our town?” he told Rappler past midnight on March 15.
(If we do thermal scanning on all passengers, this is going to take forever. The sun will be up before we’re done checking. There’s another group that handles that. But our primary purpose here is to ask: what is your purpose for entering our town?)
“There is a quarantine declaration in our town which means kung hindi masyadong importante ang lakad mo o hindi siya something that’s connected with employment or emergency or health issues, parang unwelcome ka ngayon,” he added.
(There is a quarantine declaration in our town which means if your purpose for entering Cainta isn’t that important or is not connected with employment, or an emergency, or health issues, you’re unwelcome here.)
But a few kilometers away at the Cainta-Pasig City border along Ortigas Avenue Extension, the checkpoint protocols were noticeably stricter. At this checkpoint, Department of Health and Cainta officials painstakingly scanned the temperatures of each commuter and passenger, whether they were inside jeepneys, private cars, trucks, or on motorcycles.
The result? An unbelievably long line of vehicles waiting to enter Cainta from Pasig City. “Pagpasensyahin niyo na lang ito (Please be patient),” Cainta town personnel said as they scanned the IDs and temperatures of each passenger.
The variation in the standards of the two checkpoints wasn’t unique to Cainta and its borders.
Around Metro Manila, local officials, police, and military differed in the implementation of a quarantine on the megacity – something the government will need to address.
Within Cainta, Nieto has implemented various measures – from thermal temperature scans, regular sanitation, the banning of all public gatherings, and the distribution of supplements, among others.
But when you must make adjustments for economic reasons and borders are as porous as the ones between Cainta and the rest of Metro Manila, municipal-wide efforts need to be complemented by its neighbors'.

“There’s no 100% foolproof thing considering how many we are and how many personnel we can tap to handle this perfectly,” said Nieto, when asked if the inconsistency in temperature scans at the border was a cause for concern.
“That’s exactly why I’m here. So that I'll know what adjustments to make, so if at least we get to cover 90%, I think that’s reason for us to be thankful that the quarantine is in effect and is implemented properly,” he said.
The lockdown on Metro Manila is set to end on April 14, although it might be cut short or extended, depending on the coronavirus Inter-Agency Task Force’s recommendations. During the month-long “community quarantine,” only “essential” movement within Metro Manila is encouraged, public gatherings are prohibited, classes are suspended, and the executive branch of the government operates with a skeletal staff. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – Across Metro Manila on Sunday, March 15, local officials, police, barangay workers, and health personnel differed in the implementation of ""community quarantine"" checkpoints meant to minimize movement to and from the megacity.
It is an attempt to abate the spread of the novel coronavirus.
But there were differences in the way the quarantine was enforced even within the same locality – in this case, Cainta in Rizal.
Here’s how the first day of the quarantine – for both Metro Manila and Cainta – turned out, and how commuters should brace themselves for the inevitable heavy traffic at the checkpoints. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – President Rodrigo Duterte ordered to place Metro Manila under a lockdown or “community quarantine” to contain the novel coronavirus. But on the first day of its implementation, it's not difficult to find exits that do not have temperature checks.
In North Luzon Expressway, vehicles can freely go to Marilao, Bulacan, as the exit does not have a checkpoint.
Vehicles can also freely go back to the city without showing documents through the Balintawak exit.

MANILA, Philippines – On the stroke of midnight, the area of over 12 million people was placed in a state of ""community quarantine,"" which involves a ban on land, domestic air, and domestic sea travels in and out of the region.
The Metro Manila lockdown was announced by President Rodrigo Duterte on Thursday, March 12, after declaring that the alert level for the coronavirus has been raised to its maximum level of Code Red Sublevel 2.
Thousands of policemen in combat uniform stand guard along roads that connect Metro Manila to its adjacent provinces, namely: Cavite, Laguna, Rizal, and Bulacan. Troops from the military's Joint Task Force-NCR were also deployed.
Here was how Metro Manila's border looked like during the start of the first massive lockdown in the country in recent history:

MANILA, Philippines– On the first day of lockdown or the so-called ""community quarantine"" of Metro Manila, different checkpoints in several cities had their own ways of implementing rules to contain the novel coronavirus.
Frontline personnel still needed more details on how to enforce President Rodrigo Duterte's orders. Commuters likewise asked for clarifications. (READ: What we know so far: The Metro Manila coronavirus lockdown)
NLEX
In Balintawak, Quezon City, motorists heading toward the North Luzon Expressway (NLEX) were randomly stopped by police for temperature checks. Chosen drivers and passengers were also asked about the nature of their travel.
Rappler noticed that buses that contained many passengers were not asked to stop for the checkpoint. Police seemed to be inclined to stopping taxis, trucks carrying food, motorcycle riders, and small private vehicles.
Most drivers were not asked to show identification cards or proof of employment.
Moreover, there seemed to be no checkpoints for vehicles passing through the NLEX-Balintawak exit to get to the city.
Meanwhile were no checkpoints to monitor vehicles going in and out of NLEX and Marilao, Bulacan.
From the NLEX-Marilao entrance, vehicles can easily get to other areas like San Jose del Monte, which connects to Caloocan City and Novaliches, Quezon City.
Valenzuela City
In a checkpoint along MacArthur Highway, Valenzuela City, dozens of military personnel stopped most motorists and asked for IDs.
""Strictly no ID, no entry,"" said Region 3 Police Director Rhodel Sermonia.
Individuals with no IDs have to show proof of employment.
Cainta, Marikina

In the Cainta-Marikina border, temperature checks are only for those on motorcycles and not four-wheel vehicles.
""The purpose of the questioning here is to know why they’re going to Cainta and why they are leaving Cainta. That’s actually the quarantine procedure that we’re trying to implement,"" said Cainta Mayor Kit Nieto.
""If we do thermal scanning on all passengers, this is going to take forever. The sun will be up before we’re done checking. There’s another group that handles that. But our primary purpose here is to ask: what is your purpose for entering our town?,"" he said in a mix of English and Filipino.
Barangay San Isidro, Cainta chief Ricardo Licup said they turned away a taxi, since the passenger's ID revealed that he is a resident of a town in Mindanao town and he only wanted to visit a friend.

Hours before the lockdown was to take effect, checkpoints were no where to be seen across major thoroughfares cutting through Muntinlupa – the southernmost border of Metro Manila. 
Police at the boundary of San Pedro Laguna, and Barangay Tunasan, Muntinlupa arrived around 11 pm to put in prep barricades used to create one lane for commuters to go through. People coming to and from Muntinlupa were unsure of the specifics of the lockdown and asked police what they needed to have before entering and exiting Laguna. 
Police allowed vehicles to pass through until 11:59 pm of Saturday. At the stroke of midnight on Sunday, police placed a sign to mark the checkpoint. 
Rappler noticed jeepneys contained less passengers, while most commuters were ready with proper identification cards and certificates of employment. 
Only one health worker was present as police on sight assited with temperature checks on each passenger. 
Police stopped every vehicle passing through and asked each commuter to show their IDs. Those who did not have IDs or essential travel to metro Manila were turned away. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – In an attempt to arrest the spread of the novel coronavirus in the Philippines, the Duterte government began on Sunday, March 15, its lockdown of Metro Manila, the country's most populous and developed region.
Effective Sunday midnight, the area of over 12 million people was placed in a state of ""community quarantine,"" which involves a ban on land, domestic air, and domestic sea travels in and out of the region.
While the lockdown is intended for a month, until April 14, Malacañang said the inter-agency task force leading government efforts in dealing with the coronavirus outbreak could recommend to President Rodrigo Duterte an earlier termination or extension of the lockdown. (READ: What we know so far: The Metro Manila coronavirus lockdown)
The lockdown covers 16 cities and one municipality of Metro Manila, as prescribed by the Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF) for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases. 
The government imposed the measure after recorded coronavirus cases in the country spiked from 6 to 111 cases in a span of one week ,from March 7 to 14. Most of the cases are in Metro Manila.
How will the lockdown work? Thousands of combat uniform-wearing cops have been allotted to stand guard in roads that connect Metro Manila to its adjacent provinces, namely: Cavite, Laguna, Rizal, and Bulacan.
As of 11:30 pm of Saturday, PNP Director for Operations Major General Emmanuel Licup said they had identified 76 checkpoint spots. He did not disclose their locations.
The cops have been tasked to keep people from leaving and entering the region, unless they fit the government's list of exemptions, including workers, health personnel, authorized government officials, and people traveling for medical and humanitarian reasons. Check the list here.
Metro Manila police chief Major General Debold Sinas earlier said cops would close down small roads while establishing checkpoints along major roads and highways.
Sinas said in the same briefing that police would arrest trespassers and charge them with violating the Revised Penal Code and the quarantine law. It is unclear how cops will enforce this.
The military, meanwhile, said they would be on standby to assist the police. – Rappler.com "

BAGUIO CITY, Philippines – Cordillera recorded its first confirmed case of COVID-19 after test results came out positive today for a balikbayan from Manabo, Abra.
Abra Governor Joy Bernos said that the overseas Filipino worker (OFW) acted recklessly and ignored probable symptoms of COVID-19 like fever and coughing and attended the Kawayan Festival parade in Bangued last March 8. The event was graced by top celebrities.
The results from a La Union hospital came out only this Saturday, March 14 and were positive.
Bernos said that there might be confusion because the hospital where the test was taken was located in Region I while the result was given to DOH Ilocos. Abra, however, though located in Cordillera can only be accessed by going through Ilocos Sur.
Bernos said that the OFW was already a Person Under Investigation (PUI) and was suffering from fever when he went to La Union.
While there, he decided to get himself tested at a hospital in San Fernando City, La Union. 
She said that because of his 'recklessness', 3 municipalities will now be put under surveillance. This includes the capital town of Bangued, Sallapadan where he briefly stayed and his native town of Manabo.

SINGAPORE – The number of Filipinos with the novel coronavirus in Singapore rose to 9 on Saturday, March 14, after two more, one of whom recently visited the Philippines, were diagnosed with COVID-19. 
Singapore’s 205th case of the novel coronavirus disease is a 30-year-old Filipina who visited the Philippines from February 27 to March 6, according to the city-state’s Ministry of Health (MOH). She holds a long-term visit pass in Singapore. 
Case 205 was confirmed to have COVID-19 on Saturday morning, and is now confined in an isolation room at Singapore’s National Center for Infectious Diseases (NCID).
Singapore classified her as an “imported case,” which means she contracted COVID-19 outside the city-state.
The other Filipino coronavirus case on Saturday, Case 211, is also a long-term visit pass holder. Aged 35, she was diagnosed with COVID-19 on Saturday, and is likewise confined at NCID. 
Case 211 is linked to Case 142, who was linked to a cluster involving a private dinner at Safra Jurong in Singapore. 
Don't travel to PH
The new Filipino cases in Singapore come as the city-state cautions its nationals against traveling to the Philippines. The MOH said the Philippines is one of the countries that have exported coronavirus cases to Singapore.
On Saturday, another new coronavirus case in Singapore was reported to be linked to an earlier Filipino patient.
The MOH said Case 190, a 53-year-old Singaporean without any travel history to affected countries, is linked to Case 172, a 42-year-old Filipina worker in Singapore. Case 172 had visited the Philippines from February 27 to March 2.
Meanwhile, the MOH said one of the earliest Filipino coronavirus patients in Singapore – Case 102 – has fully recovered and has been discharged from the hospital as of Saturday. Case 102 is a domestic helper whose employer and Filipina co-worker in the same household contracted COVID-19.
Singapore has had 212 novel coronavirus cases as of Saturday.
Of this number, 105, including two Filipinos, have fully recovered from COVID-19, while 11 remain in critical condition. Singapore has recorded zero deaths since reporting its first case of the novel coronavirus on January 23.
The Philippines has had 111 cases of the novel coronavirus, including 8 deaths, as of Saturday, after the number of patients rose exponentially in the past few days, prompting a lockdown of Metro Manila. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – Health authorities continue to ramp up efforts to detect possible cases of the novel coronavirus in the Philippines.
The Department of Health (DOH) tracker showed that at least 914 patients have been probed as of 10 am on Saturday, March 14.
Out of this number:

153 - admitted to hospitals
697 - discharged from hospitals

The tracker also reflected only 64 confirmed cases so far, but by Saturday evening, DOH announced 34 more cases.
Of the 111 confirmed cases, 98 are currently admitted to hospitals, 5 have been discharged, and 8 have died, according to the tracker.
President Rodrigo Duterte declared a state of public health emergency in the Philippines on March 9 due to the confirmation of local transmission of the virus.

Since the outbreak began, at least 103 Filipinos outside the Philippines have contracted the virus. These include 80 from a cruise ship docked in Japan, 7 in Singapore, 5 in Hong Kong, 2 in the United Arab Emirates, 2 in Lebanon, 6 from a luxury cruise ship docked in California, and one Filipino diplomat at the United Nations in New York.

DAVAO CITY, Philippines – A total lockdown of Davao City was discussed by the local Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF) during its latest meeting on Saturday, March 14, Mayor Sara Duterte said.
Speaking over city-run Davao City Disaster Radio (DCDR), Duterte said that the scenario, where movement in and out of the city will be prohibited, was considered although it might not happen soon.
“We were briefed by an expert from the Department of Health (DOH), who told us that we should prepare for that eventuality,” the mayor, President Duterte's eldest daughter, said. 
The chief executive spends considerable time in Davao City since taking office in June 2016. 
President Duterte placed the entire Metro Manila in a ""community quarantine"" from March 15 to April 14 in an effort to contain the spread of the virus. (READ: What we know so far: The Metro Manila coronavirus lockdown)
The coronavirus cases in the Philippines spiked to 111 as of 9pm of March 14. Eight of the COVID-19 patients have died.
Mayor Duterte said that the IATF will be preparing a guideline that will be implemented in the event of a lockdown.
“This will serve as our guide in implementing restrictions when we adopt them,” Duterte said.
Duterte admitted that it is not easy to implement the lockdown of the city, considering that it plays a major role in the trade and economy of neighboring areas.
“There are many things and service that are only available here. So we have considered that,"" she said.
Duterte said that what was agreed was that a community quarantine will be implemented on a case to case basis.
For example, if there is only one COVID-19 case reported, only the area where it was reported would be subjected to community quarantine. COVID-19 is the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. 
“But if we register two cases in different areas, that's the time that we will be declaring a city-wide community quarantine, similar to what is being implemented in Metro Manila,” Duterte said. 
For now, the contents of guideline No. 8 are being strictly observed.
These include a prohibition on residents from traveling outside the city while incoming travelers were discouraged to pursue their plans amid the coronavirus scare. (READ: Davao City closes borders due to coronavirus outbreak)
Aside from banning residents from traveling to other areas, the city government also asked ""short term visitors to leave Davao City immediately."" 
The advisory will be in effect ""until after the State of Public Health Emergency is lifted.""
Duterte also indefinitely suspended the night market on Roxas Avenue starting Thursday, March 12. 
All parks and playgrounds were also ordered shut and events were discouraged. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – Pasig City government employees will be receiving their full salaries despite reduced operations during the ""enhanced community quarantine,"" Mayor Vico Sotto said on Tuesday, March 17.
Sotto issued Executive Order No. PCG-15, which identified ""alternative work arrangements"" for the different departments and branches of Pasig's local government.
Workers of non-essential units will be allowed to work from home. Others, such as the Office of the Mayor and the Public Information Office, will maintain a skeleton workforce.
Emergency response and essential service units will be in full operation, including the City Health Office, the Rescue Emergency Disaster Center, the City Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Office, and the Traffic and Parking Management Office.
But whatever their work arrangement, all of the city government's workers, including casual employees, will be paid their full salaries.
""'Wag kayong mag-alala, tuloy-tuloy kayong makakatanggap ng buong sweldo – kahit 'yung mga job order na 'no work, no pay.' Gagawan natin ng paraan. Basta, mag-ingat, at hangga't maaari sa bahay lang muna kayo,"" the mayor told Pasig's local government workers in a social media post.

,"March 17, 2020",nCov,[OPINION] Ceasefire in the time of coronavirus,Soliman M. Santos Jr,"
 
 
Love in the time of coronavirus, just like love in the time of cholera, has already happened and will likely continue to happen. How about a ceasefire on the warfront between the Philippine government/armed forces and the communist-led rebels in this time of coronavirus? (READ: Duterte asks NPA for ceasefire during coronavirus lockdown)
It has happened before, on a temporary and short-term basis, during some particularly destructive natural calamities, although mostly on a regional level. Well, this current virus is now a global pandemic. The Philippines is now under a public health emergency – to be clear, according to President Duterte, not martial law – although the military and police are being mobilized to backstop (employ reasonable force, if necessary) the new national emergency response under a civilian-led Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Disease (IATF-EID).
Given that new priority for the military and police, it should be in their interest that there be a temporary ceasefire (or at least a mutual suspension of military offensives) between them and the communist rebels (New People’s Army, NPA) until the coronvirus threat has been contained. 
However, the coronavirus emergency refocusing and redeployment (if substantial) of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) and the Philippine National Police (PNP) is also a tempting scenario for the NPA to further intensify its tactical offensives, as it has long called for since the collapse of the peace talks in 2018.
Any redeployment of big units of the AFP from the countryside to the National Capital Region of Metro-Manila (maybe the AFP version of “surrounding the cities from the countryside”) will leave some vacuum in the countryside that the NPA would normally take advantage of, such as by all the more attacking “softer” targets like the PNP and paramilitary units (Citizens Armed Forces Geographical Unit, Cafgu), which could no longer rely on immediate AFP reinforcements. 
Humanitarian considerations
But perhaps the military calculus – for both sides – should not be the only or main determinant of policy decisions and courses of action in this military matter. Humanitarian considerations can sometimes trump (pun intended) military considerations. 
This looks like one of those times. There are also – to be realpolitik about it – political (including political correctness) and propaganda considerations. What action – continuing armed hostilities or a ceasefire – will win the hearts and minds of the people? Which army is the one helping them deal with this coronavirus threat to their health and their very lives? What is the point in saving people’s lives from the virus but killing perhaps just as many persons in armed hostilities?    
A ceasefire in a time of coronavirus would be in accordance with the spirit, if not the letter, of international humanitarian law. 
For example, there is Article 56 on hygiene and public health in occupied territories under the 1949 Geneva Convention No. V on Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War that is an international armed conflict: “To the fullest extent of the means available to it, the Occupying Power has the duty of ensuring and maintaining, with the cooperation of national and local authorities, the medical and hospital establishments and services, public health, and hygiene in the occupied territory, with particular reference to the adoption and application of prophylactic and preventive measures necessary to combat the spread of contagious diseases and epidemics….  In adopting measures of health and hygiene and in their implementation, the Occupying Power shall take into consideration the moral and ethical susceptibilities of the population of the occupied territory.” (boldface emphasis supplied) 
Interestingly, both the Philippine government and the National Democratic Front of the Philippines (NDFP), including its ruling Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) and its main armed force NPA, are on record as adhering to the 1949 Geneva Conventions. And so, in this time of coronavirus, they should be combating the spread of the virus rather than combating their enemy combatants.
Those 'isms'
On a higher philosophical plane or perspective of Maoist dialectics, there comes a time when the contradiction between man and nature takes precedence over the contradiction between man and man (forgive the use of this term rather than the gender-neutral humankind). The longtime principal contradictions between the people of the world and US imperialism globally, and between the Filipino people and the Philippine state now under the “US-Duterte fascist regime” locally, becomes secondary to the new current principal contradiction between the people of the world and coronavirus (if not yet between the people of the world and climate change).  
US imperialism, Chinese imperialism, the Duterte administration, and the CPP-NPA-NDFP can become tactical allies, even if strange bedfellows, against the coronavirus. Resolve this new current principal contradiction first, then go back to the erstwhile principal contradictions, to your protracted people’s war, to your EO No. 70 whole-of-nation approach to end the local communist armed conflict, business as usual.       
Finally, if all other rationalization fails, just have some consideration for the advanced ages (and stages) and pre-existing state of health (classified information that has been occasionally subjected to fake news) of the current acknowledged leaders of your two sides – President Rodrigo Roa Duterte, nearing 75, and his Professor Jose Maria Sison, 81. They are among the elderly most vulnerable to the coronavirus. 
Perhaps, good old Pinoy cultural deference to and care for our elders can be reason enough for a ceasefire in a time of coronavirus. Coronabonus: this might help build some confidence for the so far urong-sulong resumption of the peace talks. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – No more ifs, and, or buts – the Department of Justice (DOJ) made it  clear on Tuesday, March 17, that if you are found outside your house and you are not among the narrow exemptions of the Luzon lockdown, then you can be arrested even without a warrant.
""The offense a person may be committing and be held accountable for will depend on each case. But for so long as the en flagrante delicto doctrine is applicable, law enforcers will have a ground to arrest,"" DOJ Spokesperson Undersecretary Markk Perete said on Tuesday.
En flagrante delicto is ""caught in the act,"" one of the conditions under the Rules of Criminal Procedure for state agents to arrest without a warrant.
Justice Secretary Menardo Guevarra earlier said that a warrantless arrest is only allowed if there is assault on the enforcing officer.
But as President Rodrigo Duterte puts the entire island of Luzon in lockdown, including for non-essential workers and with mass transport suspended, the DOJ's warning is now without caveat.
""Under RA 11332, yes (mere violation is basis for warrantless arrest),"" Perete said.
RA 11332
The DOJ is turning to a broad law to justify this policy – Republic Act 11332 or the ""Mandatory Reporting of Notifiable Diseases and Health Events of Public Health Concern Act"".
It's the law that authorizes the Secretary of Health or the President to declare a state of public health emergency, and the law that is continuously used as basis by Malacañang for its changing measures – like putting Luzon under lockdown.
The problem is that the language of the law is not specific.
""There are so many vague words there. That can apply to anyone not doing anything,"" said former Supreme Court Spokesperson Ted Te.
Guevarra cited Section 9 of the law which punishes non-cooperation. Under this section, two clauses leap out:

(9D) Non-cooperation of persons and entities that should report and/or respond to notifiable diseases or health events of public concern; and
(9E) Non-cooperation of the person or entities identified as having the notifiable disease, or affected by the health event of public concern.

""9D and 9E, while imposing liability for non-cooperation, covers different entities/persons,"" said Perete, without answering what specific acts are actually covered by the law.
Perete cited Section 4(f) of the law which authorizes public health authorities to enforce ""quarantine and isolation""; and ""rapid containment and implementation of measures for disease prevention and control"" among others.
""If you look at Section 4F of RA 11332, one of the declared purposes of the law is to empower public health authorities to enforce quarantine and isolation, and effectively respond to the emergency.
""Non-cooperation must be read in this light, as it undermines both objectives,"" said Perete.
""That is how the law stands, and the reasoning behind it seems pretty straight forward: in times of a health event of a public concern, an unfounded insistence to act in a way that imperils our collective health can be criminally sanctioned,"" Perete added.
Duterte's swipe
In a nation address Monday night, Duterte took a swipe at unnamed individuals who said police may not arrest without a warrant during the lockdown.
""May mga tao talaga na ayaw pahuli, alam ng mga tao bright kayo, at alam niyong bright kayo...you seem to give a side comment that is not good. Instead of saying hindi 'yung pulis, sabihin mo sumunod kayo sa mga pulis because ang pulis kumukuha ng order dito sa itaas,"" said Duterte.
(There are really people who do not want to be left out, people now you're bright, you know you're bright, you seem to give a side comment that is not good. Instead of saying that police cannot do this, just tell people to follow the police because police just get the orders from higher ups.)
Immediately after, Guevarra faced the media to tweak his earlier statement on the warrantless arrest.
Perete echoed it on Tuesday: ""What needs emphasis here is that this is not a curtailment of one’s right to mobility. Such an individual’s right yields to the safety of the community at large.""
Police chief General Archie Gamboa said he has told all his cops to apprehend all, particularly public utility vehicles which continue to operate.
""Sinabi ko kanina sa PNP, na hulihin n'yo lahat, kailangan iimpound lahat, of course problem saan iiimpound, so that people will see that really we will enforce the law,"" Gamboa said on CNN Philippines.
(I told the PNP, arrest everyone, we need to impound all, ofcourse the problem is where will we impound them, so that people will see that really, we will enforce the law.) – Rappler.com  "

CAGAYAN DE ORO CITY, Philippines – A man being probed for the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) died in Marawi City on Tuesday, March 17.
""He died before the result came in,"" said Zia Alonto, spokesperson of the Lanao del Sur COVID-19 team.
The man, who traveled recently to Malaysia to join a religious activity, was confined at the Amai Pakpak Medical Center (APMC) in Marawi City.
Based on the official tally on Tuesday, there are 7 other persons under investigation (PUIs) in Lanao del Sur – 6 confined in the APMC, and 1 discharged after testing negative for the disease.
Of the 6 confined, 4 were awaiting the test results, while two have yet to be tested.
There are 90 persons under monitoring (PUMs) in Lanao del Sur – 88 in home quarantine, and two in quarantine in a medical facility.
APMC is under the operational control of the Department of Health Region 10 (DOH10). It sent its last batch of test samples to the DOH Central Office in Manila last week.
Maria Ellen Santua of DOH-10 said that even with the Luzon lockdown, test samples of suspected coronavirus patients in the region would still reach Manila, as it was a medical emergency nature. 
On March 14, Mindanao recorded its first COVID-19 death, a 54-year-old native of Marawi City who moved to Pasig City following the Marawi siege in 2017. The man was confined at the Northern Mindanao Medical Center in Pasig City.

WARNING. Screengrab of Dr. Philip V. Limsi's appeal posted on his Faceboo account. 
DIPOLOG CITY, Philippines – As the provincial government and other local health units kept on reassuring the public that Zamboanga del Norte was still free of the novel coronavirus, one of the province’s only two adult pulmonologists appealed to stop focusing on statistics and instead consider the virus to be already here.
“Stop asking if we have positive of negative infections. Let’s think that it has already reached our province. I believe it so, and we all should work together to minimize if not stop its spread,” adult pulmonologist Dr. Philip V. Limsi said over a local radio station March 17 and on his Facebook account.
The Zamboanga del Norte Task Force COVID-19 said that the province has 899 persons under monitoring, 17 persons under investigation and 0 confirmed infection as of March 16.
If President Duterte’s order has to be strictly followed, there is still no basis for a lockdown here. But Limsi said that his fellow physicians in the province urged Governor Roberto Y. Uy to be stricter and impose the lockdown now because they believed COVID-19 was already in the province.
Starting midnight March 17, a community quarantine was implemented in the entire province on Uy’s order.

Limsi said statistics “could be deceiving. We are not seeing the real picture of the problem as the province has no capability of testing for COVID-19. And the swabs we sent to Zamboanga City and Manila have no results yet.”
And getting the results is much more difficult now that there are no flights and other provinces have also imposed lockdowns.
NO CLASSES. An empty Saint Mary's Academy in Dipolog City. Photo by Bert Laput 
We are left on our own, what should we do?
Limsi said we should accept that the virus is already within us. “Treat the person next to you as a carrier of COVID-19 and truthfully do what the (Department of Health) DOH is telling us: strictly follow social distancing, do proper hygiene – wash your hands, stop going to crowded places, stay home, use the right face masks.”
The doctor added though that to be infected of the coronavirus was not a ""death sentence"" because there are plenty of cases of patients recovering from COVID-19.
COVID-19 in the ailment caused by the novel coronavirus.
“But we have to understand that the real problem we are facing is our limited health system once this problem blows up,” he said.
Limsi cited the province’s inadequate number of doctors and nurses, and the lack of facilities. “Our main hospital (ZN Medical Center) has only 9 intensive care units and 9 ICU nurses, and we don’t have spare respirators that can be installed in non-ICU wards.”
“We will collapse easily,” he said, adding that if COVID-19 blows up in the province, infected persons are likely to have acute respiratory distress syndrome and will need respirators ideally in an ICU.
Limsi said that the province can still manage because COVID-19 has not yet proliferated, but health workers are already under stress. 
There are hospitals and nurses assigned in checkpoints that have no facemasks and alcohol. And there are also hard-headed people, who refuse medical attention.
In Dapitan City, there was a seafarer who went on rest and recreation in Italy and the Netherlands before returning home. Health workers complained that the said seafarer refused to undergo self-quarantine and recklessly roamed the city and nearby Dipolog as well.
Last March 16, the seafarer reportedly had to be confined at a hospital in Dipolog after showing respiratory disease symptoms.
“We cannot afford to have this kind of mentality. We have to be one team. We have to work together. Don’t lie about your medical history and do what health workers tell you to do,” Limsi appealed to the public.
He said there are diseases that have higher mortality rates, but COVID-19 is a problem because we have not fully understood it. He says the as days go by, COVID-19 also displays different characteristics.
“Before the World Health Organization said COVID-19 was not airborne. Now they are saying it is,” Limsi said, “it’s full of surprises, and that’s really a problem.” – Rappler.com "

On Tuesday, March 17, the University of the Philippines (UP) Diliman Department of Journalism, Philippine Press Institute (PPI), Photojournalists’ Center of the Philippines (PCP), and the Center for Community Journalism and Development (CCJD) a released a statement saying that requiring an ID from the PCOO is unnecessary.
""A valid press ID should be enough to establish the identity of a journalist and media worker even during the enhanced community quarantine,"" they said. The rule, they added, gives the impression that the PCOO is trying to control the media and compromise independent coverage. A PCOO ID could also be misused to deprive the media of access to information.
The statement said: ""Given their role in shaping public opinion, journalists and media workers should have editorial independence so that they can be expected to adhere to the highest professional and ethical standards. If government wants to suggest something from media owners, it is to provide their frontliners the necessary safety equipment and logistics to ensure effective coverage. In unfortunate cases that they show symptoms, affected journalists and media workers should be given proper medical care by their employers and the government. Indeed, the safety of journalists should be everyone’s priority.""
The Philippines is one of the most dangerous countries for journalists. It ranked 134 out of 180 countries in Reporters Without Borders' 2019 World Press Freedom Index. 
On Monday, March 16, President Rodrigo Duterte announced a lockdown or ""enhanced community quarantine"" over the entire island of Luzon.
A memorandum released by Malacañang said that strict quarantine for all households will be implemented, transportation will be suspended, and provision for food and “essential health services” will be regulated under the measure.
The memorandum said: “[m]edia personnel shall be allowed to travel within the quarantine area, provided that, within 72 hours from the effectivity of the enhanced community quarantine, media personnel intending to travel within the quarantine area shall secure an identification card from the [PCOO].”

What's this about?
Indeed, this is a new kind of war we are fighting. ""New"" to our generation, at least – the COVID-19 virus.
Isn’t it crazy how in late December and early January we were just watching and following the news on how the virus has gripped China? It wasn't until January 30, 2020 when we had the first confirmed case in the Philippines. Until the 5th of March, we only had 5 confirmed cases.[1] We were fine.
Then things developed really fast from there; now we are at 140 confirmed cases. Now the entire island of Luzon is on an enhanced community quarantine.
In this article, we share some of the results from an elementary mathematical model that allows us to project the potential growth of confirmed cases.
Findings
Data from western countries conclusively indicate that the increase in COVID-19 cases follows a sustained exponential growth in the first two weeks when significant cases (>10) are reported. This is expected since the virus will only show symptoms 97.5% of the time after 11.5 days[2]; hence, cases get reported only after about two weeks since its existence.
The current 142 cases in the Philippines, with 29 reported on Monday, March 16, follows closely this exponential trend shared by western countries (e.g., Italy, Germany, USA, etc). And we expect that every two days, the reported new cases will double. 
To illustrate, we are projecting about 58 new cases on March 18 and 116 cases on March 20. If this trend continues, the total cumulative infected patients will be 1,611 by March 23. And if the dynamics does not change/improve, it can reach up to 18,300 the week after that (March 30). 
Finally, by the end of the month (March 31), we might be grappling with 25,894 cases. If we do not have enough kits to test this much number of individuals, then expect that the number of confirmed cases to be reported to be lower than this.  
Why should we be worried?
Many reasons but most importantly, we're worried because this number is not something we believe our healthcare system can handle. In Metro Manila, 800 people struggled for one hospital bed or a 1:800 ratio; and we were short by 42,000 hospital beds.[3] This number may have already improved since 2017, but we are still worried about the nationwide distribution and accessibility of these facilities.
Where can we put another 26,000 potentially infected patients who are highly contagious?
The data has spoken, and we can only hope it’s lying.
Empirical data show that we have a convincing exponential growth of the infected population. This is seen in the figure below plotted in a semi-log scale. 
To compare across country trends, we set all of Monday’s (March 16, 2020) data points to Day 20, and make projections until March 30, 2020.

 
How confident and accurate are we?
We are not the ones talking here; it is the math and the data. For reproducibility, we have made our code open to all interested. You can download it here if you want to play around with the above fit and the data reported: https://github.com/eflegara/COVID19PH-Projection.
Projection 
When do we expect to get an exponential distribution? Short answer is when the infection spreads at rate r that is proportional to the number of the infected population. This is a valid approximation as long as the number of infected individuals are far less compared to the total population. 
For example, if there is y0 initial number of individuals infected at time t = 0, at time t = 1 this number will grow to y1 = y0 + ry0 = y0 (1 + r). For time t = 2, the total number of infected will be y2 = y1 + ry1 = y0 (1 + r)2. In general, we can get the number of infected individuals at time t using the formula: yt = y0 (1 + r)t. By some forces of mathematics, this can be expressed as an exponential: y(t) = a exp(bt) where the rate r = exp (b-1), and the doubling time is given by tdouble = ln(2) / ln (1 + r). We illustrate roughly the outcome below for r = 0.5 and y0 = 5.
 
 
 
As seen in all countries, for 10-14 days, such exponential trend has been preserved. What differentiates South Korea and Singapore from other countries was how the exponential trajectory was stunted in less than two weeks due to widespread virus testing and social distancing measures that were implemented early.
Will this trend change? 
On Sunday morning at 12 am, Metro Manila was placed under community quarantine. And the following day, Monday, the entire Luzon was placed under an ""enhanced"" community quarantine. Will this be effective? Will this stunt the exponential growth we're seeing, the way South Korea flattened its curve? 
Probably. Hopefully.
We'll only really know once we see changes in the trend (i.e., when we see the trend deviate from its current exponential growth curve) in the next week or so. We have observed that Italy eventually decreased the doubling period from an initial of 1.5 days to about 3.6 days in the last 10 days. If such is applied to the Philippine setting and we slow down the doubling to about 4 days, then the projection will be halved to about 805 cases by March 23 and 9,150 by March 30.
By how much could we be underreporting?
We can only speculate at this point.
However, using South Korea as baseline, the projection makes sense based on the following assumptions:
(1) the distribution in terms of age of that population holds(2) only symptomatic patients are being tested in the Philippines (most probably 55+ and above).
This is because the age bracket 40 years and below only has ~0.2% mortality rate, while for 60 and above, the mortality rate shoots up to within 10%. This is a ~50 fold increase. 
 

 
With such assumption, a first order approximation of the underreported cases in the Philippines is: Age below 55 (not tested) / Age above 55 (tested). Looking at the Philippine Statistics Authority data, this is about 90% / 10% or 9x. The assumption here is we are not detecting 9x of the infected because they are not going to hospitals for check-ups.
What now?
Of course, we could be wrong, and the good thing is that in the next few days we will be able to validate or invalidate our results. This is what science is all about! We will eventually know where we have gone wrong, and this will allow us to improve our model and forecast with new data coming in. But for the uncertain times ahead, our advice is to heed the lesson from Andrew Grove: right now, it is better to be paranoid to survive! – Rappler.com

MANILA, Philippines – Another staff member of the House of Representatives Printing Service Office tested positive for COVID-19, House Secretary General Jose Luis Montales confirmed to reporters on Tuesday, March 17. 
“We were advised that another employee from our Printing Service tested positive for COVID-19,” Montales said.
Montales said the patient last reported for work on March 5,  went on leave on March 6, and was admitted to the hospital on March 7. He was initially diagnosed with dengue.
“The doctors later tested him for COVID-19 on March 12 and 14, and the results just came out today,” he added.
Montales asked for prayers for the recovery of the patient. “Our prayers will come a long way for him. Let us keep praying for his recovery and for his family’s health,” he said.
It wasn’t clear if the patient was among the latest batch of confirmed cases of coronavirus in the country announced by the Department of Health (DOH) on Monday evening, March 16. There are 142 cases in the country and 12 deaths caused by the new virus as of Monday. (READ: LIST: Confirmed coronavirus cases in the Philippines as of March 16)

DAVAO CITY, Philippines – Davao de Oro Governor Jayvee Tyron Uy announced a partial lockdown of the province starting Tuesday, March 17, due to fears over the spread of the novel coronavirus.
“All the entrance and exits of the province will be partially locked down,” he said over Davao City Disaster Radio.
The guidelines for the partial lockdown, which mayors of Davao de Oro towns had agreed to, will be known Tuesday, Uy said.
But this early, he said that residents of the province are already prohibited from traveling outside.
Those passing though the province heading to other areas will still be allowed but they will be escorted out.
It was not clear how those passing through Davao de Oro to the eastern side of Mindanao, such as Surigao City, would be able to reach their destinations as neighboring Agusan del Sur had implemented stricter measures restricting traveling to the province.
Uy said the reason for the partial lockdown was the fact that Mindanao's second case and Davao Region's first came from the province.
The Department of Health-Davao Region (DOH 11) confirmed on Sunday, March 15, that a 21-year-old Filipina from Davao de Oro, who had travel history to the United Kingdom and Qatar, tested positive for coronavirus disease and had been admitted to the Davao Regional Medical Center in Tagum City.
That patient has since been reported to be improving. 
Patient PH130 arrived in Manila from the UK, with a layover in Doha, Qatar. She then proceeded to Davao on February 29.
""The patient first sought consultation to a local health facility due to cough and was immediately isolated on March 9, 2020. She was transferred and admitted for isolation and testing to a referral hospital last March 10, 2020. She is currently in stable condition,"" DOH 11 director Anabelle Yumang said.
As of today, 50 PUI cases had been reported in the region. At least 29 of them had already been discharged while 21 others are admitted to two government hospitals in the region.
Earlier, Davao City Mayor Sara Duterte and Tagum City Mayor Allan Rellon also agreed to shut their borders to Tagum City residents traveling to Davao City.
Tagum lies between Davao de Oro and Davao City.
Davao del Sur curfew, community quarantine
In Davao del Sur, Digos City Mayor Josef Cagas also ordered the implementation of a community quarantine and residents were “strongly advised” against going out of their houses except for food and medical necessities.
Cagas said an 8 pm to 5 am curfew took effect starting Monday evening to curtail unnecessary movement of people.

“Her colds, cough and fever are gone. In fact we got the second (oral and nasal) swabs to determine if she's already negative (of the virus),” he added.
Dalid said if the 21-year old patient would test negative for the virus, she would be discharged.
“The criteria is two oral and (nasal) swabs and if the patient tests negative and does not manifest any symptoms anymore, we can already discharge her,” he added.
The patient, whom Davao de Oro Governor Jayvee Tyron Uy confirmed to have come from his province, had travel history to the United Kingdom and Qatar.
She arrived in Manila from the UK, with layover in Doha, Qatar.  She then proceeded to Davao on February 29.

They say we are paranoid.
They say we are OA.
They say we are praning.
True, we are paranoid, OA, and praning.
When the president announced last Monday night that classes in Metro Manila in all levels will be suspended from March 10 to 14 because of the novel coronavirus, we thought, ""They must know something that the public is not yet informed of.""
So, the next day, I did not allow my husband Roel to go to work.
We asked our daughter, who insisted on staying in her rented place near her med school until she completed all her online academic requirements, to lock herself in.
We asked our oldest son, who works in Alabang, to take stringent precautionary measures.
We asked our second son, a fitness buff, to refrain from going to the gym.
We asked my husband's nephrologist for medical advice, and she then issued a medical certificate ""strongly"" recommending that Roel be allowed to work from home.
Then when the president announced last Thursday night that NCR would be placed under community quarantine or lockdown from March 15 to April 12, we got more paranoid. More OA. More praning. (READ: LOOK: Scenes across Metro Manila as Luzon lockdown begins)
We immediately fetched our daughter from QC and took her home to Malolos.
We asked our oldest son to limit his activities within two areas only, their office and his dorm, and discouraged him from going home.
We told our second son that he would be allowed to visit his girlfriend, but they should not leave the girl's house.
We canceled our planned trip to Bataan for my father’s 75th birthday.
We stocked up on Roel's medicines.
So why are we paranoid, OA, and praning?
For those who don't understand – or obstinately refuse to understand – my husband's health condition, let me explain this in the simplest way I can manage.
As a kidney transplant patient, my husband has to take anti-rejection drugs. These drugs weaken my husband’s immune system, because if his immune system is in tip-top condition (like that of those people who are physically healthy), his body will sense and reject his transplanted kidney. (It’s our body’s knee-jerk reaction.) 
And since his immune system is weak, he is considered immunocompromised. He has a greatly reduced ability to fight infections and other diseases. He may also lack the ability to respond appropriately to vaccination. (Aside from organ transplant patients, others who are immunocompromised are the elderly; those with HIV/AIDS, cancer, diabetes, malnutrition, and certain genetic disorders; and those who are taking certain medicines or undergoing certain treatments, such as anticancer drugs, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, steroids, and stem cell transplants.)
It is easy to dismiss a group of people you don’t know much about. It is easy to claim that they are merely making excuses to receive ""special treatment."" Sometimes, it is even easy to discredit a professional's medical recommendation.
My husband, and other immunocompromised people like him, may look strong and healthy. They may be doing the same things that perfectly fit people are doing – things that could inadvertently put them at risk. They may even be crossing the line by engaging in activities considered to be risky, yet they feel the need to do so because a particular situation calls for it.
Shouldn't we be happy for them because, instead of sulking in a corner and wallowing in self-pity, they are trying to beat the odds? By trying to appear normal. By carrying their own weight. By being productive members of society.
And today that the world is worried sick, is afraid, and is even panicking over the threats posed by the coronavirus, let us pause for a while and put ourselves in the shoes of the people who are immunocompromised – they who know that they are the most likely to die if they contract the virus.
Only then can we fully understand them and their families' fears.
Only then can we be truly capable of that thing called compassion.
And only then can we possibly win this fight against the virus. – Rappler.com

Also on Instagram, Jinri said that she had cancelled her Manila wedding ceremony to her non-showbiz partner, John.
“Due to the circumstances we had to cancel our wedding this coming weekend. We will still get the legal documents ready and sign the registry on the day of the wedding but the event and gathering will be postponed,” she said in the post, which included a photo of her and John.
“I’m very upset because I prepared and stressed over this day for months. An emotional rollercoaster. But at the end of day, I have to look at the bright side and say, hey! At least I had a practice on how to go about a wedding preparation. When the virus dies down, I’ll have that wedding and my dad will get to walk me down the aisle,” she continued.
“To all the fellow brides out there who are going through the same situation as me, stay strong! I know it’s been stressful months but we now have a story to tell our grandchildren. Stay healthy,” she said.
Jinri and John, whose family name remains unknown, previously held a small ceremony for her family in her South Korea in December 2019, though she had clarified then that it wasn’t an official wedding. They were engaged in July 2019. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – The escalating coronavirus pandemic has greatly affected the Tokyo 2020 Olympics preparations of Filipino pole vaulter EJ Obiena with the cancelation of several sports events. 
""It’s a bit nerve-wracking [since I] haven’t been able to compete, but we have contingency plans if things do go south,"" Obiena told Rappler. 
Obiena, who was the first Filipino to qualify for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, was supposed to compete in the Asian Indoor Athletics Championship in February and the World Indoor Athletics Championship in March.
However, both tournaments were canceled as they were hosted in China, where the coronavirus was first confirmed. 
Now, the 24-year-old based in Italy faces a lockdown in Europe, which was declared the new epicenter of the deadly virus by the World Health Organization. 
According to Obiena, all athletes went through testing and are allowed to train as long as they stay indoors most of the time. 
""We are told to not go out. People who stay inside are not allowed to go out and people from the outside are not allowed to go in,"" said Obiena, who assured he was far from the mainly affected areas. 
The Filipino athletics star will continue waiting for his season to start and will stay put for further annoucements regarding his next competitions. 
Obiena surpassed his personal records thrice in 2019 and made the Olympic cut with a height of 5.81m last September. (READ: Dream come true: EJ Obiena caps off stellar year with SEA Games gold)
He also bagged the elusive 2019 Southeast Asian (SEA) Games gold in front of the home crowd in New Clark City.

MANILA, Philippines – The Philippines suspended trade on its local stock exchange on Tuesday, March 17, becoming the first country to close its financial market over coronavirus fears.
President Rodrigo Duterte on Monday, March 16, ordered most of the 55 million people on the main island of Luzon, which includes the capital Manila, to stay at home for the next month after social distancing measures failed to keep people away from one another. 
Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE) president Ramon Monzon told traders in a memo that trading is suspended starting Tuesday ""until further notice"" to move in step with Duterte's order.  
Monzon said the suspension was also ""to ensure the safety of employees and traders in light of the escalating cases of the coronavirus disease.""
Confirmed cases in the Philippines have jumped to 142, with 12 deaths, and the government has unveiled a P27.1-billion ($526.6-million) package to fund hospitals fighting the virus and provide reprieve amid a slowdown in economic activity. 
The benchmark PSE index plunged 7.9% during shortened trading on Monday as investors reeled from the virus' economic impact. 
The suspension order came as stock markets and oil prices went into freefall after central banks' fresh stimulus measures failed to dampen fears of the global pandemic. 
Shares in Tokyo's Nikkei 225 index dropped by as much as 3.66% at Tuesday's open before recovering about 70 minutes after the opening bell. 
Overnight, Wall Street indices fell in their worst day since 1987, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq dropping about 12% and the Dow sinking nearly 13%. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – Tricycles will be allowed to continue conveying passengers in Pasig for now, as the city government does not have enough vehicles to give all commuters exempted from the Luzon-wide lockdown a ride, Mayor Vico Sotto said on Tuesday morning, March 17.
“We're using our vehicles but it's not enough. Our risk assessment shows that we can’t ban tricycles at this point,” Sotto said on his official social media accounts.
Health workers and employees of essential services need a way to get to work. Besides, there are places in Pasig accessible only by tricycle, so they need to be on hand for emergencies.
“Dahil dito, sa ngayon ay pinapayagan ko ang limitadong pagbiyahe ng mga tricycle sa loob ng Pasig (Because of this, for now I am allowing limited trips of tricycles within Pasig),"" Sotto said.
The city’s Tricycle Operation and Regulatory Office will set guidelines on how the city’s most ubiquitous means of public transport may operate during the “enhanced community quarantine” imposed by the national government at midnight on Tuesday. (READ: GUIDELINES: Luzon 'enhanced community quarantine')
The measure suspends public transportation across Luzon’s 8 administrative regions to “keep people at home” and discourage them from going around, Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles said on Monday night.
Sotto reminded his constituents that only people exempted from the quarantine may take tricycles. They include health workers, security forces, employees of essential services such as food and groceries, and media workers.
To observe social distancing – maintaining ample personal space to avoid catching the virus – only up to 3 passengers are allowed on each tricycle at a time. Normally, the tiny taxi can cram up to half a dozen people, including the driver, in a single trip.
The Pasig government earlier allowed tricycle operators to raise fares by 50% as they cut down the number of passengers they take on per trip.
“Maawa naman tayo kung sa 8 hours na biyahe, P50 lang kikitain nila (Let’s have a heart, if for 8 hours of trips, they only earn P50),” the mayor said. 
The “enhanced community quarantine,” a virtual lockdown, is meant to quell the novel coronavirus. The Philippines saw a spike in the number of infections last week. As of Monday, there have been 142 confirmed cases in the country, and 12 deaths.
The global death toll has exceeded 6,500, with more than 3,200 of the fatalities in mainland China (excluding Hong Kong and Macau). The number of cases worldwide has risen to more than 168,200, with more than 80,800 of the infections in China. The virus has spread to at least 142 countries. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – President Rodrigo Duterte conducted a surprise inspection of some checkpoints in Metro Manila during the first few hours of the Luzon-wide lockdown.
Citing the Presidential Security Group (PSG), radio DZMM reported that Duterte headed to the Valenzuela-Meycauayan boundary along MacArthur Highway at around 4 am on Tuesday, after he saw photos of the long lines of people and vehicles stuck there because of the Metro Manila lockdown. (LOOK: Scenes across Metro Manila as Luzon lockdown begins)
The report said the President appealed to the people for understanding and to follow the government’s rules to help fight the spread of the novel coronavirus.
In the photo released by the PSG, the President was seen not wearing a mask as he talked to Metro Manila cops manning the checkpoint, but the PSG said that social distancing was observed during that time and also when he addressed the people. Duterte supposedly wore a mask but took it off when he had to speak since he might not be heard.
DZMM reported that the President also went to Mindanao Avenue in Quezon City and drove by SM North to Balintawak. He reportedly wanted to proceed to San Jose del Monte in Bulacan but the PSG advised against it.
The ""enhanced community quarantine"" that the President ordered beginning Tuesday covers 57 million people in 8 regions who were told to stay home to help curb the number of COVID-19 cases in the country.
Under the new measure, strict quarantine for all households will be implemented, transportation will be suspended, and provision for food and “essential health services” will be regulated, based on an earlier memorandum released by Malacañang. 
There are 142 coronavirus cases in the country as of Monday, May 16, while 12 people have died due to the disease.
The global death toll, meanwhile, has reached 6,501, with 3,213 of the fatalities in China (excluding Hong Kong and Macau). The number of cases worldwide has risen to 168,250, with more than 80,860 of the infections in China. The virus has spread to at least 142 countries. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – At the stroke of midnight on Tuesday, March 17, a broad lockdown on Luzon began as the Philippine government ordered over 57 million residents of the island region to begin home quarantine in an effort to contain the spread of the coronavirus.  
The capital region of Metro Manila was witness to scenes familiar in lockdowns implemented to combat the coronavirus: empty streets, people rushing to get home, and traffic build-up on borders that traverse the Metro and nearby provinces.

At 11:30 pm, vehicles were at a standstill along the Batasan-San Mateo Road along the border of Quezon City and San Mateo. Checkpoint frontliners stationed at the end of the Batasan-San Mateo Road corner General Luna Avenue painstakingly check the temperature of every passenger and pedestrian.

Vehicles were attempting to enter San Mateo from both the Quezon City side of the Batasan-San Mateo Road and the Marikina side of General Luna Avenue.
When the clock struck 12, nothing changed. Officials of Barangay Banaba, San Mateo and the police officers at the checkpoint continued getting the temperatures of motorists and inquiring why they were headed into San Mateo. 
The status quo remained, as they have not received any specific directive in relation to the Luzon-wide lockdown.

At the Strarmall Alabang Terminal, stranded passengers hoping to reach their homes in Bicol and Quezon waited at a deserted parking lot usually full of buses 24 hours a day. Each commuter stood watch to wait and see if a bus would enter to take them to their destination. 
Major roads like the South Luzon Expressway were dotted with few cars close to midnight as drives that would usually take about an hour at least from Pasig to Muntinlupa were completed in half the time.

At the border between San Pedro, Laguna and Tunasan, Muntinlupa, traffic stretched on as trucks lined up bumper to bumper to enter Metro Manila.  
Unlike earlier in the day, when police and health workers painstakingly checked each and every commuters’ temperature, the Luzon lockdown brought police a welcome reprieve, allowing some to take a rest as others continued to man checkpoints. 
The government’s attempt to order 57 million people in 8 regions to stay home follows officials' struggle to implement strict social distancing measures in the Metro Manila lockdown. 
As of Tuesday, the Philippines reported a steep increase in infections with the number of confirmed cases in the Philippines spiking from 6 to 140 in the span of a week. The confirmed cases included 12 deaths. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – President Rodrigo Duterte has asked the communist-led New People’s Army (NPA) for a ceasefire as he put the entire island of Luzon on lockdown over the novel coronavirus pandemic.
“Kayo bang mga NPA, nagmamahal kayo sa gobyerno? 'Pag hindi…tumulong kayo. Distancing. At huwag ‘nyo muna galawin ang mga sundalo,” Duterte said as he announced the enhanced community quarantine on Monday night, March 16. (You NPA, do you love the government? If not…help out. Distancing. And don’t bother soldiers for now.)
“Ceasefire muna tayo. Ako na ang nanghihingi…. Kindly give me that,” he added. (Let’s go on ceasefire for now. I am asking you.)
Duterte made this appeal as he alternated between reading a prepared declaration of the lockdown and talking spontaneously in his usual meandering way.
Jose Maria ""Joma"" Sison, the exiled founder and figurehead of the communist rebellion, responded with a statement that expressed doubts about Duterte’s motives in declaring a lockdown.
Enforced by police and soldiers, the lockdown may be meant “to suppress the people’s democratic movement in the urban areas,” Sison said.
Nevertheless, Sison said the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) and its political wing, the National Democratic Front of the Philippines (NDFP), would consider Duterte’s offer.
“If he is really serious with his offer to have a ceasefire with the NDFP, he must make a formal offer through the [government] negotiating panel to the NDFP negotiating panel,” Sison said, adding that if so, the CPP and NDFP would “seriously study” the possibility.
Duterte has repeatedly dangled offers of negotiations with the communist rebels, even when he has vowed to eradicate them by the end of his term in June 2022.
Early in his term, Duterte broached peace talks with the NDFP but the effort bogged down in November 2017, when Duterte accused the rebels of repeatedly violating a ceasefire.
In December 2018, Duterte launched a campaign to deplete the communist movement’s guerrilla forces through so-called localized peace talks, offering fighters cash incentives and livelihood packages in exchange for their defection.
In December 2019, Duterte yet again offered peace talks to the CPP-NPA-NDFP, but he and Sison could not agree on a venue. Although a member of Duterte’s Cabinet had begun setting up the negotiations, the attempt has pretty much fizzled out.
‘Love your military man’
The lockdown, from March 17 to April 12, is meant to prevent the coronavirus from further spreading among Luzon’s more than 57 million people across 8 administrative regions.
Duterte has repeatedly insisted the measure is “not martial law,” but in his public addresses on the subject, he kept warning the public against confronting the police and military personnel enforcing the lockdown.
“So inuulit-ulit kasi yung reminder, you should love your military man. Namamatay na nga ‘yan sa giyera. ‘Tamo, uuwi na du’n sa kanila, kabaong na lang,” he said in the same speech. (I keep reminding you, you should love your military man. They already die in the war. See, he arrives home in a casket.)
“You should feel for your soldiers and policemen. They are not your enemies,” the President said as a way of dismissing the public’s apprehensions over the lockdown.
The “community quarantine” that began in Metro Manila on Sunday, March 15, was largely enforced by the Philippine National Police. Military contingents were deployed to cover certain areas.
It is unclear whether the Armed Forces of the Philippines would take on a more prominent role in the “enhanced community quarantine” that now covers a third of the country. Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana has yet to respond to reporters’ queries on the matter as of this posting.
As of Monday, the Philippines has had 142 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus, and 12 deaths. 
The global death toll, meanwhile, has reached 6,501, with 3,213 of the fatalities in China (excluding Hong Kong and Macau). The number of cases worldwide has risen to 168,250, with more than 80,860 of the infections in China. The virus has spread to at least 142 countries. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – Thousands of rapid test kits for the novel coronavirus are on the way to the Philippines from South Korea and China, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said on Monday night, March 16.
The arrival of the donated test kits is expected to enable health workers to test more people for the virus. At the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) in Muntinlupa – the country's main testing hub – currently only 300 people can be tested every day.
In comparison, South Korea is able to test 15,000 people a day for the coronavirus.
Some 500 rapid test kits donated by the South Korean government arrived in the Philippines last Friday, March 13, Duque said. Another 5,000 to 10,000 kits will arrive from South Korea this week.
Meanwhile, 2,000 ""high-tech fast test kits"" arrived from China earlier on Monday, and another 10,000 such kits are expected on Wednesday, March 18, Duque added.
The unavailability of test kits has forced health officials to prioritize people with symptoms of the virus, or who have had a history of exposure to infected patients or travel to countries with local epidemics of the virus.
More testing kits would mean the disease could be detected earlier in patients, increasing their chances of recovery while decreasing the likelihood of further transmission.
Moreover, the test kits from South Korea and China can turn up results within hours – much faster than the testing kits the RITM currently uses, which takes one to two full days to yield results.
How about technicians?
But it appears having more test kits on hand may not necessarily translate into faster diagnoses.
With more samples coming in as more people get tested, it could soon take the RITM surveillance team 3 to 5 days to release results, CNN Philippines reported on Monday.
Even with thousands of ""high-tech"" test kits, hospitals might not be able to deliver the expected rapid results if there won't be a corresponding increase in the number of trained technicians running the tests and analyzing samples.
Test kits from UP
The test kits developed by the University of the Philippines-National Institutes of Health (UP-NIH) are set for field validation runs beginning this week.
The plan, Duque said, is to use the UP-NIH test kits in parallel with the conventional kits. If 200 to 300 parallel runs yield high confidence in the new kits, then they may be rolled out to coronavirus testing hubs.
The tests need to establish the UP-NIH kits' specific sensitivity to the coronavirus that originated in Wuhan – not any other virus – even at low viral counts.
""So unti-unting nagkakaroon na tayo ng maraming kakayahan para sa rapid diagnostic tests, pero kailangang masiguro natin ang kanyang quality at kanyang accuracy,"" Duque said during a media briefing in Malacañang. (So we're little by little increasing our ability for rapid diagnostic tests, but we need to ensure their quality and accuracy.)
As of Monday, the Philippines has had 142 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus, with 12 deaths. 
The global death toll, meanwhile, has reached 6,501, with 3,213 of the fatalities in China (excluding Hong Kong and Macau). The number of cases worldwide has risen to 168,250, with more than 80,860 of the infections in China. The virus has spread to at least 142 countries. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – The Philippines' health secretary said on Monday, March 16, that there are enough ambulances in hospitals to respond to medical emergencies as mass transportation in Luzon is shut down during an island-wide quarantine.
The national government placed Luzon under an ""enhanced community quarantine"" as the country's cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, continue to rise. At least 140 cases have been recorded in the Philippines, with 12 deaths.
""Oo naman. Lahat naman ng ating ospital ay may ambulansiya. Maraming-marami ang ambulansiya ng Red Cross, so we complement our ambulance capacity with that of the Red Cross,"" said Health Secretary Francisco Duque III on Monday evening, during an Inter-Agency Task Force briefing on the Luzon quarantine.
(Of course. All our hospitals have ambulances. The Red Cross has many so we complement our ambulance capacity with that of the Red Cross.)
""Wala naman dahil gaya ng sinabi ko mayroon naman tayong sapat na ambulance service (There's no reason to worry because as I said, we have enough ambulances),"" he added, when pressed.
Concerns over the availability of ambulances rose after it was announced that all forms of mass transportation would be suspended during the quarantine period. The suspension covers jeepneys, buses, public utility vehicles, sedan-hailing services, and motorycle taxis, to name a few.
Private vehicles are allowed to move around Luzon, but only for ""basic necessities"" which include buying supplies from groceries, markets, drug stores, or takeout food establishments, among others. 
Isolation areas
While the possible ""operationalization"" of the Lung Center of the Philippines as a ""COVID-19 hospital"" has yet to be studied, national government wants local government units (LGUs) to set up isolation units outside hospitals for patients with mild to no symptoms of the disease.
""LGUs should identify isolation units – this could be a private house, a building, a condominium for patients who are asymptomatic or [have] mild symptoms. The LGU can accommodate that patient, place him or her in the isolation unit so that hospitals can concentrate on patients with serious symptoms,"" Interior Secretary Eduardo Año said in a mix of English and Filipino during the same briefing.
The island-wide quarantine is the national government's latest move to address the rising cases of the novel coronavirus in the Philippines. Metro Manila, the Philippine's capital region, had earlier been placed under a ""community quarantine,"" but officials later realized the porous checkpoints were not enough.
As of Monday, there are 140 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus in the Philippines, although that number is thought of to be relatively low because testing is not as widespread as in other countries.
Thousands of rapid test kits are reportedly on their way to the Philippines.
The global death toll, meanwhile, has reached 6,501, with 3,213 of the fatalities in China (excluding Hong Kong and Macau). The number of cases worldwide has risen to 168,250, with more than 80,860 of the infections in China. The virus has spread to at least 142 countries. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – Airports in the island of Luzon will no longer operate outbound international flights starting Friday, March 20, as the Philippine government enforces an ""enhanced community quarantine,"" which, in effect, is a total lockdown of the island.
Under the rules by the Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF), outbound foreigners ""shall be allowed travel for a period of 72 hours"" from the effectivity of the quarantine. The total lockdown started 12 am on Tuesday, March 17.
But Filipinos are barred from leaving the Philippines through any of the international airports in Luzon beginning Tuesday, or as soon as the quarantine takes effect. (READ: In Luzon quarantine, DOJ says resisting and disobeying basis for arrest)
Asked whether overseas Filipino workers are exempted from the rule, Transportation Assistant Secretary Goddes Libiran said on Tuesday, March 17, ""Ang instruction (The instruction is) no Filipinos shall be allowed to leave the country.""

Are there exceptions? Only uniformed personnel transporting medical supplies, individuals carrying lab specimens, and those on humanitarian missions are allowed to travel by air.
Inbound flight passengers, meanwhile, will be ""allowed transit,"" subject to quarantine procedures if they come from a country with existing travel restrictions imposed by the IATF.
Only Filipinos, their spouses and children, holders of a permanent resident visa, and foreign diplomats will be allowed entry into the Philippines from an international flight.
In the IATF briefing on Tuesday, Transportation Undersecretary Raul del Rosario said ""transportation will be provided"" by the department for passengers going to and coming from the airport.
The Philippine government earlier barred domestic flights from flying in and out of the Ninoy Aquino International Airport, the country's main gateway, as part of restrictions on land, air, and sea travel.
On Monday, March 16, President Rodrigo Duterte announced the upgraded quarantine protocols in a bid to curb coronavirus cases in the country, as the initial lockdown in Metro Manila did not seem to work.

(READ: Duterte places Luzon on 'enhanced quarantine' to battle coronavirus)
President Rodrigo Duterte, upon the recommendation of the Inter-Agency Task Force on the coronavirus, placed the entire island of Luzon under an ""enhanced community quarantine"" in response to the ""sharp increase"" of COVID-19 cases in the country.
The quarantine began when the clock struck midnight on Tuesday, March 17.
""Each LGUs will determine now the requirements. LGUs can provide transportation. We can also require public utilities to operate that is commensurate to those who will use,"" said Interior Secretary Eduardo Año in a press conference that followed a prerecorded public address by Duterte.
""We don't want to open all public transportation because that would encourage people to move,"" added the former military general.
Cabinet officials were asked how health workers would be able to go to work with public transportation suspended.
According to a memorandum issued by Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea, private establishments allowed to remain open during the quarantine period include those that provide ""basic necessities."" The list includes workers in hospitals, clinics, pharmacies, public markets, supermarkets, groceries, and convenience stores, among others.
""Our situation here is it's as if it's a calamity…. That is how the operation lies now. That's why we're in a state of calamity,"" explained Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles in a mix of English and Filipino.
The suspension of public transportation covers jeeps, public utility vehicles, the MRT and LRTs, buses, and services like Grab.
""Public transportation is suspended. This is where the LGUs come in. This is where our coordination with the LGUs to provide the means for transportation comes in,"" he added.
Neither Año nor Nograles expounded on how the process would work.
On March 12, Duterte announced that Metro Manila would be placed under a ""community quarantine"" that was meant to heavily regulate the flow of people in and out of the capital region.
As of Monday, the Philippines has recorded 140 cases of the novel coronavirus, with 12 deaths. Thus far, only 2 patients have recovered. The government is monitoring over 2,000 people and have classified 214 people as patients under investigation. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – As President Rodrigo Duterte places the entire island of Luzon under ""enhanced community quarantine"" because of the coronavirus, the Department of Justice (DOJ) warned that those who will ""seriously"" resist or disobey enforcers will face charges and arrest.
""Considering the gravity of the present situation, our police and other law enforcement agents may effect against violators under any of the following laws,"" Justice Secretary Menardo Guevarra said in a press conference late Monday, March 16.
Under the enhanced community quarantine, mass transport is suspended, including Transportation Network Vehicle Service (TNVS) like Grab. Private vehicles carrying people who fall under the exemptions of the travel restrictions are the only ones allowed to ply roads.
The exemptions include frontliners and essential workers like those in food and medical services. People may still go out to buy groceries or eat via their cars, or by walking.
Guevarra said there are 3 laws that may become basis for arrest and charges:
1. Article 151 of the Revised Penal Code on resistance and disobedience to a person in authority, punishable by a fine not exceeding P100,000 and imprisonment of up to 6 months.
2. If there is violence involved, Article 148 of the Revised Penal Code on direct assault against an officer, punishable by 6 months to 6 years in prison and a fine not exceeding P200,000.
3. Republic Act (RA) No. 11332 on the Mandatory Reporting on Notifiable Diseases, under Section 9 which prohibits non-cooperation, punishable by 1 month to 6 months and a fine not exceeding P50,000.
""So this will come into play only kapag talagang mayroong (if there really is) serious resistance or disobedience to our law enforcers,"" said Guevarra.
""So I plead with everyone to just simply give your cooperation, this is something that is temporary, this is for the good of all of us, the police officers supported by the armed forces are not the enemy, they are not there to harass us but to protect us,"" Guevarra added.
RA 11332 too broad?
Former Supreme Court spokesperson Ted Te said RA 11332 may be too broad to be basis of arrest.
""It is difficult to see how these acts could constitute probable cause for a warrantless arrest. At best they should be subject of a criminal complaint and full preliminary investigation,"" said Te. 
In the context of the coronavirus, RA 11332 authorizes the secretary of health to declare a state of public health emergency. In the event that national security is threatened, the President may also declare it. 
Duterte used RA 11332 as basis for his proclamation of a state of public health emergency.
""The provision that is penalized is that for non-cooperation and the penalty that may be imposed by the court if found guilty is a fine of not more than P50,000 or imprisonment of not more than 6 months,"" said Guevarra.
Under Section 9, ""non-cooperation of persons and entities that should report and/or respond to notifiable diseases or health events of public concern"" is prohibited.
""There are so many vague words there. That can apply to anyone not doing anything,"" said Te.
""The others (Articles 148 and 151 of the RPC) are felonies, they require criminal intent. They're also clearly defined unlike RA 11332,"" said Te.
In his address to the nation on Monday, Duterte took a swipe at unnamed individuals who said violators of the lockdown may not be arrested, as he said it undermined the police and soldiers.
Guevarra earlier said on Saturday, March 14, that lockdown violators cannot be arrested unless there is assault, bribery or slander.
Guevarra's recent statements are a slight change of tune for the justice secretary, as the government adjusted its preventive measure from a Metro Manila quarantine to an enhanced quarantine of the entire Luzon. 
Barangay captains warned
Duterte spent a significant time in his address on Monday night threatening barangay captains who will not be able to enforce these restrictions, saying they will be charged with dereliction of duty.
Malacañang's written memorandum on the Luzon lockdown, which is addressed to local officials, specifically orders the DOJ ""to initiate appropriate charges"" against those who will fail to ""abide by the following guidelines and measures.""
""In addition to his criminal liability he will also be administratively liable and all you have to do is to report the act or omission from this barangay official to the proper offices of the DILG, and the DILG will take care of him,"" said Guevarra. 
As of Monday, the Philippines has a total of 142 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus, with 3 recoveries and 12 deaths.
The global death toll, meanwhile, has reached 6,501, with 3,213 of the fatalities in China (excluding Hong Kong and Macau). The number of cases worldwide has risen to 168,250, with more than 80,860 of the infections in China. The virus has spread to at least 142 countries. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – Attempting to allay fears of a food crisis, President Rodrigo Duterte told millions of Filipinos in Luzon who will be under an ""enhanced community quarantine"" to seek out their barangay officials and mayors.
President Rodrigo Duterte has already declared a state of public health emergency and placed the entire island of Luzon on lockdown from Monday until April 12 to help contain the novel coronavirus outbreak.
Under the lockdown's guidelines, Filipinos in Luzon can only leave their homes to access ""basic necessities."" Public markets, supermarkets, groceries, and convenience stores will remain open to the public. 
But what will happen to those unable to work during the lockdown, those unable to buy food, and those who are too far from stores?
The President's words: ""San kukuha ng pagkain? It behooves upon the barangay captain. Itong mga barangay captain, makinig kayo. (Where to get food? These barangay captains, listen up) This is a mandatory duty. It does not have to have a law,"" Duterte said in a pre-recorded address aired on Monday, March 16, as coronavirus cases in the country continued to rise. 
He then reminded mayors that they can issue executive orders to deal with the crisis and ""to protect public health, public order, public safety, as long as they are in good faith.""
During a briefing of the Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF) on handling the coronavirus outbreak, IATF spokesman and Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles said local government units should provide aid to their constituents, and the national government will only augment their help.
The national government's role: Duterte said Social Welfare and Development Secretary Rolando Bautista will ""make rounds"" and will have ""people...go around and look for people who are hungry.""
According to Malacañang's memorandum that details the guidelines for the lockdown, the DSWD is in charge of distributing food assistance to ""the most affected residents"" of Luzon.
Food assistance, under the DSWD's assistance guidelines, amounts to P80 per meal per person, and can be delivered in the form of hot meals, food packs, or food allowance.
Duterte said Filipinos should get used to a new normal during the outbreak.
""We cannnot really control, the contagion perfectly. We want it to be perfect, but there will be the downsides: one of them is food, the other one is your salaries,"" Duterte said in a mix of English and Filipino.

REJECTED. File photo of the RO-RO passenger ship St Francis Xavier of 2Go travel. 
CAGAYAN DE ORO CITY, Philippines – Mayor Oscar Moreno said on Monday, March 16, that he allowed the passenger ship M/V St Francis Xavier of 2Go Travel in this city after it was turned away from its original destination.
Moreno said he allowed the ship to dock here for humanitarian reasons.
The M/V Francis Xavier, a roll-on, roll-off passenger ship, left the Port of Cebu Sunday, March 15, and was headed for its port of call in Nasipit, Agusan del Norte. 
While en route, however, it was informed by the Nasipit port authority that it cannot dock there. The town was in lockdown due to the spread of the coronavirus.
Instead, the ship arrived Monday morning in Macabalan port in this city.
Before being allowed to berth, the Philippine Coast Guard asked Moreno if he would allow the St Francis Xavier to disembark its 491 passengers in Cagayan de Oro territory. 
Moreno said it was out of compassion to the passengers that he authorized the entry of  St. Francis Xavier. 
""If we refused to have them dock here, where will they go? They could be passengers wanting to go to their home provinces in Agusan or Misamis Oriental,"" Moreno said.
Moreno added that the vessel could have residents of Gingoog City, and Misamis Oriental, for its proximity to Nasipit port.
Saint Francis Xavier sailed from Manila over the weekend with at least 900 passengers. It docked in Cebu and proceeded to sail to its next port of call, which was originally Nasipit.
""We only asked that the passengers go through a check with health authorities,"" Moreno said.
He said the passengers were checked by Department of Health officials and thermal scanned before going to the Macabalan port's waiting area.
Port authorities allowed 38 provincal buses to enter the facilty. They permitted the passengers to board these buses, sparing them from going to the Agora Bus Terminal which was 4 kilometers away from the port.
Moreno said none of the passengers had a temperature of 38 degrees at the thermal scan.
He also said that DOH representatives also advised the passengers to undergo a mandatory 14-day self-quarantine period. – Rappler.com "

ALBAY, Philippines – The Department of Health (DOH) in Bicol is closely monitoring a person under investigation (PUI) for COVID-19, but the region remains free from the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.
Latest figures from the DOH tracker showed that while Bicol has no confirmed case of COVID-19 as of 5 pm Monday, March 16, one new PUI in Camarines Sur is being monitored by health officials. 
The previously reported 18 PUIs in Bicol have tested negative for COVID-19.
DOH-Bicol director Ernie Vera asked the public to strictly follow preventive measures, including hand hygiene, proper cough etiquette, healthy lifestyle, social distancing, and using masks when needed.
Those with history of exposure and travel to affected areas and are experiencing symptoms must visit the nearest health facility and get checked, Vera said.

MANILA, Philippines – Department of Health (DOH) Secretary Francisco Duque III said the government is eyeing turning the Lung Center of the Philippines in Quezon City into a hospital exclusive for patients with confirmed novel coronavirus infection.
Duque said this in a late-night press conference together with other Cabinet officials on Monday, March 16, right after President Rodrigo Duterte placed the entire island of Luzon under enhanced community quarantine. 
""Tinitingnan po natin ang Lung Center kung puwede po siyang maging COVID-19 hospital (We're looking at the Lung Center if it can be turned into a COVID-19 hospital),"" the DOH chief said.
But Duque said this proposal still ""needs further study,"" as he was told by Lung Center executive director Vincent Balanag Jr that the hospital is still taking care of many patients who do not have COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.  
""Mahihirapan sa ngayon kasi marami pa silang non-COVID-19 patients (It's difficult to implement this now because they still have a lot of non-COVID-19 patients)…. But the operationalization needs further study,"" Duque said.  
The Lung Center currently has 15 isolation rooms available for patients who tested positive for COVID-19. (READ: When you need to get tested for coronavirus – or not) 
It is one of 3 official referral hospitals where the government is currently admitting severe cases of COVID-19, along with the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) in Muntinlupa City and the San Lazaro Hospital in Manila. 
The RITM is also the only accredited testing center for COVID-19 in the Philippines. Duque previously said that the government is working to have 4 more laboratories across the country accredited by the World Health Organization. 
These include the Lung Center, the Vicente Sotto Memorial Medical Center in Cebu City, the Southern Philippines Medical Center in Davao City, and the Baguio General Hospital in Baguio City.
To date, the Philippines has tallied a total of 142 confirmed cases of the new disease, with 12 deaths.

BAGUIO CITY, Philippines (UPDATED) – A patient from Parañaque who tested positive for the coronavirus set Baguio City into a frenzy after the government learned that she attended a three-day conference here last week and even played in her off-hours.
The 24-year-old government employee came from Japan last February and was asymptomatic upon her return.
But as the days progressed, she had a persistent cough and underwent medical checkup at the San Juan de Dios Hospital. She was reportedly listed as a person under investigation.
Instead of going into self-quarantine, she decided to attend a convention of the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) from March 9 to 11 at the CAP Building at Camp John Hay.
She also stayed in a hotel inside Camp John Hay as the government agency rented at least 5 rooms.
Other than CAP and the hotel, the woman also went to eat in some of the better restaurants in Baguio and even went to the Baguio Market.
It was Sunday, March 15, when the confirmatory test result from the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine was brought back to her to say that she was positive of COVID-19 and she reported the matter to her mother agency.
The City Health and Services Office under Dr Rowena Galpo is currently undertaking contact tracing.
According to the manager of the hotel where she stayed, they vacated and disinfected all the rooms.
“We only have 6 guests left and we carefully disinfected the whole place,” he said.
He also said that all their workers had been asked to undergo testing.
Mayor Benjamin Magalong insisted that the case did not originate in Baguio as she was only in transit here.
In Cordillera, the only case is the 39-year-old OFW from Manabo, Abra, who is now confined at a sentinel hospital in La Union.
Magalong, however, placed the city under community quarantine Monday. – Rappler.com "

Minors
Persons with history of pulmonary ailments or disease

Others are encouraged to stay indoors, except when they need to go to work; access food, basic needs, and medication; seek medical aid and assistance; or attend to urgent and necessary personal errands.
The city government is also prohibiting ""non-essential"" social gatherings held in bars, recreation centers, public parks, hospitality industry businesses, conference, and function halls. Private establishments like theater halls and movie houses, schools, and other learning institutions, recreation centers, spas, salons, and the like will be closed.
Allowed to have limited operations are funeral parlors, groceries, supermarkets, markets, convenience stores, clinics, diagnostic centers, internet shops, pawnshops, hotels, and transient houses. Restaurants, coffee shops, and cafes can operate, but only for deliveries and takeout.

The embassy said the coronavirus patient was among those who were under intensive care.
MoFA also informed the embassy that a Filipino was among the 12 new cases of COVID-19 in the UAE, bringing the total number of Filipinos COVID-19 cases to 5.
“UAE authorities have assured that the Filipino COVID-19 patients are being monitored and are receiving necessary treatment according to highest medical standards,” the embassy said.
The UAE Ministry of Health and Prevention (MoHAP) said that with 12 new cases, the number of COVID-19 patients in the UAE was at 98.
Of this number, 26 recuperated, 4 of whom were deemed as fully recovered based on the latest information. They include the Filipino patient, two Bangladeshis, and an Indian national.
In an advisory, ENA said that according to MoHAP, the 12 new cases were tested upon arrival in the country.
“It is reported that these individuals came into contact with people who had tested positive for the virus and are all now quarantined,” ENA said.
Aside from the Filipino, the other new cases include a South African, an Australian, a Chinese, a Lebanese, a British, an Italian, an Iranian, an Emirati, and 3 Indian nationals, ENA said.
MoHAP said the cases were being monitored, and that they were stable and receiving all necessary treatment. – Rappler.com

MANILA, Philippines – As the coronavirus pandemic threatens to spread in the Philippines, a local judge in Naga is moving to ask the Department of Justice (DOJ) to fast-track its processes and implementation of Good Conduct Time Allowance (GCTA) so qualified inmates may be freed soon.
""The Naga City Justice Zone should bring this delayed matter to the attention/assistance of the Justice Sector Coordinating Council for the Joint DOJ-DILG Review Committee to conclude its review so that the suspension of the GCTA may be soonest lifted,"" said Naga Regional Trial Court Branch 61 Judge Soliman Santos in a memorandum sent to his fellow judges on Monday, March 16.
The Justice Zone is a mechanism where local justice clusters, like courts, jails and police, are more interconnected and have a direct line to either the DOJ or the Supreme Court.
Because of the aborted release of murderer and rapist Antonio Sanchez in August 2019, and the exposé that the GCTA was being sold inside prisons, the DOJ revised the internal rules so that heinous crimes convicts are not able to avail of the large-scope GCTA under Republic Act 10592. (They are able to only avail of a much lesser GCTA in the Revised Penal Code.)
Delay in Naga
Although the DOJ earlier said it would continue to process GCTA grants for non-heinous crime convicts, Santos said there is a delay at least in Naga.
""This appears to us to be already undue delay, to the prejudice of so many Persons Deprived of Liberty (PDLs) in the thousands who would ordinarily be qualified for release by virtue of GCTA – and more urgently so from their congested and likely poorly ventilated, if not also unhygienic, jails in this time of coronavirus, whereby they are extremely vulnerable,"" Santos said in the memorandum.
""However we have been informed informally but reliably that, although the Naga City District Jail has continued to compute the GCTA of resident PDLs, their corresponding computations with resultants Certificates of Time Allowance Earned are not yet being released due to a higher office suspension of the implementation and grant of GCTA since late August 2019,"" said the judge.
There is no confirmed case of novel coronavirus in Naga as of writing. Groups have urged the government to release low-offenders, elderly and sick prisoners amid the pandemic.
Defining heinous crimes
Soliman was prompted to act after a convict he sentenced to 3 years for rape by sexual assault is not able to receive his GCTA grant.
Convicted in August 2019, but detained since April 2018, the student-convict would have been free by now or at least within the next 3 months because of the GCTA.
But because of DOJ's revision of the IRR, Santos said there is a delay at least in Naga, made worse by the complication of determining what a heinous crime is.
For the convict sentenced over rape by sexual assault, Santos ruled last March 11 that rape by sexual assault is not a heinous crime, granting the student GCTA and may free him soon.
""Implementation of the GCTA has been suspended by the Bureau of Jail Management and Penology (BJMP) for one, pending review of the Implementing Rules and Regulations and Uniform Policy and Guidelines on the Computation provided under R.A. No. 10952 since late August 2019, or nearly 7 months already,"" said Santos.
DOJ Undersecretary Markk Perete told Rappler ""we’ll try to find out what’s causing the delay in this case.:
""I’ll forward this to Bureau of Corrections through Undersecretary Deo Marco as Bureau of Corrections has been computing GCTA since December last year,"" said Perete. – Rappler.com

MANILA, Philippines – The Philippines now has a total of 142 cases of the novel coronavirus after two more patients tested positive as of Monday, March 16. 
In a bulletin publicized at 7:44 pm on Monday, the Department of Health (DOH) confirmed a 63-year-old man (Patient 141) and a 50-year-old man (Patient 142) tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. 
Patient 141 is currently confined at The Medical City-Ortigas in Pasig, while Patient 142 is under the care of the RESU-NCR (Reporting Facility). 
The DOH confirmed the two new cases less than an hour after Senate Majority Leader Miguel Zubiri announced he tested positive for COVID-19. It remains unclear for now if the senator is among the two new cases.  
Other details about the patients, including places of residence and their travel histories, are still being validated by the DOH.  
The coronavirus fatalities in the country remain at 12. 
The DOH also reported on Monday the first Filipino to recover from the disease, a 46-year-old male resident of Pasay City who had been confined at the Makati Medical Center in Makati City. He was Patient 14.
He had started experiencing symptoms of cough and fever on February 25 but was only admitted to the hospital on March 5. He tested positive for COVID-19 on March 9. 
He is now asymptomatic or not showing any symptoms. He also tested negative for COVID-19 twice, so he was discharged from the hospital. 
""While this is a very welcome development, there is no reason for us to be complacent. In order to contain the virus, we may also need to extend community quarantine to other areas of the country,"" DOH Secretary Francisco Duque III said in a statement.
""We need the public to cooperate with us now more than ever, and serve as our partners in ensuring that the spread of COVID-19 is put to a halt. Let us all act fast and act now,"" he added. 
On Monday morning, Duque delivered a heartfelt but somber speech thanking health workers across the country for their ""heroic"" sacrifices to combat COVID-19. (READ: Duque thanks health workers: ‘The Filipino people will never forget your heroism’) 
President Rodrigo Duterte has already declared a state of public health emergency and placed the entire island of Luzon on lockdown from Monday until April 12 to help contain the outbreak. 
The global death toll, meanwhile, has reached 6,501, with 3,213 of the fatalities in China (excluding Hong Kong and Macau). The number of cases worldwide has risen to 168,250, with more than 80,860 of the infections in China. The virus has spread to at least 142 countries. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – As the fate of their title fights in April hangs in the balance, life goes on for Filipino world champions Jerwin Ancajas and Johnriel Casimero.
Ancajas is holed up in a Makati City condominium with trainer Joven Jimenez as they wait for the signal to proceed to Las Vegas for Ancajas' ninth defense of the IBF super flyweight belt against Mexican Jonathan Javier Rodriguez on April 11 (April 12, Manila time) at the Cosmopolitan Resort and Casino.
Casimero and trainer Nonoy Neri, meanwhile, arrived in Las Vegas from Miami, Florida, for the final buildup of his bantamweight unification collision with Japanese Naoya Inoue on April 25 at the Mandalay Events Center.
They will have to wait until March 25, when the Nevada Athletic Commission (NAC) decides on whether to allow scheduled combat sport events to proceed or not due to the coronavirus pandemic.
For now, the commission has suspended events set until March 25.
According to Jimenez, they are continuing training at their condo unit or at a nearby park for Ancajas to maintain the sharp form he attained during a two-month training camp at the rest house of Big Boss Cement president Gilbert Cruz in Dipolog City.
Jimenez said they were visited by MP (Manny Pacquiao) Promotions president Sean Gibbons on Monday, March 16, to find out how they are coping with the community quarantine imposed in Metro Manila.
According to Jimenez, Gibbons even joined them in their training session.
Scheduled to fly to Las Vegas either March 18 or March 20, Ancajas and Jimenez were advised by Gibbons to stay put, while the international matchmaker awaits a definite ruling from the NAC.
After a month of physical conditioning with Mexican Memo Heredia and gym training with noted Cuban coach Pedro Roque in Miami, Casimero got reunited with Neri, who will be the guy in charge in Las Vegas.
Casimero has been tagged as the huge underdog against Inoue, who will be dangling the WBA and IBF crowns in a much-awaited encounter between power-punching three-division world champions.
Other options being considered for Las Vegas fight cards are to move them to later dates or stage them behind closed doors or even at television studios, with TV commercials expected to compensate for the losses in gate receipts. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – Senate Majority Leader Juan Miguel Zubiri tested positive for the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), he announced to reporters on Monday night, March 16.
Zubiri, the first high-ranking legislative official to contract the virus, said in a statement that he didn't know how he got COVID-19. Zubiri got tested last Friday, March 13.
""This afternoon, I received a call from Secretary [Francisco Duque III] on my condition. My heart sank with what he had said but Im uplifted with the fact that I am asymptomatic and have no fever or cough, nor am I weak or have any headaches,"" Zubiri said.
Zubiri had voluntarily isolated himself, after learning that Senator Sherwin Gatchalian and Senator Nancy Binay had exposure to a COVID-19 patient at a Senate hearing on March 5.
""I was very careful in my dealings with people at work in the Senate. I practiced social distancing as well as a no-handshake policy yet I got contaminated. How? I do not know,"" the majority leader said.
""This just goes to show how easily this virus is spread and therefore it is best for everyone to stay home and stay clean,"" he added.
Zubiri said that he will be on self-quarantine for the next 10 days until he gets checked again whether he still has the virus.
""Sa aking mga kababayans, makinig po tayo sa mga babala ng gobyerno at 'wag na po kayo lumabas sa inyong mga tahanan,"" Zubiri said. (To my fellow citizens, listen to the warnings of the government and don't go out of your homes.)
Zubiri earlier advocated that testing kits must be made available to all hospitals to prepare for the outbreak. So far, the Research Institute on Tropical Medicine (RITM) is the Philippines' sole laboratory accredited by the World Health Organization (WHO) to test novel coronavirus samples.
At least half of senators have gone under self-quarantine, after Binay and Gatchalian did.
Senator Bong Go, meanwhile, was exposed to a coronavirus patient on March 5 as well. He had himself tested on March 12 and his results turned out negative on March 13. A day after that, on Saturday, March 14, he held a mass gathering to distribute aid in Butuan City.

DAVAO CITY, Philippines – Mayor Sara Duterte on Monday, March 16, warned Iglesia ni Cristo (INC) leaders of legal action if they continue to hold worship services even after she had placed the city under community quarantine.
In a statement, Sara also urged INC members not to attend their worship services to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus, which had killed 12 people and infected 140 in the country as of Monday.
Sara said that among her directives on the community quarantine is the suspension of mass gatherings, including religious activities, in the city
She warned that the city government will “explore what we can do on the legal side” if the INC continued to defy the order.
The Davao mayor said she understood that it would be difficult for INC members to comply with her appeal. “I know it's sad for them because their faith is very deep,” she said.
Sara said INC leaders should not expel members for not attending their worship services amid the COVID-19 threat.
“Because what kind of a church would expel a member who wants to protect himself or his family?” she said.
Sara said she learned that the INC continued to defy her orders not to conduct their mass gatherings in the city through an informant.
“He told me that he wanted to invoke citizen's arrest but I told him do not go near them because you might get infected,” she said.
Sara said praying inside churches would not spare those who attended from the virus.
“Only go out to buy medicine or food, wash your hands with soap and water and maintain social distance,” she added.
Sara also said she was  giving the same reminder to the Muslims in the city.
When told that an Arab missionary was insisting on holding Friday prayers in the mosques, she repeated what she told INC members.
“Your attendance to temple, chuch, facility, center will not prevent you from getting the disease. In fact, if you go there and one of those who came had the virus, you will all get infected,” she said.
Sara even quoted a Hadith (saying) attributed to Muslim and Bukhari, ""If you hear of an outbreak of plague in a land, do not enter it, but if the plague breaks out in a place while you are in it, do not leave that place.""
“Pray inside your residences and make use of online platforms,” she said.
For example, a pastor can go live on Facebook, she said. “Let us make use of technology to practice our faith-based activities,” she added.
Most Catholic churches in Metro Manila have suspended Masses starting Saturday, March 14, after the Duterte government announced it was placing the capital region on lockdown due to the novel coronavirus on March 15. – Rappler.com

BUDGET CARRIER. A Cebu Pacific plane prepares for landing at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport. Photo from Shutterstock 
MANILA, Philippines – Budget airline Cebu Pacific decided to lay off 150 newly hired cabin crew, as several provinces and cities are restricting flight travel over the novel coronavirus.
Given more citywide quarantines, Cebu Pacific explained that reduced operations mean fewer flight staff are needed.
""It is a difficult decision but we are letting go of our newly hired cabin crew because less flights mean less time and opportunity for them to gain inflight experience,"" the budget airline said in a statement sent to Rappler on Monday, March 16.
""It is painful, but necessary action to take to cope with the impact of COVID-19.  We assure everyone that they are treated fairly and have been given packages which are more than what the law requires.""
The newly hired cabin crew's last day will be on Thursday, March 19.
""We also assured them that if the business picks up, hopefully in the very near future, they will be prioritized in the hiring,"" Cebu Pacific said.
As the coronavirus started hurting the aviation industry, Cebu Pacific executives voluntarily took pay cuts starting March to avoid layoffs.
The airline also delayed non-critical projects and programs, froze hiring, deferred some training programs, and restricted overtime.
The Philippine government has since restricted land, air, and sea travel to and from Metro Manila, prompting Cebu Pacific and other airlines to cancel all domestic flights to and from the capital region.
Cebu City stopped accepting flights from any local airport, while Davao City banned flights coming from Clark Airport in Pampanga.
Zamboanga del Norte also restricted air travel to and from its main gateway, the Dipolog Airport. Only movement of cargo is allowed.
In a bid to help local airlines, Philippine aviation officials deferred fees for takeoff, landing, and parking for a year.

A province-wide curfew from 8 pm to 4 am was also imposed. 
Ilocos Norte was the first province to impose a community quarantine in the Ilocos Region.

""Going to neighboring provinces for work purposes, however, shall be allowed provided the same is not a COVID-19 affected area.""
""Non-residents who are working in Ilocos Sur shall be allowed to enter the province once provided they are not COVID-19 infected or residents of a COVID-19 affected area and shall undergo the screening protocols set forth before entry,"" the EO also read.
Frontliners like medical personnel and police are exempted. No stopovers are allowed for travelers going to Ilocos Norte, for example.
""No transfer and/or referral of patient/s coming from neighboring provinces to any health facility in the province of Ilocos Sur shall be allowed during the entire community quarantine period,"" it added.
Big gatherings will also be suspended. In this regard, Ilocos Sur 2nd District Representative Kristine Meehan and National Artist Ryan Cayabyab decided to postpone the 2nd Candon Music Festival indefinitely.

MANILA, Philippines – Health Secretary Francisco Duque III thanked all health workers on the frontlines of the fight against the novel coronavirus, calling them heroes.
Duque expressed his gratitude during the flag-raising ceremony at the Department of Health headquarters in Manila on Monday, March 16, a little over two months since the Philippines recorded its first case of COVID-19, the disease caused by 2019-nCoV.  
The number has since risen to 140 cases, 12 of which were fatal.  
“Stay strong and keep alert. Keep heart. The Filipino people will never forget your heroism in this phase of great adversity. And may your families relatives and friends continue to understand our solemn oath. I pray with them and the whole nation that we shall overcome,” Duque said. 
“We continue to rely on your heroism in the weeks and months ahead. I also hope to see you in better times to personally embrace and thank you for indeed your manifest sense of heroism,” he added. 
Duque, a physician before he started serving in government, had a somber mood throughout his speech. He opened his address by acknowledging the difficult task of the health sector now, which is suffering from depleting funds as well as low medical supplies and protective gear.

CAGAYAN DE ORO CITY, Philippines – Mayor Oscar Moreno ordered the temporary closure of malls, watering holes, entertainment centers, and bars, and other public places here starting Tuesday, March 17, as part of measures to stop the spread of the novel coronavirus.
On the same day of the indefinite closure, the local government will also impose a city-wide curfew.
Moreno issued the order Monday, March 16, and urged residents here, as well as the nearby areas of Northern Mindanao, to stay in their homes and do self-quarantine.
Moreno said he declined imposing a lockdown because it would harm Cagayan de Oro's economy since the city is the regional hub of Northern Mindanao.
Earlier, the city declared the cancellation of classes in all levels.
Also ordered closed are all internet and gaming shops in the city.
Exempted from the closure order are:

groceries and 24/7 convenience;

supermarkets;


 
public markets;
gasoline stations;
banks;
pharmacies;
bakeshops;
pet shops;
hardware stores;
health Clinics, diagnostic centers and laboratories;
and restaurants.

The Cagayan de Oro-wide curfew will be from 10 pm to 5 am. Only those who work at night will be exempted from this imposition.
The following are expected to close down during duration of the nightly curfew: stores, bars, restaurants, spas, massage parlors, videoke bars and the like.
The popular night agri-food market in Cogon Market will also be temporarily stopped.
""Because Cagayan de Oro is a convergence city, people from other provinces have different reasons why they need to come here,"" Moreno said.

Sotto said they got the idea from Valenzuela City, which earlier passed a similar ordinance to prevent panic buying.
Last week, the Pasig mayor urged his constituents to be considerate when stocking up on food and supplies. This was before the national government announced the ""community quarantine"" of Metro Mania.
""Kawawa naman 'yung mga mauubusan (How unfortunate for those who won't have any left for them),"" Sotto said on Wednesday, March 11.
On Friday, March 13, Sotto warned the public that hoarding disinfectants and sanitizers may inadvertently cause the virus to spread faster.
""Babalik din po sa atin 'yun. Kapag hindi nakapag-sanitize 'yung ibang tao, eh 'di baka lalong kumalat 'yung virus,"" he told reporters as he led the distribution of disinfectant kits to leaders of Pasig's barangays.

MANILA, Philippines – People going inside grocery stores will be limited to minimize the risk of spreading the novel coronavirus, based on a new memorandum circular from the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI).
While grocery stores and supermarkets will remain open during the lockdown in Metro Manila, the DTI said the number of people should be limited inside the selling area.
There should only be one person for every square meter (sqm) of free space in the store. This means that a store with 200 sqm of free space can accommodate 200 people.
The DTI said it will coordinate with the local government units for effective implementation of the order. (READ: 'Customer not always right': Alcohol hoarders should be sent out of stores, says DTI)

MANILA, Philippines – The office of Vice President Leni Robredo and its partner-donors were able to raise as much as P12.3 million to buy more personal protective equipment (PPE) sets for health workers on the frontlines of fighting the novel coronavirus outbreak.
According to Robredo's official Facebook account on Sunday, March 15, the Office of the Vice President (OVP) allotted P5.9 million of its current 2020 budget for the donation drive. 
The remaining P6.4 million was raised by private donors and the Kaya Natin! Movement, a partner-organization of Robredo's flagship anti-poverty program, Angat Buhay. 
The OVP started distributing the first batch of PPE sets for some 1,000 frontliners on Monday, March 16.
""Patuloy ang pakikipag-ugnayan ng aming opisina sa Department of Health (DOH) upang matukoy kung aling mga ospital ang kailangan i-prioritize na mabigyan ng karagdagang PPEs (Our office continues to coordinate with the DOH to identify the hospitals to be prioritized in the distrubtion of additional PPEs),"" the OVP statement read. 

With the increasing number of cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, the DOH is in dire need of funds to buy more PPE sets for some 5,000 government health workers working for 90 days.
Health Secretary Francisco Duque III previously said that one PPE set costs P1,500, including headgear, goggles, an N95 mask, gloves, apron, and gown. That's around P7.5 million for one PPE set for each of the 5,000 frontliners alone.
This was why the DOH has been asking Congress to augment the P530 million it currently has to fund efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19. It has sought P2 billion more.
But the House committee on appropriations was only able to approve P1.65 billion worth of supplemental funds for the DOH, as this is the only amount available in the National Treasury.
Duque said on March 10 that the health department will have to source additional funds from the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation, which has committed to give the DOH an additional P2 billion, and the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office, which will be providing the agency with P420 million.
The COVID-19 outbreak has been worsening in the Philippines. From just 6 cases on March 7, the total number had reached 140 as of early Monday afternoon. Of the 140 cases, 12 patients have died.  
Still, the DOH said two patients have already recovered from COVID-19, while another 5 cases who now have mild symptoms have been moved out of the hospital to undergo home quarantine instead.
President Rodrigo Duterte placed the entire Metro Manila under lockdown and gave the go signal to provinces, cities, and municipalities to put their respective areas under community quarantine as needed.

CARE FOR SENIORS. What should older Filipinos amid the coronavirus pandemic? File photo by Mark Saludes/Rappler 
 
Older persons age 60 years and above who become infected with the novel coronavirus have a greater chance of hospitalization, complications, and death. Aside from age, medical problems such as heart and kidney disease, diabetes, and asthma may individually and cumulatively contribute to a poorer outcome. (READ: No, coronavirus isn't the same as the flu)
So how do you protect yourself? An older person needs to eat a well-balanced diet, with a lot of fruits and vegetables, stop smoking tobacco, and engage in daily physical activities. Multivitamins or nutritional supplements may help if you are unable to eat properly, have poor dentition, or have a medical illness that affects appetite and digestion. Taking a daily dose of Vitamin C and a little bit of Zinc within 200% of the daily recommended allowance may help. Avoid high doses of any Vitamin C (2000 mg or higher) as this may cause kidney stones.
During hot days and summer, make sure that you take plenty of water, 1.5 to 2 liters a day, for those without kidney or heart disease. You may need a reminder to do this, as older persons may not always feel thirsty even if they are already dehydrated. Set up a one-liter pitcher of water on your table to remind you of how much you need to take before sunset. Take soup and juice in between. If you always get up at night to urinate, you may limit your fluids after 7 PM. 
Follow your doctor’s advice on any disease that you have. Make sure you have at least 2 months' stock of your maintenance medicines. If you need to follow up with your doctor or dentist, try a telephone, text, or online consultation before heading off to a hospital or clinic. Geriatricians do house calls for older persons who have a disability, or are bedridden. Take the yearly influenza vaccine and once-in-a-lifetime pneumonia vaccine. These two vaccines may help lower complications when the rainy season arrives. You don’t want both COVID-19 and the flu to hit you! (READ: 'Super-spreaders': A coronavirus myth or reality?)
Present yourself to the Emergency Room only if you have fever, cough, or diarrhea and know about a recent exposure to someone with COVID-19 or who had traveled to a COVID-19 hotspot. Tell your family to help you to the hospital, and don’t wait to consult until you can no longer breathe or have chest discomfort. 
As a senior in the community and household, you have the responsibility of caring for others. Be aware of the DOH and WHO guidelines and always get updated through reliable sources of COVID-19 information. Be an expert in proper hand washing and cough etiquette. Lead your family in prayer and lighten the mood through humor. Share your wisdom and good counsel. You have much to contribute during this crisis. Social distancing may be important, but God’s spirit links us all. – Rappler.com

With that said, I had to make the hardest decision of my life. I would not go home. Not this time. 
I’ve been crying since the night I learned about the cancellation of flights to Manila. I am frustrated that I have no control of the situation. No matter how badly I want to go home, I cannot risk being a possible carrier of the virus. (READ: Metro Manila to be placed on lockdown due to coronavirus outbreak)
I'd made a promise to myself that starting this year, I would be as helpful a person as I could be to 3 people: my lola, my closest friend's dad, and my former tutee's grandfather. And this is the best thing that I can do for them at this moment.
The fact that the virus hasn't stopped spreading, and could especially kill the elderly or people who have weak immune systems, is an issue that needs to be taken seriously. What's worse is how it can affect our mental health, incuding those who won't even get infected by the virus. The virus can threaten our wellbeing, and test how we treat other people. It’s a normal reaction to panic, but it is not necessary to be selfish in this situation. (READ: [OPINION] Notes from a supermarket on the last day of freedom)
I do have high hopes that most of us will help one another by obeying the protocols given by professionals and the government. They may not be easy to follow, but they are doable. Despite the panic and fear that we are feeling right now, the best solution to the problem is to be the solution and always do the right thing. And I hope we will continue to practice washing our hands, keeping hydrated, and basically having a healthy and balanced lifestyle even if the outbreak is over. 
And even if this year didn’t start well, remember that as long as the sun still rises and sets for us, there is still hope. It will be over. Let us be patient together and encourage one another. 
If you have OFW friends and family who are having a hard time understanding the situation, please do check on them by sending a message or calling. It’s the best way to comfort them during this time.
My heart goes out to all my kababayans abroad, and my friends who had also planned to go home this summer. It's not easy to seek comfort by yourself, to need a warm hug when your loved ones are away. Know that you are not alone. I understand how you feel. 
And to those who are currently in the Philippines during the quarantine, I may not know how it feels like to be isolated because of the virus, but please don't feel so bad about it. Hang in there a little longer. Things will get better. Let’s continue to believe that they will. – Rappler.com

MANILA, Philippines – Employees of Lucio Tan's MacroAsia are taking unpaid leaves as the aviation sector continues to take a hard hit from the novel coronavirus.
MacroAsia is an aviation-related support services company, which provides catering and ground handling services to airlines. (READ: Philippine Airlines lays off 300 workers)
In a letter to the Philippine Stock Exchange on Monday, March 16, MacroAsia said a ""rotating voluntary no-work, no-pay schedule is being implemented on all pay grades"" as the company loses revenues.
Top management is also taking a 10% pay cut to help save jobs affected by the diminished workload.
""For airport stations where volumes are down, variable labor (outsourced) are being discontinued on a temporary basis. With the recent pronouncement of the government on domestic travel ban, a retrenchment program on a LIFO-basis (last in, first out) is being considered as a last recourse,"" MacroAsia said.
The company estimates a revenue downturn of around P867 million. MacroAsia said it is losing almost P300 million a month due to travel bans.
Operating expenses of the company are also being reduced as night-shift work is minimized.
""Utilities expenses, including rates, are being reviewed. Discounts for some recurring high-value, high-volume consumption items were sought from supplier-partners for a limited period,"" MacroAsia said. – Rappler.com "

CROWDSOURCING. Dakila gets data from free lancers who've lost gig during the quarantine. Screenshot from Dakila 
MANILA, Philippines – Dakila, a collective of artists, students, creatives, and other individuals, are crowdsourcing data from freelancers as the effects of a month-long “community quarantine” began in Metro Manila, the Philippines’ center of commerce and business.
The Philippines is dealing with rising cases of the novel coronavirus. 
“The COVID-19 pandemic has shown in very short order how fragile the economic existence of the everyday person is. If you are an artist, cultural worker, freelance content creator, or creative gig worker, you have likely already seen work opportunities disappear, and are likely anticipating more,” reads the introduction to the Google Spreadsheet.
On Monday, March 16, the group posted on its Facebook page a Google Doc where freelancers – artists, cultural workers, freelance content creators, and the like – can put in the number of gigs they’ve lost since the lockdown was announced, how much potential income they’ve lost, and how much more money they’re expecting in the coming 3 months.
Explaining why they were crowdsourcing data, Dakila said: “We recognize that any fundraising efforts on our part — be it crowdfunding campaigns or getting support from organizations — require information to be more convincing (particularly to large institutions) and so that the response can be proportional.”
“We encourage all freelance artists affected by the community quarantine to fill out the attached form and share it with your networks. The data gathered shall be shared individuals and organizations that can provide relief,” the group added.
The freelance sectors covers a wide range of jobs, from events hosting, performing, events styling, hair and makeup, photographer, and the like.
On March 12, President Rodrigo Duterte announced that a community quarantine – or a lockdown, in his own words – would be imposed on Metro Manila as national government’s effort to curb the spread of COVID-19, the disease cased by the novel coronavirus.
The lockdown has allowed movement to and from and within Metro Manila, although people are advised to minimize outside interactions. Events and gatherings have also been barred during the period, as cases of the novel coronavirus rise in the country.

The diocese administers over all Roman Catholic churches in the province of Albay.
Bishop Joel “Bong” Z. Baylon released the guidelines during the online mass Sunday aired over the Diocese-run radio station, Radio Veritas of Legazpi.
The guidelines barred from attending to either of the 3 services those who travelled from Metro Manila or "" any other place outside of the Bikol Region where COVID-19 has been determined as present.""

""The bride and the groom should have been in the vicinity of the Bicol Region for at least 2 weeks, and should not have travelled to Manila or any place outside the Bikol Region, in order that the wedding ceremony be allowed,"" said the directive.
The ban extends to the wedding entourage (principal & secondary sponsors, maid of honor, best man, etc), guests and those involved in planning the event.
Baylon's directive said: ""The entire wedding entourage (photographers included) shall not be more than 20 individuals, and should observe hygienic protocol and the required social distancing, i.e., at least 1 meter away from the nearest person.""

 
Baptisms will only be held with 5 babies/candidates, the respective parents and godparents. Only one or two sponsors will be allowed.
Only ""parents may stay near the child, the sponsors shall keep the required distance.""

,"March 16, 2020",nCov,[OPINION] What will happen to poor students when schools go online?,Prince Kennex R. Aldama,"
 
 
I just attended a meeting on the utilization of online learning materials, as our university is about to use these to aid the continuation of our classes amid the coronavirus outbreak. For this so-called distance learning to be effective, a student will need a computer and stable internet.  
Earlier this week, the university tasked each faculty member to conduct a survey in our respective classes to assess our students’ access to virtual learning. The survey asks how many students have computers and internet access in their homes. All of my students, in 4 classes, have computers. But some of them do not have access to the internet when they go home. (READ: How Metro schools continue lessons amid coronavirus threat)
I start to wonder about other students in the country who do not have internet access, let alone computers and gadgets. What will happen to their learning when their school suspends classes? How are they going to have access to online learning materials? 
The presence of technology and digital classrooms are manifestations of a modern education system. We see that distance is being overcome. The physical presence of warm bodies is not necessary for a class to be held.  
While the presence of technology is one good story of innovation, access to them is another. This issue is rooted in the larger social problem of digital inequality. Only those who have the resources to buy gadgets and to get an internet connection in their homes are the ones who are privileged to continue their learning despite the physical distance. They are ensured that their education is not compromised at times like these.
The adjustments done by universities for continuing teaching through online resources is an impressive solution. But the situation also unearths the reality that income and social inequality breeds digital inequality. When they go back to school, the poor will have to make up for the lessons they missed, having not been able to attend the online classes. (READ: [OPINION] Let’s not forget the poor during the coronavirus pandemic)
Online classrooms, internet resources, and digital technology have been remarkable modes of closing the physical distance and making education perpetual and accessible. But we must ask, “For whom?”
Students can only go so far with their access to technology. In a world where virtual reality and digital classrooms are becoming a feature of formal education, having a personal computer and a reliable internet connection is a sure advantage. For those who do not have access, this is yet another challenge that they have to work hard to overcome.
After this pandemic, the gap between the rich and the poor will still remain. The lower classes will continue to navigate their way around the limits of their daily lives to have better access to the things they need in order to survive.
This painful reality of inequality is not just virtual. Decent food, clean water, safe shelter, quality education, affordable medicine, and secure jobs are concrete and tangible necessities. These are part of the greater gaps that we need to close if we want everyone to go the distance. – Rappler.com

,"March 16, 2020",nCov,[OPINION] Loving your country is very different from loving your government,Jaira Roxas,"
 
I believe this started during the Philippines' hosting of the 2019 SEA Games, when there were many organizing mishaps – the foreign athletes' poor accommodations, the P50-million opening ceremony cauldron, the displacement of Aetas as New Clark City was being constructed, and all the unfinished venues days before the opening.
All these prompted those ""critical"" of the government to call out the organizers (headed by none other than House Speaker Alan Cayetano) for having such a big budget but delivering poor results. The ""supporters"" of the Duterte administration were then quick to defend the organizing officials, saying that we had to cut them some slack because they were working hard and doing their ""best.""
Then came the amazing opening ceremony. All of us were in awe – I for one got really hyped over the performances. The production was world-class, and the moment the Filipino athletes came out in the parade, I was just so elated, my heart soaring upon seeing them smiling and waving little Philippine flags. Add to that the moment when Filipino sports legends came out to raise the SEA Games banner, and that was when I'd probably hit peak Filipino pride. 
Then the social media wars started. As we all tweeted the Philippine flag emoji, people were calling others out for being hypocrites.
It was preposterous at best. I know this firsthand because I had clashed with friends who believed being critical of the government and/or calling out the administration could not be done while you were proud of being Filipino. 
I was enraged. How could people say that being critical and being proud were mutually exclusive? 
A friend also pointed out: when you're critical, you use your mind. When you're proud, that's your heart and feelings at work. Those are different things.
Loving your country is very different from loving your government. Besides, who are we to stay blind when faced with blatant incompetence? As a taxpayer, I know that I – we – deserve better.
Now the same scenario is happening as Metro Manila goes under ""community quarantine"" to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus. People are calling others out for pointing out the things that should be improved by the administration.
The military and police are being deployed instead of implementing large-scale health measures. The President placed us under this ""community quarantine"" (a lockdown, in essence), but only very vague guidelines were provided. As of writing, they haven't even released the Executive Order for this ""quarantine."" 
However, people say we should just ""obey."" People say we should just trust the President.
But how can we give our trust when we don't really know if there is a long-term plan to address the pandemic? How do we give our trust if this administration believes that the root of all the country's problems are illegal drugs? How do we trust an administration who keeps cutting the budget on health and education, just to add money to intelligence funds that just result in ""Red October"" plots and ouster plot matrices?
My heart goes out to every single frontliner in this health emergency – the health workers, hospital staff, LGU officials, establishment guards and maintenance staff, and all other men and women keeping this situation from getting out of hand. They really are gems and they should be protected.
But I still stand that our government could have done better and been prepared better for this. I am still holding them accountable. (READ: Metro Manila to be placed under curfew during lockdown)I love the Philippines. I love the people in it, with their smiles and their hospitality and resiliency and so many other things. So I will not turn a blind eye when government incompetence makes these people suffer even more.

MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – The rush hour on Monday morning, March 16, saw vehicles piling up around Metro Manila where checkpoints have been placed to help combat the spread of the novel coronavirus.
This is the first Monday of the lockdown in Metro Manila, a measure imposed by Preisdent Rodrigo Duterte's government to contain COVID-19, the disease caused by 2019-nCoV that has so far infected 140 people and killed 8 across the Philippines. (READ: LIST: Metro Manila lockdown checkpoints)
On Monday morning, commuters had to wait for several minutes as cars, jeepneys, UV Express vans, trucks, and motorcycles are stopped by checkpoint frontliners to get their temperatures and verify their documents to ensure they are either residents of the city they are entering or they are working there. 
Even pedestrians are asked to line up at the checkpoints to have their temperatures taken and their purpose of travel assessed. (READ: At Cainta-Marikina checkpoint, some pedestrians evade temperature check)
While stringent protocols are in place regarding social distancing, it's nearly impossible to implement this during the rush hour as commuters scramble to get seats in cramped jeepneys and buses so they could get to work on time.
The week started with a total of 140 people in the Philippines tested positive for COVID-19. Of this number, 8 have died. The Department of Health, however, said two patients have already recovered while 5 cases who now have mild symptoms are under home quarantine.

MANILA, Philippines – Several pedestrians passing through the checkpoint along the border of Marikina City and Cainta – both under quarantine due to the novel coronavirus outbreak – are able to evade temperature check on Monday morning, March 16. 
Health worker Jocelyn Landero of Barangay San Isidro, Cainta, admitted to Rappler the 3 thermal scanners they have are not enough for the deluge of people and vehicles that need to enter Imelda Avenue or Felix Avenue from the Marikina-Infanta Highway, also known as Marcos Highway.
“Kulang na lang po kami siguro sa tao… Kulang [din ang thermal scanners]. Nagpadagdag na po kami. Baka po mamaya, dala na po nila,” Landera said. (READ: Coronavirus lockdown: Metro Manila to Cainta, from one quarantine to another)
(We are perhaps undermanned... We also lack thermal scanners. We already asked for additional ones. Maybe they'll send them in later.)
Landera said they are expecting 3 more thermal scanners to arrive within the day, but these would likely arrive during the second shift.
At past 6 am on Monday, Landera and two other barangay health workers at the checkpoint were two hours away from ending their 8-hour shift. They are assisted by 7 traffic enforcers and 5 police officers who stop pedestrians and motorists along the road.

But Rappler observed several people are still able to evade having their temperatures checked, especially when the checkpoint personnel are focused on the passengers of stalled vehicles. 
The pedestrians would instead walk on the elevated walkway of the nearby Sta. Lucia East Grand Mall instead of the sidewalk, where the checkpoint frontliners are located. 
The overpass at this part of the highway also has two stairways entering into Cainta. Only one is covered by the checkpoint. On the other side of the street, pedestrians are able to enter and leave Imelda Avenue without any temperature checks. 
Face masks rule
Anyone who wish to enter Cainta through this checkpoint will be required to wear a face mask as well. Those who don’t are asked to improvise with any handkerchief, towel, or cloth they have in their bags. 
If people don’t have anything in their bag to improvise with, traffic enforcer Rizalina Diaz said that they ask the pedestrians to go home or buy a face mask first. 
“Pababalikan na lang po natin. Mag-provide sila ng face mask o kaya kung may mabibilan sila diyan, bumili na muna sila bago sila bumiyahe,” Diaz said. 
(We will ask them to go back home. They have to pesent a face mask or buy one before they go on the road again.) 
FACE MASKS. Pedestrians along Imelda Avenue in Cainta were face masks on March 16, 2020. Photo by Rob Reyes/Rappler 
But in most cases, the checkpoint frontliners still allow the people to pass through, since Landero said that it was the humane thing to do while the whole country continues to grapple with the spread of COVID-19, the disease caused by 2019-nCoV.
“[May] nakakadaan? Siguro depende na rin sa ano pero minsan kasi, nakikiusap din. Siguro tao din namin. Tao din naman kami, puwede po. Bukas po, hindi na pupuwede,” Landero said. 
(Some people are able to pass anyway? It depends, because some of them appeal to us. We are people like them so we allow some of them to pass through. But we tell them that by tomorrow, they can’t go here without a face mask.)

MANILA, Philippines – A total of 444 Filipinos who were repatriated from the quarantined ship MV Grand Princess are now back in the Philippines.
According to the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA), the chartered flight carrying 438 crew members and 6 passengers from the cruise ship left the San Francisco International Airport at 9 pm Saturday, March 14 (Pacific Time) and arrived at the Haribon Hangar in Clark Airbase, Pampanga, at around 2:15 am Monday, March 16.
DFA said the disembarkation at Oakland Port in California started Saturday around noon.
""Upon disembarkation from the ship, the repatriates all underwent health screening by the US Department of Health and Human Services, which included thermal scanning and other diagnostics to test if they had symptoms of COVID-19,"" the DFA said in a statement on Monday.
""As a matter of protocol, only those who were asymptomatic were allowed to board the buses that transferred them to San Francisco International Airport.""
Upon arrival at Clark Airbase, all 444 repatriates were brought to the Athletes' Village in New Clark City for their 14-day quarantine period.
This is the latest batch of repatriates that the DFA brought home from areas affected by COVID-19. The DFA had also repatriated Filipinos from Hubei, China, where the novel coronavirus originated; from a quarantined cruise ship in Japan; and from Macau.
Meanwhile, 94 Filipinos onboard MV Grand Princess will remain in the US for now. Of this number, 78 are crew members who opted to be part of the ship's minimum safe manning and minimum operational manning teams.
Thirteen have tested positive for COVID-19 and were put in health facilities in the US, said the DFA. The remaining 3 passengers are California residents who stayed behind.

MANILA, Philippines – Pasig has begun enforcing a nightly curfew after its city council passed earlier on Sunday, March 15, an ordinance allowing the measure aimed at stifling the spread of the novel coronavirus.
Although other cities in Metro Manila such as Muntinlupa, Makati, and Manila also announced curfews on Sunday, only Pasig began implementing it the same evening.
As was agreed on by the Metro Manila Council, Pasig’s curfew runs from 8 pm to 5 am, during which all citizens are expected to stay indoors unless they fall under the following exceptions:

People going to work or returning home from work
People buying food and essential supplies
People responding to emergencies
People traveling for medical or health reasons

In Pasig’s Barangay Santolan, the police patrol began a few minutes past 9 pm. Joined by barangay security officers, they merely urged people they found outdoors to go home and stay indoors until morning. They ordered shops and stores to close for the night.

It was too early to mete out punishment on violators, as the law under normal circumstances requires a two-week interim after an ordinance’s publication before it can be enforced with penalties.
However, in an emergency, a curfew may be imposed but without punishing violators. 
“Although the word used is ‘curfew,’ the focus is really on encouraging people who are simply loitering or roaming around to go home,” Pasig Mayor Vico Sotto told Rappler in a message.
As of Sunday, the Philippines has had 140 confirmed cases of the virus, and 12 deaths. Pasig has had at least 9 residents who contracted the disease.

MANILA, Philippines – At 8 in the evening on Sunday, March 15, Pasig became the first city in Metro Manila to enforce a nightly curfew in an effort to quell the novel coronavirus.
Other local governments in the metropolis have announced their own curfews, to begin on Monday.
In Pasig, patrols were delegated to police community precincts (PCP), and at 9 pm, about a dozen policemen and barangay security officers made the rounds of Barangay Santolan to urge people to go home and stay indoors until 5 the next morning, when the curfew ends.
The curfew will last for a month, or until the threat from the coronavirus is abated.
Mayor Vico Sotto's instructions were to urge people to vacate the streets and remind them to practice ""social distancing,"" which is to stay at least one meter apart from one another to avoid spreading or contracting the virus.
The goal, he said, was not to catch violators but to get people to safety – and at home is where they should be safest from the coronavirus.
Rappler joined the police patrol in Barangay Santolan, which began from Pasig's PCP 7 in Barangay Manggahan.
Why a curfew?
In this video, we give you the background of the curfew ordinance, as the police unit waits for their cue to begin the night's rounds.

How to get people to go inside?
When the police patrols entered the winding neighborhoods of Santolan, some people were caught unaware that a curfew had been declared. The cops told them – some gently, some rather sternly – to get off the streets and stay home until morning.

This first patrol turned out to be more of an information drive to tell people about the curfew. The police officers said people could expect them to be more strict in the coming nights. – Rappler.com "

Photo by Gelo Litonjua/Rappler  CEBU CITY, Philippines – Cebu City Mayor Edgar Labella placed Cebu under community quarantine, effective Monday, March 16, at 12:01 am.  Executive Order 52 was released late Sunday evening during a press conference held by the mayor.   The inter-agency task force on COVID-19 only recommends community quarantine if there are 2 or more confirmed cases in a city, municipality, or barangay.
“We dont’ have yet a confirmed positive case,” Labella said during a press conference on Monday, March 16. “But it is better to be preemptive and precautionary rather than reactive.”   He said that while there were no positive cases there were a number of persons under monitoring (PUMs) – or people who have traveled to areas where novel coronavirus is present but no systems manifested – and persons under investigation (PUIs). These are persons who have traveled to areas where coronavirus is present and have flu-like symptoms.   Labella said the growing number of cases globally triggered the move to put Cebu City – the economic center of the Visayas – under community quarantine. “We must not wait for more cases before taking action,” the mayor added in Cebuano.   He added that the EO was complementary to Cebu province’s move to restrict entry into the province and take stricter precautionary measures in combating the virus.
Cebu City, although it is the capital of Cebu province, is independent of the provincial government.
Under community quarantine, all residents are advised to stay in their homes, except for necessary travel such as work; buying groceries, food, or medicines; or to go to the hospital.
The EO said that government work would “not be disrupted” but government agencies were encouraged to make alternative work arrangements for employees.  Seaports in Cebu City are now closed to ingoing and outgoing trips, except for cargo.
Health checkpoints will also be set up in the entry points of the city’s borders.
The order also asks barangays to take charge of surveying residents who may have symptoms.
Prior to the EO, a curfew had already implemented for minors between the hours of 8 pm and 5 am.  Because citizens aren’t banned from going out, Labella said that he did not want to call the EO a lockdown.   After a month-long quarantine was ordered of Metro Manila, thousands fled to their homes in the provinces. (READ: Metro Manila lockdown begins) Over 300 arrived in the Port of Cebu on Saturday. Local officials asked them to self-quarantine and consider themselves PUMs.
Earlier on Sunday, the first positive coronavirus case in the Central Visayas died in Dumaguete City, prompting Cebu Governor Gwen Garcia to ban trips from Negros Island. (READ: Negros Oriental councilor dies of coronavirus)

MANILA, Philippines – Checkpoints at the northern borders of Metro Manila lacked thermal scanners on Sunday, March 15, the first day of the lockdown to contain the novel coronavirus.
At the border separating Malanday in Valenzuela City from Meycauayan City in Bulacan, soldiers manning the checkpoint were not using thermal scanners. A soldier there told Rappler their scanners broke from the early morning of Sunday.
Valenzuela City Mayor Rex Gatchalian said their health workers were supposed to provide the thermal scanners, but they were forced to pull out because the Philippine National Police (PNP) told them so.
""In the original setup, we should have had health workers doing the checkup for fever. We had thermal scanners, but at the last minute, the PNP bosses instructed us that it was no longer the setup. So they pulled out our people. The checkpoints are operated by PNP and Army so we have to follow,"" Gatchalian said in a mix of English and Filipino on Twitter, in response to a video posted by Rappler.
At the Mindanao exit of the North Luzon Expressway, operations had to pause because the thermal scanners were running out of battery. When they worked, soldiers were only using thermal scanners, but not checking IDs.
In a statement, the Armed Forces of the Philippines' Joint Task Force National Capital Region said their soldiers are equipped.
""Yes, we are equipped. Actually, the soldiers have different taskings. In a squad, two soldiers have a thermal scanner, while the others will check for the identification,"" said 1st Lieutenant Arrianne Bichara, spokesperson for the task force. – Rappler.com "

,"March 15, 2020",nCov,[OPINION] What will we tell future generations about the coronavirus?,Jo-Ed K. Tirol,"
 
 
Yesterday afternoon, I drove to Antipolo to visit my parents. With the NCR quarantine taking effect today, I won't be able to see them face-to-face for at least a month.
Over an early dinner, my mom and I were discussing the inconveniences and difficulties quarantine might bring, and of course, the looming threat of death by COVID-19, the disease brought about by the novel coronavirus. She pointed out that the generation of my grandparents, and I'm in my 40s, had it much worse. They had to survive the Japanese Occupation and all the horrors that it brought, for 4 years.
In retrospect, COVID-19, although possibly fatal, is still not as frightening as 4 years of starvation and warfare. Fighting an armed opponent is no joke, especially with shortages of food, medicine, and information making day-to-day life very difficult.
My mom's own generation endured Martial Law. That meant 14 years of authoritarian rule, the threat of detention, torture, and death, and an economy mismanaged and looted. Martial Law was already a year old when I was born. Although I have strong memories of the period, these are still through the eyes of a child growing up, and not consciousness of an adult living a nightmare in his own country. (READ: [OPINION] Marcos and Duterte: Strongmen's changing playbook)
On the other hand, there are ways to combat the virus, if we are careful rather than carefree. Boredom at home is the least of one's worries. Be glad that you are precisely safe at home, because the risks faced by medical workers in hazardous environments is only too real. The same is true for policemen and soldiers manning roadblocks, employees of the transportation industries, and other occupations whom by definition cannot exercise enough social distancing. (READ: LIVE: Coronavirus advisories)
My frustration is that government at the highest levels has shown little concern and instead coughed out much inanity. To say, for example, that we should have sympathy for a tired, old president rather than hitting him with scorn, is missing the point. In times of crisis, especially in times of crisis, if one cannot cut it, then get out of the way, step down, and give it to someone who can, according to the rules of succession in a democratic society.
We don't need senators-turned-page turners. We need leaders who actually lead, rather than plaster their faces on alcohol bottles to be distributed to constituents. We don't need leaders who ramble and rumble during press conferences without knowing where to begin, or even where to end. Rather, we need leaders who appreciate what people are doing to make things better, even if they must endanger themselves for the greater good.
I am still hoping that implementing rules and regulations can be finalized sooner rather than later, but with proper coordination with other agencies rather than haphazard, contradictory announcements. I am aware that in a crisis there is a rush to issue orders, but orders without basis or direction make situations worse rather than better. And we definitely can't afford worse.
During an emergency meeting, and there have been many over the last week, someone said that COVID-19, for all the fear it generates, is also an opportunity. In many institutions, the transition to online work is fast-tracked, because face-to-face is no longer an option. Fear breeds necessity, and necessity abbreviates movement towards much-needed change.
Empty corridors in the malls, vacant seats in stadiums and movie houses, silence in the streets can be taken as a chance for introspection in what seems to be unreal, unwelcome gaps in our daily routines. This too is an opportunity to reflect. To spend time with family. To spend time with ourselves. Perhaps the contingencies generated by COVID-19 could even be an antidote to the virus that is too much clutter in daily life, and not enough space to really live.
To young people now, this could be THE moment you will later remember most, and later tell your children about, as Martial Law was to mom and dad, or the Occupation was to grandfather and grandmother.
But to get past this moment, we need to make it all OUR moment. Please do what you can to help, not hoard. This is not just a question of YOUR surviving. It is OUR surviving. In a pandemic, local, national, and international borders are mere lines on paper. COVID-19 doesn't give a damn about your gender, age, social economic class, and nationality.
So for all our sakes, please do give a damn. This is not the time for I, my, myself, even just my family. Amid COVID-19, there is only US.
Just, US. – Rappler.com

SINGAPORE – Filipinos entering Singapore, if coming from the Philippines, need to stay home for 14 days after entry into the city-state, as part of efforts to fight the novel coronavirus.
The same rule applies to individuals with travel histories to other member-states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), Japan, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom, said the Singaporean Ministry of Health (MOH) on Sunday, March 15.
In a statement, the MOH said visitors with travel histories to these countries will be issued a 14-day stay-home notice.
A stay-home notice requires a person to remain in his or her place of residence at all times. The person is not allowed to leave his or her residence even to buy food and other goods.
Penalties include prosecution under Section 21A of Singapore's Infectious Disease Act, and revocation of their work or reentry permits.
""From 16 March 2020, 2359 hours, all travelers (including Singapore residents, long-term pass holders, and short-term visitors) entering Singapore with recent travel history to ASEAN countries, Japan, Switzerland, or the United Kingdom within the last 14 days will be issued with a 14-day stay-home notice (SHN),"" said the MOH.
""In addition, they will have to provide proof of the place where they will serve the 14-day SHN, for example a hotel booking covering the entire period, or a place of residence they or their family members own. They may also be swabbed for testing for COVID-19, even if asymptomatic. This is because of the risk of community transmission in these countries and evidence of cases that have been imported from these countries into Singapore,"" the ministry added.
On top of this, short-term visitors who are citizens of ASEAN countries need to submit information on their health to the Singapore overseas mission of their country of residence. Singapore's MOH will have to approve this submission, and the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority needs to verify this.
Travelers without this approval will be denied entry to Singapore.
The MOH said: ""In addition to the SHN requirement, from 16 March 2020, 2359 hours, all short-term visitors who are nationals of any ASEAN country will have to submit requisite information on their health to the Singapore Overseas Mission in the country they are resident before their intended date of travel. The submission will have to be approved by Singapore's Ministry of Health (MOH) before travel to Singapore, and the approval will be verified by the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) officers at the Singapore checkpoints.""
""Short-term visitors who arrive in Singapore without the necessary approval will be denied entry into Singapore.They are therefore advised to secure the approval before making definitive travel bookings,"" said the MOH.
This comes after the number of imported coronavirus cases in Singapore rose in recent days.
Singapore has identified the Philippines as among the countries that have exported COVID-19 cases in the city-state.
There have been 9 Filipino coronavirus cases in Singapore. At least 5 of them recently visited the Philippines.
Singapore on Friday, March 13, cautioned its citizens against traveling to the Philippines and other countries that have exported COVID-19 cases to theirs.
Singapore has had 212 novel coronavirus cases as of Saturday, March 14.

LAGUNA, Philippines – Against the glaring headlights of cars lined up, Ryan Arboleda, a nurse at the San Pedro City Laguna Epidemiology Surveillance Unit powers through the row of people attempting to cross the city border into Muntinlupa, Metro Manila.
He knows he must check every passenger for symptoms of the coronavirus disease, also known as COVID-19, before anyone enters the mega-city. Armed with only a surgical face mask, gloves, and a handheld thermometer, beads of sweat trickle down his face after checking nearly 50 passengers. 
It’s Sunday, March 15, and barely an hour has passed since the Philippine government enforced a lockdown of Metro Manila in a bid to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus. 
For government health workers like Arboleda, the order means they are tasked to head to the frontlines to check each person who moves into and out of the capital region for signs of the virulent disease. 
His tool of measure is precise: anyone exhibiting temperatures of a fever must turn around and head back to where they came from if they do not live in the metro. 
On the first night of the lockdown, described by government officials as “community quarantine,” Arboleda stands one health worker among cops as the city’s health unit is spread thin monitoring other checkpoints across Laguna.  
""Tinulungan lang po natin mga kapulisan para lamang kung sakali may mga katanungan ang mga pasahero natin o mga indibidwal na nahaharang po natin, meron isang local health authority na mapagtatanungan at makakapagbigay ng tamang kaalaman,"" Arboleda told Rappler. 
(We are helping the police so that in case there are passengers and commuters who have questions, there is someone from the local health authority to give them correct information.) 
Aside from addressing commuters' concerns, Arboleda is responsible for ensuring police can properly check passengers and screen them for symptoms. 
As of Sunday, March 15, the Philippines counted 140 coronavirus cases, including 11 deaths. Laguna reported its first case the same night the lockdown was enforced. 
Arboleda is aware of the risks his job brings, but times of crises, he said, reinforce the virtue of his calling to become a health worker.
""Sanay na po mga health workers natin dito sa Pilipinas…. Ito ang direktiba na tinanggap natin para tugunan ang tungkulin natin bilang manggagawa ng kalusugan,"" he said.

MANILA, Philippines – Makati Mayor Abby Binay is placing the entire city under a general community quarantine starting March 16 to April 14 to help contain the spread of the novel coronavirus. 
Binay signed Executive Order (EO) No. 10, Series of 2020, on Sunday, March 15, the same day she delivered a public address discussing its main contents through a Facebook Live video aired on Makati’s official page.  
Under the community quarantine, the movement of all persons within Makati’s borders will be “limited to accessing basic necessities” during the quarantine period or until the national government’s Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging and Infectious Disease will change its recommendation for the lockdown imposed in Metro Manila. 
Binay is also imposing a daily curfew from 8 pm to 5 am in the city starting Monday, March 16. Several city-run facilities and commercial establishments often frequented by the public for recreation and entertainment will also be closed. (READ: LIST: Metro Manila lockdown checkpoints)
According to Binay, the City Council is set to sign a resolution on Monday to declare a state of calamity in Makati, which would allow the city to tap into its Quick Response Fund to help combat COVID-19, the disease caused by the 2019-nCoV 
As of 4 pm on Sunday, Makati has recorded a total of 14 confirmed cases of COVID-19. The Philippines has so far recorded 140 cases of COVID-19, 11 of which are fatal. 
Binay is “strongly” directing Makati residents to stay at home, especially those who are 60 years old and above, those who are immunocompromised or with co-morbidities, and pregnant women.
Among those exempted from the curfew are health workers, call center agents, passengers going to the airport for international flights, and skeletal forces of city hall.

Is anyone exempted from curfew? Yes. Binay said the following will be exempted from the 8 pm to 5 am daily curfew:

Those working in business with a work schedule within curfew hours
Health workers
Authorized government officials
Those traveling for medical and humanitarian reasons
Persons transiting to airport for travel abroad

Persons delivering food and medicines
Essential skeletal workforce of the Makati City government 

What establishments will be closed? Binay is temporarily closing down all malls in Makati. But groceries, pharmacies, 24/7 convenience stores, banks and financial institutions, hardware stores, health clinics, diagnostic centers and laboraties, and restaurants with take-out or delivery services will remain open.
The mayor is also prohibiting bars, resto-bars, KTV bars, cocktail lounges, theaters, gyms, private basketball and badminton courts and other similar establishments from operating. Also closed starting on Monday are city-run facilities like basketball courts, multi-purpose halls, swimming pools, public schools, and the University of Makati. 
What establishments will remain open? The Makati City Hall will remain open, but skeletal workforces will be in place to continue delivering vital and essential services to residents. Social distancing will be strictly implemented.  
The following city-run offices will remain open as well:

Ospital ng Makati
Makati Health Department
Barangay health centers
Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Office
Public Safety Department
Department of Environmental Services
Makati Action Center

Will there be enhanced community quarantine? Yes. Binay is allowing enhanced community quarantine for persons under investigation (PUI) or persons under monitoring (PUM) for COVID-19. 
An enhanced community quarantine means the person cannot leave his or home, transportation will be suspended, and provision for food and essential health services will be regulated. 
Binay said if a PUI or a PUM lives in a condominium unit, the city government has the power to place the entire building under an enhanced community quarantine “effective immediately from notice.” – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines (4th UPDATE) – The Department of Health (DOH) confirmed 29 new cases of the novel coronavirus in the country on Sunday, March 15, bringing the total number of cases to 140.
The DOH also announced that 4 more patients have died from the virus. The death toll now stands at 12.
The 4 latest fatalities are the following:

9th death: 86-year-old American male from Marikina City with travel history to the United States and South Korea. He was the 9th recorded case, and died on Saturday, March 14.
10th death: 40-year-old Filipino male from Pasig City with no travel history and no history of exposure 14 days prior to onset of symptoms. He was the 54th recorded case, and died on Sunday, March 15.
11th death: 64-year-old Filipino male from Negros Oriental who went to Greenhills. He was the 39th recorded case, and died on Sunday, March 15.
12th death: 56-year-old Filipino male admitted to Makati Medical Center who was reported to have preexisting asthma. He was the 12th recorded case, and died on Sunday, March 15.

Earlier on Sunday, the Negros Oriental provincial government said the fatality from the province was a councilor from the municipality of Tayasan. He was an immunocompromised patient, having had a kidney transplant before.
The DOH also said in a separate statement on Sunday that 5 confirmed cases who have mild symptoms ""are under home quarantine based on the existing decision tool for the diagnosis and management of COVID-19.""
The DOH added that only 2 patients have recovered so far, both Chinese tourists from Wuhan who traveled to the Philippines. They were the 1st and 3rd recorded cases in the country.
Meanwhile, at least 4 members of the Duterte Cabinet have tested negative for the virus – Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea, Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III, Transportation Secretary Arthur Tugade, and Public Works Secretary Mark Villar.
They were among the government officials who went into self-quarantine after exposure to a person who later turned out to have the virus.
With the rising number of coronavirus cases, Metro Manila went into lockdown beginning Sunday. Travel in and out of the capital region is restricted. (READ: Day 1 of Metro Manila lockdown: Different checkpoints, different rules)
President Rodrigo Duterte declared a state of public health emergency last March 9. – Rappler.com "
,"March 15, 2020",nCov,[ANALYSIS] The flawed economics of Duterte’s partial Metro Manila lockdown,JC Punongbayan,"
 
 
To contain the further spread of COVID-19, on March 12 President Rodrigo Duterte put all of Metro Manila under partial lockdown (technically “community quarantine”) from March 15 to April 14. 
Although certainly better than nothing, there are reasons to believe this partial lockdown – as designed by Duterte – will not be very effective in containing the disease.
Duterte’s partial lockdown also doesn’t provide any financial assistance for workers and businesses whose incomes and livelihoods will be wiped out by the resulting economic downturn.
'Flattening the curve'
To contain COVID-19, epidemiologists around the world recommend “social distancing.”
This chiefly involves closing down schools, offices, malls and public places; banning mass gatherings; and encouraging or requiring people to go into home quarantine.
Social distancing works. Figure 1 shows that when done properly it spreads a viral outbreak over a longer period of time, but lowers the peak number of cases.
By “flattening the curve,” so to speak, we can prevent overwhelming our hospitals, exhausting frontline health workers like doctors and nurses, and preventing shortages of much-needed equipment like masks, gloves, and testing kits.

— The Spinoff (@TheSpinoffTV) March 8, 2020

 
But besides social distancing, Duterte is also imposing upon us a partial lockdown. Movements in and out of Metro Manila are now restricted, but not totally prohibited.
Such lockdown is certainly better than nothing. It’s also much less economically disruptive than a mandatory lockdown, where we’re all trapped in our houses.
But because sealing off an entire region is next to impossible, a partial lockdown is inferior to, and less effective than, social distancing in containing a viral outbreak (see these animated visualizations).
Duterte’s partial lockdown also has too many weak points.
For instance, it still allows workers to go in and out of Metro Manila, provided they show identification at checkpoints. Considering there are about 3 million such transient workers – both those knowingly and unknowingly infected – it’s hard to imagine how this can effectively contain COVID-19 in Metro Manila.
Second, international flights will still be allowed under certain conditions. Unless government beefs up its contact tracing – as done in other countries – this might only spread the disease all over the place.
Third, Metro Manila’s mayors are mulling a curfew from 8 pm to 5 am. But the virus respects no schedule, and absent similar restrictions of movements during the day, the virus can still freely spread outside curfew hours.
Fourth, Duterte first announced the lockdown on Thursday, March 12, giving everyone two days to flee Manila and stay in the provinces before the curfew on Sunday, March 15. Hours before the shutdown, throngs of people were still jostling to catch flights at the airport.
Without knowing who among them were infected or not – because too few have been tested so far – this could have accelerated the spread of the virus outside of Metro Manila.
Recall that a similar thing happened in Wuhan City, the original epicenter of COVID-19. In time for their Lunar New Year holiday, some 5 million people, or half their population, fled before a city-wide lockdown was imposed. Experts believe this exodus raised the risk of spreading COVID-19 elsewhere, leading to the present pandemic.
All in all, Duterte’s community quarantine is not airtight and somehow defeats the purpose of containing the disease. One prominent doctor even called it “a mockery” of the concept of community quarantine.
Such policy would be much less useful if there are, in fact, already thousands of Filipinos already infected with COVID-19, but we’re just woefully clueless since too few of us have been tested.
Safety nets
Duterte’s partial lockdown also comes with it severe economic disruption that he doesn’t seem to have foreseen and prepared for.
For starters, malls have been advised to stop all their operations for a month. Considering that nearly two-thirds of our economy rests on consumption, and a third of our national output comes from Metro Manila alone, this spells a severe economic downturn.
Besides malls, lots of other businesses will suffer huge losses as customers stay at home over the next month, presenting severe cash flow problems that could bury lots of entrepreneurs – especially small and medium enterprises – in debt.
Millions of workers risk losing their incomes, especially those who live outside of Metro Manila. Lining up at the checkpoints will add to their commuting woes, eat up their working hours, and erode their incomes.
Trade Secretary Ramon Lopez blithely suggested that business owners should just encourage their employees to find a place to rent here in Metro Manila – as if that’s so easy for ordinary workers to do. Rents in the city are so much higher and will eat up a sizable part of their meager pay.
Even more insensitively, Secretary Lopez bade all workers in the informal sector – with no valid IDs to show proof of employment or business in the city – to just ply their wares and do business outside Metro Manila.
This again is glaringly anti-poor and sure to impoverish those just hanging on the edge of the poverty line.
The partial lockdown behooves the Duterte government to extend various forms of financial assistance to everyone whose incomes and livelihoods are in danger.
As I wrote in my previous piece, these safety nets may come in the form of temporary tax relief for businesses, as well as paid leaves, wage and rent subsidies, and cash transfers for workers, especially those in no-work-no-pay arrangements. (READ: Can Duterte ward off a coronavirus economic slump?)
All these may be folded into a comprehensive stimulus package bill by Congress. Thankfully, one such proposal amounting to P108 billion has already been put forward by Marikina Representative Stella Quimbo – formerly a health economist and professor of mine at the UP School of Economics.
Unfortunately – but unsurprisingly – Duterte himself said nothing about any such economic assistance during his nationwide address on March 12.
At this point are we even surprised he has a shortage of both economic competence and sympathy for the plight of the poor?
Priorities
With the death toll rising in the Philippines – according to the Department of Health there are now at least 11 deaths out of about 140 confirmed cases as of Sunday afternoon – an outbreak this drastic requires similarly drastic solutions. No less than UN Secretary-General António Guterrres said, “We must declare war on the virus.”
But Duterte’s partial lockdown has too many loopholes that do not ensure at all that the disease will be effectively contained. It’s also glaringly inequitable.
Finally, Duterte is dangerously treating this new public health problem as a law enforcement problem – as he did with the war on drugs.
Rather than pouring resources into the police and military, his government should instead be prioritizing support for hospitals and health workers (like doctors and nurses) who are at the real frontlines of this battle.
Rather than firearms and checkpoints, we need more masks and testing kits. – Rappler.com

,"March 15, 2020",nCov,Filipino workers worry about low daily earnings amid coronavirus outbreak,Rappler.com,"
 
MANILA, Philippines – As of Sunday, March 15, the  government has implemented aggressive measures in an effort to contain the spread of the 2019 novel coronavirus in the Philippines. 
On the first day of the lockdown or the so-called ""community quarantine"" of Metro Manila, the government has deployed several security personnel at various checkpoints in the region that are implementing their own version of rules to contain the coronavirus.
Earlier this month on Wednesday, March 4, the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) also issued guidelines that employers should follow when implementing flexible working hours in response to the outbreak. 
However, these options are easier said than done for the frontliners, service staff, and essential personnel who do not have the luxury to work from home, go on leave, or reduce their work hours and work days.  (READ: Groups slam 'grossly anti-poor' measures for labor during Metro Manila lockdown) 
This is especially true for minimum wage earners including grocery staff, cashiers, vendors, PUV drivers, conductors, and food workers who rely on their day-to-day wages to survive.  
To capture the sentiments of the ordinary workers on this crisis, MovePH mobilized its movers to ask Filipinos how they are dealing with the coronavirus outbreak and the Metro Manila lockdown.
Through the #StoryOftheNation campaign, vendors, drivers, and other Filipinos shared their fears and thoughts about the pandemic. 
Affected earnings 
One of their most common concerns was how the outbreak will affect their daily earnings. They said the past few days have been a struggle to reach their ideal, daily earnings.

“Ngayon medyo mahina ang kita dahil malimit ang taong lumalabas dahil sa COVID-19 at apektado ang hanapbuhay dahil walang pasok,"" tricycle driver Rene Florendo said.
(Business is slow since there are fewer people going outside due to COVID-19. My work has been affected since schools and companies cancelled classes and work) 
According to Florendo, he is practicing basic preventive health measures such as washing hands regularly given the nature of his job.
""Medyo maingat lang sa paghahawak sa mga bagay, pagsukli ng pamasahe,"" he added. (I am extra careful in handling things and fare) 
Jomer Sumbang, 33, carenderia owner. Photo by Jene-Anne Pangue/Rappler  
In general, vendors and tricycle drivers agree that their daily earnings have dramatically decreased since news about the increasing number of coronavirus cases in Metro Manila came out. 
Jomar Sumbang, 33, owns a carenderia. He said that not a lot customers are going to his eatery. Still, he chooses to stay hopeful.
“Humina dahil wala masyadong pumapasok sa trabaho.  May pangamba pa din dahil sa virus pero may pag-asa naman,"" Sumbang said. (I barely earn since people barely report to work. While the virus scares me, I think there's still hope.) 
'Can't afford to panic buy'
Based on the interviews made for the #StoryOfTheNation campaign, vendors in public markets are faring better than drivers and carinderia owners.
News of the Metro Manila lockdown have pushed many residents to stock up their pantries and freezers. Not a few headed to public markets to escape the long lines in grocery stores. (READ: Hoarding, overpricing would lead to criminal charges, warns DTI)
“Sa ngayon lumakas ang benta gawa ng naghahanda ang mga tao kung halimbawa, hindi sila makalabas dahil sa nasabing lockdown. Pero alam natin na hindi maganda ang nangyayari kasi may kinakatakutan kaya dapat mas maging maingat,"" meat vendor Rolly Bacalla said.
(Sales incresed for now because people are preparing for a lockdown scenario. We understand that we should not entirely rejoice and that we should exercise caution.) 
The same is true for fish vendor Salvacion Capariño who noticed that people are adequately preparing for possible worst case scenarios the outbreak could bring.

Unfortunately, the busy activity in markets recently does not necessarily mean that all vendors could also afford to have a stockpile of essentials that will last them for weeks.
Luisito, a 62-year-old vendor based in Bulacan, noted that those who have the capacity to do so are lucky for they can afford to hoard a month's worth of food and grocery.

""Suwerte yung mga maraming pera, nakakapag-stock ng maraming pagkain. Tugon ko naman sa bigas na sagot ng Presidente, hindi lang naman bigas lang ang kinakain ng mga Pilipino. Kung makakapag-supply sila ng pang araw-araw na pangangailangan, mas maganda,"" Luisito said. 
(The rich are lucky since they can stock up on a lot of food. I wish we could get enough support from the President beyond the dole out of rice. After all, rice is not the only food we consume. If they can supply our everyday needs, that would be better.)
Courage on
One thing connects many of these hardworking vendors, drivers, and small-time business owners and it's that life goes on for them despite the constant threat the coronavirus may bring. 
In this trying time, they are calling on the government to support those who are in need and are sick.

MANILA, Philippines – Even after an ordered lockdown on government sports facilities, the Philippine Sports Commission (PSC) will continue to look after the national athletes and coaches who were left behind.
A total of 28 athletes, 4 Filipino coaches and 2 Korean coaches – from fencing, boxing, athletics, and 6 para sports – were unable to secure tickets back to their home destinations, prompting the government sports agency to accommodate them.  
According to PSC dormitory manager Roselle Destura, the athletes and coaches will remain billeted at the PSC dormitories in the Philsports complex in Pasig City. 
They will be provided with food, recreation facilities, and medical monitoring as Metro Manila was officially on lockdown on Sunday, March 15. 
Although athletes were asked to vacate PSC's facilities on Thursday, March 12, chairman William ""Butch"" Ramirez personally instructed the agency’s officials to ensure the unhampered delivery of basic services to the national athletes.
""These are extraordinary times which call for extraordinary commitment and service from all of us,"" explained Ramirez. 
In previous announcements, the agency closed its two major facilities – the Rizal Memorial Sports Complex (RMSC) in Manila and Philsports in Pasig.
Acting executive director Merlita Ibay supervised the sanitation activities in both venues and assisted athletes in booking their plane tickets. 
The two deputy executive directors Atty Guillermo Iroy and Simeon Rivera, meanwhile, ensured that staff are available for any medical emergencies, delivery of basic services in the facilities and its remaining occupants, as well as the processing of salaries and allowances of national coaches and athletes.
""We all increase our susceptibility when we go out of our homes, but we also know that there are very basic services that we need to deliver,"" said Ramirez, who has been very hands-on in ensuring that all preventive measures are taken for the safety of athletes, coaches and employees.
""I appreciate the sacrifice of our officers and staff to brave the risk to work on these things. Ito talagang para sa inang bayan (This is for our country).""
The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the Philippines climbed to 111 on Saturday night, March 14 with a total of 8 deaths.

MANILA, Philippines – The Department of Health (DOH) has confirmed 73 new coronavirus cases on Sunday, March 22.
In an interview with DZBB, Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said the total number of confirmed cases in the country has shot up to 380 as of Saturday night, from their earlier tally of 307, marking one of the biggest jumps in the Philippine record so far.
Before this, the DOH reported on Saturday afternoon an increase of 77 new cases from Friday's tally.
Vergeire also confirmed that the total number of deaths related to the virus had reached 25, and recoveries had increased to 15.
Why the big jump? According to Vergeire, the leap in figures could be ""artificial"" as the government conducts more tests and gathers more results.
""Our capacity has stabilized. We are already going through our backlogs before. Our capacity has been expanded to other laboratories,"" Vergeire said in Filipino.

Cebu recorded its first coronavirus case on Wednesday, March 18. The 65-year-old patient from Mandaue City is recovering, Department of Health Region 7 Director Jaime Bernada had said. 
Garcia said here that the 24-hour home quarantine will be enforced starting Sunday, March 22.

""Tanan nga mga estudyante will be under a 24-hour curfew. Diha nalang sila sulod sa balay (All students will be under a 24-hour curfew. Stay inside your homes.),"" Garcia said.

MANILA, Philippines - Concerns are mounting for informal workers and urban poor communities across Metro Manila, as the sweeping restrictions on travel and city-wide curfews have left thousands of the country’s indigent with little means to support themselves.  
A full week into the mega city’s enhanced quarantine, communities have now reported no updates or contact from government officials, with many fearing they won’t have the ongoing support needed to cope during the COVID-19 pandemic, which has now killed over 10,000 people worldwide.  
“I still have supplies, but I’m not sure when they will run out. I have 1kg of rice to feed a family of five, some canned goods and instant noodles. I think it will last the next two days. So many people here can’t work given the restrictions. We need food,” said Virgie Lorica, an urban poor community leader in Caloocan City. 
The Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) reports around 38% of its population work within the informal economy, which includes jobs such as tricycle and pedicab drivers, jeepney drivers and road-side sellers. Many of these citizens also live in informal settlements, or slums.  
With the entire country told to stay at home, all informal workers have no option to avail of financial assistance from an employer, and will rely heavily on help from the government.
Meanwhile, commentators and netizens alike have criticized the government’s response to the urban poor’s plight, following comments earlier this week from Presidential Spokesperson Salvador Panelo who suggested, ""no one dies of hunger, even for a month."" 
The comments came before the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) suspended several subsidy programs for the country’s poorest between March 15 - April 15, citing adherence to government quarantine guidelines, given many programs require citizens to receive cash transfers in-person. 
While the DWSD has since stated they are working on reinstating some assistance programs for those in need, Erik Villanueva, Local Governance Coordinator at the Institute for Popular Democracy in Quezon City said that the suspensions were indeed a cruel blow for urban poor communities across the metro. 
“This is the time when those communities need the subsidies the most. It leaves many families and senior citizens with zero income whatsoever. That is concerning,” Villanueva said. 
“You also need to consider a large percentage of poor families, maybe around 60-70%, are not eligible for any subsidy program because their income is above a certain threshold. However, they still have very low incomes overall and will need assistance going forward to feed their families,"" he said, adding:
“Hopefully, the government will release special cash subsidies for a broad range of indigent citizens. Unfortunately, we’ve heard little from officials regarding this type of support.” 
Villanueva said that such ""special"" subsidies would not be without precedent, referencing the cash handouts given to jeepney drivers during the fuel crisis of Gloria Macapagal- Arroyo’s government in the early 2000s. 
Rudy*, a street vendor working in Manila’s Santa Mesa district, whose family is based over 20- kilometers away, said that he has no option but to keep working, as his wife and children were still waiting for food and emergency supplies from the government.  
“I’m only making 100 pesos per day at this point. Before the lockdown, I usually made around 500 (pesos). I haven’t been able to return home to my family for five days. because there’s no transport. It’s so far, I can’t walk,” said Rudy.  
“I hope the government will take care of us - this quarantine could go longer than they’re saying” he added. 
Reflecting on the government’s current plans for the poor, Villanueva asserted that the measures so far were mostly geared on formal workers and the wealthy:
“While they’ve made televised assurances the military and local governments will help the poor, current measures and support are really only conducive to the middle and upper class; those who have enough money and a vehicle to hunker down, or those who will be receiving assistance from their employer.
“Of course, no one in their proper mind could question the necessity of the lockdown to contain the virus, but more action is needed to address the questions and concerns of poor communities on how they will make it through this crisis. 
“To-date though, I think what some officials have made clear: for a government who is insensitive to the issue of extrajudicial killings of its citizens, there’s every chance they’ll be insensitive towards the hunger of its people.”

MANILA, Philippines – “He is a casualty of this war.”
In a Facebook post on Saturday, March 21, the Philippine Heart Association (PHA) announced that one of its members died due to COVID-19 “while fulfilling his duties as a doctor.” 
“It is a sad day for the whole association as we have lost one of our own in the fight against COVID. He is a casualty of this war. We honor him as he lost his young life while fulfilling his duties as a doctor, a young cardiologist and a dedicated member of PHA,” the post read. 
The doctor wasn’t identified in the post. It wasn’t clear yet if he was among the 19 fatalities announced by the Department of Health (DOH) on Saturday. 
The PHA asked for prayers for the doctor, for the recovery of the COVID-19 patients, and for the coronavirus frontliners. (READ: LEFT IN THE DARK: Little protection forgovernment's coronavirus frontliners)
“Please pray for all our members and all our other doctors and healthcare workers in the frontlines and all the people who are afflicted by the disease,” the PHA said. 
Meanwhile, at least 144 doctors and nurses at The Medical City (TMC) in Pasig City are under self-quarantine due to exposure to the coronavirus, based on the hospital's daily update.
""Alam mo 'yung challenge is not like 'yung number lang, [pero] ang exposure ng mga doctor at ang bilis ng kalat [ng virus]. And then, nauubos na 'yung mga PPEs (personal protective equipment) namin.

MANILA, Philippines – The 18th Congress is set to pass a bill that would tap into some P200 billion from government-owned and -controlled corporations (GOCC) funds to deal with the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak.
Coming from a meeting with Malacañang and House leaders, Senate President Vicente Sotto III said Saturday, March 21, that the bill will give President Rodrigo Duterte the power to realign available funds from GOCCs to finance measures to deal with the pandemic.
Discussing the proposal with reporters, Sotto said: ""Not emergency powers. Not supplemental budget. [The bill would give] financial authority to realign funds available to address the COVID-19 emergency crisis.""
Sotto said that there's no specific amount that would be included in the bill, a copy of which is yet to be made available to the media. The P200 billion in funds is the estimated amount of money available to be tapped according to economic managers.
But the Senate president said that the bill would include provisions on giving food and cash aid to those affected by the Luzon-wide lockdown.
Sotto, along with Senator Bong Go, Senate health panel chair, and Senator Pia Cayetano, Senate ways and means panel chair, met with senior Cabinet officials Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea, Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III, Budget Secretary Wendel Avisado, and Interior Secretary Eduardo Año.
Their counterparts at the House of Representative were also there, Speaker Alan Cayetano, Deputy Speaker Luis Raymund Villafuerte, ACT-CIS Representative Eric Yap, the new House appropriations panel chair.
According to Dominguez, the P200-billion worth of funds will come from ""non-budgetary sources.""
""We are not reducing the amount of spending. We will source the funds from non-budgetary sources. This will not impact taxes. We want to preserve the Build, Build, Build program and all the economic programs of President Rodrigo Roa Duterte to reduce poverty in the country,"" Dominguez said in a video on Cayetano's Facebook page after Saturday's meeting.
It was unclear where the funds would be sourced specifically. In a text message to Rappler, Avisado said that the Department of Finance (DOF) will announce the details on Monday, March 23.
""Ang DOF po ang magso-source out 'nyan po. Sa Monday po ilalahad nila 'yan,"" (DOF will be the one to source out the funds. They will announce that one Monday),"" Avisado told Rappler.
Special session
A special session will happen on Monday at 10 am, to approve the measure, which is dubbed ""Heal As One"" bill. It was Cayetano's idea.
Several senators have ended their self-isolation due to exposure to a coronavirus patient two weeks ago. Senate Majority Leader Juan Miguel Zubiri has tested positive for the virus. But Sotto said that there will be no problem with quorum.
The House leadership, meanwhile, decided that only 20 congressmen will be allowed to be physically at Batasan. The list has yet to be finalized. The rest will have to use the teleconferencing app Zoom for manifestation and interpellations. Votes will be cast through social messaging app Viber.
Two employees of the lower chamber had died of COVID-19.
Duterte declared a state of calamity in the Philippines and a total lockdown on the island of Luzon, to arrest the spread of coronavirus.
Several provinces, cities, and municipalities in the Visayas and Mindanao had likewise declared localized lockdowns.

MANILA, Philippines – Cops rounded up dozens of people in Manila Saturday afternoon, March 21, using a spurious police advisory as confusion led to the increase of apprehensions after Luzon was put on lockdown to contain the coronavirus.
The latest source of irritant was a bogus advisory about ""window hours"". The Philippine National Police (PNP) has disowned this advisory, but cops on patrol still accosted individuals using the fake information. 
Paolo Alfonso was on his way home from buying food when he was stopped by cops at the foot of the Bacood-Mandaluyong Bridge in Manila. Alfonso said more than 30 people were rounded up around 5 pm Saturday.
Around 7:30 pm, PNP Spokesperson Major General Benigno Durana sent a message to reporters with another graphic disowning the phoney ""window hour"" advisory.
At 9:30 pm, Justice Secretary Menardo Guevarra, senior member of the Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF) said: ""Walang ganyang ka-specific guidelines na galing sa IATF. That is unauthorized.""
(There are no IATF guidelines as specific as that. That is unauthorized.)
The cops who apprehended Alfonso's group showed the fake graphic advisory from a phone identifying window hours for going outside. In the bogus advisory, 2-5 pm was ""travel ban"" misspelled as ""travel van"" in the graphic.
The apprehending police invoked the spurious advisory as the basis for hauling Alfonso and the rest.
Alfonso said he told the cops he has not heard of an official ""window hour"" advisory. The apprehending police brushed aside his arguments and told him to just follow the rules. (READ: Luzon lockdown: What are the do's and don'ts?)
""Ang nakakatakot dun may isang senior citizen na nakikipagtalo. Tinatakot siya na huhulihin,"" Alfonso said in a phone interview with Rappler Saturday night.
(What's scary was that there was a senior citizen who was arguing with cops. He was threatened with arrest.)
The erroneous graphic advisory said the public was allowed to go out between 5 to 8 pm. Alfonso's group pointed this out when the clock struck 5 pm.
""Palabas na kami hinarang pa kami ulit na kinakausap pa namin kayo,"" (We were about to leave, when the cops stopped us and said they were still talking with us.) said Alfonso. 
""(The PNP) said they will relay this to the local units to prevent further reliance on this (spurious advisory) for arrests,"" said Justice Undersecretary Markk Perete.
Window hours have been a major source of confusion, with the PNP saying Local Government Units (LGUs) may enforce their own window hours. The city of Manila  does not have one, Mayor Isko Moreno has clarified.

Held at the station for an hour
In Pasig, police held over a dozen people at the station for over an hour around 4:30 pm for not having quarantine passes.
One person in the group talked to Rappler, but asked not to reveal his identity.
The person was buying food at one of the stores in Barangay Napico-Manggahan when he was approached by a cop.
""Ang approach sa akin hinawakan na ko sa balikat then 'yun pinasakay kami sa police mobile, 13 kami, ang issue namin dun sabi ko social distancing, pero pinuno nila kami sa mobile. Nung nasa istasyon pinag kumpol kumpol kami,"" said the source.
(The cop approached me and held my shoulders. Then they made us ride the police mobile, all 13 of us. My issue there was, there was supposed to be social distancing, but the mobile was full. At the station we were also crowded.)
They told the police their barangay officials have not issued passes yet. When the cops escorted them to the barangay hall, they were then told there were not enough printed passes for everyone.
The barangay made them sign their names on a piece of paper. They were told cops would check their names to see if they have been arrested the previous night. Curfew in Pasig is only from 8 pm to 5 am.
""Kung 2nd offense na raw namin, ikukulong na kami at magbayad ng P50,000 (We were told that if it was our 2nd offense, we would be jailed and we would pay P50,000),"" said the source.
They were released around 6 pm.

BATAAN, Philippines – The Department of Health (DOH) confirmed the second case of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Bataan, after a patient referred to as PH303 tested positive and was now being treated in a provincial hospital here.
Because of this development, Bataan Governor Albert S. Garcia appealed to the public for unity and cooperation by following the rules of the Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ) to help slow the spread of the disease in the country.
The Provincial Health Office (PHO) here has started contact tracing of individuals related to the second case of COVID-19.
While still gathering more information, the Bataan PHO said that PH303 lived in the same dormitory in Manila as PH64, the first confirmed case from this province. PH303 went home to Bataan when he felt the onset of a respiratory illness. 
According to the last health update, PH64 was getting better, and may recover soon.
At the time of writing, the Bataan Provincial Health Office said there are 4,475 Patients Under Monitoring (PUM) and 231 Patients Under Investigation (PUI) here. 
Governor Garcia said: ""I am directly appealing to the public to continue to remain calm and vigilant and be very careful so as to prevent the spread of this disease.""
He added that residents of Bataan should stay inside their houses and practice social distancing at all times.
""What we are trying to do here is to avoid the spread of COVID-19 because our frontliners, healthcare workers, doctors, nurses, and even our hospitals, may be overwhelmed if there is a surge of cases. "" Garcia said.

CAGAYAN DE ORO CITY, Philippines – A village councilor and two barangay health workers died Friday night, March 20, when a 10-wheeler truck rammed into the quarantine checkpoint they were manning in Maramag town in Bukidnon.
The accident happened a few minutes before the start of Bukidnon's province-wide indefinite lockdown to stop the spread of the novel coronavirus.
Lieutenant Colonel Casan Ali, chief of the Maramag Municipal Police Station, identified the fatalities as Barangay Kagawad Aldren Gaitera, and barangay health workers Jomalyn Buhayon and Margie Maribao
Ali said a third barangay health worker, Beth Lumanca, was also injured.
All 4 were residents of North Poblacion, Maramag, Bukidnon. They were all on duty at the community quarantine checkpoint when a truck rammed it.
""They were manning a Community Quarantine Control Point at Sayre Highway, Camp-1, Maramag, Bukidnon,"" Ali said.
The accident was a few kilometers away from the house of Senator Migz Zubiri and his father, Bukidnon Governor Jose Maria Zubiri.

SOCIAL DISTANCING. The center practices social distancing in their operations to feed the homeless of Manila. Photo courtesy of Fr. Flavie Villanueva 
MANILA, Philippines – Since news of the Luzon-wide lockdown broke, Fr. Flavie Villanueva and volunteers at the Arnold Janssen Kalinga (Kain at Ligo nang Ayos, or ""eat and bathe properly"") Center in Manila have been even more dedicated to caring for the homeless in the capital region.
“All we want is to provide the homeless with what they deserve and what others have failed to give,” Fr. Villanueva said in an earlier Facebook post. 
Villanueva is the founder of the center, an institution established in Tayuman, Manila to provide ""dignified care and service"" to the homeless and the marginalized. (READ: Shelters kept unlocked for the homeless during coronavirus outbreak) 
The center has been providing the homeless with food and a place where they can take a bath every Thursday, Saturday, and Sunday.
Following the strict measures of the lockdown, the center has been implementing social distancing in the process of feeding the homeless. They also make sure the homeless wash their hands thoroughly before entering the center. 
According to Fr. Flavie, the center can normally accommodate up to 40 individuals at a time. However, since they practiced social distancing, this number has been limited to 12 at a time. 
Once a homeless person enters their center, they are automatically ushered to the bathroom so they can practice hygiene and take a bath. Before the spread of the coronavirus, the homeless are normally ushered to the kitchen first so they can eat a proper meal.
However, in order to swiftly finish the process, the center just prepares a pack filled with a face mask, vitamin C, rice, two kinds of viand, and an orange. 
Fr. Flavie said in an interview with Rappler that their services have been interrupted at least twice – first on Thursday, March 19 and then again on Saturday, March 21. (READ: Filipinos find ways to improvise safety in the time of coronavirus) 
“We were asked to stop our 'kain-ligo' for our homeless. Barangay Captain Allan Yamson of Brgy. 344 of Manila again intervened [in] what was an orderly 1.5-meter distance and flow,” Fr. Flavie said. 
On Saturday, the center was able to cater to at least 160 homeless individuals before the local barangay officials gathered there and interrupted their service. Around 200 other homeless individuals were waiting in line at that time. 
HOMELESS DURING LOCKDOWN.  Around 200 homeless individuals who lined up to take a bath and get food at the Kalinga Center were not able to enter the center. Photo courtesy of Fr. Flavie Villanueva  
""I am trying to absorb how the coronavirus can be outweighed by a far [more] threatening virus that is indifference, greed. I don't understand how local officials could interpret the law according to their own standards even if the law prescribes that you serve first and formeost the lost, last, and least,"" he added. 
Because of the interruptions, Fr. Flavie decided that he would discontinue his operations at the center. Instead, he would go around and personally deliver food packs to the homeless. 
PNP Chief Archie Gamboa already said during a virtual press conference by the Inter-Agency Task Force on Managing Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-MEID) in Malacañang that the center's members should not have been stopped by authorities. 
“Generally what we should observe is a prohibition on mass gatherings. But if it's feeding program, especially if it’s for the less fortunate, I think what should be observed is social distancing. This should not be prohibited especially if they are feeding the less fortunate of our society,” Gamboa said in mixed Filipino and English.
According to Manila Police District spokesman Lt. Col. Carlo Magno Manuel, there is nothing wrong with conducting such initiatives as long as the the center coordinates with the barangay prior to the event. 
""Okay lang po mga ganoon basta pumunta muna sa office sa barangay para maabisuhan sila. Na-a-alarma ang barangay sa mga ganyan lalo na kung di nila alam. Lalo na at pwede maging carrier ang mga homeless at pakalat-kalat pa sila,"" Manuel said in a phone interview with Rappler. 
(Such initiatives are okay as long as they coordinate with the barangay. The officials get alarmed over events like these if they have no prior knowledge. This is especially because the homeless, who wander around the city, can become carriers of the virus.)

MANILA, Philippines – Over 100 stars from ABS-CBN will be starring in a digital concert – straight from their respective homes – to raise funds for families whose incomes will be affected by the lockdown in the whole of Luzon.
In a statement to the media, ABS-CBN said the Pantawid ng Pag-ibig: At-Home Together Concert will begin on Sunday, March 22, at 7 pm. Different artists will be performing for the fundraising activity, which was staged in partnership with local government units in Metro Manila and private companies.
The aim of the “at-home” concert is to “provide food and basic necessities to Filipinos who are unable to make a living.” Funds will be used to buy food and other basic necessities, primarily for local governments in Metro Manila.
Since March 16, Metro Manila has been on an “enhanced community quarantine” to slow down the spread of the novel coronavirus. On March 17, the national government extended the quarantine to cover the entire Luzon. (Click here for the latest on the coronavirus pandemic in the Philippines.)
The concert will air live on all of ABS-CBN’s platforms: ABS-CBN, ABS-CBN S+A, ABS-CBN News Channel (ANC), MYX, DZMM Teleradyo, as well as AM radio station DZMM Radyo Patrol 630 and FM radio station MOR 101.9, and streaming service iWant. Overseas, viewers can catch it on The Filipino Channel.
It will also be streamed on ABS-CBN’s Youtube channels and Facebook pages.
The Lopez Group, which owns ABS-CBN, earlier donated P100 million to the fund. ABS-CBN said they plan on extending the campaign to areas outside of Metro Manila.
Cash donations can be made through deposits to the ABS-CBN Lingkod Kapamilya Foundation Inc.-Sagip Kapamilya bank accounts :

BPI peso account 3051-11-55-88
Metrobank peso account 636-3-636-08808-1
BDO peso account 0039301-14199
Philippine National Bank peso account 1263-7000-4128
BDO dollar account 1039300-81622

ABS-CBN has since suspended production for both its live shows and TV series in compliance with the quarantine. The media giant had earlier barred the admission of a live audience for its shows in the lead-up to the eventual announcement of a quarantine.
The Luzon quarantine stays in place until April 12, while the one in Metro Manila is in place until April 14. The date, however, is subject to change, depending on the national government's assessment. – Rappler.com "

BACOLOD CITY, Philippines – Some 84 individuals who were stranded in Luzon for days were airlifted  to their home province, Negros Occidental, this week.
The group traveled on a special Cebu Pacific flight from the Clark International Airport in Pampanga, which was initiated by the provincial government here.
Governor Eugenio Jose Lacson wrote a letter to the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines, appealing the return of the Negrenses following the suspension of land, sea and air travels to ease the possible transmission of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). They arrived in the province on March 19.
Negros Occidental has already sealed its borders after thousands from Metro Manila fled to the province last weekend to escape the Luzon-wide lockdown.
Board Member Ryan Gamboa said the 84 individuals were automatically considered as persons under monitoring (PUM) for the infectious disease and would undergo a 14-day mandatory quarantine at the provincial government-run Mambukal Summer Resort in Murcia town.
With this, Mambukal Resort has also halted its operations this week to accommodate the PUMs, whose food and lodging will be provided by the provincial government.
The PUMs are not allowed to go out or accept visitors and will be strictly monitored.
However, hours later, one of the PUMs escaped the quarantine but was quickly arrested by the police in a subdivision in Bacolod City.
He will be charged for violation of the Republic Act 11332 or the Mandatory Reporting of Notifiable Diseases and Health Events of Public Health Concern Act.
Aside from the 84 Negrenses, also joining them in the mercy flight were some 54 passengers from the neighboring provinces. Their return to their home provinces was arranged. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – The Department of Health (DOH) on Saturday, March 21, said that the COVID-19 test kit developed by the scientists from the University of the Philippines (UP) will be available for commercial use after two to 3 weeks of validation. 
“Ang proseso po ng pagpapa-validate ay hindi po mabilis. Ito ay meron silang pinipiling lugar kung saan mag gagawa sila ng field trial,” DOH Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said in a virtual press briefing. (The process of validation would take time. It includes selecting a particular area where they can do the field trial.)
The DOH said that the UP test kit would undergo thorough validation. After the validation process, it needs to get a Certificate of Product Registration (CPR) from the Food and Drug Administration of the Philippines (FDA) before mass use. 
The test kit is capable of fast detection of the coronavirus in samples taken from patients. The results can be ready in two hours. The UP test kit is cheaper than the test kits being used now. (READ: How does the U.P.-developed coronavirus detection kit work?)
According to the DOH, the COVID-19 test at the RITM ranges from P5,000 to P8,000, including the extraction steps that cost around P1,200 to P1,500. The UP test kit costs around P2,700-P3,500, including extraction procedures.
Still no mass testing
Meanwhile, the DOH said the Philippines still would not implement mass testing for coronavirus, even as the country received 100,000 new test kits from China, South Korea, and Brunei. (READ: Netizens urge DOH to conduct mass testing for coronavirus)
The DOH added that the donated test kits “may only be sufficient for our countrymen this time.” (READ: When should you get tested for coronavirus?)
The Philippines' testing capacity is 950 to 1,000 tests per day, with the bulk coming from the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine which can perform an average of 600 tests per day.

ISABELA, Philippines – A 44-year-old resident of Tuguegarao City, who travelled all the way from Manila to his home city, was recorded as the first coronavirus disease patient of Cagayan province and the Cagayan Valley Region as well.
The Department of Health (DOH) - Cagayan Valley said in a press briefing Saturday, March 21, the man designated as PH275 is a resident of Barangay Caritan Norte in Tuguegarao City.
DOH-Region 2 Officer-In-Charge Leticia Cabrera said PH275 was already coughing and had difficulty of breathing when he left Manila. He arrived in Tuguegarao on March 11. 
Cabrera said DOH members of the Regional Epidemiology and Surveillance Unit and personnel of the City Health Office of Tuguegarao were now conducting contact tracing. 
The patient is now confined at the Cagayan Valley Medical Center.
""Since Cagayan Valley Medical Center only has the capability to handle the PUIs in the province, all patients will be transferred there from other hospitals to avoid the spread,"" Dr. Glenn Mathew Baggao, Medical Center Chief, said in Filipino.
Baggao also clarified that the patient was alive, contrary to rumors on social media on Friday, March 20.
Meanwhile, Cabrera urged the public to cooperate with the efforts to locate all persons that need to be traced.
""We assure the public that all measures needed to combat the spread of this virus are being seriously undertaken. Strict infection and prevention protocols are being observed by the Cagayan Valley Medical Center and its personnel while caring for the patients, leaving no room for infection to occur,"" she said.
The province of Cagayan has been placed under lockdown after President Rodrigo Duterte imposed an “enhanced” community quarantine in the entire Luzon Island.

MANILA, Philippines – The Department of Health (DOH) said Saturday, March 21, that the Philippines still would not implement mass testing for the novel coronavirus, even as the country receives 100,000 new test kits donated by China, South Korea, and Brunei.
Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said in a briefing Saturday afternoon that testing will still be limited to severe or vulnerable Persons Under Investigation (PUIs).
""Habang inaayos pa po natin ang ating sistema, ang mga pinaka-vulenrable muna ang ite-test natin, sila po ang ating mga nakakatanda, sila po ang mga may sakit at underlying conditions, at high-risk pregnant women natin,"" Vergeire said.
(While we're still finalizing our system, we will have to test the most vulnerable first for now, they are the elderly, with pre-existing ailments and underlying condiitons, and high-risk pregnant women.)
PUIs with severe symptoms are also considered high priority, according to Vergeire.
950-1,000 tests a day Vergeire said the Philippines' average testing capacity is 950 to 1,000 tests per day, with the bulk coming from the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine, which is averaging 600 tests per day. ""Given that we already have these testing kits that have been donated to us, ito pong dami ng testing kits na ito ay maaaring sufficient na para sa ating mga kababayan sa ating present time,"" said Vergeire.
(Our current supply of testing kits may be sufficient for our countrymen at this time.) As of March 21, the confirmed cases of the coronavirus in the Philippines rose to 307, with a single-day increase of 77. The number of deaths is at 19.
To be re-assessed Vergeire was asked whether the deaths are due to the non-implementation of mass testing.
""Hindi po totoo yun, ang atin pong namamatay pumupunta sa ating mga ospital at mapapansin natin na may common denominator and factors kung ano 'yung nga nasa profile ng namamatay, and these are those with underlying conditions and those na elderly o mas nakakatanda,"" said Vergeire.
(That's not true, the people who died went to the hospital and we can see that they have a common denominator or factor in their profiles, and these are those with underlying conditions or the elderly.) Vergeire said when there are more testing kits, they will reassess whether to increase testing capacity to go beyond severe cases. Vergeire said that the addition of 100,000 kits would mean the next few days will see the ""true"" increase of cases. Vergeire said this will help the DOH spot patterns. ""Sa mga susunod na araw ay makikita na po natin ang totoong pagpasok ng mga bagong kaso. Kung may mga tumataas na araw o bumabababa na araw o kung normal po ang behavior ng pasok ng mga kaso sa bawat araw,"" said Vergeire.
(In the next day we will see the true increase in cases. If there are days with high increase or days with low increase, and the behavior of the increases per day.)
The University of the Philippines or UP-developed testing kits, which are cheaper and can turn in results faster, is still in the process of validation which could take 2-3 more weeks, according to Vergeire.

 ONLINE GIMMICKS. Youth leaders and local government units organize a number of online initiatives aimed at keeping young Filipinos at home  
MANILA, Philippines – Several youth councils and a local government have created ways to encourage the public to stay at home as parts of the country have been placed under lockdown or “enhanced” community quarantine"" in a bid to contain the spread of the coronavirus.
President Rodrigo Duterte, in a recorded message aired last Monday, March 16, placed the entire Luzon island on lockdown until April 12. The measure took effect 12 midnight of Tuesday, March 17, implementing strict quarantine for all households, among other measures.
After the declaration, local officials were quick to respond with creative efforts, compelling the public, especially those who still try to roam outside, to remain at home. (READ: Is the Metro Manila coronavirus lockdown bound to fail?) 
“Marami pa ring kabataan namin ang lumalabas-labas ng bahay kahit delikado. So sabi namin, we have to think of innovative ways to stabilize our youth...Our main objective is to enforce Stay at Home policy. Kahit nasa loob ng bahay sila, they can be productive,” said Joal Cocjin, Sangguniang Kabataan (SK) Chairperson of Barangay Caragñag in San Andres, Catanduanes.
(There are a lot of youths who are still going outside their houses despite the dangers. We told ourselves that we have to think of innovative ways to stabilize our youth. Our main objective is to enforce Stay at Home policy. Even if they are inside their homes, they can be productive.)
In a data released by the Department of Health on Friday, March 20, Catanduanes province has 4,325 persons under monitoring.
The youth council launched on Wednesday, March 18, the “TikTok Challenge Kontra COVID-19,” enabling the public to remain interactive amid the lockdown.
In Quezon town in Quezon province, the SK Federation also used social media to convince individuals to stay at home, especially those who had arrived from Metro Manila.
Jolas Clemente, a member of the federation, said they were asked by their Rural Health Unit to help in implementing the strict quarantine for all households.
The social media challenge asked participants to take videos and photos of themselves inside their houses, thus helping the local government in making sure that the members of the community are not loitering outside.
Quezon province has one confirmed case of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. As of Thursday, March 19, the province also has more than 40 Persons Under Investigation.
Time to bond with family
In Naval, Biliran, Mayor Gerard Espina offered P10,000 pesos for an online gimmick “that will compel them to stay at home and wait for updates.”
“We just don’t want the whole home quarantine experience to be depressing...We want to prove that you can still enjoy and be interactive while staying at home,” he said.
In a Facebook post, Espina informed his constituents that he will give instructions for 7 days, mostly taking videos and photos while doing home activities.
Biliran Governor Rogelio Espina imposed a 15-day limited border closure for people in the province from March 17 to March 31. In Naval, curfew hours have been enforced from 9 pm until 5 am.
According to the town mayor, the challenge does not only ease the government’s task in monitoring people, but also “gives more bonding time with the family.”
Lapses of national government
Despite the fulfillment he feels seeing the community participate, Cocjin also aired his sentiments over the national government's lapses in responding to the pandemic.
“I think our national government is acting too slow and too late to respond to this pandemic. Binuksan natin ang ating payong ngayong basang-basa na tayo…(I think our national government is acting too slow and too late to respond to this pandemic. We opened our umbrellas only when we were already drenched in rain),” he said.
The same sentimenets were aired by Alden Fajilan, the SK Chairperson of Barangay San Roque in Corcuera, Romblon who initiated an online gimmick to call for submissions of literary works and videos about COVID-19.
“Masaya na may halong disappointment...Ang mahirap lang talaga ay kakulangan ng mga kagamitan like thermal scanners (I am happy and disappointed at the same time. It’s hard because there is really a lack of medical equipment such as thermal scanners.),” said Fajilan.
Human rights group Karapatan earlier hit the government for placing almost all of its resources on military actions, instead of medical solutions: “The COVID-19 is a public health issue. Checkpoints should be primarily medical in nature. Why does it seem that personnel manning the checkpoints are fully armed with M-16 rifles instead of functioning thermal guns, personal protective equipment, and disinfection facilities?”
Cocjin said their initiative is their little way to fill the lapses in the national government. Meanwhile, he urged the youth to never lose hope.
“Ngayon ang oras upang kumilos….Malayo pa ang ating tatahakin upang mapagwagian ang problemang ito...Walang susuko (This is a time for action. We have a lot more struggles to face before winning this battle. Do not lose hope.),” he said. – Rappler.com  "

ILOILO CITY, Philippines – Iloilo recorded its first novel coronavirus case on Saturday, March 21.
The province's first confirmed case was announced in a news briefing of Iloilo Governor Arthur Defensor Jr, Iloilo City Mayor Jerry Treñas, and the Department of Health Region VI.
DOH-Western Visayas director Marilyn Convocar said the patient is a 65-year-old man with no travel history to countries and Philippine cities with coronavirus cases. He is the second COVID-19 case in Western Visayas.
The patient, who hails from Guimbal town in southern Iloilo, had cough and a fever on March 6, and was brought to a hospital in Iloilo City on March 13, when his symptoms persisted.
Considering his age, he was immediately tested for COVID-19, but the test results were only released on Saturday,  Convocar said.
Convocar said the man might have contracted the infection from his children who had recently visited Japan, suggesting that some of his family members might be asymptomatic carriers of the new virus.
The DOH official said the patient’s family would also be subjected to testing, and that the DOH-6 had begun contact tracing. 
Meanwhile, Treñas announced that Iloilo City will order 2,500 test kits from an accredited South Korean supplier approved by the Food and Drug Administration, at a cost of P5.5 million. He said this will be paid for by donations from Henry Sy and Chusuey of Hennan Resorts (P3.5 million), Iloilo Supermart and the Que family ( P1 million), and Edgar Injap Sia (P1 million).
""These will be ordered from South Korea and as soon as we have an available and accredited laboratory in Iloilo City, kits will be available for testing,"" the mayor said in a Facebook post.
Treñas earlier ordered a lockdown on Iloilo City on Friday, March 20 through Executive Order (EO) 55-2020. This was prompted by the death of a 57-year-old person under investigation (PUI) in an Iloilo City hospital earlier this week. (READ: Man probed for coronavirus dies while waiting for test results)

ARIZONA, United States – Germany is flying in at least 75 Filipino nurses to help care for its novel coronavirus patients, according to the report of the German Press Agency (DPA).
According to the Hessische Krankenhausgesellschaft, an association of over 150 hospitals in the federal state of Hesse, they are having a ""recruitment flight"" for intensive care personnel.
""We have received a special permit that we can still bring 75 Filipino nurses to Hesse,"" group president Christian Höftberger told the news agency on Friday, March 20.
""We are very confident that they can land in Frankfurt in the next few days,"" he said, referring to Hesse's largest city.
The Philippine government imposed a lockdown in the entire island of Luzon from March 17 until April 12. It has however allowed Filipino workers to leave for their work abroad during this period.
Also on Friday, Manila imposed a travel ban on all foreigners entering the Philippines. It's not clear how this ban will affect Germany's plan, unless they intend to simply dispatch a plane and will not send any of its nationals to fetch the nurses outside the airport. 
Other hires?
The nurses will work at the Asklepios clinics. But Höftberger said “there are other Filipino intensive care nurses on the same plane"" and that two other large clinics hired nurses.
Germany had almost 14,000 cases as of Friday, according to its official heath reporting organization, the Robert Koch Institute (RKI).
The article, also carried by other news organizations, said the hiring was done through the efforts of Foreign Minister Heiko Maas, the crisis team of the Hessian state government, and employment agencies.
It added that “Maas even campaigned for the visas to be sent by messenger from the embassy to the employees, despite the exit restrictions imposed there” [in the Philippines].
The Philippines' Department of Health admitted that the health care system is “challenged” by the growing demand for novel coronavirus testing.
There are shortages in medical personnel and personal protecive equipment, prompting staff to either improvise or ask for donations. (READ: Left in the dark: Little protection for government's coronavirus frontliners)
For decades, Filipino nurses have also opted to work abroad due to low wages and poor working conditions in the country.
As of Saturday afternoon, March 21, the Philippines had 307 coronavirus cases, with 19 deaths.
Experts from the DOH and the World Health Organization (WHO) said that the cases could peak to as many as 75,000 in the next 3 months, or by June, if not properly contained.

The DPWH said in a press statement on Saturday that it has provided power and water supply to 110 of the evacuation centers.
“We are now facilitating power and water connection to an additional 15 evacuation centers,” said Public Works Secretary Mark Villar.
An evacuation center in Butuan City has already been transformed into a health facility specific to COVID-19 patients, with the help of the Butuan City Government and the Butuan City Medical Center.
The evacuation center in Dalaguete, Cebu, was already being used as a health facility for persons under investigation and persons under monitoring. 
Villar said proper distancing of beds in the facilities, as recommended by the Department of Health resident epidemiologist, was being observed.
The Department of Social Welfare and Development is using at least 4 evacuation centers as food hubs. The Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Office is using 9 evacuation centers as emergency operations centers.

MANILA, Philippines – The Philippine National Police (PNP) on Saturday, March 21, said the advisories on window hours for going out did not come from them, but may be being implemented by local government units (LGUs).
The confusion arises from messages being spread about window hours limiting the movement of people going out. In many localities, quarantine passes are being given because people are still allowed by the national government to buy food and other essentials, on top of the mobility for essential workers.
""Maaaring mga local government units ay may pinapatupad na ganitong curfew hours, but in so far as the Joint Task Force Covid Shield at ating PNP is concerned, wala po tayong ipinalabas na ganitong time period,"" PNP Spokesperson Brigadier General Bernard Banac said on Saturday during the government's Laging Handa briefing.
(Maybe it's the LGUs enforcing these kinds of curfew hours, but in so far as the Joint Task Force Covid Shield and the PNP are concerned, we have not come out with this time period.)
Banac reminded that only one member per household may go out to buy essentials, otherwise, he said the curfew is essentially 24 hours as Luzon is under enhanced community quarantine or a total lockdown.
""Pero 'yun pong specific na period na 'yan, maaari pong ang local government units natin ang nagpapatupad so kung saan po kayo naroroon alamin po natin ito sa ating local chief executives sa ating window hours na yan,"" Banac said.

Pagcor suspended on March 18 POGOs in Luzon. It also suspended all other land-based gaming operations in the country including casinos as Luzon is put on lockdown.
POGOs have been sanctioned before for not paying taxes, and for being linked to crimes like bribery, forgery of passorts, money laundering and even kidnapping.
Malacañang has stood by POGOs despite these, saying the income generated from them is needed.
Domingo said casinos Resorts World, Okada Manila and City of Dreams have also donated P50 million each worth of equipment and supplies.
The Pagcor chief noted that Okada donated 3 testing machines and test kits to the Philippine General Hospital (PGH).

Domingo said Pagcor has already donated P2.5 million worth of food packs, which will be distributed to local government units.

Domingo added they will remit P12 billion, or the equivalent of Pagcor's cash dividends for 2019.

Baviera, one of the Philippines’ leading experts on China, died at 3:55 am on Saturday, March 21, due to the novel coronavirus that originated in the Chinese province of Hubei. At the time she died, the Philippines had 230 cases of the coronavirus, including 18 deaths. 
“We have been working so hard the last 6 days to help in this fight against COVID-19. I couldn’t help crying to know that while we were so busy yesterday, putting together 150 boxes of medical supplies, she was fighting for her life,” Ang-See, herself a China expert, said on Saturday.
But what made Baviera’s friends even more emotional was the way she lived – and loved her country.
For 40 years, her eyes as an expert were focused on China. But till she died at the age of 60 due to a pandemic, her heart stayed with the Philippines.
Iskolar ng Bayan
An Iskolar ng Bayan (“Scholar of the Nation,” as students of the University of the Philippines are called) from college to MA to PhD, she is best remembered as an expert who studied China for the sake of the Philippines. 
“If one has to take a side, one must take the side of the Filipino people,” Baviera wrote in a 2019 essay to mark her 40th year as a China expert. 
Born on August 26, 1959, Baviera started studying contemporary China at the age of 20. From 1981 to 1983, she studied in China as an exchange scholar of the Chinese government. She learned the Chinese language, traveled the country extensively, and encountered its people, “from the hot deserts in Xinjiang and Gansu to the grasslands of Inner Mongolia to icy Harbin and Heilongjiang.”
“More than taking me places, these travels took me to the people: fellow travelers on a train asking me if I were an Uyghur because they hadn’t yet seen one, a lily-footed grandma skillfully scaling the steps of a mountain trail while I huffed and puffed my way up, a village circus troupe performing all muddied and ragged in a park, a young Mongolian woman making cheese from horse’s milk,” Baviera wrote.
Baviera studied Mao Zedong at the same time that Ferdinand Marcos was pillaging the Philippines. “It also didn’t take too long before I learned to recognize and shun the shallowness of political propaganda when I saw it, Mao’s as much as Marcos’.”
Baviera added that the Tiananmen Square tragedy of 1989, where hundreds of pro-democracy protesters were massacred by Chinese troops, was a watershed moment in her China-watching.
“The rose-tinted glasses came off; but even the large dose of cynicism that replaced it was soon moderated by grudging respect and admiration for how quickly these people bounced out of political crisis to eventually transform China into an economic juggernaut. There was still much that could be learned from and about China, so I remained an avid watcher,” said Baviera.
Drawing from her experience, Baviera advised young China watchers: “Do not be emotionally invested in the subject of your study; you should try to maintain objectivity at all times, which can be quite difficult given the state of ties today.”
She added: “Recognize that China is complex and has multiple facets; it is not unidimensional and not always clear as day. Chinese society is old and it is new. There is the State, and there is the 1.4 billion thinking, breathing, living people. Simplistic thinking will not do. In the end, Deng Xiaoping’s cat was neither black nor white; it is grey.”
Baviera’s accomplishments include leading the University of the Philippines (UP) Asian Studies Center as its dean from 2003 to 2009, and heading the Asia-Pacific Pathways to Progress Foundation, which aims to promote peace and understanding among Filipinos and other peoples of the Asia-Pacific. 
Remembered for objectivity
Chito Santa Romana, the Philippines’ ambassador to China, remembers Baviera for her objectivity in analyzing Beijing.
Santa Romana had known Baviera since the early 1980s, when she was studying at Peking University. The ambassador himself is a veteran China watcher, an Emmy award-winning journalist and former Beijing bureau chief of ABC News, who worked as producer and reporter in China for two decades.
“Dr Aileen Baviera was a close friend and colleague. I will miss her scholarly wisdom and collegial advice. We had intensive discussions about China and Philippines-China relations, and we exchanged many observations and ideas,” Santa Romana said.
“Her insightful writings and talks constitute a lasting legacy of her influential ideas and policy advice. She will be remembered for her scholarship and objective analysis,” said Santa Romana.
The ambassador added that Baviera was “a passionate advocate of scholarly dialogues and engagement as part of people-to-people exchanges and ‘track two’ or nongovernmental diplomacy.”
In fact, in 2013, after the Scarborough Shoal standoff that brought Philippines-China relations to new lows, Baviera invited Santa Romana to join her academic delegation that flew to China. There, he said, they engaged in “frank but friendly discussions” with Chinese researchers on the way forward.
Pillar of China studies
Like Santa Romana, former CNN Beijing bureau chief and veteran China watcher Jaime FlorCruz also remembers Baviera as a fellow student in Beijing in the early 1980s. 
“She was gregarious, and made a lot of friends among Chinese and overseas students. She adapted well to the relatively Spartan life of students like us,” FlorCruz told Rappler.
FlorCruz said Baviera was curious and diligent, conducting interviews and traveling as much as she could. “As a scholar, she was rigorous and yet humble in her research. She acknowledged what she did not know or understood – and single-mindedly looked for answers,” he said.
FlorCruz also said Baviera “was always ready to help or share her insights and research materials,” and that “she spoke softly and calmly but she was firm and thoughtful on controversial issues.”
“We lost a pillar of China studies in the Philippines,” FlorCruz said.
Jay Batongbacal, one of the Philippines’ leading experts on the South China Sea, also deeply admires Baviera, with whom he worked on maritime and foreign policy issues for more than two decades. 
Batongbacal said it was Baviera who recruited him back into UP as he was finishing his doctorate. He was with the UP Asian Center for a number of years while Baviera was dean, before he transferred to law.
Batongbacal is now director of the UP Institute for Maritime Affairs and the Law of the Sea.
“She was probably the only who could truly understand China in this changing world, unlike the old guard who romanticized China, or the new scholars who either idolized or feared it. She was able to see and point to the truth that was often in between,” Batongbacal said. “She was the quintessential scholar, mentor, and friend.” – Rappler.com "

Filipinos on Twitter demanded that the Department of Health (DOH) conduct mass testing for the novel coronavirus, as ""MASS TESTING NOW"" trended on the social media platform on Saturday, March 21.
 
This comes after DOH stated there was “no need” to conduct mass testing for COVID-19 in the country, despite a steady rise in cases.
In a press conference on Friday, March 20, DOH Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire was asked if the Philippines was capable of ""aggressive testing."" (READ: WHO says 'aggressive' action needed in Southeast Asia to stop virus)
Vergeire said the national government would look into conducting mass testing if the situation calls for it, and if the government has enough resources.
""Kung sakaling dumating ‘yong panahon na we have enough resources, the government can do it, and if it is imperative for government to do it, gagawin po natin ‘yan kung saka-sakali,” she stated. 
(In case we reach that point where we have enough resources, the government can do it, and if it is imperative for the government to do it, we will do this if needed.)
This angered many Filipinos online, who demanded mass testing was necessary in order to prevent the further spread of the virus.
As of Saturday, March 21, there are 262 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the country. A total of 19 patients died from the disease, and a total of 13 patients have recovered.

SARA DUTERTE. File photo by Pia Ranada/Rappler 
DAVAO CITY, Philippines – Mayor Sara Duterte said the distribution of relief goods to the sectors most affected by the national situation caused by the coronavirus in the Davao Region will start on Monday, March 23.
She said Davao city's social welfare office is currently drawing up a master list of the most affected sectors, such as the indigents and those who lost work due to the public health emergency.
The Davao Region, made up of the provinces of Davao del Sur, Davao Occidental, Davao del Norte, Davao Oriental and Davao de Oro, has around 4.9 million people and 13.7% of that are considered poor or indigent, according to the Philippine Statistic Authority's 2018 poverty estimates.
“The mayors and governors of the Davao region have agreed to start relief assistance next week,” she said.
“All municipalities and cities will have their own distribution activities to the affected sectors,” she said over the city-run Davao City Disaster Radio (DCDR).
This is why those from nearby areas, such as Panabo in Davao del Norte and Sta. Cruz in Davao del Sur, need not come to Davao City anymore to have food during the crisis.
In the case of the city, Sara said the city government will be distributing relief packs that will be good for at least a week for each qualified recipients.
“Starting March 23, we will distribute,” she said.
Qualified residents, Sara said, could simply go to their barangay halls to get their ration cards.
On Friday, the city government started distributing masks to city residents in various areas.
Aside from the masks, fliers were also handed out, reminding people to stay home, observe social distancing, and to frequently wash their hands with soap and water.
Sara, meanwhile, clarified that despite the lockdown, people transiting through Region 11 for other areas will be allowed provided that they would not stay in any of region's populated areas. 
“That's a win-win situation. They can pass through but not stay,” Sara said, adding that they will be escorted out to ensure that they will not violate the rule.
As to the operation of the airport, she said that her order stays.
Only international and domestic flights for cargo, medical evacuations, weather mitigation flights, maintenance flights, government and military flights, emergency landings and recovery flights for expatriates are currently allowed.
“There is a need to exempt certain international and domestic air travel from the coverage” of the earlier ban,” she earlier said in her order No. 18. – Rappler.com "

DAVAO CITY, Philippines – North Cotabato residents who fled their villages due to a series of strong earthquakes which started in October 2019 have been ordered to return to their homes to prevent the coronavirus disease from spreading.
North Cotabato Gov. Nancy Catamco signed Executive Order No. 23 on Wednesday, March 18, which aims to decongest various evacuation centers in the province of occupants.
Catamco said “thousands” of people remained in evacuation centers for more than 4 months since the earthquakes struck and the concept of social distancing was impossible to observe.
She also pointed out cleanliness in evacuation centers was hardly being observed, which makes those staying there vulnerable to illnesses, including COVID-19.
North Cotabato hosts major evacuation centers in the towns of Makilala, Tulunan and Mlang and Kidapawan City, and satellite camps in adjoining areas. (READ: North Cotabato implements 'pre-emptive' lockdown)
Exemptions
Catamco clarified that evacuees who do not have homes to return to are exempted from the order. 
“Those living in evacuation areas can return to their original homes if the earthquake had not damaged these and that the same had been declared safe for occupancy. If evacuees cannot return to their original homes, they will remain in evacuation centers but they must follow things that will help prevent COVID-19 such as proper hand wash and cleaning of the environment,” she added.
Catamco said the provincial disaster prevention office and the provincial social welfare office had already been directed to assist residents in returning to their villages.
In the Davao Region, Davao City Mayor Sara Duterte issued more directives to stem the spread of the virus.
Sara, who chairs both the regional development council and the peace and order council, had banned the serving of liquor starting at 5 p.m.
She also ordered malls to shut down their shops except those pertaining to food and medicines, banking and finance, and call centers.
Sara also partially lifted a ban on flights in and out of the Davao International Airport for cargo, medical evacuation, and other necessities but maintained the ban on passenger flights, except for incoming flights aimed at repatriating expatriates.
She also signed an order for a regionwide curfew starting from 9 pm to 5 am.
Exempted are those working in public markets and supermarkets, convenience stores, hospitals, drugstores and delivery of food and other essential items.
“Media personnel; persons transiting to and from work, provided they shall present necessary identification and certificate of employment, are also exempted,” she added.
In Davao del Sur, Governor Douglas Cagas had ordered a ""No Face Mask, No Entry"" policy inside the Davao del Sur provincial capitol compound in Barangay Matti in Digos City.

MANILA, Philippines – In an effort to ensure public health and safety in Leyte, local health and science officials pushed for a coronavirus testing center in the province. 
A letter was submitted to the Department of Health (DOH) proposing the establishment of a testing center in Tacloban City, through an initiative by Philippine Medical Association of Medical Technologists (PAMET) officer Carlo Chris Apurillo and St Scholastica's College Tacloban Department of Medical Laboratory Science chairperson Clive Ivan Mercado.
""We don't want that our frontliners will be fighting the virus blindfolded because once they become asymptomatic carriers, they will be pulled out of their post and no one will man our hospitals and laboratories in April or May when this pandemic peaks,"" Mercado said in an interview with Rappler.
Mercado, who is also a PAMET member, said that setting up a testing hub in the province could address the concern on the turnaround time of results. (READ: Without test kits, provinces, cities fighting blindly against coronavirus) 
“The concern really is the turnaround time of samples. It takes too long before we know the results and then we are not comfortable that we don’t have any COVID-19 cases granting that there was a massive exodus from Manila. So, we were discussing the possibility for a long term solution which is a regional testing lab,” Mercado stressed.
Proposal to be finalized
Following the proposal, a meeting presided by the Department of Health (DOH) regional director Minerva Molon and Tingog party-list president Glenn Capucion was held on Friday, March 20. 
Representatives from PAMET-Leyte and Biliran Chapter, city government of Tacloban, various hospitals in Leyte namely Eastern Visayas Regional Medical Center (EVRMC), Divine Word Hospital, Remedios Trinidad Romualdez Hospital were also present in the local discussion. 
""We had inventory of our assets, that includes manpower, laboratory, and other needed supplies. Budget requirement was estimated, where to source. A technical working group was made to come up with a proposal to be submitted to the Department of Health Central Office,"" Molon told Rappler. 
Molon emphasized that the process would then require approval from the DOH Central Office and the assessment and validation from the experts in Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM). 
Tingog party-list second nominee Philip Jude Acidre said this has been made possible with the partnerships from both the private sectors and the local agencies. 
“In the last few days, we’ve been working hard to make that meeting happen. We understand that given our present system, Eastern Visayas is not among the priority areas for establishing COVID-19 testing center,” Acidre said. 
Initially, the patients' samples from the region will be sent to Vicente Sotto Memorial in Cebu for testing. But now that the region is looking into the establishment of a testing center, Acidre said it would be a big help in safeguarding the health of the public in Eastern Visayas. 
“During the meeting, they made a commitment to make it happen. There’s a go signal. DOH is onboard,” he added. ""PAMET will deliver the volunteer service. On behalf of Tingog, Congresswoman Yedda Romualdez and Congressman Martin Romauldez will procure the testing machine. It’s really good we’re almost able to complete the requirements needed.""
This testing center according to Acidre will be situated at EVRMC Magsaysay in Tacloban City. 
An important requirement needed in establishing a regional testing lab is the purchase of a P2.7 million worth of real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) machine for COVID-19, compatible with the coronavirus detection kits developed by the scientists at the National Institutes of Health of the University of the Philippines (UP) Manila. 
According to DOH, the current gold standard for diagnosing COVID-19 is through laboratory-based PCR testing done at the RITM. 
Five subnational laboratories for PCR testing namely San Lazaro Hospital and Lung Center of the Philippines in Manila, Baguio General Hospital and Medical Center in Northern Luzon, Vicente Sotto Memorial Medical Center in the Visayas region, and Southern Philippines Medical Center in Mindanao are also being capacitated to expand diagnostic testing.  
An alliance of concerned scientists, organizations, and other citizens also urged the government to expand testing efforts at the regional and local levels.

""Sa kabila po ng pagod, gutom, puyat para lang maipatupad ang batas para maging maayos at ligtas ang lahat ay makakarinig pa ng mga ganyang salita sa mga taong walang simpatya!

According to a news report, the incident is being investigated by the Department of Interior and Local Government and the Philippine National Police. 
The photo drew flak from netizens with comments criticizing the barangay for how they treated its residents.

(To those who said that that move was right, may it not happen to your children. You were once a minor and hard-headed but to arrest them like animals, that's too much. There is a right process.)

The Philippine government placed Luzon under lockdown starting Tuesday, March 17, as a response to the increasing number of coronavirus cases in the country.
In a bid to contain the spread of the virus, the measure implemented strict quarantine procedures, suspension of transportation services, and regulation of food and essential health services, among others. Additional travel restrictions were rolled out while local governments across the capital region moved to implement an 8 pm to 5 am curfew in their respective areas.
The measure however lacked details on how the most vulnerable sectors – including the homeless – will be taken care of. 
This has only put the homeless in a tighter situation than they had already been in prior to the virus outbreak. (READ: Confusion in Manila keeps over 20 curfew violators in jail for 2 days) 
Despite the enforced quarantine, fortunately, some establishments have decided to keep their doors open for homeless people who need their assistance more than ever. 
St Arnold Janssen Kalinga Center
In a Facebook post, Fr Flavie Villanueva of St Arnold Janssen Kalinga Center said that keeping the center open during these trying times is just the right thing to do as the homeless need to be kept clean, strong, healthy, and informed about the threats the coronavirus brings.
Last week, the center was able to serve 226 homeless people, and wish to be able to reach out to even more.
In a beautiful turn of events, eight homeless young men decided to volunteer and dedicate themselves as Beneficiary Volunteers (B-Volts).
Villanueva expressed his gratitude in his post, saying, “In the midst of panic, they came to help. In the midst of hoarding for one’s survival, they gave themselves at the service of their fellow homeless.”
He has also guaranteed that the center shall continue to strictly employ safety guidelines such as social distancing and hygiene maintenance as they extend help to their benefactors.
However, while the Kalinga Center opened its doors to serve early Thursday morning, the local barangay officials where the center is located attempted to shut the relief activities down, stressing that Villanueva was not following lockdown protocol and that his project’s intentions were not genuine.

As a result, volunteers and beneficiaries were dispersed by the barangay captain despite the center observing proper social distancing of at least 1.5 m between people in the queue.
In an interview, Villanueva said, “I don’t know what is more painful, to see someone denied of food or to see someone in authority tell a homeless person to get out.”
At the moment, the center is still calling for donations of face masks, sources of vitamin C, food, and water to give to the homeless. St Arnold Janssen Kalinga Center located in Santa Cruz, Manila will continue providing care to the homeless every Thursday, Saturday, and Sunday.
Hey Homies
Hey Homies is currently offering its available Airbnb and condominium units for street dwellers along the España-Morayta area.
The company’s chief operating officer (COO) is currently offering a monthlong staycation with free food and utilities to the homeless people who need it the most in the midst of the pandemic.
However, most of these people declined his offer, as they were not aware of the ongoing outbreak at all.

Hey Homies is urging people who might pass by along Loyola St, España Blvd, and Nicanor Reyes St to bring food to help sustain the street dwellers of Morayta and to get in touch with their COO.
#PusoKitchen
Barangay Captain TJ Malvar, MD is looking to start a soup kitchen in Calawis, Antipolo City.
Many residents of their barangay have been forced to come home as a result of the temporary work suspension implemented as part of the lockdown. Malvar expressed his worry about this, especially since most of these people are contractual or informal laborers who are also breadwinners of their families.
This also means that within a week or two, people especially the vulnerable will start going hungry.
In preparation for this, project #PusoKitchen seeks to prepare at least 300 meals a day for those in need, particularly senior citizens, malnourished children, as well as pregnant and lactating mothers.
Malvar added that their barangay is also accepting donations of rice, instant coffee, and soap.
Popburri
A store that sells popsicles and burritos in Barangay East Kamias, Quezon City has decided to transform its place into a shelter for the homeless and those affected by the lockdown. 
Popburri will be open daily from 6 pm to 6 am until April 12 to serve dinner and handle medical needs with the support of the East Kamias Barangay teams.
“You are welcome to serve and bring food for our community during this time, or bring an old mattress, pillow, or bedsheet which we really need. We may be small, but we serve a big God, let’s be instruments for Him together!” Popburri said in a Facebook post. – Rappler.com

ILOILO CITY – Mayor Jerry Treñas ordered a lockdown on Iloilo City on Friday, March 20 through Executive Order (EO) 55-2020. The mayor referred to the enhanced community quarantine as a “lockdown.""
“These are extraordinary times; we are at war with something we cannot see. We have to meet this challenge with extraordinary measures as well,” Treñas told members of the media during a press conference on Thursday morning ahead of the signing of the EO.
The city executive’s pivotal decision is directly caused by the sudden death of a 57-year-old person under investigation (PUI) at an Iloilo City hospital earlier this week, confined after exhibiting influenza-like syptoms. The patient died without having a confirmed test result for COVID-19, as the delivery of specimens to testing centers in Manila have largely been delayed by air traffic gridlock due to the National Capital Region’s own lockdown. (READ: Man waiting for coronavirus test results dies in Iloilo City)
The Western Visayas' Department of Health said there have been no confirmed case in Iloilo City.While the Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF) on coronavirus recommended a community quarantine only if two or more confirmed cases are present in a city or barangay, Treñas said he is using the quarantine as a preventive measure.
“While DOH will claim there are still no cases in Western Visayas, of course there will be no confirmed cases in our region yet because we don’t have the proper testing kits,” Treñas spoke candidly in Hiligaynon during the press conference on Thursday.According to DOH-6, as of March 19, they say there are 18 PUIs in Iloilo City and 30 PUIs in the province. 
Local testing
Treñas is pushing for local testing in Iloilo City.Currently, only the Vicente Sotto Medical Center in Cebu City is accredited to run tests for COVID-19 in the Visayas region.
“We are moving heaven and earth to establish our own testing centers here in Iloilo for the welfare of our citizens,” the city executive said during Thursday’s presscon. “We are eyeing Western Visayas Medical Center in Mandurriao district, with plans also to utilize the laboratories of the University of the Philippines Visayas and the University of San Agustin in Iloilo in the near future.”The city received about 100 testing kits, already, but they are still working to get the kits approved and training the medical technologists to handle running the tests. 
According to the DOH's triage system, those with underlying health conditions, and those whose ailments have progressed to severe or critical symptoms – will have to be prioritized first for testing.Treñas said in a Facebook post that DOH Secretary Fransicso III said an accredited medical technologist from Metro Manila would be coming to help start local testing.Meanwhile, Treñas identified Iloilo Central School and Mabini Elementary School as quarantine areas. 
“This is a fast-evolving public health concern, so we require fast and decisive solutions,” Treñas explained. “[The city hall] is taking this day to day, because our challenges change day by day. We are hoping for all the Ilonggo’s cooperation and understanding as we continuously evolve and change how we handle the containment of COVID-19.”
The quarantine includes provisions that mandate the closure of all major non-essential business establishments and spaces like malls and public parks, as well as strengthen the social distancing measures being adopted by the city.
Necessary establishments like supermarkets, restaurants, banks, pharmacies, hardware stores, gasoline stations, and other essential service providers, however, will remain open. Treñas said that in this time of crisis, the priority is to ensure that Ilonggos' access to their necessities is not cut off entirely.
Treñas previously met with market and grocery store owners to ensure that food supplies will remain sufficient.
A liquor ban is in effect until April 14. A curfew is in place from 8 pm to 5 am. Only essential travel for medical or humanitarian reasons, will be allowed during these hours.
“We have to implant in our citizen’s minds that they shouldn’t leave their homes willy-nilly, this is for their own safety,” Treñas said in Hiligaynon.
On Friday, the mayor also suspended jeepney operations after observing most of the riding public would not follow social distancing, or keep at least one meter apart, to prevent potential contact with the virus.Iloilo City Hall is coordinating with the Philippine National Police, the Armed Forces of the Philippines, the Bureau of Fire Protection, the Philippine Coast Guard, and the Public Safety and Transportation Management Office (PSTMO) to implement the enhanced community quarantine.
On Thursday, Treñas presided over a session of the City Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council to ask for a P98-million supplemental budget to spend on combating COVID-19. The funds will be utilized for laboratory materials and testing kits, food and medicine supplies, as well as livelihood support for underprivileged Ilonggos.
“This is for the good of our city and the welfare of its people. Let us cooperate and be one as we fight COVID-19. I know together we can win against this virus. Keep safe my beloved Ilonggos,” Treñas concluded in a statement. – Rappler.com

PALAWAN, Philippines (UPDATED) – Palawan recorded its first confirmed coronavirus case, Puerto Princesa City Mayor Lucilo Bayron confirmed on Saturday, March 21.
The patient is a 26-year-old male Australian tourist who flew out of the city on March 17 through a “mercy flight” to Clark via Airswift, Bayron said in a press conference on Saturday at Puerto Princesa City Hall. 
Bayron said the case was only confirmed to him Friday night by Dr. Mario Baquilod, chief of the regional health department. Currently, Palawan has 49 reported persons under investigation (PUIs) as of March 21, according to the Provincial Information Office
A statement from a regional Department of Health news release added the patient had history from Kuala Lumpur before flying to Manila. 
The mayor said the tourist arrived in Manila on March 5. He then hopped on an undisclosed commercial plane to Puerto Princesa City on March 7. 
The patient then travelled in the tourist town of San Vicente and stayed in a resort for 5 days. He sought a medical consultation upon experiencing symptoms of COVID-19, such as fever, vomiting and diarrhea.
On the same day, he was fetched by the government’s Rescue 165 ambulance and brought to the Palawan Provincial Hospital where his nasal swab samples were collected for testing on March 14.
On March 15, the Provincial Hospital released the foreign national and recommended him to self-isolate. He then stayed for two days at an undisclosed hotel before availing of the said “mercy flight” after securing a health clearance from the City Health Office as his fever subsided.
The Regional Epidemiology Surveillance Unit began contact tracing activities for the case. Local health authorities and municipal government officials are working closely with the concerned hotels and other facilities where the patient stayed.  (READ: Luzon lockdown: What are the do's and don'ts?)
Baquilod also appealed to all individuals who will be contacted by the surveillance team to fully cooperate in the investigation and contact-tracing activities. 
Individuals with a history of known exposure to the confirmed case are urged to get in touch with the Provincial Department of Health or the city health office for appropriate assessment for home quarantine, management and referral.  
As of 3 pm on March 20, the regional DOH CHD reported a total of 39 PUIs in Palawan, and 11 of these tested negative for the coronavirus. Among the reported persons under investigation,18 were admitted in health facilities, while 21 are under home quarantine while awaiting test results from the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine. 
“While we are still waiting for the other test results, we assure the public that our referral hospitals are well-equipped and prepared to handle COVID-19 cases once it arises in our provinces. Our health response team is taking extra precautions to prevent further transmission,” Baquilod said.
The city mayor meanwhile urged residents to stay calm and cooperate with authorities by observing the preventive measures, such as the home quarantine, social distancing, and proper hygiene, among others.
Bayron also approved the release of P1,500 for each household in the city to help them tide over during the enhanced community quarantine. The cash assistance will prioritize, especially the daily wage earners.
The top city official was earlier slammed by netizens for a remark urging residents to pawn their fishing boats for their subsistence during the month-long Luzon lockdown. He then apologized after garnering flak on social media. – Rappler.com "

Pasig Mayor Vico Sotto is undeterred by the national government’s rejection of his appeal to let tricycles have a limited run on his city’s streets during the coronavirus lockdown of Luzon.
Although Malacañang denies it, Sotto’s stand on the tricycles certainly is one of the reasons, if not the, reason that President Rodrigo Duterte put out a video past 1 am on Friday, March 20, scolding local governments for having their own ways of implementing the lockdown.
Stick to the national government’s idea of the lockdown, or else face administrative and even criminal cases, the President warned local executives.
Never mind that Duterte himself, a few nights earlier, charged local governments with making the lockdown work in their constituencies.
Sotto had inadvertently put himself on a collision course with Duterte by taking the liberty of making an executive decision and standing up for it when it was challenged, citing risk assessment and common sense.
Tricycles, limited
On the first two days of the lockdown, he let tricycles in Pasig make limited trips to service health workers, essential business staff, and the infirm who did not have their own cars.
These were people exempted from the lockdown anyway, and if only one passenger sat in the tricycle’s side car and another one behind the driver (usually two passengers sit behind the driver), social distancing could still be practiced, Sotto pointed out.
Or else, people will die, he said. Based on a proper risk analysis, poor patients needing dialysis or post surgery care would have to walk as far as 5 kilometers to the nearest public hospital (there are only 3 in Pasig) if they couldn’t find a ride.
With the metropolis on lockdown, all public transport is grounded, and those without cars have no choice but to walk – even the elderly.
Even with all the city’s buses and vans out servicing exempted workers heading to their workplaces, it wasn’t enough, and the mayor saw a solution hiding in plain sight: tricycles, on a limited basis.
‘No’
So he raised his hand and asked national authorities if that could be allowed. He got a “no” from Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles on Wednesday evening, March 18, and an even more resounding turndown from the President the following night – a message to local executives not to improvise or challenge what the boss has ordered.
How is the first time mayor taking this?
“I will always just do what I believe is right, informed by the collective wisdom of our team,” Sotto told Rappler when asked whether the incident would affect the way he leads Pasig.
He never intended to defy the higher-ups, he said. When Malacañang rejected his idea, he promptly said his city would comply, and his team would just look for other ways to solve the problem.
“We have actually been compliant with national directives. Now is not the time for making issues or arguing, but let's just do what we can to save lives,” Sotto added.
#ProtectVico
After that rebuff from the Palace and the ensuing maelstrom of social media trolling, the hashtag “Protect Vico” trended on Twitter, fueled by Filipinos – from Pasig and beyond – who recognized his ingenuity in responding to the pandemic.
To wit, the Pasig government under Sotto has:
Before the lockdown

Set up and trained response teams to handle COVID-19 cases
Disinfected all public schools, the city hall, the public market, much-frequented places, and even the streets and sidewalks
Met with a major private hospital’s executives to make sure they were not turning down suspected COVID-19 patients
Enlisted medical professionals to brief local health workers about the pandemic
Distributed 500 disinfecting kits to the city’s 30 barangays, with more than 1,000 sets of equipment all in all
Regularly went live on social media to inform his constituents about the situation and what precautions to take

During the lockdown

Inspected checkpoints
Enforced a nightly 8 pm to 5 am curfew starting March 15
Ensured full salaries for all city government employees
Worked out schedules to sustain frontline government services with a skeleton staff
Ordered penalties on hoarders of food and essential supplies
Deployed the city’s fleet of buses to service essential workers
Allowed limited tricycle trips for people with legitimate reasons to commute
Set up sanitation tents at the city hall, Pasig City General Hospital (PCGH), and Pasig City Children’s Hospital (Child’s Hope)
Continued disinfecting public places
Procured and used drones to spray disinfectants
Lent “Pasig Bike Share” bicycle units to health workers and other frontline personnel
Started a “food truck” effort to provide 2,000 packed meals for health workers, security officers, and other frontline personnel
Started procuring supplies for 400,000 food packs to be distributed to Pasig residents, similar to the Pamaskong Handog last Christmas
Started sourcing vitamins to be distributed to residents; 5,000 bottles already in the inventory with more expected to come in
Arranged for the use of motels as quarantine facilities for persons under monitoring or investigation for COVID-19
Set up a meeting with teams from The Medical City, PCGH, Child’s Hope, and the City Health Office, to coordinate efforts and share procedures in responding to the pandemic

Future President?
At these, many people on social media commented, “sana all,” wishing all politicians were as prolific and responsive to the situation.
Some teased Sotto about his future prospects in politics. How would he like to be president someday?
As in the early days of his term, he deflected such suggestions. He tweeted:
“Bagama’t na-a-appreciate ko ang magagandang komento 'nyo sa akin, 1 – I’m only 30, with no interest in your national politics; 2 – Kasama sa trabaho ko ang pag-report ng ginagawa ng (local government unit), but our social media team is composed of only two people, and we really can’t control what goes on here.”
(Although I appreciate your positive comments about me, 1 – I’m only 30, with no interest in your national politics; 2 – My work includes reporting what the local government unit is doing, but our social media team is composed of only two people, and we really can’t control what goes on here.)
It’s as though he was apologizing for calling attention to himself.
Camera-shy
On Wednesday, as he was inspecting food preparations for health workers at Pasig Rainforest Park near the PCGH, reporters trailed him to get an interview on the city's response to the pandemic and his appeal about the tricycles.
He noticed the head of his two-man social media team, Ron Angeles, was also holding up a camera at him.
“Naka-live ka ba? Mamaya ka na mag-live! Camera-shy tayo eh,” Sotto told Angeles, half-joking. (Are you live? Do it later! I’m camera-shy.)
But at the rate he is going, Sotto cannot dodge the cameras anymore. As some netizens put it, he is getting attention for being a good leader, which they rarely find in this government. Of course people want to see and hear more from him. (READ: Kasalanan natin kung bakit kinukuyog si Mayor Vico Sotto)
But what makes a good leader?
Sotto granted the reporters an interview, in which he appealed to national leaders, explaining why he had to let the tricycles stay on the road. Videos of that interview went viral and resonated with people, but Malacañang would have none of it.
And so the tricycle drivers who took his word were flagged down by police and issued violation tickets. No worries, Sotto said. He would pay for each P500 ticket himself.
He took the fall, and the heat from the higher powers, for a decision he had made. As he said, a pandemic is not the time to argue or make issues. Lives are at stake, so to put the matter to rest, he did not push his way.
He can take “no” for an answer. He knows how to be a good follower. – Rappler.com "

Five PUIs are in isolation facilities of several Department of Health-designated hospitals, according to the advisory of the  Porac Task Force COVID-19 headed by Mayor Jaime Capil on Thursday, March 19.
One PUI is undergoing self-quarantine “due to mild symptoms,” the task force said.

Neil San Andres, spokesperson of the municipal COVID-19 task force said that there were 315 PUMs, and ""of the 315 PUIs 6 became PUIs, while 36 did not finish the self-quarantine period and left for abroad,""
The PUMs include some family members, relatives, and friends of the 33-year-old Grab driver who was found positive of COVID-19.
Pampanga Governor Dennis Pineda earlier said that the patient, who is being treated in a hospital in Metro Manila, did not travel abroad and had history of tuberculosis and hypertension.

BAGUIO CITY, Philippines – Mayor Benjamin Magalong asked his frontliners here to conduct contact tracing even before the patient is confirmed to have contracted the coronavirus disease or COVID-19.
He said that at Baguio hospitals, there are 3 to 4 patients whom he called “red flags” or those who manifest the classic symptoms of COVID-19. One even died Thursday night, March 19, of severe pneumonia.
“The first thing I told them (frontliners) for highly-suspicious or very probable COVID cases, those red flags, you should do contact tracing,” he said.
Magalong said that they already conducted Thursday a crash course on cognitive interviewing to better parse more information for contact tracing.
“For our frontliners, they are medical people. If they interview as usual, they only get 25% of where the patient went or who they interacted with. The cognitive interview will get the other 75%,” he said.
Magalong said that if the medical personnel are busy doing other things, it would be best to hand the phone to them and let those who are knowledgeable of cognitive interviewing to do the contact tracing.
He said that waiting for the confirmation results would be too late, especially for those outside Manila.
He said that for confirmation, you need 3 tests which would take 8 days.
“We could not afford to wait,” he said.
He said that for the 4 red flags in the city, he has already talked to the barangay officials where they reside and asked them to interview who the patients interacted with.
He said that Baguio, which has the Baguio General Hospital that is one of the 5 provincial sentinel hospitals trained by the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) to do confirmatory testing of COVID-19, was initially given only 100 test kits.
Magalong said that SM Foundation promised 1,000 more test kits.

MANILA, Philippines – The Kalibo police pressed charges against nine people for violating the curfew in public areas imposed by the city government to mitigate the spread of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), the city police chief said.
The arrests took place hours after the curfew took effect on Wednesday, March 18.
The curfew from 9 p.m. to 5 a.m. aims to restrict the movement of people in communities and lessen the chances of spreading the coronavirus. Experts have urged people to stay at home and practice social distancing as the virus spreads easily in crowded places.  
“They should stay at home for their safety and only go out if necessary for emergencies or health-related reasons. The violators would be pursued aggressively in the coming days,”  Kalibo police chief Major Belshazzar Villanoche said.
Villanoche said that the curfew hours will be implemented until lifted by the provincial government. Several cities and towns across the country have imposed curfews, as well. (READ: Cops arrest homeless Lola who shouted at tanods warning about curfew)
Police officers have started their 12-hour shifts to ensure residents and establishments are complying with Executive Order No. 31 issued by Mayor Emerson Lachica.
The curfew forced local businesses such as fast food chains, restaurants, malls, stores and bars to close before 9 p.m. Some commercial establishments also adopted a four-day workweek for their workers while others temporarily suspended their operations.

SENTINEL. File photo of the Baguio General Hospital. 
BAGUIO CITY, Philippines – Mayor Benjamin Magalong asked his frontliners here to conduct contact tracing even before the patient is confirmed to have contracted the coronavirus disease or COVID-19.
He said that at Baguio hospitals, there are 3 to 4 patients whom he called “red flags” or those who manifest the classic symptoms of COVID-19. One even died Thursday night, March 19, of severe pneumonia.
“The first thing I told them (frontliners) for highly-suspicious or very probable COVID cases, those red flags, you should do contact tracing,” he said.
Magalong said that they already conducted Thursday a crash course on cognitive interviewing to better parse more information for contact tracing.
“For our frontliners, they are medical people. If they interview as usual, they only get 25% of where the patient went or who they interacted with. The cognitive interview will get the other 75%,” he said.
Magalong said that if the medical personnel are busy doing other things, it would be best to hand the phone to them and let those who are knowledgeable of cognitive interviewing to do the contact tracing.
He said that waiting for the confirmation results would be too late, especially for those outside Manila.
He said that for confirmation, you need 3 tests which would take 8 days.
“We could not afford to wait,” he said.
He said that for the 4 red flags in the city, he has already talked to the barangay officials where they reside and asked them to interview who the patients interacted with.
He said that Baguio, which has the Baguio General Hospital that is one of the 5 provincial sentinel hospitals trained by the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) to do confirmatory testing of COVID-19, was initially given only 100 test kits.
Magalong said that SM Foundation promised 1,000 more test kits.
“If possible, we are going to buy our own kits,” he said. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – The Kalibo police pressed charges against nine people for violating the curfew in public areas imposed by the city government to mitigate the spread of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), the city police chief said.
The arrests took place hours after the curfew took effect on Wednesday, March 18.
The curfew from 9 p.m. to 5 a.m. aims to restrict the movement of people in communities and lessen the chances of spreading the coronavirus. Experts have urged people to stay at home and practice social distancing as the virus spreads easily in crowded places.  
“They should stay at home for their safety and only go out if necessary for emergencies or health-related reasons. The violators would be pursued aggressively in the coming days,”  Kalibo police chief Major Belshazzar Villanoche said.
Villanoche said that the curfew hours will be implemented until lifted by the provincial government. Several cities and towns across the country have imposed curfews, as well. (READ: Cops arrest homeless Lola who shouted at tanods warning about curfew)
Police officers have started their 12-hour shifts to ensure residents and establishments are complying with Executive Order No. 31 issued by Mayor Emerson Lachica.
The curfew forced local businesses such as fast food chains, restaurants, malls, stores and bars to close before 9 p.m. Some commercial establishments also adopted a four-day workweek for their workers while others temporarily suspended their operations.
The state of public emergency led to the banning of large public gatherings, suspension of classes and church activities, and travel restrictions for residents going to adjoining provinces in Panay Island.

""[Special session is] postponed – converted to a meeting in the Palace with House counterparts,"" Senate President Vicente Sotto III told reporters late Friday, March 20.
Sotto said that Senator Pia Cayetano, the Senate ways and means committee head, will attend the meeting with him, because Senator Sonny Angara, the Senate finance panel head, could not go.
The meeting on Saturday at 2 pm will also be attended by Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea, Finance Secretary Sonny Dominguez, Budget Secretary Wendel Avisado, and House Speaker Alan Peter Cayetano.
Duterte initially called for a special session to approve the supplemental budget that the Department of Health (DOH) had requested to address the coronavirus outbreak. 
""We will discuss tomorrow [March 21] how to empower and give the government the flexibilty to address the present crisis,"" Sotto said.
Asked whether an emergency powers bill will be tackled at the meeting, Sotto said: ""Hindi naman emergency powers. (It's not really emergency powers.)

The Senate President said that the meeting will be done because the ""terms could not be finalized."" He did not elaborate.
Duterte declared a state of calamity in the Philippines and a total lockdown on the island of Luzon, as coronavirus cases continue to rise in the country.
Several provinces, cities, and municipalities in the Visayas and Mindanao had likewise declared localized lockdowns.

CAGAYAN DE ORO CITY, Philippines – Bukidnon Governor Jose Maria Zubiri ordered Friday, March 20, the closure of the borders of his province, in complete disregard of a proposal from the mayor of this city for unified checkpoints.
The governor's complete lockdown bars everyone from entering or leaving Bukidnon, except for humanitarian workers and government workers whose purpose is related to the prevention of the spread of the novel coronavirus.
Earlier Friday, Cagayan de Oro City Mayor Oscar Moreno asked the different political leaders in the region to organize unified checkpoints for a wider community quarantine of Northern Mindanao.  Aside from Bukidnon, Moreno reached out to officials of Misamis Oriental.
Moreno raised his proposal because Cagayan de Oro was the de facto regional capital of Northern Mindanao.
In an announcement, Zubiri said he would close Bukidnon's border effective midnight of Saturday, March 21 until further notice.
""We are now enforcing (a ban to) the  entry of any person that is not a resident of the province. Non-residents are only up to the borders of the province,"" Zubiri said in an announcement issued in Bisaya dialect.
""This is in line with the strenghtening of the current Community Quarantine that is meant to prevent the spread of Covid19,"" Zubiri said.
The announcement allows the entry of its residents, humanitarian workers, health workers responding to emergencies, government officials and employees whose travels are directly related to the prevention of the spread of the virus.
People who are carrying food and medical supplies, and government employees of Bukidnon who are on official travel will be exempted.
""These persons, before entering the province will have to show proof of identification at quarantine and border checkpoints of the province,"" Zubiri said. 
Earlier, Senator Juan Miguel Zubiri, son of the Bukidnon governor, tested positive of the coronavirus. 
Previously, 2 women being probed for  COVID-19 died on Wednesday, March 18, within 24 hours after they were brought to the Northern Mindanao Medical Center (NMMC) in Cagayan de Oro from different hospitals in the region.
On March 14, Mindanao recorded its first COVID-19 death, a 54-year-old native of Marawi City who moved to Pasig City following the Marawi siege in 2017. The man was confined at the NMCC in Cagayan de Oro City.

WARRANTLESS ARREST. Justice Secretary Menardo Guevarra stands by his pronouncement on warrantless arrests during the lockdown. File photo by Angie de Silva/Rappler 
MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – Justice Secretary Menardo Guevarra is standing firm on his pronouncement that violators of the enhanced community quarantine can be arrested without a warrant, even as the lockdown creates gaps in the process that might prejudice those apprehended.
""Our criminal laws are not suspended during times of emergency,"" Guevarra told reporters on Friday, March 20, in response to a question if he's considering adjusting his statement given that the Supreme Court has already closed all court offices nationwide.
But judges and court staff will go to work on a per-urgent call basis. The Supreme Court will be announcing hotlines soon.
In the capital city of Manila, over 20 violators of the curfew, many of them poor, were detained for over 2 days because no inquest staff was available to process their release. This incident in Manila was a case of confusion over arrangements and ordinances, expected to happen in a lockdown where many are rendered immobile.
""Would you consider changing your message that all lockdown violators will just have to be forcibly sent home and not be arrested?"" was the question to Guevarra.
""Law enforcement, prosecution, and court adjudication structures and procedures will just have to make the necessary adjustments, no matter how difficult it may be,"" said Guevarra.
""Otherwise, we will have a breakdown of law and order,"" the justice secretary said. 
'The law needs to be compassionate'
In Manila, Chief Inquest Officer Jovencio Senados said some of the people arrested for violation of the curfew ordinance were also booked for violating Article 151 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC), or resistance and disobedience to authority, which is punishable by a fine not exceeding P100,000 and imprisonment of up to 6 months.
Senados said it is their policy to immediately release those filed with that charge, instead of going through the usual process of letting the charge reach the court first before they could post bail.
""Kasi para sa amin ang unang gagawin mo naman talaga kapag naaresto ka ay resist, di ba? Isang dahilan namin dyan congested na ang city jail, isasama ba namin sa city jail kung yan lang kaso mo,"" said Senados. (For us, it's natural instinct to resist when you're being arrested. One reason for that is also the city jail is congested, would we really put you there for that offense only?)
Article 151 has been cited by Guevarra as a legal basis for arresting without warrant those who will be caught violating lockdown terms – even those found outside without an essential task.
A homeless elderly woman was already arrested over this charge during the lockdown.
Guevarra also cited the broad law of Republic Act 11332 which punishes mere ""non-cooperation"" with authorities in a public health emergency.
In a tweet, former solicitor general Florin Hilbay said that the use of the law is wrong.
""I'm assuming their goal is a practical, overriding good: convince people to stay home,"" said Hilbay.
In another tweet, Edwin Lacierda, former president Benigno Aquino's spokesperson who's a lawyer, said ""jailing them won't advance social distancing measures.""

MANILA, Philippines – The Philippine Association of Meat Processors, Incorporated (PAMPI) told the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) that a ""severe"" shortage of meat products may occur by April, as the Luzon-wide lockdown against the coronavirus pandemic disrupts deliveries and production.
In a letter sent to Trade Secretary Ramon Lopez on Friday, March 20, PAMPI said vehicles transporting raw materials for processing meat get stuck at checkpoints.
Imported meat products are also being held up at ports.
""We agree that a lockdown is necessary to stop the contagion. Unfortunately, we were not prepared for it in terms of increased production and bigger raw meat inventories,"" PAMPI said in its letter. (READ: LIST: Who are allowed out during Luzon lockdown?)
Asked for further comment, PAMPI spokesperson Rex Agarrado told Rappler that the letter was ""not meant for public consumption,"" as it was meant to convey the industry's concerns only to Lopez.

""While we do encounter problems at the checkpoints, ongoing talks with the DTI as well as other government agencies prove to be very fruitful,"" he added.
Agarrado said packaging materials like carton boxes, tin cans, flexible films, and spices are not allowed by some checkpoints.
The DTI released a memorandum on Friday, instructing checkpoint personnel to let all types of cargoes, both food and non-food, move freely.
If subjected to random inspection, cargoes should not be delayed, especially if a cargo manifest or delivery receipt including the destination is presented.

MANILA, Philippines – Confusion over work arrangements and effectivity of the curfew in the capital city of Manila kept over 20 people in jail for almost 2 days, many of them poor.
Manila's Chief Inquest Officer Jovencio Senados said that they released on Friday, March 20, the 22 to 23 people arrested for violating Manila's city ordinance imposing an 8pm-5am curfew for the duration of Luzon's lockdown to contain the coronavirus outbreak.
Senados told Rappler in a phone interview on Friday that many of those arrested were either homeless, vendors, or people who needed to go to work.
The arrested people were kept in detention for almost 2 days, since Wednesday, March 18, which was a procedural gap because they should have been released immediately.
""Kapag ang inquest case ay para sa violation ng city ordinance, kahit for filing ang kaso nya, nire-release na namin because it's a  minor offense. That is our office policy,"" said Senados.
(If the inquest case is over violation of a city ordinance, even though we will file charges, we also release immediately because it's a minor offense. That is our office policy.)
Manila Mayor Isko Moreno, who initially said that there were no judges to process one's bail, eventually clarified there were no inquest staff to take on the cases.
In the legal process, a warrantless arrest have to undergo inquest, after which the inquest prosecutors file charges in court where those arrested can post bail. (READ: Cops arrest homeless Lola who shouted at tanods warning about curfew)
File but release
As Senados said, the people did not need to wait for the filing of charges because of their policy of releasing them right away. 
However, Senados said that because of the difficulty getting to work due to the suspension of mass transportation, he and his staff decided to go to work only on March 19, Thursday.
""Akala ko Thursday pa ang effectivity ng curfew (I thought curfew was only effective Thursday),"" said Senados.
The Manila City Council conceded that their ordinance was supposed to take effect on March 19, to comply with the rule that an ordinance must be published before it takes effect. 
But the council changed its mind and decided it would take effect immediately, or on Monday, March 16, skirting the process. The change was apparently not cascaded to the city government personnel and the public. 
Senados said the many of the staff are city government employees, whose work are already suspended.
""Kahit 'yung staff ko na gustong gusto pumasok hindi makapasok. 'Yung isa bumili na nga ng bike,"" said Senados.
(Even my staff who badly wants to go to work cannot go to work. One of them bought a bike.)
The Department of Justice (DOJ) kept inquest proceedings open precisely to respond to these situations.

MANILA, Philippines – After posting wrong information on social media about the spread of the novel coronavirus which caused panic, a barangay chairman in Marikina City faces charges for violating the Anti-Cybercrime Law.
Marikina City Mayor Marcelino ""Marcy"" Teodoro said he was suing Ziffred Ancheta, chair of Barangay Tumana here for falsely claiming on a Facebook live post Thursday, March 19, that there was a case of coronavirus infection in his area.
That erroneous Facebook post caused panic in Marikina, said Teodoro.
Teodoro said Ancheta faced charges of Unlawful Means of Publication and Unlawful Utterances,  Article 154 of the Revised Penal Code in relation to RA 10951 of the  Anti-Cybercrime Law.
Ancheta's claim on Facebook has since been refuted by the Marikina City Health Office (CHO), and the city's Rescue 161.

MANILA, Philippines – Last hurrah on hold. 
PBA veteran Cyrus Baguio had decided to postpone his retirement to chase the elusive Philippine Cup title, but his swan song has been delayed as the league suspended its season due to the coronavirus. 
""I want to end my career on a fitting exit. It would be great if we reach the finals or win the championship,"" Baguio said in Filipino, baring he asked NLEX coach Yeng Guiao if he could play for one final conference.
But even before Baguio stepped on the hardcourt for his last conference, the PBA had to cancel its games to prevent the spread of the virus that has infected over 200,000 and killed nearly 9,000 worldwide. 
PBA commissioner Willie Marcial estimated the suspension will last for at least two months, which is half of the time for an entire conference to finish. 
As soon as the PBA season returns, though, Baguiao has his sights set on the All-Filipino crown, believing NLEX has a shot at winning the grand prize.
NLEX finished the elimination round in the Governors' Cup last season with the best record and is expected to contend in the Philippine Cup. 
Baguio, who has 3 PBA championships under his belt, came close to nailing the All-Filipino title several times.
He and Barako Bull fell short of the crown to Purefoods in 2006. Nine years later, he once again failed to bag the prestigious hardware when Alaska succumbed to San Miguel in 7 games in 2015. 
But his most painful Philippine Cup finals heartbreak came in 2016 as Alaska squandered a commanding 3-0 lead that paved the way for San Miguel to complete what is famously known as the ""Beeracle."" 
""I had a lot of heartbreaks. That's why I asked coach Yeng [if I could] play [for one more conference],"" Baguio said. 
Although he has no serious injuries and can still produce decent numbers, Baguiao said he is far from the player who sank acrobatic shots and slammed home dunks with ease, earning him the moniker ""Skyrus."" 
""My body doesn't feel the same,"" said the former 14th overall pick. ""Many of my batchmates are already out of the league."" 
Only Baguio, Harvey Carey of TNT, and Reynel Hugnatan of Meralco have active contracts from the 2003 draft class. 
Baguio added he does not want to hold on to his roster spot, especially with NLEX having a bevy of young and talented guards in its lineup.

NEGATIVE. Chief Justice Diosdado Peralta tests negative for coronavirus. File photo by Ben Nabong/Rappler 
MANILA, Philippines – Chief Justice Diosdado Peralta tested negative for the novel coronavirus, the Supreme Court said on Friday, March 20.
""He tested negative of COVID-19 after traveling to the Netherlands early this month and later on showing symptoms of the disease,"" the Supreme Court (SC) said in a statement on Friday.
Peralta was on an official business trip to The Hague from March 1 to 7.
As of March 19, 2020, the Netherlands has 2,051 cases of coronavirus, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). 
The SC said Peralta didn't immediately show symptoms. 
""However, when Chief Justice Peralta showed symptoms such as persistent coughing, he then went on self quarantine in his residence, and was advised by doctors to be tested for the COVID-19 considering also the fact that he traveled to a COVID infected country as per the guidelines of the Department of Health (DOH),"" said the SC.
SC Spokesperson Brian Keith Hosaka said Peralta got tested on March 17. (READ: When should you get tested for coronavirus?)
""Chief Justice Peralta made this statement as he reassured the officials and employees of the Judiciary, as well as the general public, that he is continuing his work from home and that he is closely monitoring the situation of the courts throughout the country,"" the SC said.
With limited test kits, the Department of Health (DOH) said it would only test for now a specific group of persons under investigation (PUI).
PUIs are individuals who have two or all of the following:

History of travel in the past 14 days to countries with local transmission and risk of importation of the virus
History of exposure with a confirmed case
Has symptoms of respiratory illness (cough and/or colds) and/or fever

The DOH said a PUI will only be tested if the person is experiencing severe manifestations of symptoms. 
But elderly who manifest coronavirus symptoms, whether mild or severe, and those who have underlying medical conditions, will automatically get tested for possible infection.
Peralta is 67 years old.
Peralta on Friday ordered the physical closure of all courts nationwide, but he said judges and staff will be required to answer calls and queries, and if the matter is deemed urgent, they will have to go to court and act on it. – Rappler.com

STILL SERVING. File of a RTMI bus in Cagayan de Oro City. Wikipedia.org 
CAGAYAN DE ORO CITY, Philippines – Public transport, particularly buses, continued to ply their routes within Northern Mindanao despite the stirct measures implemented nationwide to stop the spread of the coronavirus disease.
Land Transportation Franchising Regulatory Board Region 10 Director Aminoden Guro said that buses and other public transports are still allowed to operate but only intraregional routes.
This means, Guro said, these bus companies could still crisscross Northern Mindanao, but would be barred from entering Caraga, Davao, Zamboanga and BARMM. 
""Rural Transport Mindanao Incorporated, (RTMI), Super 5 and Pabama continue to operate provided they observe stringent measures for travelers,"" Guro said.
Jessie Boy Lentorio, Manager of RTMI Yacapin Branch confirmed that their company continued to serve the public, especially in Bukidnon, Misamis Oriental and Lanao del Norte.
Lentorio said RTMI provided handwashing stations at the Agora and Westbound bus terminals in Cagayan de Oro. It also required thermal scanning and using alcohol hand sanitizers before boarding their buses.
Lentorio added that passengers will be stamped on their wrist to show that they have gone through the inspection and sanitation process. Travellers need to sign their passenger logbook and write where they came from and where they were going.
""All our buses are disinfected before the trip. We are also implementing the LTFRB guideline on social distancing, all passegers are one seat apart, at only 50% capacity of the bus,"" Lentorio said.
Right to travel vs public health
""It is in our law, the right to travel. Every person has the right to be where he wants to be, although that is not absolute. One of the exception is public health. That's the basis for the restriction,"" said Cagayan de Oro City Mayor Oscar Moreno.
Moreno said that the real spirit of the quarantine is to stay home. ""Hopefully, what we are doing is preemptive, our measures since the beginning have been calibrated,"" he added. 
On Friday, March 19, Moreno reached out to the political leaders of Misamis Oriental and Bukidnon for the implementation og a wider community quarantine area.
Moreno asked Bukidnon, Misamis Oriental and Cagayan de Oro to have primary checkpoints where they share borders with Region 10
Moreno said it was difficult to close the city's border, ""I find it difficult that it is only in our city, what is important is that we prevent the entry of the virus,"" Moreno said.
Moreno added that they were closing Region 10's boundary following the first recorded COVID-19 death in this city and in Mindanao. The patient though is not from this city. – Rappler.com

UNINHABITED. Sibakil Island in Lantawan, Basilan. Photo from AFP Westmincom 
MANILA, Philippines – The military in Western Mindanao plans to build a quarantine facility in an uninhabited island in Basilan province for 131 Filipinos stranded on vessels after ports denied them entry because of the novel coronavirus pandemic.
The Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) Western Mindanao Command proposed building 100 tents on Sibakil Island for the Filipinos who had traveled from Sabah, Malaysia, but were turned away as they were about to dock in several Philippine ports facing the Sulu Sea, said Westmincom chief Lieutenant General Cirilito Sobejana.
The national government now requires Filipinos coming home from countries with local transmissions of the coronavirus to be placed in quarantine for 14 days. Malaysia, like the Philippines, has a local epidemic of the virus.
The two vessels carrying the Filipinos are currently adrift in the waters around Basilan, after being denied entry in Tawi-Tawi, Jolo, and Zamboanga.
On March 17, the vessels docked at the ports of Maluso town and Isabela City in Basilan, where 282 of the original 413 passengers were allowed to disembark.
There are at least 10 children among the 131 remaining passengers, all of whom would have to go through medical screening for symptoms of the virus.
Seeing the need for a place to serve as their quarantine, a team from Westmincom led by Colonel Leonardo Peña, chief of the unified command staff, inspected Sibakil Island in Lantawan, Basilan, and found it suitable to house up to 200 people.
FROM SCRATCH. There are no existing structures on Sibakil Island, and quarantine facilities will have to be built from scratch, says the military. Photo from AFP Westmincom 
There is no infrastructure on the island so a quarantine will be built from scratch, and Sobejana said the Department of Health in Region 9 is deliberating on securing resources for the military’s proposal.
“Through the Westmincom-initiated Inter-Agency Task Force on COVID-19, a comprehensive plan was jointly done for the conversion of Sibakil Island into a Quarantine Controlled Area. Concerned agencies indicated their support for the idea,” Sobejana said.
COVID-19 is the official name of the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.
“We anticipate that the current number of returning Filipinos will still increase as they evade the threat of COVID-19 in Sabah and parts of Malaysia,” the general added.
Sabah, internationally recognized as part of Malaysia, is claimed by the Philippines as its territory.
As of Friday, the Philippines has had 230 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus, with 18 deaths, and 8 recoveries.
Across the globe, more than 217,500 people have contracted the disease. More than 9,000 people have died of it, as the virus hit 157 countries. – Rappler.com "
,"March 20, 2020",nCov,"How Filipinos are using #INeedARide to crowdsource, match transpo needs",Francisco Mendoza,"
  
MANILA, Philippines – Left with limited options for public transportation, frontliners and healthcare workers have been harnessing the power of online crowdsourcing to look for ways to get to their places of work. 
The Philippine government placed Luzon under lockdown starting Tuesday, March 17, as a response to the spike of  coronavirus cases in the country.
This new measure implemented strict quarantine procedures, suspension of transportation services, and regulation of food and essential health services, among others. Additional travel restrictions were rolled out while local governments across the capital region moved to implement an 8 pm to 5 am curfew in their respective areas.
While the tactic is supported by experts, frontliners struggled with the national government's lack of immediate and timely transport solutions for those who are required to report to work. 
It was only on the day after President Rodrigo Duterte implemented the enhanced community quarantine when the Department of Transportation reactively set up free bus rides around Metro Manila for health workers.
 However, even with this added provisions, frontliners and healthcare workers said that it does not fully satisfy the demand for transportation. (READ: Groups providing transportation services for frontliners) 
Hoping to address this issue, spoken word poet Juan Miguel Severo introduced #INeedARide on Twitter to match people who need a ride to go to their workplace with volunteers who can accommodate these requests.

Dear health workers/anyone whose work isn't suspended today:If you need a ride, please reply to this thread with #INeedARide and your route.If you're a private citizen w/ car whose willing to drop them off, check hashtag to see you can accommodate someone.Let's do this.— Juan Miguel Severo (@TheRainBro) March 17, 2020

Most of the Twitter users who used the hashtags are healthcare workers who need to get to hospitals for their duty. Without the means for mobility, some of the healthcare workers have been walking to their places of work instead.

“As of now, despite the high reach, we are only able to pick up and drop off a few people. So far, I've accommodated people whom I've interacted with via direct messages,"" JC shared. 
He added that the initiative is more effective on Facebook since Filipinos have been coordinating through groups that are dedicated for that specific purpose.

LEGAZPI CITY, Philippines (UPDATED) – Department of Health officials in the Bicol region fear that they could be  sitting on a ticking time bomb after the different local government units here reported Friday, March 20, over 97,000 cases of Persons Under Monitoring (PUM) for the coronavirus disease.
Ernie Vera, DOH Bicol regional director, said that based on the data provided by the Department of Interior and Local Government situation report of March 19, 5 pm, that there were almost 90,000 PUMs, with majority of the cases in Camarines Norte, Camarines Sur and Albay. 
As of Friday, March 20, the LGU situation report posted on the DOH-Bicol Facebook account said they were monitoring 97,215 persons.
DOH Bicol's count though of PUMs with complete reports was at 77.

 
DOH Bicol also said there were still 7 persons under investigation (PUI) here. Overall it has recorded 39 PUIs and discharged 32.
There was still no confirmed case of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, in Bicol.  
Vera said LGUs here noted a big spike in PUM cases in their areas after President Rodrigo Duterte declared the community quarantine in Metro Manila on Monday, March 15. The president later imposed a more strict Luzon-wide lockdown on Tuesday, March 16.
Vera said Bicolanos based in Metro Manila returned home in droves, some of them coming from places where there were cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. 
DOH Bicol said if an outbreak happens, the region's referral hospitals do not have testing kits to immediately determine coronavirus cases.
All specimens from those categorized as PUI, meaning the patient has a fever and has problems breathing, are tested only at the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) in Muntinlupa, Metro Manila.
The 3 referral hospitals identified by DOH Bicol are the Bicol Regional Training and Teaching Hospital, Bicol Medical Center and Bicol Sanitarium. 
“The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is already in the doorsteps of Bicolanos as the persons under monitoring are ballooned to 86,698 as of March 19,” Vera said.
Based on the LGU situation report, the highest number of monitoring among the 6 provinces of Bicol was Camarines Sur with 35,754. Albay was second with 21,113, while Camarines Norte had 14,623. 
Vera said, if Bicolanos do not follow the recommended home quarantine policy, a coronavirus infection ""could happen in the coming days.""
""The virus is in our doorstep. Based on the average of 6.5 days incubation period, anytime, we could have COVID-19 case here. We don’t want the blaming scenario here. Follow the quarantine because the war on virus is unseen,” Vera added. 
Last Wednesday, March 18, the provincial government of Albay sealed its borders in a bid to contain the spread of the virus. – Rappler.com  "

MANILA, Philippines – The office of Vice President Leni Robredo donated P5.3 million worth of novel coronavirus extraction kits to the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM), the country’s primary testing center. 
Robredo’s office delivered the kits as well several personal protective equipment (PPE) sets to RITM’s headquarters in Muntinlupa on Friday, March 20.
""The extraction kits were obtained from a local supplier. An extraction kit separates the genetic material from the other components of the virus. The detecting kit identifies whether the extracted genetic material is that of the virus [2019 n-CoV]. This was requested by RITM,"" Barry Gutierrez, Robredo's spokesperson, told Rappler in a text message.
In a statement, the OVP said that the extraction kits may be used for 12,750 coronavirus tests at RITM and the other subnational laboratories where coronavirus samples may be tested. These are the Lung Center of the Philippines, San Lazaro Hospital, UP-National Institutes of Health, Baguio General Hospital (Baguio City), Vicente Sotto Memorial Medical Center (Cebu City), and Southern Philippines Medical Center (Davao City). 
The DOH has admitted the Philippine health care system is “challenged” by the growing demand for test kits, where supplies run low in the provinces outside Metro Manila. (READ: Coronavirus mass testing not needed for now – DOH) 
The country has mostly been relying on donations from the World Health Organization (WHO) and foreign countries to augment its low supply of test kits, though the DOH is working to increase the Philippines’ testing capacity.

The OVP statement did not specify how many PPE sets it donated on Friday, but it has raised as much as P17.3 million to buy protective gear for health workers on the frontlines against COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus. 
Robredo and the partners of her flagship anti-poverty program, Angat Buhay, have been raising funds to give assistance to health professionals, whose travel to and from hospitals have been hampered by the lockdown imposed by the national government over the entire Luzon. 
The OVP is currently providing free shuttles for health workers around Metro Manila.

MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – The number of coronavirus cases in the Philippines is now at 230 after the Department of Health (DOH) reported an additional 13 cases as of 12 pm Friday, March 20.
DOH Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire announced the latest tally in a press conference that aired on state-run PTV-4 past 4 pm Friday. The DOH is yet to release more details about the new cases.
Vergeire also said one more patient with COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, died. He was Patient 124, a 65-year-old Filipino male who traveled from Singapore. He died on Tuesday, March 17. 
This means the total fatalities in the Philippines due to COVID-19 is currently at 18. 
No new recoveries were reported, which means the number of patients who no longer have COVID-19 stays at 8. 
The DOH tracker shows there are a total of 506 persons under investigation (PUIs) for COVID-19 who are currently confined in medical facilities nationwide, while another 6,321 are persons under monitoring quarantined at home. 
In an earlier press conference on Friday, Vergeire admitted the Philippine health care system is ""challenged"" by the growing demand for test kits. 
This shortage has forced the DOH to prioritize testing for PUIs who have severe or critical symptoms and have either traveled to a country with local transmission of COVID-19 or have known exposure to a positive case. 
Vergeire said there are now 5 subnational laboratories that can test COVID-19 samples: the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine in Muntinlupa City, Baguio General Hospital and Medical Center in Baguio City, San Lazaro Hospital in Manila City, Southern Philippines Medical Center in Davao City, and Vicente Sotto Memorial Medical Center in Cebu City. (READ: Coronavirus mass testing not needed for now – DOH)
Vergeire said each of these laboratories is capable of processing some 50 to 300 tests per day. 
Two more subnational laboratories are being eyed to eventually become extension testing centers for COVID-19: the Western Visayas Medical Center in Iloilo City and the Bicol Public Health Laboratory.
Vergeire also said the laboratory of the University of the Philippines-National Institutes for Health, which developed its own testing kit, is being mobilized to augment the government's testing capacity. – Rappler.com "

“The suspension of sea travel and air travel that bring passengers here to Bohol is extended until April 12,” Yap said in a Facebook post in Bisaya. “This does not include cargo. Cargo vessels are still allowed to come to bring our supplies,” he added.Following the implementation of a curfew in surrounding provinces, Bohol also ordered a province-wide curfew from 9 pm to 5 am.The curfew seeks to limit the movement of people because they observed people still gathering and loitering in places like parks and staying at internet cafes through the night.Exempted from the curfew are pharmacies, employees of telecommunications companies, electric and water utilities doing maintenance or emergency repairs, and medical personnel.Tagbilaran City has its own guidelines to restrict movement including a curfew between  9 pm to 5 am, and the suspension of operations of internet cafes, KTV bars, movie houses, and other entertainment establishments.The Diocese of Tagbilaran also took masses online to follow the ban on mass gatherings.
In other parts of Bohol, local government units where iconic tourist sites are located have closed to the public the Chocolate Hills Complex in Carmen,  the Loboc Tourism Complex (Loboc River Cruise), the Loboc Eco-Adventure Park in Loboc, and the Danao Adventure Park in Danao.As of Thursday night, the Philippines recorded 217 COVID-19 cases, 17 deaths, and 8 recoveries.
The global death toll, meanwhile, has reached 9,020, with 3,245 of the fatalities in China (excluding Hong Kong and Macau). The number of cases worldwide has risen to 217,510, with 80,928 of the infections in China. The virus has spread to at least 157 countries.  
Tourism – a major economic driver in Bohol – has taken a huge hit from the quarantines and lockdowns of neighboring provinces and Metro Manila.According to data from the Department of Tourism, room occupancy went down by 35% in February compared to the previous year.In 2019, 322,000 Chinese tourists visited Bohol, making China the province's top market. South Korea is next at 117,000 tourists and Japan with 32,281 tourists.There were 7 persons under investigation for novel coronavirus in Bohol, but no confirmed cases as of Thursday. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – Why did the national government allow the City of Manila to deploy electronic tricycles (e-trikes) during the coronavirus lockdown, when it earlier stopped Pasig City from letting conventional tricycles make limited trips for health workers and the sick?
For one thing, Manila’s 189 e-trikes are not taxis, and were hired specifically to bring health workers to the hospitals they work at, said Interior Secretary Eduardo Año on Friday, March 20.
""Hindi sila pumapasada (They don't ply routes). They are on the spot system to pick up the health workers. Specific. Hindi yung pumi-pick up ka ng pasahero (They don't pick up passengers),"" he said in a media briefing in Malacañang.
Second, it would have been impossible to really limit trips tricycles make: allow a few to go around and others will follow, Año added.
All modes of public transportation are banned during the “enhanced community quarantine” to “make it hard for people to move so they will stay at home.”
“My job is to make people stay at home,” Año said.
Limited trips
Pasig Mayor Vico Sotto initially allowed tricycles on “limited trips” around his city to service health workers, employees of essential establishments, and the infirm who do not have access to private cars – people exempted from the lockdown.
Based on a risk assessment, more people could die without transportation to hospitals or health centers, Sotto said.
Tricycles were seen as a viable alternative to the city government’s buses and shuttles, which the mayor said were not enough to service the thousands of people who still need to get around every day, and who have legitimate reasons to be traveling during the lockdown.
Tricycles were also the only mode of transportation that can navigate Pasig’s narrow streets and alleys, which would be handy in cases of emergency, the Pasig mayor said. 
Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles shot down Sotto’s suggestion on Wednesday, saying social distancing – keeping ample personal space to prevent contagion — could not be practiced in tricycles, even though Sotto already pointed out that it could be done by limiting the number of passengers on every trip.
270,000 tricycles
Metro Manila has at least 270,000 tricycles, Año said. If tricycles were allowed in Pasig, there would be no reason to ban them in other places.
Supposing only 100,000 tricycles return to the streets on limited trips, the interior secretary said that would still be too many, and it would encourage people to go outdoors when they should be on quarantine.
“I don’t want the [police and military] to check 100,000 tricycles every moment just to check kung who is on them. I’d rather have them focus their efforts on keeping people at home,” Año said.
The entire island of Luzon, with its more than 57 million people, is on lockdown until April 12. Metro Manila will remain under lockdown until April 14. The measure is meant to contain the outbreak of the novel coronavirus.
The Philippines has 217 confirmed cases of the virus, 17 deaths, and 8 recoveries.
Across the globe, more than 217,500 people have contracted the disease. More than 9,000 people have died of it, as the virus hit 157 countries. – Rappler.com

MANILA, Philippines – The Department of Health (DOH) said there is no need to conduct mass testing for now, despite a steady rise of novel coronavirus cases in the Philippines.
On Friday, March 20, DOH Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire was asked in a press conference if the country is capable of “aggressive testing” and if there is a need to conduct tests door-to-door, similar to what countries like South Korea are doing. 
“In other countries, though it has been done like in South Korea, they did mass testing, pero ito po ay mayroon silang... well-capable ang kanilang health systems at [may] capacity for that. Sa ngayon po, hindi pa naman natin nakikitang kailangan nating gawin itong mass testing na ito,” Vergeire said.
(In other countries, though it has been done like in South Korea, they did mass testing, but they have well-capable health systems and the capacity for that. Right now, we still see no need to do mass testing.)
From just 3 coronavirus cases in February, the Philippines now has 217 positive cases of COVID-19. Of that number, 17 patients have died while only 8 have recovered so far. 
Still, Vergeire said if the national government would eventually find the need to widen the scope of testing and if there are enough resources, then mass testing for COVID-19 – the disease caused by the virus – would be conducted.
“Ngunit of course, nariyan po ‘yan sa ating talaan, nasa mapa, nasa radar. Kung sakaling dumating ‘yong panahon na we have enough resources, the government can do it, and if it is imperative for government to do it, gagawin po natin ‘yan kung saka-sakali,” Vergeire said. 
(But of course, we are mapping these out and the cases are in our radar. In case we reach that point where we have enough resources, the government can do it, and if it is imperative for the government do it, we will do this if needed.)
The World Health Organization (WHO), however, have already called for ""aggressive"" action in Southeast Asia to combat the fast-spreading coronavirus. 
The Philippines has long been grappling with a shortage of test kits since the outbreak began, with the country mostly relying on donations from the WHO and other foreign countries. This is compounded by the growing demand for test kits around the globe, where at least 157 countries have recorded 217,510 cases of COVID-19.  
This has forced the DOH to prioritize testing for severe and critical COVID-19 cases. 
On Friday, Vergeire also admitted the Philippine health care system is “challenged” by the growing demand for novel coronavirus testing. (READ: Without test kits, provinces, cities fighting blindly against coronavirus) 
For the longest time, the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine, the DOH’s research arm, was the sole WHO-accredited laboratory capable of testing COVID-19 specimens. Five other subnational laboratories for coronavirus testing were opened this week, but they are not at full capacity yet. 
The DOH is now moving to augment the country’s severely lacking testing capacity. The Food and Drug Administration has already approved 4 novel coronavirus test kit products for commercial use, though these can only be purchased by hospitals and laboratories with testing capacity. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – President Rodrigo Duterte’s reminder to local executives to enforce the coronavirus lockdown in Luzon was not aimed at anyone in particular, members of the Cabinet said on Friday, March 20, as they reiterated and clarified some of the measure’s guidelines.
“Everyone is reminded. We’re not pinpointing an individual LGU (local government unit) or person. These are the guidelines of the President intended for all LGUs,” said Interior Secretary Eduardo Año at a media briefing in Malacañang in response to questions.
“Let’s make this clear ha (alright)? Let’s not start this ball rolling of identifying LGUs. Alam ko (I know) where this is going…. Let’s not fall into that, okay?” added Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles.
“Magtulungan po tayo. Wala nang ganyanan na, ‘Sinong LGU ‘yan?’ Nagtuturuan na eh. That’s not healthy anymore. Please…this is a general directive of the President so everybody, just follow. Huwag na ‘yung mag-intriga pa na ganito, ganyan. Pare, COVID-19 ang kalaban natin dito. Hindi tayo-tayo ang magkaaway dito, ha?” Nograles went on.
(Let’s help one another out. No more of this, ‘Which LGU is that?’ We’re pointing fingers now. That’s not healthy anymore. Please…this is a general directive of the President so everybody, just follow. No more intrigues on this or that. Bro, our enemy here is COVID-19. We’re not enemies here, alright?)
Tricycle tussle
Earlier on Friday, at around 1 am, Malacañang streamed a prerecorded video of Duterte telling local governments to “stand down” and enforce the “enhanced community quarantine” in their constituencies only according to the guidelines set by the national Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF) on Emerging Infectious Diseases.
Duterte did not single out any mayor, city, or municipality, but the address followed a much-publicized plea from Pasig Mayor Vico Sotto that the national government allow tricycles to continue servicing people exempted from the lockdown – health workers, employees of essential businesses, and people traveling for medical reasons.
The lockdown includes a total ban on public transportation, which Sotto reasoned would result in even more deaths, based on the Pasig government’s risk assessment.
Sotto initially allowed tricycles to take limited trips in Pasig on the first two days of the lockdown, but Nograles on Wednesday ruled it out, and Sotto said Pasig would comply with the total ban.
Still, Duterte scolded local governments, which he said were implementing the lockdown “according to their own interpretation,” and threatened to file administrative and even criminal cases against local executives who would not follow the IATF’s guidelines to the letter.
'Variations' in LGU enforcement
On Wednesday and Thursday, as the controversy between Pasig and the national government over tricycles drew public attention, #ProtectVico trended on Twitter and other social media platforms as people rallied behind the mayor whom they said was only trying to do his job well.
At Friday’s briefing, Año talked about other “variations” among local governments’ enforcement of the lockdown: some locales were hampering the passage of cargo trucks including those carrying medicines and other vital items, and some checkpoints barred stranded travelers who were just heading home.
Año said the cargo trucks and the stranded travelers should have been allowed passage.

CEBU CITY, Philippines – About 30,100 novel coronavirus test kits have arrived in Cebu,  regional health officials assured residents in the Visayas as the number of cases continued to rise nationwide.
Department of Health-Central Visayas officials said in a press briefing on Thursday night, March 19, that 10,100 test kits have arrived in Cebu – 100 from the DOH main office in Manila – with an additional 20,000 arriving on Friday, March 20. 
The test kits would be used at the Vicente Sotto Memorial Medical Center (VSMMC) in Cebu City, one of the first designated testing centers outside of Manila. 
According to a representative from the Office of the Presidential Assistant for the Visayas, they expected about 10,000 more test kits to arrive.  The 40,100 total kits will be distributed with half of them allocated for Cebu City residents and the rest for testing PUIs across the Visayas. 
Presidential Assistant for the Visayas Michael Dino, who was at the press briefing, said the test kits were ordered from South Korea.There are about 7 million people living in the Visayas, about 1 million of them living in Cebu City.
So far only one coronavirus case was confirmed in Cebu. The DOH said the patient was recovering and preparing for discharge.

MANILA, Philippines – A senior official from the Department of Health (DOH) admitted the Philippines' laboratories are currently overwhelmed by the growing demand for novel coronavirus testing.
Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said they are ""being challenged"" right now, when asked by the media on Friday, March 20, to confirm reports that test results of several persons under investigation for COVID-19 – the disease caused by the virus – have not been released for over a week now.
The DOH previously said test results are supposed to come out within 24 to 48 hours.
""So 'yun pong nababalita na medyo may delay, totoo po iyon (So those reports that there are some delays, those are true). We are being challenged right now,"" Vergeire said in a press briefing at Malacañang.
Vergeire, however, did not specify the extent of the backlog at the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) in Muntinlupa City, the DOH's research arm which, for the longest time, had been the country's only accredited laboratory to test COVID-19 specimens. The World Health Organization had said the RITM's daily capacity right now is at 450 tests.  
In a separate phone interview with Rappler, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III also admitted the delay in the release of results was due to the RITM reconfiguring its laboratory to ensure biohazard safety standards are still met despite the increasing number of specimens it needs to process.
""The biosafety standards should not be breached. They had to stop for a while to reconfigure and make the necessary infectious prevention and control measures. So they needed some time to do that,"" Duque said, adding that the RITM is back to its ""usual"" operations this week.
According to Vergeire, the DOH has started sending more testing kits to 5 subnational laboratories across the country so they can test more COVID-19 samples.
These include Baguio General Hospital and Medical Center in Baguio City, San Lazaro Hospital in Manila City, Lung Center of the Philippines in Quezon City, Southern Philippines Medical Center in Davao City, and Vicente Sotto Memorial Medical Center in Cebu City. 
The DOH is also in talks with 5 big hospitals in Metro Manila to assess if they have facilities to augment the country's severely lacking testing capacity. 
Local government units in the provinces are now battling COVID-19 with a blind eye due to a shortage of test kits. In the Davao Region, for example, 3 persons under investigation died before the RITM could even release their results. 
Vergeire said on Friday, however, that the DOH finds no need to do mass testing of the general population for now.

MANILA, Philippines – Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said that 125,000 novel coronavirus testing kits from China and South Korea will arrive in the Philippines early Saturday morning, March 21. 
Duque said in an interview on DZMM on Friday, March 20, that authorities have been alerted about the shipments to ensure their speedy release.
“Tinutukuan ko ‘yung mga test kits kasi nga may paparating na 25,000 from South Korea and 100,000 from China tomorrow at 5 am. Tinututukan ko ‘yung Bureau of Customs saka FDA  na mapabilis ang release, kasi ‘’yung ating number one na kakulangan, 'yung ating testing capacity,” Duque said in an interview aired on DZMM on Friday morning.
(I focused on the test kits because there are 25,000 kits from South Korea and 100,000 from China that will arrive tomorrow at 5 am. I coordinated with the Bureau of Customs and the Food and Drug Administration to speed up the release because this is what we lack now, the testing capacity.)
The additional test kits are expected to enable health workers to test more people for the virus. As of Friday, the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine can perform 450 tests per day.
The 4 new laboratories which were recently accredited by the World Health Organization (WHO), were only given 100 test kits each due to the limited supply. 
“What my concentration is now is to ensure that those 4 subnational labs are really operating according to set standards of safety and accuracy of testing.

MANILA, Philippines – Department of Health (DOH) Secretary Francisco Duque III said barangays have the option to turn classrooms into isolation rooms for patients with the novel coronavirus. 
Speaking to dzMM on Friday, March 20, Duque said this is one option Barangay Health Emergency Response Teams can take to make sure cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, will be isolated from the rest of the population. 
""Barangay Health Emergency Response Teams should focus on isolation rooms, identify where isolation rooms can be placed. Among the possible places are schools, classrooms,"" Duque said in Filipino. (READ: Braving a pandemic: Frontliners battle fear to confront the novel coronavirus)
The DOH chief said beds in isolation rooms should be at least two meters apart.
Duque explained allowing local government units to turn schools into isolation centers was one option to ensure even COVID-19 cases showing mild to moderate symptoms have somewhere to go for their quarantine. (READ: Millions could die if virus allowed to spread unchecked – U.N. chief)
Currently, hospitals are prioritizing severe and critical COVID-19 patients for confinement due to lack of facilities and testing kits. 
“Dapat doon talaga lahat ng ang tutok. So ‘yong mga kailangan i-isolate na mga mild to moderate cases, hindi naman puwedeng pabayaan sila. ‘Yong mga moderate, puwede kasing mag-deteriorate into severe or critical cases. ‘Yon ‘yong kailangan magkaroon na ng mga isolation rooms,” Duque said. 
(That's really what we need to focus on. We can't just abandon mild to moderate cases. Moderate cases can deteriorate into severe or critical cases, and they're the ones who need to be in isolation rooms.)
The DOH secretary already said he green-lighted the plan to turn a building of the University of the Philippines-Philippine General Hospital and the Dr. Jose N. Rodriguez Memorial Medical Center as hospitals exclusive for COVID-19 patients.  
The government is also eyeing to turn the Lung Center of the Philippines as another centralized hospital for COVID-19, but its “operationalization” is still being studied because many cancer patients are still confined here. 
To date, the Philippines has reported a total of 217 cases of the novel coronavirus, 17 of whom already died. Eight patients, however, already recovered from COVID-19. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – Acting on the urgent appeal of medical industry leaders, Health Secretary Francisco Duque said on Friday, March 20, that he has given the go-signal to turn the Dr Jose N. Rodriguez Memorial Medical Center and a building at the University of the Philippines-Philippine General Hospital (UP-PGH) for exclusive use of coronavirus patients.
Duque said that this was in response to the joint statement of private hospitals and medical industry leaders urging the government to put up “centralized” facilities for COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus that has so far infected 212 in the country.
“Nabasa ko na ito at ‘yon na nga, gagawin natin, ‘yong PGH, binigyan ko na ng [go-signal] ’yong plano ng UP-PGH [na] gawin ‘yong isang gusali good for 140 COVID patients. Gagawin siyang exclusive COVID hospital ng PGH. Tapos ang DOH naman, we will also convert ‘yong ating Jose N Rodriguez Memorial Hospital sa Caloocan as a specialized COVID hospital,” Duque said in an interview on DZMM.
(I read that statement and that's why I gave the go signal to the plan of UP-PGH to turn one of its buildings for the exclusive use of 140 COVID-19 patients. The PGH will be turned into a COVID-19-exclusive hospital. The DOH will also convert our Jose N Rodriguez Memorial Hospital in Caloocan as a specialized COVID hospital.)
UP-PGH is located in Manila while Jose N. Rodriguez hospital is in Caloocan. Both cities have confirmed COVID-19 cases.
Duque said he fully supports the appeal of the private hospitals to have dedicated  COVID-19 hospitals, as he knew even private hospitals were struggling as more and more persons under investigation (PUIs) are admitted to their facilities.
Health workers who get exposed to PUIs and COVID-19 patients have to take a 14-day quarantine, which means the workforce on duty in these hospitals would be severely affected.
“Tamang posisyon no’ng sumalat ng maraming private hospitals na talagang nakokompromiso pati ‘yong kanilang surgical services, pediatric, OB-GYN, iba pa hong mga may sakit. Siyempre nagkakaroon ng exposure. Tama naman ho sila kaya ko sinusuportahan ‘yong kanilang panukala, ‘yung kanilang mungkahi,” Duque said.
(The position of these private hospitals is correct because their surgical services, pediatric services, OB-GYN, and other patients really get compromised. Of course some of their workers get exposed. They are right and that's why I am supporting their proposals.)
Duque, who himself is under quarantine due to exposure to a positive case, did not say when the two hospitals would begin admitting only coronavirus patients.  
The health chief earlier said the government was eyeing the Lung Center of the Philippines in Quezon City as a facility exclusively for use of COVID-19 patients, but the “operationalization” was still being studied, as the Lung Center caters to many cancer patients.
For now, Duque said the Lung Center can offer several isolation rooms where novel coronavirus cases can be confined.
As of 12 pm on Thursday, March 19, the Philippines’ total tally of COVID-19 cases spiked to 217, 17 of which were fatal. Eight patients have recovered from the disease. – Rappler.com  "

MANLA, Philippines – Saying there is no time to lose, the chiefs of major hospitals in Metro Manila appealed to the government to designate hospitals dedicated for COVID-19 patients now.
""If we do not put our act together, the prospect of the healthcare delivery systems crashing down is imminent and real. It is already happening,"" the chiefs of 11 hospitals, endorsed by the Philippine College of Physicians and the Philippine College of Surgeons, said in a unity statement sent to media on Thursday, March 19.
According to the group, at least one or two centralized hospitals should be “adequately equipped and invested upon by the government, designated to receive, screen and treat PUIs and COVID-19 positive patients” to cater to the needs of growing number of cases.
They said they were aware of a Department of Health plan to designated COVID-19 hospitals but issued the appeal to highlight its urgency.
""As we observe globally, and in alignment with the government efforts, the most effective way to slow down this pandemic is through effective containment and distancing within the potentially disease-stricken population. Given the sharp increase of COVID-19+ patients per day, we have to act fast, and act now. There is no time for indecision,"" the group said.
“With the COVID-19 hospital(s) in place, the other institutions can then focus on the bigger population who need to be treated for the rest of the other conditions other than the COVID-19 infection,” they added.
In explaining the need for the dedicated COVID-19 hospitals, the medical chiefs noted that ""an alarming number of nurses, residents, consultants, and hospital employees are under 14-day quarantine while the number of PUIs (Persons under investigation) continue to flock to our emergency rooms every day.""
""We speak, as one, because the mismatch between the exponential surge of patients and the available healthcare workers is no longer occurring in just one center, but in all our respective institutions. We share information and coping mechanisms, but we cannot share resources that we no longer have,"" they said.
They said their regular rooms have been turned into coronavirus isolation areas, leaving less space for patients who have similarly life-threatening illnesses, 
""The panic is escalating, mortality is increasing, our supplies of personal protective equipment (PPE) are running short, our frontline staff are increasingly getting depleted as more of them are quarantined or physically and emotionally exhausted, and a number of our medical colleagues are already hooked to respirators fighting for their lives in various ICUs. Even our ICUs are getting full,"" the doctors said.
“Soon we will have a shortage of respirators. We have every reason to be scared; we are, indeed, very scared because we feel that we are on our own to face our countrymen in dire need of help,” they added. (READ: LEFT IN THE DARK: Little protection forgovernment's coronavirus frontliners)

ALBAY, Philippines – The People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) asks persons with companion animals, like cats and dogs, to not put masks on them as protection against the novel coronavirus. 
""Never put face masks on animals, as they can cause breathing difficulties...experts from the World Health Organization, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and elsewhere agree that cats and dogs are not at risk of getting COVID­-19 nor transmitting it to humans,"" said PETA, referring to the disease caused by the coronavirus. 
PETA also provided other life-saving tips as far as caring for companion animals and the prevention of virus transmission are concerned. 
One of them is avoiding close contact with animals if you are sick with COVID-19. 
According to PETA, ""The coronavirus can be left on animals' fur, just as it can remain on a doorknob, a handrail, another human hand, or any other surface that an infected person has touched.""
The group then advised that another member of the family should care for the companion animal in the meantime. 
Those living alone and undergoing self-quarantine will also be unable to care for their companion animals. They can call PETA Philippines' emergency response line at 0999-888-7382 for veterinary care or food. 
Educational sources 
The group also encourages parents to take advantage of their free online educational resources, activities, and lesson plans for students of all ages, including reading comprehension exercises for kids in grades K-12 and dozens of writing prompts for middle and high school students.
PETA's fun posters can prompt a discussion about animal-friendly idioms, while lessons on pronouns can help teach students in grades K-2 or 3-5 that animals are someone, not something. 
The ""Share the World"" kit, which includes an online video, helps even the youngest learners develop empathy for animals and PETA Kids offers fun activities for kids under 12, including comic books, games, and videos.
""Schools may be closed, but kids' minds are still wide open, and they can keep right on learning how to be good citizens at home with PETA' TeachKind,"" says PETA Senior Vice President of International Campaigns Jason Baker. TeachKind is PETA's human-education division for teachers, school administrators, and educators. 
""With these worksheets, writing prompts, videos, and games, students can stay busy and hone their reading and writing skills while learning to have compassion and empathy for others,"" Baker said.
Year-round, PETA and TeachKind offer free lesson plans, classroom materials, and more to help teachers add compassion for animals to their curriculum. 
PETA also offers a free vegan starter kit to anyone in the Philippines who orders one from its website, PETAAsia.com. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – Foreigners currently in the Philippines will not be affected by the country’s latest move to ban all non-Filipinos from entering the country, the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) said on Thursday night, March 19. 
The DFA made the clarification in an advisory, saying the temporary suspension of visa issuances and visa-free entry privileges ""has no impact on foreign nationals that are already in the country or on holders of visas issued by other government agencies.""
Earlier on Thursday, Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr announced on Twitter that the Philippines would effectively ban all foreigners from entering the country to prevent the further spread of the novel coronavirus. 
Locsin said the Philippines would do this by suspending all visa issuances in the DFA’s foreign posts and home office, as well as suspending visa-free entry privileges for at least 100 countries, including the United States and several European countries. 
The move caught many by surprise as the DFA chief said visas issued before the announcement would be deemed canceled, while only foreign spouses and children of Filipinos were exempted from the temporary travel restriction. 
How the ban will be implemented: The DFA’s posts both in the Philippines and abroad will stop issuing visas from Thursday, March 18 ""until further notice.""
Aside from this, the DFA said all visa-free privileges including those based on visa waiver agreements, those under Executive Order 408 series 1960, as well as holders of Hong Kong and Macau passports, Macau-Portuguese passports, and British National Overseas passports would likewise be temporarily suspended beginning Sunday, March 22.
Holders of visas issued by Philippine Foreign Service Posts such as tourists visas will not be allowed entry into the country starting March 22.
The DFA said the ban is based on Presidential Proclamation No. 922, dated March 8, 2020, declaring a ""State of Public Health Emergency"" throughout the Philippines; and Proclamation No. 929, dated March 16, 2020, declaring a ""State of Calamity"" throughout the Philippines due to the coronavirus disease. 
Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr likewise gave assurances foreign tourists stranded in the Philippines will be ""deemed to have their visas extended"" and will not face penalties when departing the country.  
 If this inconveniences foreign nationals, we will ease the way for them. This is not a time to teach people lessons, force them to depend on themselves; but for us to help. Teaching lessons is for teachers—not officials. It is not that we're paid to help but helping is duty. https://t.co/kl0GqUU60V— Teddy Locsin Jr. (@teddyboylocsin) March 19, 2020 
Who else is exempted: Aside from foreigners in the country, foreign spouses and children of Filipinos were exempted from the temporary suspension.
Holders of visas earlier issued to accredited foreign government and international organization officials, as well as their dependents, will also remain valid. These visas, the DFA added, will be honored when entering the country even after March 22. 
Why this matters. The Philippine government has put in place a series of stringent measures, include sweeping travel restrictions, to quell the spread of the coronavirus in the Philippines, where at least 217 cases and 17 deaths were recorded as of Thursday. 
Stringent social distancing measures – or the practice of increasing the space between people to prevent the spread of disease – were put in place on Tuesday, March 17, after President Rodrigo Duterte put the entire Luzon on lockdown to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus. 
The global death toll due to the virus has surpassed 9,000 while at least 217,000 people were infected across 157 countries. – Rappler.com "

PRESIDENT'S WARNING. President Rodrigo  Duterte holds a meeting with the officials of the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases  in Malacañang on March 19, 2020. Malacañang Photo 
MANILA, Philippines –  President Rodrigo Duterte warned local officials struggling to enforce a Luzon-wide lockdown to follow all the national government’s orders, or risk facing administrative cases. 
Duterte made the apparent show of authority as he warned local government units (LGUs) the national emergency brought by the coronavirus crisis meant ""it is the national government that should call the shots.""
""At this time, let us make ourselves clear that we are not separate from a republic or from each other. There is only one republic here, the Republic of the Philippines, and therefore, you should abide by the directives of the national government when it sets…the directives...for the good of the country,"" Duterte said in briefing past midnight on Friday, March 20.  
""I am ordering all LGUs that are doing this to stand down and to abide by the directives of the IATF, the task force (on coronavirus)…and those issued by the Office of the President,"" he added.  
Duterte issued the call in a recorded statement broadcasted past 1 am on Friday, hours after his spokesperson Salvador Panelo announced it would be aired at around 9 pm.  
The President’s call followed several executive officials’ moves to reject Pasig City Mayor Vico Sotto’s appeal to exempt tricycles from travel restriction placed on public utility vehicles. 
Sotto had earlier allowed tricycles to make ""limited trips"" to move essential workers exempted from the travel ban, and those in need of medical care who do not have their own cars.
Before Duterte made the statement, he also told officials to ensure the flow of food and cargo would go unhampered, as directed by the government’s coronavirus task force. 
What will happen if local officials fail to follow Duterte?  
The President warns: ""If you go beyond the standards that we have set, you are abusing your authority and you know that it can lead to administrative cases or even worse, unless you stop what you are doing,"" Duterte said. 
Duterte ordered both the Department of Justice and Department of the Interior and Local government to closely monitor local officials and file cases against concerned officials. 
""Criminal cases cannot be far behind,"" he said. 
Duterte then reminded LGUs to ensure their actions were ""consistent"" with national directives since ""to do otherwise would sow confusion.""  
""Let our country lead the way in imposing a lockdown strict enough to effectively kill COVID-19, liberal enough so our people will not die of hunger, and orderly enough so that our country will not be driven towards chaos in this difficult time,"" he said.  
Why this matters. The Philippine government has put in place a series of stringent social distancing measures, including ordering over 57 million people to stay home to quell the spread of the coronavirus in the Philippines.  
But on the ground, local governments have been left to figure out how exactly they would be implemented, as guidelines on the lockdown continued to be relayed piecemeal. Among the crucial tasks given to local officials included finding ways to ensure residents were fed and essential workers could be brought to their workplace.  
The Philippines has reported 217 confirmed coronavirus cases, including 8 recoveries and 17 deaths.

,"March 20, 2020",nCov,Cagayan de Oro placed under community quarantine,Bobby Lagsa,"
 
CAGAYAN DE ORO, Philippines – Cagayan de Oro Mayor Oscar Moreno placed the city under community quarantine following the death of two women at the Northern Mindanao Medical Center (NMMC) who were classified by health officials as persons under investigation (PUI) for the novel coronavirus.
The women died within 24 hours after reaching NMMC. The cause of their deaths is severe acure respiratory illness. Doctors managed to get a specimen from only one of the women for COVID-19 testing. The test result was not yet known.
The community quarantine will start Friday, March 20, until further notice.
Moreno signed Executive Order (EO) No. 049-2020 which not only put the city under quarantine status but also urged Misamis Oriental, and the Bukidnon towns of Libona, Baungon, Manolo Fortich, Talakag and Malitbog to be part of an expanded quarantine territory.
On Tuesday, March 17, Moreno ordered the closure of malls, entertainment centers, bars, and other non-essential shops to discourage people from converging together.
Moreno said that placing the city under community quarantine was not an easy decision to make as he would have wanted to put a sense of normalcy even in trying times.
Moreno asked residents of the city to stay home and and only go out for essential travels.
The EO also ordered the unhampered movement of all cargoes within, to and from Cagayan de Oro, subject to random inspection with cargo, before and after delivery.
Reaching out to Misamis Oriental, Bukidnon
Moreno said that he had reached out to Misamis Oriental Governor Vincente Yvegeny Emano, this city's congressmen Rufus Rodriguez and Rolando Uy, Misamis Oriental congressmen Christian Unabia and Juliette Uy, and Bukidnon Governor Jose Maria Zubiri for a harmonized quarantine.
Moreno suggested that they work together in combating the entry of COVID-19 into the region.
He suggested that there should be a ""primary checkpoint"" in Bukidnon and in Magsaysay and Lugait towns in Misamis Oriental.
Magsaysay shares borders with Agusan del Norte in Caraga, while Lugait shares borders with Iligan City in Lanao del Norte.
Moreno suggested that those coming from the primary checkpoints be provided with travel pass after having gone through thermal scanning and travel routes.
Unifying local governments' actions will save on resources and manpower, Moreno said.
Moreno said that if Cagayan de Oro and its neighboring towns establish separate checkpoints on their respective side of the border, it will be a waste of resources.
""And then every LGU will behave like we are a separate world. And that's a nightmare,"" Moreno said.
""Of course, towns can set up their own checkpoints, but we cannot have checkpoints in every town, there are 24 towns in Misamis Oriental, do we have to need 50 checkpoints?"" Moreno asked.
Moreno said that the Philippine National Police and the 4th Infantry Division of the Philippine Army agreed to the suggestion, having learned from the experiences of the security forces in Metro Manila.
Misamis Oriental Governor Emano said that he will work with the city government in whatever capacity it needed. 
Emano also placed Misamis Oriental under community quarantine on Thursday afternoon, March 19.
""I am ready and willing to work with anybody. This is beyond politics now,"" Emano said.
Moreno and Emano have been at odds with each other since Moreno unseated Emano's father, Vicente Emano, in 2013.
Rodriguez said that with the huge crisis the country is facing, he is doing everything and constantly coordinating with local and national leaders to address the concerns of the people in this city.
""On the call of Mayor Oscar Moreno, I am fully supportive of all the initiatives of the LGUs to collectively address the problem,"" Rodriguez said in a statement.
""In this most trying times, we have to work as one. I'm humbly asking everyone to follow the government in all its mandates,"" he added.
Moreno said that he and Bukidnon Governor Jose Maria Zubiri talked over the phone and that Zubiri will go through with his proposal.
Moreno said staying at home is still one of the best ways to prevent the spread of COVID-19.
As of Thursday, the Philippines has 217 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus, with 8 recoveries and 17 deaths. 
The global death toll, meanwhile, has reached 9,020, with 3,245 of the fatalities in China (excluding Hong Kong and Macau). The number of cases worldwide has risen to 217,510, with 80,928 of the infections in China. The virus has spread to at least 157 countries. – Rappler.com "

SINGAPORE – Singapore confirmed 6 more cases of the novel coronavirus involving travelers who recently visited the Philippines, as the city-state tightens its borders to stop the importation of COVID-19 from other countries.
The 6 cases involving Philippine travelers were included in the bulletins of Singapore's Ministry of Health (MOH) on Wednesday and Thursday, March 18 and 19. They include 5 Singaporeans and one Filipino.
Another Filipino tested positive for COVID-19 on Thursday, but his recent travel history was to the United Kingdom.
This brings to 13 the number of Filipinos in Singapore who have tested for COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. Other Filipinos with COVID-19 in Singapore include a preschool teaching staff member, and two domestic workers who work under the same employer who also contracted the disease.
Singapore has had 345 cases of COVID-19 as of Thursday evening. Of this number, 124 have recovered and have been discharged from the hospital, most of the others are stable or improving, and 15 are in critical condition in the intensive care unit. Singapore has recorded zero deaths due to COVID-19.

Singapore noted that in the earlier part of the week, around 70% of its new COVID-19 cases were imported, involving Singapore residents and long-term pass holders who returned to Singapore after traveling abroad.
To stop this trend of imported cases, Singapore advised Singaporeans to defer all trips abroad, in contrast to earlier advisories to defer only non-essential travel.
On top of this, starting 11:59 pm on Friday, March 20, all Singaporeans, permanent residents, long-term pass holders, and short-term visitors entering Singapore will have to stay home for 14 days upon entry. Violators of this stay-home notice face prosecution under Singapore laws, or revocation of their work or reentry permits. – Rappler.com "

Since the outbreak began, at least 127 Filipinos outside the Philippines have contracted the virus. Below is the breakdown:

Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan - 80
Grand Princess cruise ship in California - 19
Singapore - 11
Hong Kong - 5
United Arab Emirates - 5
Lebanon - 2
France - 1

Of the 127 Filipinos abroad, at least 83 have recovered: 77 from the cruise ship in Japan, 3 in Hong Kong, 2 in Singapore, and 1 in France.
The World Health Organization on March 11 called the new coronavirus outbreak a pandemic and warned that the spread and severity of the illness was due to ""alarming levels of inaction.""
As of Thursday, the number of novel coronavirus cases globally is at 217,510 with 9,020 deaths, across 157 countries and territories. – with reports from Agence France-Presse/Rappler.com "

DAVAO CITY – Mayor Sara Duterte on Thursday, March 19, ordered the management of malls in the city to temporarily close down, except for their occupants which are supermarkets, pharmacies, in-house department stores, medical and dental offices.
The move of the city was part of the aggressive measures taken to curb the spread of the coronavirus disease.
Also part of the latest stringent directive was the shutting down of mixed-use buildings in the city starting 11:59 pm Thursday. (READ: Davao City under community quarantine)
However, the mayor clarified that public markets are not covered by the closure order and would continue to operate.
Duterte also ordered the shutting of all entertainment facilities such as internet and gaming shops, carnivals, movie houses, spas, beauty and massage parlors, starting 5 pm Thursday. 
She said that the two new orders, numbered 15 and 16, only closed certain establishments because she could not afford to order a total closure because people would have nowhere to run to for their supplies.

“I asked our doctors if we shut the city down for two weeks, will we be ok already? They said they could not give a definite answer. Then I asked if we do it for one month, will we address COVID-19? They gave me the same answer,” she said over the city-run Davao City Disaster Radio (DCDR).
“We cannot afford a total shutdown,” Sara added.
She said in the case of markets, the protocol on safety should be followed, such as the wearing of masks.
Sara also clarified that public transportation had not been halted in the city and that taxis and public utility jeepneys should continue to ply their routes.
(READ: Sara Duterte says no more localized quarantines as Davao Region lockdown begins)
“We are paying them to drive so they should not stop,” she said.
The city government and the Department of Labor and Employment teamed up for the implementation of the Tulong Panghanapbuhay sa Ating Disadvantaged/Displaced Workers (Tupad) program, under which, drivers will be given a monthly subsidy of about P10,000.
Meanwhile, the mayor also urged the public to listen to DCDR instead of calling the Central 911 for Covid information.
“Every time you call 911 to ask for information, you put other emergencies at risk of being delayed,” she added. – Rappler.com

MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – Pasig City is quite known for its motel strip, and the local government is taking advantage of this by using one of the establishments as a quarantine area for people being monitored for the novel coronavirus.
""Dahlia Hotel Pasig has now been converted into a quarantine facility,"" Pasig City Mayor Vico Sotto tweeted on Thursday evening, March 19. (READ: #ProtectVico trends as netizens defend Pasig mayor's coronavirus measures)
The motel will serve as an isolation area for persons under monitoring (PUMs) and persons under investigation (PUIs) for COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.
""Ayon sa mga eksperto, mataas ang tsansa na dadami pa ang kaso ng COVID-19. Kailangan handa tayo (According to experts, chances are high that cases of COVID-19 will still multiply. We should be prepared),"" Sotto said.
""Strict supervised 14-day quarantines of PUMs and PUIs with mild to moderate symptoms is one way we can minimize the community risk,"" he added.
Dahlia Hotel can accommodate at least 300 people at once, and the local government will only pay for water and electricity consumption for its use, Sotto said, thanking the establishment's owners for lending it to the city.
""The mayor's office discussed this on Monday, did all the necessary preparations on Tuesday, and had the facility occupied by Wednesday morning. Health personnel are present to supervise the quarantine. All needs are covered, including toys and house parents to ensure the welfare of children,"" said Ron Angeles of the city's Public Information Office.
The city government is preparing a similar facility for the same purpose, Angeles added.

The Department of Health (DOH) classifies people who possibly contracted the virus as either a PUM or PUI.
A PUI is someone who has two or all of the following: 

History of travel in the past 14 days to countries with local transmissions and risk of importation of the virus
History of exposure to a confirmed case
Symptoms of respiratory illness (cough and/or colds) and/or fever

Meanwhile, a PUM is someone who has a history of travel to a virus-hit country or exposure to a coronavirus patient.
Health Secretary Francisco Duque III himself became a PUM on Thursday, after he was exposed 3 times to a senior DOH official who has since tested positive for the virus.
As of Thursday, the Philippines has had 217 confirmed cases of COVID-19, 17 deaths, and 8 recoveries.
Across the globe, more than 217,000 people have contracted the disease, and over 9,000 have died of it. The virus has reached 157 countries. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – Outside Metro Manila provinces, cities, and towns are doubling efforts against the coronavirus despite zero or low number of confirmed cases in their areas, reflecting fears that some cases are undetected because of the shortage of test kits in the country.
In the isolated Mindoro island, a village in Calapan City, Mindoro Oriental, was placed under ""strict quarantine"" following the the death of an elderly woman from respiratory failure. She was not tested and no specimen was taken. 
“Although she was not a confirmed COVID-19-positive patient, we consider her a highly suspicious PUI (person under investigation),” Calapan City Mayor Arnan Panaligan said in a Facebook post.
The Department of Health (DOH) has not reported a confirmed case in the island of 1.3 million people, but there are fears the elderly woman's grandchild, who returned from Manila with fever, might have been a carrier of the disease. 
In Lanao del Sur in Mindanao, government workers did not take their chances when a person under investigation for coronavirus died at the Amai Pakpak Medical Center in Marawi City. They gave the victim a proper Muslim burial, but treated the body like it was positive for coronavirus. They wore hazmat suits and skipped the full washing and ablution of the cadaver as normally required in Islamic rites.
It turned out, they were right having done that. The DOH belatedly confirmed that the victim tested positive, the first in Lanao del Sur. The entire province with over 1 million population has been placed under community quarantine. 
'Good to close borders early'
PROACTIVE MEASURES. Police checkpoints along San Juanico Bridge in Leyte show government commitment against coronavirus despite zero confirmed case in the province. Photo by Jazmin Bonifacio/Rappler 
Everybody has to play it smart, said Edsel Salvana, director of the University of the Philippines Institute of Molecular Biology. He welcomed moves to put more areas around the country in lockdown regardless of the number of confirmed cases.
""It's a good move because if you see one and don't know where it came from, it's better to be safe than sorry. At the same time, there will be more potentially infected people coming from outside, so you can try to prevent that by closing [the borders] early,"" Salvana told Rappler.
Cebu province, with one confirmed case, was placed under community quarantine, which orders its almost 3 million population to observe social distancing in public transport. The measure includes the closure of internet cafés and cancellation of social gatherings and sports activities.
Cebu Governor Gwendolyn Garcia said the province must do what Metro Manila failed to do in the beginning. She appealed to her constituents to follow orders to stay at home, warning that the province will not have enough facilities if the situation escalates. 
""This virus can be overcome, but only if there is a minimum of movement,"" Garcia said. 
She said the provincial government would be aggressive in tracing the contacts of the first confirmed case in Mandaue City and would reveal the identity of the victim to the media so that suspected contacts could immediately go into quarantine.
The entire Davao region, also with one confirmed case, has closed its borders but provided several exemptions to allow business to continue. The region is home to almost 5 million people.
Leyte has no confirmed case but has 10 persons under investigation for the disease. Governor Leopoldo Dominico Petilla has placed its population of 1.7 million under a month-long ""general community quarantine."" All borders, ports, and boundaries of Leyte will be monitored, and non-residents will be denied entry. Health workers and other frontliners will be exempted while cargo vehicles bringing in essential goods and supplies will be allowed. 
The province that suffered Super Typhoon Yolanda in 2013 is hoping to be spared. ""We have gone through a lot. [We had] Yolanda. [We had] earthquake. But we have never been in a situation like now, wherein we need to contain within our inner selves and we make amend with ourselves also. The only way to survive is to discipline ourselves,"" said Vice Governor Carlo Loreto.
More tests urgent

Still, local officials are demanding more tests to be conducted, especially as the number of persons under investigation (PUIs) and persons under monitoring (PUMs) for coronavirus symptoms has been increasing.
The recent death of 3 persons under investigation in Davao region has caused some panic. Their specimens were sent to the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) in Manila but results have yet to be released as of this posting. 
Without enough tests, many local government units are fighting blindly against coronavirus. It is urgent in the Bangsamoro region, said Interior Minister Naguib Sinarimbo. 
""There is a growing fear that the virus may have spread widely undetected, given that some significant cases are linked to BARMM (Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao),"" he said.
Sinarimbo said they had made the appeal to the DOH. There are concerns that the couple from Rizal, the country's first cases of local transmission, who died from coronavirus might have infected relatives from Lanao del Sur. The Bangsamoro region is also racing to trace 215 participants of a Malaysian gathering linked to clusters of cases abroad.
""Now we also have an evolving frontline in the island provinces of returning residents from Sabah, Malaysia, who may also be carriers of the the virus. So we need to have the test conducted to as many as possible for our PUIs so that plans and policies may also be solidly anchored on facts and not just fear,"" Sinarimbo said. 
Salvana said it's hard to say how many undetected cases the country has. ""Hopefully it's not many since we intervened early,"" he said.
The RITM, until recently the only center that could conduct tests, can perform 450 every day. The 4 new laboratories in the Philippines just approved by the World Health Organization have 100 test kits each for now. – with a report from Jazmin Bonifacio "

MANILA, Philippines – Rank-and-file employees thanked Jollibee Foods Corporation (JFC) for providing some P1 billion in advanced one-month salary and 13th month pay for 90,000 employees affected by the Luzon-wide lockdown amid the coronavirus pandemic.
Jollibee chief executive officer Ernesto Tanmantiong released the emergency response fund to cover all work teams, as well as partner employers in stores.
""We were very surprised to receive such memorandum from our boss. We were already at a very low morale due to the uncertainty of a one-month suspension of work when the news showed up at our email inbox. This will definitely free us from such anxiety and would enable us to tide things over. Thank you Jollibee, "" said Arthur Juego, president of Kilusan sa Jollibee Foods Corporation-Trade Union Congress of the Philippines.
Employees will continue to receive their full salary for the duration of the lockdown. The lockdown for Metro Manila is until April 14, while for Luzon, it is until April 12.
Affected employees can also convert their leave credits in advance and may file for personal leaves when necessary until the situation normalizes.
“We know that this is a very unsettling time for everyone, but let me assure you that we are doing all we can in JFC to help you and your families and our customers during this period,” Tanmantiong said.
Unions thank big businesses
The Associated Labor Unions (ALU) also commended mall operators SM Supermalls and Robinsons Malls for waiving the rental fees of mall tenants from March 16 to April 14 to enable small businesses to pay in advance the salaries and 13th month pay of affected employees.
The labor group also hailed business tycoon Manny Pangilinan for releasing in advance the 13th month pay for employees of PLDT, Smart, and Manila Electric Company.
Other companies which advanced the salaries and 13th month pay of their employees are the Aboitiz Group, Asian Terminals, JG Summit Holdings, Lucio Tan Group of Companies, and Ramon Ang's San Miguel Corporation.
""The gesture promotes unity and reinforces Filipino bayanihan (unity) during these distressful times for workers and families. We urge other companies, big or small, to do the same, to help the workers and their families during these times,"" said Gerard Seno, executive vice president of ALU. 
With their salaries and benefits assured, workers said they will be able to comply with the mandatory home quarantine policy and minimize the spread of the virus. – Rappler.com "

Bela is one of many celebrities who have mobilized to help the poor after a lockdown on Luzon.
President Rodrigo Duterte announced Tuesday that he was placing the country in a state of calamity for 6 months because of the threat of the novel coronavirus. The entire Luzon is on lockdown, as part of the national government's strategy to minimize its spread. The ""enchanced community quarantine"" over Luzon stays in place until April 12.
Bela began the drive with a tweet on March 15, hours before a Metro Manila ""enhanced community quarantine"" began. She went on to raise over P3 million even as the quarantine expanded to the whole of Luzon. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – The New Bilibid Prison (NBP) and the rest of the 6 penal colonies  in the country are free of the novel coronavirus, the Bureau of Corrections (BuCor) said.
""So far we have no PUIs. BuCor remains Covid19 free and we hope and pray to stay that way."" said BuCor spokesperson Gabriel Chaglag on Thursday, March 19.
PUIs are individuals who have two or all of the following: 

History of travel in the past 14 days to countries with local transmission and risk of importation of the virus
History of exposure with a confirmed case
Has symptoms of respiratory illness (cough and/or colds) and/or fever

PUIs are only tested by the Department of Health (DOH) if they experience severe manifestations of symptoms.
The other category is Person Under Monitoring (PUM) – or a person who have a travel history and history of exposure to a coronavirus patient. 
On theory, inmates are less likely to be PUMs because of their restricted mobility, unless they are exposed to jail officers who might be carriers.
Visitations have been suspended.
BuCor Chief Gerald Bantag led the disinfection of Bilibid on Thursday, and said they have procured N95 masks, gloves, disposable ponchos, and alcohol.
""Sa kabila ng kakulangan ng supply sa merkado. Hindi po tayo tumitigil sa paghahanap ng resources para mapunuan at makumpleto ang kailangang proteksyon ng mga (Persons Deprived of Liberty) PDL,"" said Bantag.
(Despite the shortage of supply, we are not going to stop looking for resources to make sure PDLs get complete protection.)
The New Bilibid Prison can hold only 6,435 inmates. As of October 2019, it kept 30,426, translating to a 337% congestion rate. 
At least 4 returnees have died in harrowing conditions inside the Minimum Security Compound because of overcapacity since the Duterte government hauled back to jail heinous crime convicts because of the Good Conduct Time Allowance (GCTA) scandal.
As for the detention facilities under the Bureau of Jail Management and Penology (BJMP) – meaning the jails of those not yet convicted, Interior Secretary Eduardo Año rejected calls to release low-level offenders saying they are ""safer inside.""

 Hi everyone! Given the difficult situation we are all facing, I thought of starting the DoNation drive today. This is to help the employees who are not allowed to work because of the community lockdown. Please take some time to read. :)https://t.co/IqlUgc5vsv— Maine Mendoza (@mainedcm) March 19, 2020 
On the website's details, Maine said she'll be donating P 1,000 per household for groceries and basic necessities for employees affected by the ""enhanced community quarantine."" 
""This also leads me to the realization that we can all help, in our own little ways, to at least make things easier to those who need it the most. If you want to play a part, you can spare a little amount from your pockets that will surely go to those in need. Our share, no matter how big or small, will go a long way,"" she wrote.
Those who need help can send an email along with proof of employment and a cellphone number where the money will can be coursed through.
""I will personally facilitate all the donations and I will TRY my best to accommodate as many people as I can. I will also provide proof of transactions to the donors for transparency purposes if they wish. Again, your share, no matter how big or small, will surely go a long way. Let’s DO this!"" Maine said.
Maine is the latest celebrity to help those affected by the lockdown. Actress Bela Padilla and comedian Pokwang have raised funds for street vendors and given food to frontliners of the lockdown, respectively. – Rappler.com "

FREE RIDES. The Department of Transportation launches a free shuttle service for health workers. Photo from DOTr 
MANILA, Philippines – With mass transportation suspended in Luzon, government agencies arranged free shuttles for health workers and overseas Filipino workers.
President Rodrigo Duterte on Monday, March 16, imposed a total lockdown in the entire island of Luzon, in a bid to stop the spread of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
On the morning of the Luzon-wide lockdown, some health workers, frontliners, and OFWs were either left stranded or forced to walk because of the absence of public transportation.
Malacañang ordered agencies to provide free shuttles to transport health workers and OFWs on Wednesday, March 18. See the list below:

SEASON SUSPENDED. PBA commissioner Willie Marcial says the safety of the players, staff, and fans is their top priority amid the coronavirus outbreak. File photo from PBA Images 
MANILA, Philippines – Suspending the season due to the coronavirus has taken its toll on the PBA as the league continues to suffer financial losses. 
It has been more than a week since the PBA canceled its games and commissioner Willie Marcial said he expects the season to be shelved for at least two months before players return to the hardcourt.
""Overall, we will lose a lot of money. Millions,"" Marcial told Rappler in a mix of Filipino and English through a phone call. 
Despite not delving into the exact numbers, Marcial said all departments – from advertisements to ticket sales – are affected. 
""It's a domino effect. It's not just one aspect. Everything took a hit."" 
But for Marcial and the rest of the PBA, losing millions is a sacrifice they have to make to ensure the safety of their players, staff, and fans. 
""Even if you earn big, if there's one person who gets infected, it's not worth it. We're not about what the league will lose, what's important is we're all safe."" 
""By God's grace, I haven't heard someone from the PBA family who has contracted the virus. That's what I've been praying – that no one from the PBA family and our fans gets infected,"" Marcial said. 
With the number of coronavirus cases in the country rising to over 200, the two-week ban on team practices, which will end on March 27, could be extended. 
""We might not allow teams to practice [after March 27] so we'll see in the coming days what move we're going to make,"" Marcial said.  – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – Netizens rallied behind Pasig City mayor Vico Sotto after administration officials and supporters blasted him for allowing tricycle drivers to operate while Luzon was on lockdown.
On Thursday, March 19, the Twitter hashtag #ProtectVico trended and has since garnered almost 33,000 tweets, mostly in support of Sotto who has led numerous “pro-people” initiatives in Pasig City.
A day after the start of the Luzon lockdown, Sotto urged national government to allow tricycles to continue operations, citing health workers and people in need of medical attention, for example, who have no cars and could not all be accommodated in the local government-provided shuttles.  (READ: Vico Sotto urges nat'l gov't to allow tricycles during coronavirus lockdown)
On Wednesday, March 18, Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles rejected Sotto’s appeal, saying that he could not see how social distancing can be practiced in a tricycle. (READ: Pasig to comply with ban on tricycles during coronavirus lockdown)
Interior undersecretary Jonathan Malaya also said on Thursday that Sotto should just be more creative in dealing with the transportation problem.
This did not sit well with netizens who pointed out that allowing tricycles on the streets was actually based on a risk assessment study conducted by the city’s local government.
We're using our vehicles but it's NOT enough. Our risk assessment shows that we cant ban tricycles at this point.Health workers need to get to work. Some emergencies can only be reached by tryk.For now, I am allowing tricycles to operate w/in Pasig. TORO will issue guidelines— Vico Sotto (@VicoSotto) March 17, 2020
Noli de Castro's analysis is too simplistic: ""National government says bawal, therefore that's right."" Vico Sotto is on the ground in Pasig. He knows what people need. Kabayan has wrong priorities. It's not just about the letter of the rules. It's about saving people!— Kip Oebanda (@kipoebanda) March 18, 2020

Actress and comedian Ethel Booba, who has since gained a formidable online following from her comical way of criticizing the government, also chimed in on the conversation and pointed out an obvious way to address the supposed social distancing concern in tricycles. 
 Put plastic cover between side car and motorcycle. Make sure na may suot na mask ang pasahero at driver. Dapat one passenger allow lang sa side car at bawal ang pasahero sa likod ng driver. Pwede pa din naman ang social distancing sa tricycle. Charot!— Ethel Booba (@IamEthylGabison) March 19, 2020 
Even pro-administration blogger and Overseas Workers Welfare Administration deputy executive director Mocha Uson got involved and insinuated that Sotto was just being childish and needed to heed the national government’s commands – a comment which drew flak online. Uson clarified later, that what was posted on her blog was not her opinion and was posted by another admin of her page.

Netizens immediately defended the popular Pasig City mayor, with many posting memes from the film Four Sisters and a Wedding where Sotto’s mom Coney Reyes and Uson starred together.

Some netizens also pointed out that Sotto’s clear-headed and empathetic way of handling the coronavirus threat is supposed to be the standard for any political leader, but Filipinos have just grown accustomed to their leaders’ incompetence. 
In the wake of the coronavirus outbreak, the Pasig City government led various initiatives to help workers cope with the community Luzon lockdown such as the early release of salaries for local government employees and the setting up of mobile kitchens for frontline workers.
Sotto also put up “sanitation tents” in key public areas. The city government also procured 3 drones to be used for aerial spraying of disinfectants.
Netizens pointed out that Pasig City's example is something that local governments can replicate and enforce in their areas. They also discussed how local leaders are rising to the occassion, as the country grapples with impact of the coronavirus.

It's not just luck. The people of Pasig chose better governance. They voted for reform and decided to do away with traditional politics.

MANILA, Philippines – Billionaire Ramon Ang, through San Miguel Corporation, delivered food and rubbing alcohol to frontliners and Metro Manila residents amid the spread of the novel coronavirus.
San Miguel started delivering free rubbing alcohol after it used a Ginebra San Miguel facility to produce 70% alcohol, following a shortage of disinfectants and sanitizers.
Bulk of the supply will be channeled through the Department of Health.
San Miguel also started food donations like nutri-bun bread to local government units in Metro Manila to feed severely affected communities during the total lockdown.
Ang was praised by President Rodrigo Duterte for assuring the public that San Miguel's supply chain has enough inventory to feed Filipinos for the next several months.

MANILA, Philippines – A Filipino worker in Macau tested positive for the novel coronavirus, making him the 15th person to contract the disease in the city, Macau’s government confirmed.
The 31-year-old male is a registered non-resident restaurant worker in a casino property, according to a government advisory on Wednesday, March 18. He was admitted at the Conde S. Januário Hospital.
The advisory also showed that he travelled to the Philippines from January 27 to March 15 to visit his family. He returned to Macau on March 16 through the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge.  
A day after, the Filipino went to the Kiang Wu Hospital after suffering toothache, fever, and a rash. He was classified at the hospital as a person with “moderate risk of COVID-19 infection.” 
The worker was sent back to his residence after he received treatment and got tested for coronavirus. The samples examined at the Macau Public Health Clinical Centre later showed that he was positive. 
The Macau government said the Municipal Affairs Bureau directed a cleaning team to disinfect public areas in the worker’s residence. The government will also reach out to his close contacts in Macau.
He is the 127th Filipino outside the country to contract the disease. The breakdown is below:

Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan - 80
Grand Princess cruise ship in California - 19
Singapore - 11
Hong Kong - 5
United Arab Emirates - 5
Lebanon - 2
France - 1

Of the 126 Filipinos, at least 83 have recovered – 77 from the cruise ship in Japan, 3 in Hong Kong, 2 in Singapore, and 1 in France. 
In the Philippines, there are 217 confirmed coronavirus cases, including 8 recoveries and 17 deaths.

MANILA, Philippines – The Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) said on Thursday, March 19, that granting Pasig's request to exempt the city's tricyles from the ban would defeat the purpose of the island-wide lockdown to contain the novel coronavirus. 
It will also encourage other citiies in the National Capital Region to ask for their own exemptions, said DILG Undersectary Jonathan Malaya during the Laging Handa briefing on the crisis. 
President Rodrigo Duterte has placed Metro Manila first, then the entire Luzon, in a month-long lockdown in response to the rising cases of coronavirus infection in the country, and the measure includes banning all forms of public transportation. 
Mayor Vico Sotto of Pasig City had appealed for the exemption of tricycles to move workers and residents who have medical emergencies, saying the local government's risk assessment showed that thousands of workers and patients wouldn't be able to move without the tricyles, which could ply the narrow streets in the city.
But Malaya said: ""If we give an exemption, it will defeat the entire purpose of the quarantine. 'Wag na lang po tayo mag-quarantine kung gano'n (Let's not impose a quarantine if that's the case). 
Malaya said riding in tricyles would place the passengers and drivers at a risk of catching the virus.
""Let me emphasize na ang mass transpotation po talaga ay bawal 'pag may quarantine. Dahil mass transportation ang nagdadala ng virus paikot at palayo sa mas maraming tao,"" Malaya said. (Let me emphasize that mass transportation is banned when there is quarantine. Because it's mass transportation that spreads the virus to more people.)
Netizens were quick to show that Malaya's assumption was wrong, with a number of them posting illustrations of how, if a tricycle carries only one passenger, a safe distance between him and the driver can be maintained. (READ: #ProtectVico trends as netizens defend Pasig mayor's coronavirus measures) 
One such netizen was Jeannie Maraya, a senior high school teacher at Manila Tytana Colleges. Her illustration includes an improvised plastic cover between the tricycle driver and passenger, as well as a place inside the tricycle car for the passenger to place his payment instead of handing it to th driver.  
This a simple illustration I just made. Please help me share it so that others (govt) will see why it's practical. This is my simple contribution to Mayor Vico. This is the most practical way to show them it's feasible thru tricycle. Thank you. I have included details as well. pic.twitter.com/02QByEdoMJ— jininabottle (@JiniMaraya) March 19, 2020
""Transportation of our frontliners is feasible without compromising social distancing,"" she wrote.
DILG's Malaya said that, if other local government units in Metro Manila were able to provide vehicles for their health workers, he ""couldn't understand"" why Pasig City had to seek for such exemption. Malaya then appealed to Sotto to ""just follow"" the guidelines of the IATF. 
""I appeal to Mayor Vico, suportahan 'nyo na lang po ang ating ginagawa. Mag-provide po ng mga sasakyan...gaya ng ginagawa ng ibang local government units,"" he said on Thursday. (I appeal to Mayor Vico to just support what we are doing. Provide vehicles...like what other local government units are doing.)
Contrary to Malaya's statement, Pasig City had started fielding its buses and its bicycles, free of use, for its health workers – even before some local government units in Metro Manila did so. Some private groups have also lent buses and vans to the city.
He set aside Sotto's explanation that there are residents who live in areas with narrow streets that only tricyles could ply or they would walk long distances.
“Pa’no po ang mangyayari kung hindi makasakay ang mga health workers at libo-libong mga pasyente na nangangailangan ng treatment? Palalakarin ba talaga natin ng 5 kilometro and isang dialysis patient na senior citizen? Ang cancer patient na bagong opera?” Sotto said when he asked for an exemption. 
 (What will happen if health workers and the thousands of patients who need treatment don’t get a ride? Are we really going to ask a dialysis patient – a senior citizen at that – to wak 5 kilometers? And ask the same for a cancer patient who has just undergone an operation?)
 
On Thursday, Sotto said he would comply with the tricycle ban, even if it meant thousands would be left unserved in emergency situations.
Malacañang had also rejected Sotto's appeal Wednesday night, March 19, saying that they couldn't see how social distancing can be implemented inside the tricycle.
Pasig City has a population of over 750,000 people, as of the 2015 census. There are 40 public health centers and 3 public hospitals in the city. – with a report from Gaby Baizas/Rappler.com "

ECONOMY. Consumers line up at a supermarket in Mandaluyong City. Photo by Jire Carreon/Rappler 
MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) Monetary Board trimmed key interest rates by 50 basis points, bringing the reverse repurchase facility to just 3.25% as the coronavirus pandemic triggers an economic slowdown.
Interest rates on the overnight lending and deposit facilities were reduced to 3.75% and 2.75%, respectively.
""[T]he Monetary Board decided that there is a need for a follow-on monetary policy response to address the adverse spillovers associated with the ongoing pandemic,"" said the BSP.
""With a manageable inflation environment and stable inflation expectations, the Monetary Board sees enough policy space for an assertive reduction in the policy rate at this juncture to cushion the country's growth momentum and uplift market confidence amid stronger headwinds.""
Easing the interest rate generally lowers borrowing costs for consumers and would lead to people spending more. (READ: FAST FACTS: What does the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas do?)
More spending means higher demand for goods, which in turn boosts the economy over time.
The central bank has also relaxed regulations on reserve requirements and single borrowers limits to combat possible liquidity issues.
Economic growth remains dim, as the Luzon-wide lockdown is disrupting various supply chains.
Bank of the Philippine Islands chief economist Jun Neri welcomed the lowering of interest rates, but noted that fiscal stimulus should go along with it.
""More importantly, this has to be complemented by a massive fiscal stimulus that will target key sectors and industries including health, travel, tourism, but most especially the families that depend on daily wages. Most banks may need increased access to the BSP's rediscounting facility. And, in turn, keep credit lines open for their client,"" Neri said.
ING Bank Manila senior economist Nicholas Mapa also warned that the lower rates would ""do little to ignite loan demand"" as people's movements are restricted and they won't be able to spend much.
""With the central bank moving aggressively, we now await additional action on the fiscal front with the government rolling out a mere COVID-19 fiscal stimulus package worth [P]27 billion, roughly 0.1% of GDP (gross domestic product),"" Mapa said.

Pangasinan Provincial Health Officer Dr Anna Marie De Guzman said that the woman was earlier brought to a private hospital in Urdaneta but when she manifested classic COVID-19 symptoms like incessant coughing, fever, and tightness of chest, she was transferred to the Region 1 Medical Center in Dagupan.
Barely a day after staying at the Dagupan hospital, however, she died. 
The woman was immediately cremated according to her and her relatives’ wishes.
Pangasinan still has no positive coronavirus case.
Earlier in March, a woman who had attended a school reunion in Lingayen, Pangasinan, tested positive for the coronavirus disease when she returned to Australia. 
As of Wednesday, there are 24 PUIs in the province,  half of whom have been discharged while the rest were in different hospitals in the province.
There are also 43,950 residents who are considered persons under monitoring and 732 already finished their 14-day self-quarantine. 
Nationwide, there were 217 confirmed cases, 17 deaths, and 8 recoveries. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – As the number of coronavirus infections in the country continue to rise, many rush to pharmacies and drug stores, depleting stocks of face masks and alcohol to guard against disease.
In some parts of the Philippines, the growing scarcity of face masks has affected even frontliners in the health sector, who have no stocks of their own to use during their shifts. But Filipinos, ever resourceful, have found ways to keep safe amid the pandemic. (READ: Filipino bayanihan spirit shines through amid coronavirus outbreak)
In a Facebook post on Sunday, March 15, post-grad intern Rhona MacEachen shared how there were no more stocks of face masks available at the West Visayas State University Medical Center (Don Benito) in Iloilo City for frontliners. She added how some might be forced to wear washable face masks instead.
The scarcity has pushed doctors and health frontliners in West Visayas State University Medical Center and other Iloilo public hospitals to make improvised reusable face shields from acetate plastic sheets and elastic bands.
Hoping to help frontliners who might be exposed to patients with the coronavirus disease, MacEachen and her fellow post-grad interns at West Visayas State University called for donations to make more of these improvised face shields.
As of March 17, they were able to gather funds to purchase materials good for around 550 pieces to be made into face shields by post-grad interns at West Visayas State University and from Capiz.
“We are all overwhelmed by your support...We will be sharing these blessings to hospitals and doctors all across Iloilo and possibly the nation! We will try to extend our products to washable masks, gloves, and vitamins for our frontliners! We in the medical field have hearts full of love from all of you,” MacEachen said.

 
Meanwhile, UP Visayas students, who were left stranded due to the community quarantine imposed in their area, are making improvised face shields for health professionals in Iloilo.
With funds and materials from a private hospital and the Philippine College of Physicians Visayas Chapter, the students were able to create more than 100 face shields out of acetate, foam, tape, and a stapler.

 
In the surfing capital of the Visayas, Brandale Balid, a talented board shaper and native Boronganon, repurposed his crafting and design skills into creating cheap personal protective equipment (PPE).
Along with the Surf Riders Club, they're eyeing to produce 100 of these face shields to help fellow Filipinos during this crisis.

 
Businesses like Printfinity Graphics Design and Print Solution are also doing their part in giving face shields to the frontliners.

 
Aside from face masks, other Filipinos explored different ways to protect their fellow kababayan in light of the coronavirus pandemic.
In the municipality of Salcedo, Eastern Samar, local government officials have installed handwashing stations at the entrances of all municipal buildings, wet and dry markets, transport terminals, and other strategic points in the area.
Its local health unit has also constructed a sanitized triage and improvised protective gear using acetate to protect both patients and frontline health personnel from infection.

 
At SSS Legazpi, acetate is also used as improvised plastic barriers to protect against the spread of COVID-19, the coronavirus disease. The chairs are also blocked off to ensure social distancing.

Even in jeepneys, driver Federico Tiozen Jr. has found a way to repurpose old juice boxes to encourage distance between passengers.

Some people have had to resort to extreme measures to keep safe though. This driver used a diaper as a makeshift face mask, and some plastic gloves to get around safely during this pandemic.

 
Face masks are important in containing the spread of COVID-19, which is most commonly spread through respiratory droplets. As those that come into contact with the infected, our frontliners are most in need of face masks. (READ: What you need to know: Coronavirus cures, vaccines being tested)
These improvised equipment, along with the other commercially available personal protective equipment should be discarded properly. 
In an explainer by This Week in Asia, consultant Wong Chen Seong  said that improperly discarded masks have a large amount of secretions and may be a health hazard to others who may come into contact with them.

MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – The Philippines will stop issuing visas to foreigners worldwide to prevent the further spread of the novel coronavirus in the country, Foreign Secretary Teodoro Loscin Jr said on Thursday, March 16. 
Foreigners from at least 100 countries enjoying visa-free privileges will likewise not be able to travel to the Philippines temporarily. 
Locsin said all Philippine visas previously issued to foreigners were likewise deemed canceled. 
Only visas already issued to Filipinos’ foreign spouses and children remained valid. 
The Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) chief said the mode effectively goes “one imperative step forward: a total ban on incoming foreign visitors of all nationalities, no exceptions.""
Locsin made the announcement on Twitter, a day after he suggested the Philippines would halt its visa issuance schemes and floated the possibility of suspending visa free privileges for all countries except those in Southeast Asia.
“Starting today (March 19), all our embassies and consulates will temporarily suspend visa issuance to all foreign nationals as well as the visa-free entry privileges for all foreign nationals” Locsin tweeted on Thursday afternoon. 
“We are stopping the issuance of visas from all posts abroad and here,” Locsin said.
Locsin added outgoing foreign visitors stuck in the Philippines should likewise be given “all the help to get out.” 
How this will take effect: As the DFA is in charge of issuing visas in its foreign posts abroad, visa applications will not be approved during the Luzon lockdown, which lasts from March 17 until April 12. 
 We are stopping the issuance of visas from all posts abroad and here. This goes one imperative step forward: a total ban on incoming foreign visitors of all nationalities no exceptions. Outgoing foreign visitors should be given all the help to get out. Idiotic to detain them. https://t.co/6RuZNIHT02— Teddy Locsin Jr. (@teddyboylocsin) March 19, 2020 
Why this matters. After President Rodrigo Duterte placed an island-wide lockdown on Luzon, stringent travel restrictions were implemented to manage the flow of non-Filipinos coming from countries with a high number of confirmed coronavirus cases. 
The Philippines earlier limited the suspension of visa issuances to foreigners coming from China, Hong Kong, and Macau. Aside from this, the Bureau of Immigration in January 2020, suspended the visa upon arrival (VUA) mechanism for Chinese tourists and businessmen. 
With the new pronouncement, travelers from  at least 100 countries that enjoy visa-free privileges to the Philippines, including the United States and several countries in Europe, will no longer be allowed to enter the Philippines. 
Travel measures in place: Before Thursday's announcement, non-Filipino travelers coming from North Gyeongsang Province, including Daegu City and Cheongdo County in South Korea; as well as Hong Kong, Macau, and mainland China – ground zero of the coronavirus outbreak – were not allowed to enter the country. 
All Filipinos traveling as tourists were also barred from leaving the country during the lockdown. 
As of Thursday, the Philippines has reported 217 confirmed coronavirus cases, including 8 recoveries and 17 deaths.
The global death toll due to the virus has surpassed 7,800 while at least 194,000 people were infected across 150 countries. More than 69,000 have since recovered . – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – The Department of Health (DOH) on Thursday, March 19, confirmed that the Philippines now has 217 cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.
In a statement sent to media, the DOH reported 15 new cases of COVID-19 as of 12 noon Thursday.
The health department also announced that one new patient has recovered from the disease. The patient is a 28-year-old Filipino male from Cavite. He has a travel history from Japan and was admitted to the Research Institute of Tropical Medicine on March 7. He was discharged after testing negative for COVID-19 twice.
The total number of recoveries in the Philippines now stands at 8.
Meanwhile, the total number of fatalities in the country is 17.
On Thursday morning, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III confirmed to Rappler that he is under self-quarantine after being exposed to a senior DOH official who tested positive for COVID-19.
Duque said he was in close contact with the COVID-19 patient for ""about 3 times."" Duque is not showing symptoms, but he is closely monitoring his health because the DOH chief has hypertension and asthma.
""I have no fever, so I'm pretty okay. It's just that of course I'm watching over my hypertension and asthma,"" he added. 
As of Thursday, the DOH said that they have tested 1,172 patients for possible infection.

SAMAR, Philippines – The Calbayog City government ordered the police here to apprehend those who refuse to go on 14-day quarantines even though they have been identified as Persons Under Monitoring (PUM) and Persons Under Investigation (PUI).
PUMs and PUIs resisting the quarantine will be detained in an isolated facility here under strict medical attention, said the orders.
Calbayog City Mayor Ronaldo Aquino said the stringent orders were part of the measures to contain the spread of the dreaded novel coronavirus.
He said the COVID-19 outbreak was a worrying situation that required drastic but necessary measures in order to stop the transmission of the virus. COVID-19 is the sickness caused by the new coronavirus.
The City Health Office confirmed that there were people in the city who are now considered as PUMs and PUIs because of the increase in travellers here following  the lockdown in Manila on Monday, March 16.
Among the recommendations by the city’s Inter-Agency Task Force on COVID-19 now being implemented are:

Any person arriving in the city, whether a resident or non resident should undergo home quarantine;
A curfew is now imposed from 6 pm to 6 am for minors, and 9 pm to 5 am for adults. Adults and parents, or guardian of children caught violating the curfew will be required to render 2 hours of community work as sanction;
Motorboats from Masbate and Cebu are prohibited to dock in Calbayog, except those transporting food products and other basic goods;

CAGAYAN DE ORO CITY, Philippines – Two women being probed for the novel coronavirus disease died on Wednesday, March 18, within 24 hours after that they were brought to the Northern Mindanao Medical Center (NMMC) from different hospitals in the region.
""The women died less than 24 hours after they were brought here,"" NMCC chief Dr Jose Chan announced in a news briefing on Thursday, March 19.
NMMC doctors said the two women had severe acute respiratory Illness, and that they managed to get a specimen from only one of the women for COVID-19 testing. The test result was not yet known.
""We were not able to take sample from the other woman as we only have had hours after she was brought here when she expired,"" Chan said.
He declined to specify where the women came from but said they were from different areas and had no links to previous patients in the NMMC classified as persons under investigation (PUIs).
Chan said that they instructed the families of the deceased to follow the Department of Health guidelines in burying their dead, which is ""preferably by cremation.""
Under the DOH guidelines, COVID-19 patients and suspected cases who died should be buried within 24 hours, the remains should be placed in an airtight container, and there should be no viewing during the wake.
The two women's death happened a day after another PUI – this time, in Marawi City – died ahead of the release of his test result.

SPECIAL SESSION. Senators call for a special session to tackle coronavirus supplemental funds. File photo by Angie de Silva/Rappler 
MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – Senate President Vicente Sotto III is pushing for a special session to approve a supplemental budget, including a food subsidy fund for disadvantaged households, during the one-month total lockdown in Luzon.
The Senate president told reporters on Thursday, March 19, that Malacañang has yet to call for a special session. Sotto's proposal is on top of the P3.1-billion supplemental budget request of the Department of Health (DOH).
""I suggest for Congress to pass a food subsidy budget in order to provide for the daily wage earners who lost their income,"" Sotto said in a statement, adding that he had already discussed his proposal with Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III and an unnamed high-level economist.
Sotto said that while P500 per day per family is the ideal subsidy, he proposed at least P300 per day per family, which would amount to a total of P27 billion for Metro Manila's 3 million poor families. He added that the rate may also vary for regions outside Metro Manila.
""Assuming there are 3 million poorest of the poor in [the National Capital Region], with each family consisting of 5 members, that will be 15 million NCR residents who will be assured that their families will not go hungry while the ECQ (enhanced community quarantine) is in place,"" Sotto said.
While the Senate president agreed that social distancing and working from home is necessary during the lockdown, he said the government should make an exception for a special session.
""Lawmakers should bite the bitter pill in an emergency situation such as this. We need to get on our feet and make sure that our people, especially the poorest of the poor, do not worry about going hungry at a time when they should be focusing their attention on staying healthy,"" Sotto said, adding that Congress can still hold a special session with a skeleton work force.
Senator Panfilo Lacson, meanwhile, is pushing for a monthly subsidy for senior citizens.
Senator Bong Go said he also recommends the holding of a special session for the budget. Go chairs the Senate health committee.
Unlike the House of Representatives, the Senate finance panel did not pass a supplemental budget for the DOH before Congress went on break on March 14. The House committee on appropriations on March 10 already approved a P1.65-billion supplemental budget for DOH.
On Thursday, House Speaker Alan Peter Cayetano said the lower chamber will be ready when the President decides to hold a special session.
""We are willing to have special sessions to come up with a feasible and pragmatic economic package. We can adapt special rules like online voting if necessary, and practice social distancing measures to accommodate all our members, including those who are currently in self-quarantine,"" Cayetano said.
The House Speaker added that he wants to prioritize the passage of a measure which would ""grant more flexibility"" regarding the use of funds to allow quicker disbursement and immediate support for those affected by the lockdown.
""We have started discussions with our colleagues in Congress and the executive [branch] on how to operationalize short- and medium-term economic programs, and reduce bureaucratic procedures to help those who are going to be adversely affected by COVID-19,"" Cayetano said.
President Rodrigo Duterte declared a state of calamity in the Philippines, as coronavirus cases continue to rise. As of Wednesday, March 18, there are 202 patients who have tested positive for COVID-19, 17 of whom have died.

MANILA, Philippines – The Manila City Government and the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) have hired 189 electric tricycle (e-trike) drivers to service health workers during the Luzon lockdown, Mayor Isko Moreno announced Thursday, March 19.
""189 e-trikes will be deployed for frontliners in Manila, may trabaho at may sweldo (with salaries),"" Moreno said during a Facebook live address.
Why does this matter? Public transportation has been restricted since President Rodrigo Duterte declared a lockdown over the entire island region of Luzon, in a drastic effort to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus in the Philippines.
The e-tricycles, according to Manila Public Information Office chief Julius Leonen, will ferry health workers straight to the hospitals they work at in the capital.
Different from Vico Sotto? The collaboration of the local government and Manila is so far different from what Pasig City has been pushing for: allowing tricycles to operate for public use with ""limited trips.""
The policy was criticized by the national government as increasing the possibility of spreading the coronavirus. Sotto later decided to comply fully with the ban, saying that they have other transportation options to provide. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – Government forces warily stand down as rebel leaders declined to reciprocate President Rodrigo Duterte’s declaration of a ceasefire during the nearly month-long lockdown of Luzon over the coronavirus pandemic.
Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana on Thursday, March 19, ordered the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) “to temporarily suspend all offensive combat operations against the CTG (communist terrorist group) but to continue normal law enforcement operations in coordination with the PNP (Philippine National Police) in order to maintain peace and order.”
The government usually refers to the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP), its guerrilla force the New People’s Army (NPA), and its political wing the National Democratic Front of the Philippines (NDF) as the “communist terrorist group.”
The unilateral ceasefire began at midnight on Thursday, and will lapse at midnight on April 15, along with the scheduled end of the lockdown in Metro Manila. The lockdown over the rest of Luzon is set to last only until April 12.
Noting past alleged ceasefire violations by communist guerrillas, Lorenzana reminded the military “to remain vigilant, and ready to defend themselves and the communities in their respective areas of responsibility against those who will take advantage of the nationwide state of calamity to advance their selfish cause.”
“The enemy…has a bloody track record of using the government’s declarations of ceasefire to launch offensives, ambuscades, destruction of government and private property, extortion activities as well as to recover their dwindling numbers and create a false perception that they still have influence and relevance,” Lorenzana said.
Programs to disarm guerrillas and resettle them as civilians are to continue, the defense chief added. The government’s National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict (NTF-ELCAC) offers cash incentives and livelihood packages to entice rebel fighters to defect.
Psywar?
The NDF, meanwhile, has refused to declare its own ceasefire, saying the government’s gesture “is premature, if not insincere and false.”
Unless it receives sufficient assurances from the [government], the NDFP will be inclined to think that the…unilateral ceasefire declaration is not sincere and is not intended to invite reciprocation by the NDFP, but is meant to be a mere psywar (psychological warfare) trick,” NDF’s exiled leader Jose Maria “Joma” Sison said in a statement dated March 18, hours after Duterte officially declared a ceasefire with the NPA.
Sison called the lockdown “militarist,” and said it was meant to intimidate the public and suppress their freedom of movement, including health workers and people seeking testing or treatment for the coronavirus.
Sison also accused the military and police of continuing to “red-tag” activists and human rights defenders.
Since attempts at peace talks bogged down between the Duterte administration and the NDF in November 2017, government forces have clamped down on progressive groups whom they accused of being legal fronts for the CPP-NPA. Some members of such groups reported being harassed or intimidated by the police and military.
‘With a good heart’
After putting Metro Manila on “community quarantine” on Sunday, March 15, Duterte amped up the measure into an “enhanced community quarantine” covering all of Luzon with its more than 57 million people, beginning on Tuesday, March 17.
All modes of public transportation are banned, movement from one locality to another is highly restricted, and only essential businesses are allowed to operate during the lockdown.
Because the police force and the military are on the frontlines of enforcing the lockdown, Duterte on Monday, March 16, urged the communist rebels to go on ceasefire.
“Kindly give me that…. I will repay you with a good heart in the coming days,” the President said.
In December 2019, Duterte made a surprise offer to revive peace talks with the NDF, but so far to no avail. Duterte and Sison could not agree on a venue for negotiations.
Duterte had, from the beginning of his term in June 2016, dangled offers of negotiation with the communists, but he rescinded them when guerrilla attacks allegedly continued against government forces and civilians.
“Promises of Duterte, such as doing a good turn from a good heart, can be believed only as they are realized promptly and according to a definite schedule,” Sison said in his statement on the ceasefire offer. – Rappler.com "

TONDO, Philippines – Mary Grace Aves is terrified of the deadly coronavirus pandemic, but the best weapons to protect her family – isolation and sanitation – are unreachable luxuries in the Manila shantytown they call home.
The same particularly dangerous set of threats loom over hundreds of millions packed into Asia's massive slums, where staying clean is nearly impossible and people have to leave their homes daily to survive.
""It may be possible (to isolate) in other areas because they are rich. They have big spaces,"" said Aves, a mother of 4. ""Here we are crammed.""
""If you run into somebody on the way out of the house you will touch,"" the 23-year-old said from her closet-sized home in Manila's Tondo district.
Asian nations have imposed increasingly heavy measures to fight the contagion, with the Philippines ordering around half of its 110 million people to stay home.
That quarantine includes Manila, but there was no sign of authorities enforcing it in slum areas on Wednesday, March 18. The order was being flouted in many parts of the sprawling metropolis.
Because the virus spreads through droplets that can be picked up with one touch or inhaled from a sick person's sneeze, global health authorities say the best protection is staying home and keeping hands clean.
""But what if you cannot do either of those things?"", asked Annie Wilkinson, a fellow at research group Institute of Development Studies, in an opinion piece.
""There is a real risk that the impacts on the urban poor will be considerably higher than elsewhere,"" she wrote.
East Asia and the Pacific are home to 250 million slum-dwellers, many of them in China, Indonesia and the Philippines, a 2017 World Bank study said.
Homes in these slums are tightly-packed, tiny spaces that are only big enough for sleeping and lack running water.
Cooking, laundry, personal hygiene and leisure are done in common spaces filled with people, which means residents have to be in public in order to survive.
In Aves's settlement, there are no surgical masks, hand sanitizer or sinks, and toilets are buckets emptied directly into the black water of the Estero de Vita river.
The narrow, muddy passages between the homes are only wide enough for one person, so locals touch frequently as they slide past one another.
An infection there would have everything it needs to spread.
'Life and death difference' 
More than 218,000 cases of the COVID-19 infection have now been detected globally, with nearly 9,000 deaths.
Asia's poorest have been largely left to protect themselves as the outbreak accelerates.
Neither Indonesia nor India have imposed lockdowns, and have not taken significant steps specifically directed at preventing outbreaks in shantytowns.
In Pakistan, Prime Minister Imran Khan said the government would not impose a large-scale urban lockdown against the virus because it would extract too great an economic toll.
""If we shut down the cities – people are already facing difficult circumstances – we will save them from corona at one end, but they will die from hunger on other side,"" Khan said.
Tondo residents said they had been out of work since the Philippines' quarantine kicked in but would be forced to go out to find other employment once their money ran out in a matter of days.
Unlike wealthier communities that can restrict access to outsiders with entrance gates or security guards, slum areas are wide open.
""There's a possibility we'll get infected because we can't control who comes here,"" said 48-year-old Fely Tumbaga, who runs a small store in Tondo.
""We don't know if outsiders have the virus,"" she added, noting that locals were increasingly wary of anyone they didn't know.
For slum dwellers who develop severe cases, reluctance to seek care due to the cost involved could prove a deadly decision.
The strength of a nation's healthcare system has been a key factor in death rates, but so is the severity of infection when people seek treatment.
Public health expert Gideon Lasco said the ability to pay but also to reach the hospital as lockdowns tighten will be decisive.
""Immediate access to quality care can mean the difference between life and death,"" he said. – Rappler.com

MANILA, Philippines– Hoping to help curb the spread of the coronavirus, Polytechnic University of the Philippines (PUP) has made a local version of ethyl alcohol in a bid to protect students and teachers from the disease.
The PUP Institute for Science and Technology Research (ISTR) developed and tested the pilot batch of the localized ethyl alcohol on March 11, following the requirements and standards of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
Larger batches will be manufactured once raw materials to be used for the mass production of the alcohol become available, according to PUP. 
The production, pegged to be at least 20 gallons of alcohol per month, will be done at PUP’s Engineering and Science Research Center. It will also be led by a team from ISTR, as spearheaded by Coronado and licensed chemist and faculty researcher Christian Cambiador. 
The university is set to manufacture and distribute the free ethyl alcohol to the PUP community by the end of March.
“The product will be used by the members of the PUP community, including branches and campuses. It will not be sold commercially nor distributed outside PUP,” said Dr Armin Coronado, the director of ISTR, in an interview with PUP.
They explained that the decision to manufacture local alcohol was brought up to save the university at least 70% of the total expenses compared to buying commercially made alcohol.
Dr Ma. Liza Yanes of PUP’s Medical Services Department added that the team opted to produce ethyl alcohol instead of isopropyl alcohol, as well, because it is safer to the skin.
Among their suggestions in helping curb the spread of coronavirus in the community was the production of local alcohol-based sanitizers. However, given time and equipment constraints, the ISTR prioritized the development of ethyl alcohol.
As of writing, PUP has not stated how the alcohol will be distributed to the community.– Rappler.com

DAVAO CITY (UPDATED) – A 68-year-old Korean businessman who had recent travels to Riyadh and Manila was among the 3 Patients Under Investigation (PUI) for the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) who died Thursday, March 19, in the Davao Region .
Dr. Anabelle Yumang, DOH- Davao Region director, said that also among the 3 deaths was that of a 78-year-old who had arrived in the country from  Australia. The patient's passing was caused by uremic sepsis secondary to urinary tract infection.
“The patient had a pre-existing bladder cancer stage 4 and the cause of death is uremic sepsis secondary to complicated urinary tract infection,” Yumang said.
The third victim had traveled to Laguna and Metro Manila and arrived here on March 9.
“The patient had complaints on epigastric pain with shortness of breath and had undergone an operation at the Southern Philippines Medical Center,” she said, adding that the cause of death was septic shock secondary to ulcer.
Yumang said DOH-11 is currently awaiting the results of the swab samples sent to RITM to determine if any or all of them had COVID-19.
DOH Undersecretary Abdullah Dumama, Jr. said they wanted to expedite the results but they were facing problems on transport.
The city's airport had been locked down a few days ago to stem the spread of the disease.
“We submitted the specimen on March 17 and I know that as soon as it will reach there, they will do the testing right away,” Dumama said.
As this developed, Mayor Sara Duterte ordered the partial opening of the airport to international and domestic flights for cargo, medical evacuations, weather mitigation flights, maintenance flights, government and military flights, emergency landings and recovery flights for expatriates.
“There is a need to exempt certain international and domestic air travel from the coverage” of the earlier ban, she said in her order No. 18.
The 3 unidentified victims were among 54 persons isolated at the Southern Philippines Medical Center in Davao City and the Davao Regional Medical Center in Tagum City.
Davao region has one confirmed coronavirus case. The 21-year-old female from Davao De Oro traveled to United Kingdom and Doha in Qatar. 
The patient, known as PH130, is recovering well since isolation on March 9, according to the DOH.
The region recorded a total of 88 PUIs since the outbreak of the disease. Out of this total, 31 were discharged after getting negative results. 
The region also recorded 3,589 persons under monitoring (PUM) as of Thursday.
The entire region has sealed its borders. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – The Commission on Higher Education (CHED) said Thursday, March 19, that colleges and universities can adjust their academic calendars the way they see fit without going through the usual stringent rules.
""Hindi na po nila kailangan ng permission ng commission, ang nirerequire natin sa kanila ay i-inform ang commission in writing para alam namin kung paano sila tutulungan (They don't need to get the commission's permission, what we require is that they inform the commission in writing so we know how we can help),""CHED Chairman Prospero de Vera said during the government's daily briefer on Thursday morning.
In the earlier CHED Advisory No. 3, the commission allowed both public and private Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) to ""exercise flexibility in determining the extent of adjustments that will be made in their approved academic calendar,"" as physical classes are now suspended because of the lockdown in Luzon prompted by the novel coronavirus outbreak.

De Vera said universities can extend their semesters as needed, and adjust requirements.
Several universities have opted to hold online classes to continue the semester.
De Vera said, however, that he has received complaints from students who are unable to attend to online classes or comply with requirements made online because of poor internet connection.
""HEIs must exercise leniency and help the students during these difficult times. CHED is monitoring the situation and will take the necessary corrective actions if HEIs do not act accordingly,"" said De Vera.

MANILA, Philippines – To aid students and their families, Commission on Higher Education Chairman Prospero de Vera III on Thursday, March 19, called on private universities to delay tuition payments until the Luzon lockdown ends on April 12. 
De Vera made the appeal after receiving complaints from students who reported they were being made to pay tuition despite the government's order to observe mandatory home quarantine. 
""Naglabas ako ng statement [na] kung pwede (I released a statement asking if it’s possible to have) no tuition collection for this month [and] staggered payment for succeeding months,"" De Vera said during a Laging Handa briefing. 
Why this matters: During the monthlong lockdown for the entire Luzon, the government is restricting land, air, and sea travel to essential movement only. While over 57 million residents in the island region are made to stay home, payments for some services continue despite most being unable to work. 
Individuals part of skeleton forces, emergency response, and medical services, as well as those going out to buy essential goods are among the few people authorized to leave their homes. 
Stringent social distancing measures were enforced starting Tuesday, March 17, after President Rodrigo Duterte put Luzon on lockdown to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus.
How universities have responded: De Vera said several universities have heeded his call, including the University of Perpetual Help system, Immaculate Concepcion institutions, and Lyceum of the Philippines University. 
Aside from these schools, De Vera said CMDI college informed him they would waive tuition for students who have difficulty paying because their parents are struggling to work. 
The Philippine Association of Private Schools, Colleges, and Universities, as well as the Coordinating Council of Private Educational Associations, likewise assured De Vera they would ensure private schools would grant CHED's request.
As for state colleges and universities, they are already observing free tuition under the Universal Access to Quality Tertiary Education Act. – Rappler.com  "

MANILA, Philippines –  The Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) on Thursday, March 19, advised local governments to realign their budgets so they can allot more money for  relief assistance to the poor during the month-long Luzon lockdown.
""They can realign. Just call the Council. Beautification projects can be realigned for now. This (social welfare) is what we need to respond to right now,"" DILG Undersecretary Jonathan Malaya said during a Laging Handa press briefing on Thursday.

Why does this matter? During the program, a barangay captain phoned in a question asking what they should do if they're running out of money for their respective relief and feeding programs. Malaya said they should turn to their municipal and city governments, and that the local governments should realign their budgets to release more funds. (Here's a DILG opinion backing Malaya's recommendation)
President Rodrigo Duterte earlier ordered a lockdown in the whole of Luzon, which has a 57 million people most of whom would not be able to go to work because of the restrictions imposed on individuals and businesses during the lockdown period. He also declared a state of calamity in the country, which allows local governments to tap their Quick Response Fund.
Help is coming: Malaya said the national government's aid will reach local governments by next week, or March 23 at the earliest. This would be led by the Department of Social Welfare and Development, which is preparing the food packs.  
Until then, Malaya said barangay officials should feed their indigent constituents ""systematically,"" or to ensure that while they give away food packs, they would still observe social distancing . – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – Tricycles, too, will no longer be allowed on the streets of Pasig, after the national government rejected a plea from city mayor Vico Sotto to allow the modified motorcycle taxis to take limited trips during the Luzon-wide lockdown to avert the spread of the novel coronavirus.
“We will comply. Marami kaming efforts sa transpo, mula bus hanggang bike (We have many efforts in transportation, from buses to bikes),” Sotto told Rappler on Thursday, March 19.
“Pero libo-libo kasi pinag-uusapan natin – ‘di lang frontliners kundi pati mga regular na pasyente at mga sitwasyong may emergency,” he added. (But we’re talking about thousands of people – not just frontliners but also regular patients and emergency situations.)
When the lockdown began on Tuesday, March 17, Sotto allowed tricycles to make “limited trips” to service essential workers exempted from the travel ban, and the infirm who do not have their own cars.
To observe social distancing – keeping ample personal space to avoid contagion – Sotto ordered to limit the number of passengers each tricycle could take on per trip to just one in the side car and another behind the driver. Tricycles usually put up to 3 passengers in the side car and two behind the driver.
Knowing the move was against the national government’s orders, Sotto asked for consideration, pointing out that tricycles were the most easily available and inexpensive mode of door-to-door transportation in Pasig. With the right number of passengers, they are even safer than enclosed, air-conditioned private cars in terms of preventing viral transmission, he said.
Sotto also pointed out that some neighborhoods in Pasig have streets that are too narrow for most types of vehicles, save for tricycles and motorcycles. In an emergency, said Sotto, a tricycle would be the best option to go in and get people out of such places. Pasig City is home to at least 755,000 residents. 
Despite deploying all the city government’s buses and other vehicles, Sotto said they were not enough to convey the thousands of people with legitimate reasons to travel during the lockdown.
The national government’s lockdown order exempts health workers, security forces, certain government officials, media personnel, and those with emergencies from the travel ban.
On Wednesday night, March 18, Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles rejected Sotto’s appeal, saying the government did not see how social distancing could be practiced in such a cramped vehicle as tricycles.
“Let’s all stick to the common ground rules,” Nograles said.
Sotto said Pasig will then have to make do with their buses, bicycles, and other vehicles. Some private groups have lent buses and vans to the city – but the mayor was apprehensive about the poor and the sick, who would find it difficult to walk to bus stops. – Rappler.com "

CHECKPOINT. Police man a checkpoint in Barangay Manat in Nabunturan, Davao del Oro. Photo courtesy of PRO 11 
DAVAO CITY, Philippines – Davao City Mayor Sara Duterte, chair of the regional development and peace and order councils, said that all local government units in the Davao Region should allow the movement of people within the region – with some form of restrictions – as the region-wide lockdown took effect at 12:01 am on Thursday, March 19.
“LGUs should no longer implement localized lockdowns. It is the regional lockdown that should prevail,” she said.
Many local governments in Davao Region, including Davao City, had earlier placed their areas under community quarantine to help stem the spread of the coronavirus disease COVID-19.
Sara said that during the regional lockdown, those trying to accomplish business, following up on important things or emergencies, should not be hampered. She said those coming in should still be allowed if they are reporting for work but they should present their company IDs and procedures.
Members of the media are also exempted from the restrictions on the movement of people during the regional lockdown
Sara also clarified that individuals or vehicles going out of the region should be allowed but they could not reenter in the next 14 days.
Questions
Sara made the clarification on the movement of people during the regional lockdown as some residents raised questions about it on the official Facebook pages of local government offices, possibly fanned by panic or lack of understanding of geography.
""If I am from Mintal (Tugbok district in Davao City), can I still go to San Pedro (a popular street in downtown Davao City)?"" asked one.
Another netized also asked if he would still be allowed to enter Toril (a district in Davao City) from Sta Cruz, Davao del Sur.
""My husband said he can't go home because of the lockdown,"" a housewife from Davao del Sur told Rappler. Her husband works in Calinan, Davao City
Because of the confusion, several media outlets had put up maps of the Davao Region on social media.
But still, many social media users continued to ask similar questions on mobility from one area in Davao region  to another in the region.
""If you are from Davao de Oro, Davao del Sur, Davao Oriental, Davao del Norte and the cities and towns within them, you can move inside Davao Region,"" Sara said.
She also said that in the case of the ban on Tagum residents from entering Davao City, the same had been lifted with the implementation of the regional lockdown.
""Those from Tagum can now move within the region if their travel is important,"" she added.
'Be courteous'
Police began turning away people or restricting the number of logistics personnel from entering Davao region as the regional lockdown took effect midnight of Thursday.
At the borders of Davao del Sur and Sarangani province, and Davao del Sur and North Cotabato for example, a composite team from the police, the Provincial Health Office, soldiers, the Bureau of Fire Protection, and representatives from the local government units, manned the checkpoints in Barangay Kinuskusan in Bansalan town and Barangay Kiblagon in Sulop.
Davao del Sur police chief Lieutenant Colonel Alberto Lupaz said they expected resistance from individuals trying to enter the region via Davao del Sur, which was why those manning the checkpoints were told to be patient in explaining why they cannot be allowed in.
“The troops (were told) to be patient and courteous in handling the lockdown and adhere to the existing Police Operational Procedure and other PNP Command Guidelines, as well as the Executive Order on Community Quarantine issued by the Davao Sur Provincial Government headed by Governor Douglas  Cagas,” Lupaz said.“As front liners, we are the shock absorbers of the anguishes of the people who will try to get in. But even then, let us do our job, this is for the safety of everyone,” he added.

Lupaz said the instruction to the front liners was to deny entry to any person entering the Davao Region, “except for vehicles with cargo and one driver without an assistant.”
“Cargo shall mean to include all animals. Vehicle assistants may be unloaded at the checkpoint to wait for the vehicle to come back and leave Davao Region,” Lupaz said, reading the resolution of the Regional Task Force on COVID-19.
Checkpoints were also put up in the borders of Bukidnon and Davao City; the borders of Davao de Oro and Agusan del Sur; and the borders of Davao Oriental and Agusan del Sur, according to the Police Regional Office 11 (PRO11)
There had been minor issues, such as people insisting on coming in, according to the regional police office, but these were properly addressed.
Soccsksargen next
North Cotabato Governor Nancy Catamco said that the Soccsksargen area or Region 12 will also be on lockdown starting March 23.
“The combined Regional Peace and Order Council and the Regional Disaster Risk Reduction Council met in Tacurong City on Wednesday and it was agreed to impose a lockdown on the region,” Catamco said.
She said the governors of the two Cotabato provinces, Sultan Kudarat and Sarangani; and the mayors of Tacurong, Kidapawan, Koronadal and General Santos cities, attended the meeting.
“The regional borders will be strictly manned and all seaports and airports will be shutdown to passengers and non-cargo,” she said.
Catamco said a regional curfew, starting from 9 am to 5 am had also been adopted.
“The provisions of the regional lockdown are similar to the ones adopted by Region 11,” she added. – Rappler.com "

NOW UNDER QUARANTINE. DOH Secretary Francisco Duque in a recent press conference. File photo by Daren Langit/Rappler 
MANILA, Philippines – Department of Health (DOH) Secretary Francisco Duque III is now under-self quarantine after being exposed to a senior health official who tested positive for COVID-19.
This was confirmed to Rappler by Duque in a phone call on Thursday, March 19. He said he started his home quarantine on Wednesday, March 18, two days after the DOH confirmed one of its senior officials, whom Duque said is a 60-year-old director, already has COVID-19. 
Duque also got himself tested for COVID-19 on Wednesday and is awaiting the results. 
“Yes I am on quarantine now because another official from DOH, from central office, tested positive and he’s symptomatic and in the hospital. But he is improving,” said Duque. 
The Philippines’ top health official said he was in close contact with the COVID-19 patient for “about 3 times.” Duque is not showing symptoms, but he is closely monitoring his health because the DOH chief has hypertension and asthma. 
“I have no fever, so I’m pretty okay. It’s just that of course I’m watching over my hypertension and asthma,” said Duque, 
“So I just want to make the necessary precautions. So I’m on quarantine following our protocol,” said the DOH secretary, who added he would now have to lead the DOH’s efforts against combatting COVID-19 from within his house.  
The Philippine government has long been grappling with a lack of supply of test kits for COVID-19. This has forced DOH to prioritize persons under investigation (PUIs) for testing. PUIs are the individuals who are manifesting severe symptoms of COVID-19 and have either traveled to a country with local transmission and have risk of importation of the virus, or have known exposure to a positive case. 
The elderly who manifest COVID-19 symptoms, whether mild or severe, and those who have underlying medical conditions, will automatically get tested for possible infection. 
Duque is 'PUM'
Meanwhile, the DOH said persons under monitoring (PUM) are individuals who have a travel history and history of exposure to a coronavirus patient. They will undergo 14 days of self-quarantine at home or at barangay isolation units.  
This means Duque is a PUM for now because he has known exposure to a positive case but has no symptoms yet. (READ: When should you get tested for coronavirus?)
As of 12 pm on Wednesday, the Philippines has tallied a total of 202 confirmed cases of COVID-19, 17 of which are fatal. Still, 7 patients have already recovered from the disease.
Experts from the DOH and WHO have estimated the novel coronavirus cases in the country could peak to as much as 75,000 in the next 3 months or by June if not properly contained.
President Rodrigo Duterte declared a state of public health emergency on March 9, a Luzon-wide lockdown from March 17 to April 12, and a state of calamity in the Philippines on March 16.
Several provinces, cities, and municipalities in the Visayas and Mindanao have also declared localized lockdowns and placed their localities under a state of calamity. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – Philippine shares plunged by nearly 25% on Thursday, March 19, only moments after the Manila stock exchange resumed trade following a two-day trading suspension prompted by the coronavirus pandemic.
The Southeast Asian nation was the first in the world to indefinitely suspend trading after President Rodrigo Duterte ordered more than half of its population to stay home for the next month.
Manila's bourse had suspended operations ""until further notice"" in response but quickly recalled its order and reopened the market on Thursday after the government exempted it from the lockdown.
The Philippine Stock Exchange index dropped 24% from the close Monday, March 16, just seconds after the opening bell, triggering a 15-minute trading halt.
It was the largest fall on record for the benchmark, Bloomberg reported.
""We were kind of expecting that the market would open quite low, especially after a two-day halt in trading,"" exchange president Ramon Monzon said.
Monzon said he was in talks with Philippine regulators to implement new measures to stem market volatility, which could include additional intraday trading suspensions.

NO LOCKDOWN YET. Quezon City Health workers disinfect the surroundings of a barangay. File photo by Darren Langit/Rappler 
MANILA, Philippines – Despite its big number of coronavirus cases, Quezon City will not be placed under total lockdown yet due to insufficient police force, Mayor Joy Belmonte said on Thursday, March 19. 
The national government's Inter-Agency Task Force on the coronavirus outbreak earlier imposed a Metro Manila-wide lockdown, allowing city-wide quarantine when at least 2 positive coronavirus cases live in different barangays.
As of Wednesday night, March 18, there were already 34 confirmed coronavirus cases in Quezon City, the highest number of cases in any local government unit in the country, based on the health department's monitoring. They are spread across at least 22 barangays, with some villages hosting multiple cases.
The city is the Philippines' largest and most populated, with almost 3 million residents based on the 2015 census.
According to Belmonte, 3 of the coronavirus patients have already recovered while one died.
But the city government is implementing a total lockdown, or extreme enhanced community quarantine, only in two villages: Barangay Tandang Sora and Barangay Kalusugan, which have multiple coronavirus cases each.
Some residents have questioned the wisdom behind this decision.
Special case?
Belmonte said the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) acknowledged Quezon City as a special case.
""Ang lungsod kasi natin ayon sa DILG, DOH [Department of Health] ay kakaiba dahil napakalaki. So if you put everything under extreme enhanced community quarantine or heightened enhanced community quarantine, magkukulang po talaga ang manpower resources ng atin pong Quezon City Police District. Maooverstretch po, at hindi po magiging epektibo dahil sa laki po ng ating lungsod,"" Belmonte said in an interview on DZBB. 
(Our city, according to the DILG, DOH, is different because it is very large. So if you put everything under extreme enhanced community quarantine or heightened enhanced community quarantine, the manpower resources of the Quezon City Police District will be insufficient. It will be overstretched, and it will not be effective because of the size of our city.)
In Tandang Sora and Kalusugan, which are under the ""extreme enhanced community quarantine"" due to 3 coronavirus cases each, household members of coronavirus patients are not allowed to leave their residences, and people within a 500-meter radius from coronavirus patients' houses are under strict monitoring and surveillance. Food is delivered by barangay officials to those not allowed to leave their homes.
'Heightened' quarantine
According to Belmonte, villages with only one coronavirus case are under ""heightened enhanced community quarantine,"" which also entails stricter surveillance and monitoring but not as extreme as the ones in Tandang Sora and Kalusugan.
As of Wednesday, there were 20 villages under ""heightened enhanced community quarantine.""
All the other barangays in Quezon City fall under the enhanced community quarantine imposed by the national government.
The city government said it will be providing two weeks worth of food for 400,000 families who were displaced by the enhanced community quarantine. – Rappler.com

MANILA, Philippines– The Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) gave in to taxpayers' plea and extended the deadline for the filing of 2019 annual income tax returns (ITRs) by a month to May 15, 2020, the agency announced on Thursday, March 19.
But the BIR appealed to those ready to file their ITRs on or before the original April 15 deadline to do so, ""in order to help the Duterte administration raise enough funds"" to combat the economic impact of the novel coronavirus.
A revenue memorandum circular dated March 18 and signed by BIR Commissioner Caesar Dulay granted the one-month extension for income tax filing and payments without the imposition of penalties on taxpayers.
""This emergency measure is being offered to provide relief to Filipino taxpayers who will not be able to prepare, let alone file, the necessary ITR documents on or before the original annual deadline of April 15 because of skeletal workforce arrangements and enhanced community quarantine rules that the national government has implemented to contain the pandemic,"" the BIR said.
The ""enhanced community quarantine"" of Metro Manila is in effect until April 14, while for Luzon, it is until April 12. During this period of total lockdown, movements of at least 57 million people are restricted, with most mandated to stay at home.
The BIR noted that the extension will lead to a shortfall in tax collections of around P145 billion. This may have to be covered by additional borrowings by the national government. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles rejected the appeal of Pasig City Mayor Vico Sotto's move to allow tricycles to operate on a limited capacity during the Luzon-wide lockdown, as it puts passengers and drivers at risk of catching the novel coronavirus.
In a press briefing on Wednesday night, March 18, Nograles insisted that local government units can use other vehicles like jeepneys to transport frontline workers.

“Concerned ang gobyerno dito sa paggamit ng tricycle dahil hindi namin lubos makita o maintindihan paano mag-social distancing sa tricycle,” Nograles said.
(The government is concerned by the use of tricycles because we don’t see how social distancing can be observed in such a cramped space.)
“Let’s all stick to the common ground rules,” he added.
Sotto has allowed tricycles to continue conveying passengers in Pasig for now, as the city government does not have enough vehicles to give all commuters exempted from the Luzon-wide lockdown a ride.
“We're using our vehicles but it's not enough. Our risk assessment shows that we can’t ban tricycles at this point,” Sotto said on Tuesday.
Sotto insisted that there are places in Pasig that are accessible only by tricycle.
Only people exempted from the quarantine may take tricycles. They include health workers, security forces, employees of essential services such as food and groceries, and media workers.
Only 3 passengers are allowed on each tricycle that can normally cram up to 6 people in a single trip. 
The government highly encourages people to be at least 1 meter apart to minimize the risk of getting the virus. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr on Wednesday night, March 18, said the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) was considering suspending visa issuances worldwide as well as the visa-free privilege for all countries except those in Southeast Asia.  
Locsin made the announcement in response to the Philippine government’s decision to place the entire Luzon on lockdown to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. The measure, he added, would be temporary and last until the end of lockdown period on April 12 if implemented.  
“DFA considering suspension of visa free privilege except for ASEAN. Also stopping visa issuance worldwide during period of lockdown,"" Locsin tweeted Wednesday night. 
""And no more visa upon arrival even if we stamp passports with DFA stamp showing most of South China Sea and Pacific up to Guam as PH territory,"" he added referring to the Philippines' policy to stamp foreign passports with the map of the country's exclusive economic zone. 
If finalized by the Philippines, the measure will be an expansion of restrictions taken by the Philippine government to manage the novel coronavirus situation in the country.  
The Philippines has so far limited the suspension of visa issuances to foreigners coming from China, Hong Kong, and Macau. Aside from this, the Bureau of Immigration in January 2020, suspended the visa upon arrival (VUA) mechanism for Chinese tourists and businessmen.
There are at least 100 countries that enjoy visa-free privileges to the Philippines, including the United States and several countries in Europe. 
Other measure taken: Sweeping travel restrictions are already in place in the Philippines with Filipinos traveling as tourists barred from leaving during the Luzon lockdown. 
After nearly a day of back and forth, the government said only overseas Filipino workers, balikbayans, and foreigners will be able to leave the country from Luzon, provided they showed proof they were traveling 24 hours after leaving their residence or accommodation. 
Filipinos, their foreign spouses and children, if any, as well as permanent resident card holders coming home will likewise be allowed to do so, subject to quarantine measures. 
So far, non-Filipino travelers coming from North Gyeongsang Province, including Daegu City and Cheongdo County in South Korea; as well as Hong Kong, Macau, and mainland China – ground zero of the coronavirus outbreak – were not allowed to enter the country.

MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – GMA News TV, the network’s free-to-air news and public affairs channel, will temporarily stop broadcasting starting Thursday, March 19, amid the ongoing coronavirus outbreak in the Philippines.
GMA News anchor Jessica Soho made the announcement during the Wednesday, March 18, edition of 24 Oras.
""Mahalagang anunsiyo po: Sa gitna ng enhanced community quarantine at ng state of calamity sa ating bansa, simula po bukas, hindi po muna sasahimpapawid ang GMA News TV o ang GNTV. Manatili pong nakatutok dito sa GMA para sa news updates,"" Soho said.
(An important announcement: Amid the enhanced community quarantine [in Luzon] and the state of calamity in the Philippines, starting tomorrow, GMA News TV or GNTV will temporarily stop broadcasting. Please continue tuning in to GMA for news updates.)
The short announcement did not mention whether or not GMA News TV employees would be paid while the channel is off air.
On Wednesday, CNN Philippines stopped broadcasting after a coronavirus case was confirmed in the building where the television channel is based, forcing it off the air while the offices are disinfected.
President Rodrigo Duterte placed the entire Luzon on lockdown until April 12 to prevent further spread of the novel coronavirus, which has infected at least 202 individuals in the Philippines as of Wednesday. The entire country is under a state of calamity.
The global death toll due to the coronavirus, meanwhile, has reached 7,873, with 3,237 of the fatalities in China (excluding Hong Kong and Macau). The number of cases worldwide has risen to 194,000, with more than 80,894 of the infections in China. The virus has spread to at least 150 countries.
No work no pay for talents 
On Friday, March 20, network talents received notice from the management that a no-work-no-pay scheme will apply to them.  
Before this, the only information they got about their status while the Luzon-wide lockdown is in effect was a press release published on GMA News Online, titled ""GMA gives aid to employees during enhanced community quarantine."" 
The article says: “Talents and project employees will still be able to receive their salaries on March 25 and 30, respectively. In addition, a cash advance will be made available for them for their April 10 and 15 pay-outs.""
According to an advisory sent to one group of project employees, the end-of-March salary will be for the work rendered from March 1 to 15. 
The cash advance covering the first half of April will be ""deduction."" They were informed the deduction scheme is still being ironed out.
The cash advance is based on their income bracket:

Those with salaries P20,000 or below will get P10,000
Salary of P20,000 to P40,000 – will get P12,500
Salary of P40,000 to P60,000 – will get P17,500 
Salary of P60,000 to P80,000 – will get P22,500
Salary of P80,000 to P100,000 – will get P27,500 
Salary of above P100,000 – will get P32,500 

“The scheme is really unjust and inhumane…. [It] made us feel like face masks that has to be disposed of because we’re used and infected,” one of the talents said. “We're also told that our output had not been enough for us to be given full cash advance salary.” – with reports from Agence France-Presse/Rappler.com "

ILOILO CITY, Philippines – A person under investigation (PUI) for coronavirus died in Iloilo City, Mayor Jerry Treñas confirmed in a press conference Wednesday, March 18. 
The patient had been confined at a hospital in the city after showing symptoms of the infection. A PUI is someone who had exposure to the novel coronavirus and is showing symptoms.
As of this posting, there are at least 29 PUIs in Iloilo City.
The Ilolio City PUI is one of 3 who died this week without having confirmed their test results for COVID-19. The first was in Cebu City, while another died in Marawi City. (READ: Man probed for coronavirus in Marawi dies while awaiting test result)
Treñas had met with the managers of malls, supermarkets, and other local stakeholders earlier Wednesday afternoon to discuss the possibility of a ""lockdown"" in the next few days to slow down the  spread of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, in this city.
Iloilo City Hall's plans of a 14-day lockdown would include a full shutdown of malls and other major establishments. 
Establishments like supermarkets, restaurants, banks, pharmacies and other services would remain open.
Treñas said that in this time of crisis, the priority is to ensure that Ilonggos' access to their necessities is not cut off entirely.
A number of hospitals in Iloilo City have also been implementing a ""no visitor"" policy. Those entering these hospitals are required to submit themselves for assessment to protect the welfare and health of the city's health care frontliners and patients. 
The Department of Health reminded the public to constantly wash their hands, cover their mouth properly when coughing, and practice social distancing.
As of Wednesday, the Philippines has a total of 202 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus, with 7 recoveries and 17 deaths.
The global death toll, meanwhile, has reached 7,873, with 3,237 of the fatalities in China (excluding Hong Kong and Macau). The number of cases worldwide has risen to 194,000, with more than 80,894 of the infections in China. The virus has spread to at least 150 countries. – Rappler.com  "

ALBAY, Philippines – The hard lockdown imposed in this province exempts nobody, not even residents.
Albay Governor Al Francis Bichara Wednesday, March 18, ordered a total border closure here, hoping to spare the province from a novel coronavirus infection.
With the borders sealed, not even Albayanons currently outside the province will be allowed to enter and return home. Also those in the province will be barred from leaving.
""Stay where you are even if you're outside Albay because you can no longer go home as we are closing all borders in the province to prevent the entry of coronavirus disease,"" Bichara said.
The Albay-Camarines Sur border, Tiwi-Camarines Sur (Tiwi-Sangay Coastal Road) border, and Albay-Sorsogon border, including all other possible entry points – by land, air, and sea shall be restricted.
Police Col. Wilson Asueta, Albay police provincial director, said the critical areas are the Polangui and Tiwi-Sangay entry and exit points, where motorists will be strictly assessed by a composite team of personnel from the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP), the Philippine National Police (PNP), and local government units.
Bichara said all the mayors of Albay's 3 cities and 15 towns supported the border closure.
When asked if the border closure will affect the Albayanos' food supply, Legazpi City Mayor Noel Rosal, chairman of the Regional Development Council, said that local government units will provide locally-sourced products for citizens.
“All mayors of the 15 towns and 3 cities of Albay will buy local products, to be given to the people, specifically the hand-to-mouth families, for free,” he said.

COVID-19 TEST KIT. A sample of the UP-developed novel coronavirus detection kit as presented to media during a press briefing held at the Philippine Gerome Center on March 12, 2020. Photo by Darren Langit/Rappler  
MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – The World Health Organization (WHO) said 4 subnational laboratories in the Philippines can begin testing novel coronavirus samples starting Thursday, March 19.
The WHO made the announcement in its sixth situation report on the status of the virus outbreak in the Philippines on Wednesday, March 18. 
According to the WHO, the following subnational laboratories ""will be operational"" to screen samples for COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, by Thursday:

Baguio General Hospital and Medical Center in Baguio City
San Lazaro Hospital in Manila City
Southern Philippines Medical Center in Davao City
Vicente Sotto Memorial Medical Center in Cebu City

The WHO said the laboratory of the University of the Philippines National Institutes of Health, whose scientists developed their own coronavirus detection kits, will ""soon"" be ready for COVID-19 testing as well. (READ: U.P. coronavirus test kits still need gov't validation, no mass use yet)
This means the Philippines will have 5 WHO-accredited centers by Thursday. Since the outbreak began, only the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM), the Department of Health's (DOH) research arm based in Muntinlupa, has been testing samples of COVID-19.
The WHO also provided RITM additional supplies of test kits, increasing the laboratory's daily testing capacity from 300 to 450 tests. 
This is a welcome development for the Philippines, whose government has been drawing flak for not testing enough of its population for the fast-spreading coronavirus.
But Health Secretary Francisco Duque III clarified on Thursday, March 19, that these 4 subnational laboratories only have around 100 test kits available for now. The health department is working to give them additional test kits as soon as possible.
""What my concentration is now is to ensure that those 4 subnational labs are really operating according to set standards of safety and accuracy of testing. Puwede na silang tumanggap (They can receive samples already), but that depends because of the limited test kits sent to them. One hundred pa lang ang mayroon sila sa ngayon (They only have 100 test kits each right now),"" Duque said in a phone interview with Rappler.
The lack of test kits available in the country has forced the DOH officials to prioritize persons under investigation for testing. They are the individuals who are manifesting severe symptoms of COVID-19 and have either traveled to a country with local transmission and have risk of importation of the virus, or have known exposure to a positive case. (READ: When you need to get tested for coronavirus – or not)
Duque said on Monday, March 16, that thousands of additional test kits are also coming in from South Korea and China. But the Philippines may still not have enough trained technicians to run tests and analyze samples.  
As of 12 pm on Wednesday, the Philippines has tallied a total of 202 confirmed cases of COVID-19, 17 of which are fatal. Still, 7 patients have already recovered from the disease. 
Experts from the DOH and WHO have estimated the novel coronavirus cases in the country could peak to as much as 75,000 in the next 3 months or by June if not properly contained.
President Rodrigo Duterte declared a state of public health emergency on March 9, a Luzon-wide lockdown from March 17 to April 12, and a state of calamity in the Philippines on March 16. 
Several provinces, cities, and municipalities in the Visayas and Mindanao have also declared localized lockdowns and placed their localities under a state of calamity.Read a full copy of the WHO 6th COVID-19 situation report on the Philippines below:

CAGAYAN DE ORO, Philippines – The Department of Health in Northern Mindanao (Region 10) said Wednesday, March 18, it was coordinating with the Philippine Air Force for the quick delivery of specimens of Persons Under Investigation (PUI) from here to the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) in Metro Manila.
At present, it is only the RITM which confirms if a PUI is infected with the novel coronavirus. 
DOH Region 10 Director Adriano Suba-an said that they have coordinated with the PAF for the delivery of Universal Tranport Medium (UTM) and other tools to be used to transport the specimens.
The UTM is a room temperature stable viral transport medium used for collection, transport, maintenance and long-term storage of viruses.
""We coordinated with Colonel Rommel Almaria and they responded that they would provide us with the schedules of the Air Force plane so we can send the samples,"" Suba-an said.
Suba-an said the first step of the process is,  if the PUI has severe acute respiratory illness, especially if doctors suspect COVID-19, a swab specimen will be taken and stored in the UTM. The next step is the UTM with the specimen would be sent to the RITM, which houses the DOH national research laboratory for confirmatory tests.
Aside from transporting samples, the PAF has also agreed to facilitate the transfer of medical  resources from the National Capital Region to Northern Mindanao.
""We also coordinated with the DOH Central Office that if there are items that they need to send to us here, they can send it through the (PAF) plane. We also contacted director Celia Carlos, the director of the RITM, that if there are supplies that they wanted to send to us, they can send (to the Air Force)."" – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – President Rodrigo Duterte on Wednesday, March 18, declared a unilateral ceasefire with the communist rebels a day after a broad lockdown in Luzon took effect to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus. 
Presidential Spokesperson Salvador Panelo made the announcement Wednesday night, saying the ceasefire against the Communist Party of the Philippines, its armed wing the New People's Army (NPA), and political arm the National Democratic Front of the Philippines (NDFP) would take effect midnight of Thursday, March 19, until April 15, 2020. 
""The President has directed the Department of National Defense (DND) and the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG), together with the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) and the Philippine National Police, to cease and desist from carrying out offensive military and police operations during the ceasefire period,"" Panelo said. 
The DILG and DND have yet to issue an order implementing this, including the Suspension of Offensive Military and Police Operations or SOMO. 
In a statement Wednesday night, AFP Chief of Staff General Felimon Santos Jr said the military supports Duterte's call, urging troops to ""continue their keen focus on their mission to protect our people from and assist medical health practitioners in the fight against this dreaded disease.""
Santos likewise sought to assure the public troops will be able to respond to any threat, if needed.
""While I direct the troops to observe guarded optimism, your AFP will not be deterred by similar treacherous attacks by Communist Terrorist Group. We will be there where and when we are needed,"" he said. 
Impromptu wish: Duterte on Monday night, March 16, asked the NPA for a ceasefire during a briefing on the government's response to the coronavirus pandemic. 
""Kindly give me that,"" Duterte said as he continuously switched from a prepared statement on government measures to spontaneous talk on other topics.  
Jose Maria ""Joma"" Sison, the exiled founder and figurehead of the communist rebellion, said Duterte has to make a formal offer through the government negotiating panel to the NDFP if he is ""serious"" with his call. 
Duterte had repeatedly offered to negotiate with communist rebels but likewise named them terrorists.  
Duterte earlier said the ceasefire is needed so that the Philippine government, including uniformed personnel, can focus on combating the novel coronavirus. 
""Through this ceasefire, the Philippine government aspires that the swift provision of public health assistance goes unimpeded with the movement of health workers and medical supplies to communities, as well as of people in need of immediate medical attention remains unhampered,"" Panelo said. 
As of Wednesday, the Philippines has reported 202 confirmed coronavirus cases, including  7 recoveries and 17 deaths.

MANILA, Philippines – Mayor Isko Moreno ordered all hotels and motels in Manila to provide free lodging for health workers who are working in the capital amid the Luzon-wide lockdown due to the novel coronavirus.
""[I] do hereby order all the motels and hotels in the city of Manila to accommodate the health workers of 6 hospitals of Manila, including those of the national government hospitals, as their staging area in going to and coming from city hospitals and national government hospitals,"" Moreno said in a Facebook live address on Wednesday evening, March 18, as he read his Executive Order No. 17. 
The order will last as long as the national government still includes the capital in the Luzon-wide ""enhanced community quarantine.""
Moreno said over 500 rooms will be made available in the following hotels:

Sogo Hotels - 421 rooms
Eurotel - 50 rooms
Town and Country - 60 rooms

Moreno tasked the Manila City Health Office to reach out to hospitals in Manila to link them to the health workers who would need accommodation.
Transportation options have been severely restricted in the government's bid to enforce social distancing over the country's most densely populated region, Metro Manila. 
The announcement comes as the city mayor confirmed there are already 9 novel coronavirus cases in Manila as of Wednesday. One of the cases already died, while the other 8 are being treated in various hospitals in the capital, Moreno said.

MANILA, Philippines – As of Wednesday, March 18, the Philippines has at least 202 confirmed COVID-19 cases, most of which are in Metro Manila.
The number of cases keeps increasing day by day, and scientific forecasts show that the numbers are not going to let up anytime soon.
Dr Jomar Rabajante, a mathematics professor at the University of the Philippines Los Baños, created an SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infected and Recovered) model of COVID-19 for Metro Manila to forecast the number of cases and at the same time gain insights on how to fight this epidemic.
An SEIR Model is a common mathematical model used in epidemiology for infections that have a significant incubation period wherein the infected individual is not yet infectious.
Research suggests that the COVID-19 incubation period is 5 days and that the symptoms appear within the next 12 days.
""Based on my optimistic forecast, if the interventions such as the enhanced community quarantine aren't that effective, the peak might happen mid-April, with around 2,500 active cases in Metro Manila,"" Rabajante said.
Figure 1. Predicted number of active cases from February 10-June 30, 2020. Image courtesy of Jomar Rabajante 
These active cases disregard the number of those who have recovered and those who have already died. These are the ones who might have to be admitted to hospitals in mid-April as well.
The cumulative number of infected cases might rise to between 6,000 and 7,000 in that same period.
Figure 2. Predicted number of cumulative cases (active cases + recovered cases and deaths). Image courtesy of Jomar Rabajante 
""In epidemics, the number of cases is shown as a curve. Initially there will be exponential increase in number of cases, then there will be a peak, then the number of cases starts to decline,"" Rabajante explained.
""The peak happens because the disease already infected many susceptible individuals, so the curve will soon decline. This is a common pattern in epidemics.""
Rabajante also inferred that the COVID-19 epidemic in Metro Manila might have started around Valentine's Day, when as many as 15 infected individuals started unknowingly spreading the virus after having gotten infected elsewhere.
Meanwhile, Department of Health data shows that it was not until March 6 that the number of reported cases rose to 5.
""Those we have detected in early March, it is highly possible that we had not detected all of those infected,"" Rabajante said.
Rabajante conducted the mathematical modeling on March 15, when there were still 140 cases. 
Based on his predictive SEIR model, there may be as many as 500 active cases in Metro Manila alone as of now. However, the number of infected persons may have been much higher if we take into account those who have either recovered or died since the pandemic started.
The graph also shows that for every COVID-19 case reported in Metro Manila, there may be 9 hiding in plain sight – carriers without symptoms or with just mild symptoms who are driving the spread of the infection.
This number is also consistent with the projections of international scientists, who surmise that 86% of all infections are undocumented.
What these numbers tell us is that plans and strategies for both the public and private sector must extend beyond the duration of the enhanced community quarantine, which is set to end on April 12, Rabajante said.
""People should plan long-term because we're talking about a pandemic. If we go back to our normal practices after the enhanced community quarantine, there is a possibility of a rebound of the infection,"" he added.
Experts from the Philippines and the World Health Organization estimate the novel coronavirus cases in the country could peak to 75,000 in the next 3 months or by June if not properly contained
Other experts, meanwhile, posit that the number of local cases may reach 26,000 by the end of March if not contained.
The global death toll due to the novel coronavirus has reached 7,873, with 3,237 of the fatalities in China (excluding Hong Kong and Macau).

Students from the University of the Philippines (UP) College of Medicine led a donation drive to purchase personal protective equipment for the health workers at the state-run Philippine General Hospital (PGH).
As of March 17, UP Medicine Batch 2025 has already received more than P180,000 in donations which they used to buy face masks and alcohol for PGH frontliners. (READ: Staying compassionate in the time of coronavirus)

As transportation woes hound health workers and hospital staff after the suspension of public transport in Luzon, free ride-sharing initiatives were also launched online with the hashtags #pickupCOVID19PH and #INeedARide.
Through the hashtags, citizens willing to volunteer to drive health workers and frontlines can browse tweets using the hashtag and reply to others to better coordinate.

MANILA, Philippines – The Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth) is releasing an initial P30 billion to accredited hospitals to address immediate needs amid the novel coronavirus pandemic.
Based on PhilHealth's historical data, the amount is equivalent to 3 months' worth of claims.
""The move utilizes its interim reimbursement mechanism which will provide health care providers with the much needed liquidity to adequately respond to the pandemic,"" PhilHealth said.
Hospitals will be asked to submit a letter of intent to avail of the mechanism. This will then be charged to future claims.
The state health insurer added that it extended the deadline of payment of contributions for self-paying direct contributors amid the Luzon lockdown.
First quarter contributions can be paid on or before April 30, instead of March 31, and without interest.
The policy on single period of confinement and 45-days coverage are also waived in favor of the member, while the filing period for claims is extended from the usual 60 days to at least 120 days in favor of the health care providers.
PhilHealth will provide a health package worth P14,000 if a member gets quarantined. Patients who test positive for the coronavirus can also seek a package worth up to P32,000.
The number of coronavirus cases in the Philippines rose to 202 on Wednesday, March 18. Of these, 17 have died while 7 have recovered. – Rappler.com

MANILA, Philippines – Lawmakers called on the Department of Finance (DOF) and the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) to extend the deadline for filing of taxes beyond April 15, as the entire island of Luzon and other parts of the country remain under lockdown because of the novel coronavirus. 
On Wednesday, March 18, House ways and means chairperson Representative Joey Salceda said it was “heartless” for the BIR to stick to the same deadline when President Rodrigo Duterte already placed Luzon under enhanced community quarantine. 
Other local government units in the Visayas and Mindanao have also declared localized lockdowns.
“This is a cheap shot from the DOF and the BIR. I did not expect them to be this heartless. While governments around the world feel for their people and offer them quarters, assistance, food, medicine, and just a simple helping hand during this unprecedented world crisis, you have the gall to tell us that there will be no deferment of the scheduled tax deadline on April 15,” said Salceda, whose panel is tasked to pass tax reform measures. 
“Hindi kami nanghihingi ng pera. Magbabayad kami ng buwis. Pero, huwag mo naman sabihin sa amin na magbayad kami 2 araw matapos ang quarantine na in-impose niyo,” added the Albay 2nd District congressman. (We're not asking for money. We're going to pay our taxes. But don't tell us we only have two days to pay for our taxes because of the quarantine you imposed.) 
DOF to reconsider?
Senate President Vicente Sotto III said he already spoke to DOF Secretary Sonny Dominguez to extend the deadline. ""He said he will act on it ASAP! He said he is calling a meeting right away to formulate the extension,"" Sotto told reporters. 
On March 16, BIR issued a memorandum saying the April 15 deadline for tay payments will remain and urged taxpayers to file through online means. At the time, Metro Manila was under a “general community quarantine.”
President Duterte imposed a lockdown over Luzon from March 15 to April 12 and also declared a state of public health calamity in the entire Philippines.  
Bagong Henerasyon Representative Bernadette Herrera said taxpayers would now surely fail to meet the April 15 deadline should the Luzon lockdown not be lifted sooner.  
""The country is currently facing a grave health crisis. Malaki na rin ang naging epekto nito sa hanapbuhay ng ating mga kababayan. Kaya naman nananawagan tayo sa BIR na pakinggan ang hiling ng ating mga taxpayer na i-extend ang deadline nito,” said Herrera, who is also House Deputy Majority Leader.
Senator Francis Pangilinan also appealed to the BIR to extend the deadline to at least a month or longer.
""We request for at least a month-long or longer extension for the filing of income tax returns because the accountants who prepare the returns cannot report for work as 1) they are not considered employees of essential/vital industries; 2) the finance and accounting documents are in their respective offices; and 3)they would not have enough time to examine the documents from April 12, when the quarantine is lifted, and April 15, the deadline for the filing of tax returns,"" Pangilinan said in a statement.
Deputy Minority Leader Carlos Zarate not only made a similar appeal to the BIR, but also asked other financial institutions and even electric cooperatives to extend their payment deadlines too. 
“Ito ay ilan sa mga puwede nating gawin habang tuloy-tuloy na nahihirapan ang ating mga mamamayan dahil sa nangyari na enhanced community quarantine, lalung-lalo na sa Luzon at sa iba pang bahagi ng bansa (These are just some of the things we can do as our countrymen continue to suffer from the enhanced community quaratine, especially those in Luzon and other parts of the country),” said the Bayan Muna representative.
As of 12 noon Wednesday, the Philippines has tallied a total of 202 cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. Of this number, 17 patients have died while 7 already recovered from the disease. – with reports from Aika Rey/Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – The Quezon City government will be providing food to 400,000 families who were displaced by the enhanced community quarantine ordered by President Rodrigo Duterte.
Under the enhanced community quarantine that will last until April 14, only private establishments providing basic necessities will be allowed to remain open.
In a press conference on Wednesday, March 18, Quezon City Mayor Joy Belmonte said the city government would be supplying food for the 400,000 displaced families during the weeks of March 23 to 27 and March 30 to April 5.
For this week, Belmonte asked barangay captains to utilize their Quick Response Fund to provide food for the displaced families. She explained that it would take time for the city government to procure the food supplies.
Belmonte earlier declared a state of calamity in Quezon City to enable all 142 barangays to access the Quick Response Fund.
For the week of April 6 to April 12, she appealed to the Department of Social Welfare and Development and the private sector to help provide food for the displaced families. 
""Medyo magkukulang na po ang pondo ng lungsod sapagkat ang Quick Response Fund natin ay mauubos na, at ang halaga nito ay P400 million lang 'ata. And we have other things to take care of, katulad ng mga hospital equipment, 'yung mga iba pang mga pangangailangan patungkol naman sa pagtugon ng sakit,"" Belmonte said.
(The fund of the city will be insufficient because the Quick Response Fund is almost depleted, since we only have P400 million, I think. And we have other things to take care of, such as hospital equipment, other needs in response to sickness.)
Quezon City has the highest number of coronavirus cases in the country, with a total of 29 as of Wednesday. Two barangays with 3 cases each were placed under heightened community quarantine.
Health officials had recorded 202 coronavirus cases as of Wednesday, while the global tally rose to 189,680 cases. – Rappler.com "

Quezon City officials led by Mayor Joy Belmonte announced the measures being undertaken by the city government to step up its fight against the novel coronavirus outbreak in a news briefing on Wednesday, March 18, 
The two barangays – Barangay Kalusugan and Barangay Tandang Sora each have 3  COVID-19 patients.
St Luke's Medical Center in Quezon City, where at least 17 coronavirus patients are being treated, is also in Barangay Kalusugan. 
Quezon City Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Office Chief Myke Marasigan said during the briefing that the city government has designated the homes of the COVID-19 patients in the barangays as ""hot zones.""
""Ibig sabihin ng hot zone, dito natin gagawin ang extreme enhanced quarantine doon po sa mismong bahay. Hindi natin papayagan na ang mga nakatira doon ay lumabas at may pumasok pang iba, so babantayan na natin 'yan 24/7,"" Marasigan said.

Marasigan also announced road closures along portions of E. Rodriguez Avenue, and East Avenue, where hospitals are located, since COVID-19 cases are confined there as well. Checkpoints will be set up to screen if those who wish to enter and exit have valid reasons to do so.
Belmonte said the city government decided to carry out the measures after a meeting of city officials, officials of national govenrment agencies, and the Philippine National Police (PNP) that morning.

MANILA, Philippines – Interior Secretary Eduardo Año on Wednesday, March 18, rejected calls to temporarily release detainees with light offenses as government struggles to contain the spread of the coronavirus.
""You won't see them anymore after the lockdown. It's much safer inside against the virus,"" Año told Rappler in a text message Wednesday.
Several groups have called for the temporary release of low-level offenders.
In a statement, prison reform experts Raymund Narag and Clarke Jones said the government could free up the crowded detention facilities by releasing ""first time, low-risk, non-violent, bailable offenders.""
""Persons Deprived of Liberty (PDLs) who are charged with offenses such as gambling, theft of less than a thousand pesos, drug use, etc, especially those who are old (above 60 years old) and sickly, will be prioritized for release,"" Narag and Jones said.
Congested jails
To be clear, the call is to temporarily release detainees, meaning people who have not been convicted yet. These detainees are under the Bureau of Jail Management and Penology (BJMP) which is supervised by the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG).
""These are PDLs that, if with money and resources, could have bailed out, and could have been released. But due to poverty, they are languishing in our jails while undergoing prolonged trials,"" said Narag and Jones.
""No, walang connection ang COVID-19 sa sentence nila (COVID-19 has no connection to their sentence),"" was Año's initial response.
But when told that detainees under him are those with no sentence yet, Año said: ""Even then but they have prima facie evidence that's why we cannot release them.""
According to the scholars, BJMP has a congestion rate of 350%.
""If one of the PDLs gets infected in the congested jails, it will be a horrendous nightmare,"" said Narag and Clarke.
Año said, ""Kapag pinakawalan mo lalo sila mahahawa (if you release them, they are more likely to be infected).""
""As long as no outsider is allowed inside, they are all safe. All visits are suspended,"" said Año.
How to do this
Iran and Los Angeles in the US have started releasing prisoners to try and curb the spread of the coronavirus.
Iran, which has been hit hard by the pandemic, has released over 85,000 prisoners, many of whom are anti-government protesters. Iran said it will take them back into custody on April 3, according to a report on Al Jazeera.
Human rights lawyer Tony La Viña said detainees can either be bailed out or avail of the mechanism called self-recognizance, which is a written promise to the court that he or she will show up for hearings.
Narag and Jones said the Public Attorney's Office (PAO) can make a national pleading, to be submitted to the Supreme Court.
""The list will then be submitted to the respective judges, and the judges, using their sound discretion can release the PDLs on their own self-recognizance, or even on a One-Peso Bail,"" said the scholars.
They added: ""As a condition, the PDLs will provide a promise to appear on the court-appointed dates. The wardens will get their addresses and the contact information of their relatives for monitoring.""
""History tells us prisons and jails become epicenters of disease. Not only prisoners are infected, but prison officials – wardens, guards, support staff – and family members of prisoners and officials, as well as surrounding areas will be affected,"" said La Viña.
La Viña said the Good Conduct Time Allowance (GCTA) fiasco proved that prisoners can return if called. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – Philippine authorities are racing to trace attendees of a big religious gathering in Malaysia that was linked to clusters of coronavirus infection in several countries in Southeast Asia.
One of them, a Lanao Del Sur resident, tested positive for coronavirus disease and was admitted to a hospital in Cotabato City. 
The National Commission on Muslim Filipinos (NCMF) on Tuesday, March 17, posted an ""urgent plea"" on Facebook calling on up to 215 Filipino attendees of the tabligh gathering at Kuala Lumpur’s Jamek Sri Petaling Mosque to report themselves and cooperate with the government. 
""We are asking them to please contact immediately the local health units. Observe self- quarantine, and COOPERATE for the contact tracing. Report to the local hotlines provided by your LGUs (Local Government Units) and MOH (Ministry of Health) for any information you have regarding those who attended the said event,"" the Facebook post read.
The event that gathered up to 16,000 Muslims ran from February 27 to March 1.
Cluster of cases
The call was made after Malaysia reported a cluster of cases – up to 95 confirmed patients as of latest count – linked to the same religious gathering, causing a sudden spike of cases in the country. Singapore and Brunei also reported cases linked to the same event.
In total, Malaysia already has more than 500 coronavirus cases as of Tuesday, March 17. It has banned large gatherings, travel abroad for citzens, and the entry of foreigners. 
Several outbreaks in Italy were linked to gatherings of the Catholic Church. In South Korea, a cluster of cases was linked to the Shincheonji Church. The first case of local transmission in the country, a patient who did not have a history of travel, also frequented a prayer hall at the Greenhills Shopping Center. He died.
Mostly from Bangsamoro region
The attendees of the religious gathering from the Philippines were mostly from the Bangsamoro region. Cabinet Secretary Asnin Pendatun told Rappler the regional government is locating the attendees but they don't have a complete list of the participants. 
""Some of them have been located. The challenge is even the host does not have the list of attendees,"" he said.
Pendatun said they've asked for the assistance of the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Bureau of Immigration. They are also hoping for the participants to identify themselves and cooperate with government. 
The Cotabato village where the patient from Lanao Del Sur resides was put under quarantine, ""especially those near the slaughterhouse where his relatives stayed,"" the NCMF said. 
A suspected coronavirus patient who died at the Amai Pakpak Medical Center in Marawi on Tuesday was not an attendee of the event.

Tan kicked off the initiative on Friday, March 13 under the Facebook page Salamat PH Healthcare Heroes. 
Nowhere, which got in touch with food preparation services and restaurants, started delivering to 5 hospitals with meals cooked and packaged by Franco's Friends, and funded by donations from other alumni. 
By Tuesday, March 17, the group was delivering to 8 hospitals as they were able to secure donations from restaurants like Myron’s, Gourmet Gypsy and Barrio Fiesta to deliver a total of 800 meals per day. 
  
The Healing Servants Foundation also partnered with the group and committed 100 meals a day to police and military men at checkpoints. 
  
Other companies have also extended their help to backend operations – donating eggs, rice and other ingredients for the use of the restaurants. 
Non-profit organization The Veggie Drop-Off, which organizes markets to allow Benguet farmers to sell directly to consumers, said the farmers themselves donated vegetables to Nowhere To Go But UP's partner restaurants. 
  
Aside from meals, the group expanded to collecting and donating supplies such as N95 masks, alcohol gallons and goggles to government hospitals. 
'To help when no one wants to help' 
Through a UP alumnus who works as a doctor in a government hospital, the group was able to prioritize and immediatley know the needs of the healthcare workers. 
""We have a doctor in a government hospital that directs us to the hospitals that no one wants to deliver to,"" said Tan. 
Tan recalled that the situation was alarming when only skyflakes and 3-in-1 coffee sachets were available to the government healthcare workers as delivery services also no longer wanted to deliver to hospitals.
UP alumnus Mon Eugenio, owner of Franco's Friends, said he wanted to start this initiative based on his tragic experience when he lost his son Franco. 
Eugenio's three-year-old son was among the 12 dead when a motorized banca sank in Batangas in 2009. At that time, other boats also did not want to help their sinking ferry due to the strong waves and wind. 
""With the coronavirus situation, his motto was to help when no one wants to help,"" said Tan.
The Philippines' confirmed coronavirus cases jumped to 193 on Wednesday morning, March 18 with a total of 7 recoveries and 14 deaths.

MANILA, Philippines – Tricycle drivers registered with the Makati City government are set to receive an initial P2,000 cash assistance each in the wake of the Luzon-wide lockdown.
Makati Mayor Abby Binay said on Wednesday, March 18, that the money will be given to 5,952 duly registered tricycle drivers in the country’s premiere business district. That’s equivalent to P11.904 million of Makati’s budget. 
""We empathize with the plight of our tricycle drivers who are now unable to earn for the daily subsistence of their own families due to the suspension of public transport operations nationwide. This initial cash relief is intended to help tide them over for the next two weeks,” Binay said in a statement. 
Tricycle drivers will soon be informed about how they will get the money. Binay said they are also preparing a financial package for jeepney drivers in Makati.  
Even before President Rodrigo Duterte placed Luzon island under lockdown, Binay already placed Makati under a state of calamity after the city recorded a total of 14 patients who tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. 
The mayor said on Tuesday, March 17, that one patient who had been confined at the Makati Medical Center has already recovered from COVID-19 and was discharged from the hospital.

The city also deployed buses to ferry Ospital ng Makati (OsMak) workers for free. The routes include Puregold to OsMak and vice versa, LRT Buendia station to Osmak and vice versa, and Waterfun C5 to Osmak and vice versa. 
As of 11 am on Wednesday, the Philippines has tallied a total of 193 cases of COVID-19, 14 of which were fatal. At least 7 patients have recovered. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – Filipinos traveling as tourists will not be allowed to leave the country during the duration of the Luzon lockdown, Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles said on Wednesday, March 18.  
“Filipinos who will go out as tourists to any destination shall not be allowed to leave the country,” Nograles said in a Laging Handa press briefing. Nograles is the spokesperson for the government’s coronavirus task force.
The measurement is an expansion of earlier travel restrictions put in place against Filipino tourists traveling amid the coronavirus pandemic.  
The Philippine government earlier limited all restricted travel to North Gyeongsang Province, including Daegu City and Cheongdo County in South Korea; as well as Hong Kong, Macau, and mainland China – ground zero of the coronavirus outbreak. 
The measures take effect after widespread confusion and several questions were raised after President Rodrigo Duterte delivered a briefing on government’s response to the coronavirus crisis on Monday night, March 16.  (READ: GUIDELINES: Luzon 'enhanced community quarantine')
Why this matters. The government has put in place strict social distancing measures, which include limiting the movement of people in Luzon, to prevent the further spread of the coronavirus. 
Part of this includes requiring more than 57 million residents in Luzon to stay home, unless they are among those part of skeleton work forces or were health workers, emergency services, and uniformed personnel involved in responding to the outbreak. 
Experts have pointed out the social distancing measure – defined as individuals keeping distance from one another – was crucial in preventing the spread of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.  
Health officials earlier reported a steep increase in infections with the number of confirmed cases in the Philippines spiking from 6 to 193 in less than two weeks. The confirmed cases included 14 deaths and 7 recoveries. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – All licensed physicians can now issue electronic prescriptions as the Philippines continues to face the novel coronavirus outbreak.
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Director General Eric Domingo signed FDA Circular No. 2020-007 on Tuesday, March 17, which authorizes doctors to issue electronic prescriptions through email or any other alternative mode considered as an acceptable electronic document under the Electronic Commerce Act of 2000.
Domingo said the FDA issued the circular to ""ensure access to prescription medicines and maintenance drugs for all individuals vulnerable to COVID-19,"" the disease caused by the coronavirus.
The same circular also orders all drugstores and pharmacies to recognize the validity of these electronic prescriptions. 
President Rodrigo Duterte already declared a state of calamity in the Philippines, where 193 people have so far tested positive for COVID-19. 
The entire island of Luzon is under a monthlong lockdown, where only one person per household is allowed to leave to buy supplies. 
Several local government units in the Visayas and Mindanao have also placed their respective areas under localized lockdowns. 
Who can issue an electronic prescription? Only duly licensed physicians can. The electronic prescription shall be deemed equivalent to a written prescription. 
Prescriptions for antibiotics, anti-infectives, and antiviral preparations will only be valid one week from issuance to the patient. 
What should patients look for in a valid electronic prescription? The FDA said all electronic prescriptions should have the following:

Name of the individual to whom the medicines or drugs are prescribed
Name of medicines or drugs prescribed
The dosage
All other ""pertinent matters"" similarly found in a written prescription

Doctors who will be issuing an electronic prescription should also put in these details:

Physician's name
Physician's digital signature
Physician's license number
Physician's Professional Tax Receipt, if applicable

Doctors should also keep records of all the electronic prescriptions they will be issuing. 
Does the patient have to be physically present to buy the medicines? No. The FDA said that if the person to whom the electronic prescription was given is vulnerable to COVID-19, then he or she may send a proxy instead. 
A proxy needs to bring a letter of authorization signed by the person who needs the medicines or drugs. If the person is a senior citizen or a person with disability (PWD), then the proxy should bring a copy of the senior citizen card or PWD card. – Rappler.com "

Provincial Governor Leopoldo Dominico Petilla signed Executive Order No. 03-2020-03 restricting entry into the province from midnight of March 18  to April 17. (READ: Coronavirus Outbreak | VISAYAS: Provinces, cities, towns on lockdown)
Only members of the Philippine National Police, Armed Forces of the Philippines, and health workers would be allowed to enter the province.Returning residents and people with essential travel are required to show proof of residency, employment, and necessity of business.Those eturning from other provinces are required to self-quarantine for 14 days. Border control manned by the military, police, and health and local government personnel will be set up in designated areas, while piers will be manned by the Philippine Coast Guards.The EO also suspended public gatherings including fiestas, assemblies, trade fairs, fund raising, and other public events until further notice.The provincial government required mass public transportation to observe safety measures in terminals and vehicles. This includes the provision of alcohol or hand sanitizers, and use of thermal scanners upon entrance. Passengers with above normal temperature may be denied entry. Those exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19 would be referred to the nearest medical centers.Private companies are also asked to enforce preventive and safety measures in the office.Municipalities and component cities are required to impose a curfew, although the EO did not specify the curfew hours. 
Tacloban City Mayor Alfred Romualdez, who was initially reluctant to impose the measure, declared a Tacloban lockdown starting Saturday, March 21.
“I would doubt very much if that virus is not yet here. Many had run here to Tacloban,” Romualdez said on Tuesday, March 17.
A lockdown EO from the Mayor’s office has yet to be released but Tacloban City Health Office Head Dr. Gloria Fabrigas said she supported the lockdown because of the uncertainty about people carrying the virus in the province.
“I signed another death certificate (with the cause of death) community acquired pneumonia with high risk of acute respiratory failure. So how will we know that these are not Covid-19 with this many [deaths],"" Fabrigas said during a press conference on Wednesday.

Photos from Henry dela Cruz Jr 
MANILA, Philippines – After mass transport was suspended due to the “enhanced” community quarantine imposed on Luzon, a leukemia patient from Antipolo City had to walk for hours to get his oral chemotherapy medication in Metro Manila.
A person diagnosed with Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia, 32-year-old Henry dela Cruz Jr had to make his way to the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office in Quezon City to claim a Guarantee Letter, a document he awaited for two months in order to obtain his medications.
But because of the lockdown implemented by the government to battle the spread of the coronavirus, his trip took a hard turn on Tuesday, March 17: he had no choice, but to walk for hours from Masinag in Antipolo City to Santolan, more than 5 kilometers away.
“Ang hirap para sa amin kasi we are caught in crossfire. As much as we are afraid na mahawa ng virus, wala din kaming choice (It’s hard for us because we are caught in the crossfire. As much as we are afraid to contract the virus, we have no choice),” he said, referring to the lockdown’s effects to sick individuals like him.
Anticipating the long journey ahead of him, Dela Cruz prepared a piece of paper with the words “Papuntang QC para sa aking chemo medicines. Makisakay po! (Going to Quezon City for my chemo medicines. Hoping to hitch a ride!)”
Dela Cruz took a photo of the paper on Monday evening, March 16, taking to social media to ask for people who could help him get to his destination. As of writing, the post has 1,500 reactions and 727 shares.

“Mahirap, lalo na para sa akin. Pero tiis lang talaga. Walang mangyayari sa akin kung ‘di ko susubukan. Wala akong iinumin, dahil maaaring magsara ang PCSO at [‘yung] pagkukuhanan ko ng gamot kapag nagpatuloy ang ECQ (enhanced community quarantine),” Dela Cruz added
(It’s hard, especially for me, but I need to endure this. Nothing will happen if I will not give it a try. I will have no medicine to take because PCSO and the place where I am obtaining my medications may possibly close if the ECQ will continue.)
Health Secretary Francisco Duque earlier said data they have gathered showed that the most vulnerable to the coronavirus disease are the elderly, and those with preexisting medical conditions like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, chronic lung disease, and immunosuppression.
While he was offered a ride to Santolan by a certain “Jhay” to bring him to his destination, Dela Cruz said making his way to Quezon City would have been easier only if the government had laid down clear guidelines and measures for the lockdown.
“Ang nangyayari kasi, parang hindi pinag-isipan at walang safety net para sa mga ganitong sitwasyon. Kahit pa sabihin nilang malayang makakapunta ang mga kagaya kong may medical na pangangailangan sa Metro Manila, ang kawalan naman ng transportasyon ay malaking balakid sa amin, na hindi naman kataasan ang antas sa buhay,” he added.
(It seems that their measures are not well-thought out and there is no safety net for this kind of situation. Even if they’re saying that we can freely go, the lack of transportation is a big hurdle for those like me who need medical attention but are not that privileged in life.)
Dela Cruz said he embarked on a jeep from his home in Barangay Mambugan at around 6 am, but eventually decided to walk even when there were concerned individuals who offered him a ride because of the traffic build-up near the checkpoint areas. He reached Santolan past 9 am.
“No choice. Lakad talaga. Kaya ginawa ko din ‘yung placard. Inasahan ko na ang magulong sistema at mapipilitan akong maglakad talaga (No choice. I had to walk. That’s why I also made the placard. I expected the chaotic system. I was forced to walk in the end),” Dela Cruz lamented.

 
Aside from the trip to the PCSO for his guarantee letter, Dela Cruz once again had to walk to Globo Asiatico in Maginhawa, where he could finally get his oral chemotherapy medication.
Lockdown’s effects
While Dela Cruz was able to get his meds in the end, he said the government’s “confusing and unclear” guidelines on the community quarantine further aggravated the plight of Filipinos. (READ: [OPINION] The out-of-touch, elitist gaps in our lockdown)
“Nangangamba na ako dahil ‘yung unang community quarantine sa Metro Manila ay hindi maayos at walang maayos na guidelines (I was fearful because the first community quarantine in Metro Manila had confusing guidelines),” he said.
Dela Cruz said some government agencies providing social services were affected by the lockdown, especially workers who struggled to go to their offices due to problems encountered at checkpoints. (READ: LIST: How to help healthcare workers, frontliners during coronavirus pandemic)
Outpouring of help
Wanting to show his journey amid the Luzon quarantine, he narrated in his Facebook posts how long it took before he finally obtained the document he was requesting and the oral drugs needed for his medication.

 
He said he was overwhelmed with the outpouring of support, especially those coming from strangers. (READ: Staying compassionate in a time of coronavirus) 
“Masaya [ako] dahil marami ang handang tumulong at nakikisimpatiya sa kalagayan ng mga maralita at gaya kong may medikal na pangangailangan... Nagulat ako na habang naglalakad ako ay madami na ang nag-aalok ng tulong,” Dela Cruz added.
(I’m happy because there are lot of people who are willing to help and sympathize with the plight of the poor and those with medical needs like me...I was shocked while walking as a lot of people offered me a ride.)
Through his experience, Dela Cruz hopes that the government will put measures in place that will consider the situation of marginalized sectors, especially in the middle of the coronavirus outbreak.
“[Sa gobyerno,] sana ‘wag nilang kalimutan ang mga gaya namin. Wala kaming angal sa pagpapatupad ng ECQ as long as may malinaw na polisiya at guidelines para sa lahat, kasama ang mga nasa laylayan at may mga pangangailangang medikal,” he added.
(To the government, I hope that they will not neglect us. We are not against the quarantine as long as there are clear policy and guidelines for all, including those in the margins of our society and people having medical needs.)
Several local government units have stepped up to provide transport options amid the Luzon lockdown, offering rides to stranded commuters, workers, and frontliners.

(READ: FALSE: Gargling salt water 'eliminates' coronavirus) 
The DOH official explained there was ""no special formula"" that was applied to the 7 patients who recovered from COVID-19.
Vergeire said the medical facilities where the patients were confined only gave them supportive treatment based on their symptoms. She added that none of the recoveries had preexisting medical conditions before they caught the virus.
""So kung sinuman ang naka-recover sa atin, they were only provided in the different facilities...ng supportive treatment po para sa kung anuman ang kanilang nararanasan o nararamdaman.... So wala pong naging special formula para naka-recover 'yung mga taong ito,"" Vergeire said.

Health experts in the Philippines and the World Health Organization (WHO) have estimated as many as 75,000 people could get COVID-19 by June if it is not properly contained.

MANILA, Philippines – A normal day for nurse Cristy Donguines starts with a two-hour commute from her Bulacan home to her workplace in Sta Cruz, Manila. 
In different and much calmer times, the long travels in the past 17 years to and from the government-run Jose R. Reyes Memorial Medical Center (JRRMMC) were already part of her daily sacrifice.
But with the outbreak of the novel coronavirus in the Philippines and the subsequent lockdown of Metro Manila and the island of Luzon, Cristy also has to contend with the daily risk of being infected. After all, having to take 6 public utility vehicles each day just to reach her destination and get back home exposes her to these risks.
Cristy said she does not want to harm herself, her loved ones, and patients at the 75-year-old hospital, many of them coming from Manila's poorest communities. As of Monday, March 16, there has been no confirmed case in their hospital just two minutes away from the Department of Health (DOH) headquarters.  
But self-quarantine – usually lasting 14 days – is almost out of the question, given the already thin workforce and the vague assurances of assistance from no less than the DOH. There's little comfort, aggravated by the measly salaries of government nurses that range from P19,000 to P25,000, depending on salary grade.
""Walang malinaw na alituntunin regarding sa leave credits kung ma-quarantine kami,"" she said. ""Walang sinasabi kung ito po ba ay ibabawas sa current numbers namin o hindi. Paano kung mag-positive kami?""
(There are no clear guidelines regarding our leave credits if we go on self-quarantine. They don't tell us if it's going to be deducted from our current number or not, What if we get the virus?)
At JRRMMC, where there are 485 doctors and 366 nurses, hospital staff have also been asked to improvise with their protective gears.
Cristy said they were told to transform cloth like linen into face masks, even if there has been no evidence of it being a sufficient protection against the virus. Still, it’s better than wearing nothing while dealing with patients every day. 
""Kami na ang hahanap ng paraan kasi iyong government, hanggang salita ang ginagawa nila, hindi sila gumagawa ng action para bigyan kami ng sinasabi nilang sapat na supply,"" Cristy said. (We are the ones looking for ways to address the problem because the government, they're all talk, they don't do anything to give us enough supply.)
""Paano kung magkasakit kami, paano iyong pamilya namin, makakasigurado ba kami na mapapakain sila ng tatlong beses sa isang araw?"" she said. ""Hindi naman makatarungan ito.""
(What if we get sick? How about our families? Are there assurances from the government that they will be fed 3 times a day? This is not fair.)
Cristy, unfortunately, is not alone in her predicament; nor is her experience unique. Health workers on the frontlines across the Philippines are put in a perilous situation where compromise and sacrifice are the name of the game, for the benefit of the public they serve. 
LEADING. The Philippine General Hospital is where many of the country's poorest sectors go to seek medical help. File photo by LeAnne Jazul/Rappler 
Philippine General Hospital  
A little over 5 kilometers away from JRRMMC is the Philippine General Hospital (PGH), one of the country's largest government health facilities, where long lines at the outpatient department or the crowded emergency room and wards are a common sight.
PGH, after all, is where many of the country’s indigents flock to, braving long commutes from their provinces to get much needed medical assistance. On average, the PGH outpatient department sees around 3,000 patients a day. On an annual basis, the hospital services at least 600,000 to 800,000 patients.
On Tuesday morning, March 17, nurse Marie (not her real name) finished her 12-hour overnight duty and stepped out into a city where mass transportation is prohibited, in accordance with the enhanced community quarantine that President Rodrigo Duterte declared the day before.
It had been a long night for Marie, who handles patients under investigation (PUIs) for novel coronavirus at PGH. She is one of the only 3 nurses per 12-hour shift in her group that receives patients referred to by the ER staff. 
As of posting, PGH has had one confirmed case, 8 admitted PUIs, and had already sent home 34 PUIs showing mild symptoms. That night, Marie handled a patient who tested negative. 
She just wanted to go home and prepare until her next shift in two days. Yet the jeepneys and buses that normally traverse Taft Avenue and contribute to the usual traffic were nowhere to be seen. 
Marie tried hailing cabs, as ride-sharing applications didn't work, but not one wanted to give her a ride home out of fear of being apprehended by authorities. Philippine National Police Chief General Archie Gamboa had ordered the arrest of ""disobedient"" drivers.
Local government units were given the responsibility of setting up transportation for health workers in their jurisdiction. But during the first 7 hours of the lockdown, no help was in sight, at least at PGH.
Fortunately, before giving up hope and starting what could be a two-hour walk, a tricycle driver took pity and offered his services. But he could only take Marie until Welcome Rotonda, the border between Quezon City and Manila.
She held her breath throughout the 5.9-kilometer ride inside the clanky metal sidecar, through roads not normally meant for tricycles, away from the eyes of law enforcers.
""Hindi lang life ko ang at risk, pati ang buhay niya kasi sobrang delikado iyong ginawa namin, pero ang hirap na kasi, baka gusto rin kasi niya kumita (We placed both our lives at risk because it was very dangerous, but it's so hard, and maybe he wanted income),"" she said.
Getting home should have been the least concern for Marie, or any of the health workers. But the latest pronouncements of the national government that caused confusion among many Filipinos have been an added burden to the frontliners.
""Nagpapatupad sila ng protocols na walang proper guidelines (They implemented protocols without proper guidelines), we're left and living in the dark,"" she said. ""We don't know how we'll get to work, how we'll get home, and how we'll be safe in between.""

Only line of defense 
If the serious lack of proper guidelines wasn't enough, public hospitals also have to face and deal with long-standing issues that should have been better handled by the national government. 
The problems – from lack of basic medical supplies to understaffed health facilities – become all the more glaring and hard to ignore amid the novel coronavirus outbreak that is threatening the nation.
Marie recalled how during the first few days of the outbreak, fear was palpable among health workers in PGH buildings that had previously seen the horrors of World War II. There was a general lack of information on the novel coronavirus that had already affected thousands in several countries, especially China. 
""After the news na sa floor namin na-admit yung isang PUI, it was scary,"" she said. ""We have general information about it pero iyong kung gaano katagal nag-stay sa air, parang sobrang limited ang information kasi bago pa iyong virus.""
(After the news that the first PUI was admitted in our floor, it was scary because we didn't know how it was transmitted. We have general information about it but information on how it stays in the air, things like that, were so limited because the virus was still new.)
Aside from the vague protocols, especially on how to handle patients suffering from the virus, personal protective equipment (PPEs) were running low. Their supplies had been almost depleted in the aftermath of the Taal eruption.
In the beginning, they were given two face masks to be used for one week. Staff were eventually provided one box good for a week – at least 52 pieces to be shared by 3 nurses, two assistants, and one utility worker.
""Protection-wise, hirap na hirap na kami kasi (we're having a really hard time),"" she said. ""We're worried that we'll get sick or we might bring home this virus.""
""We already are worrying about taking care of patients, tapos madadagdagan pa ng burden na hindi namin alam kung ang families ba namin ay safe at kung makakauwi ba kami sa kanila (Then there's the added burden of making sure our families are safe and worrying if we'll get home safe to them),"" Marie added.
With PPEs running low, it's still vague for many health workers at PGH how they'll go on in the coming days, as the number of confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus is expected to rise. 
""It's very frustrating kasi walang guidelines, walang help from the government na nare-receive right now (no guidelines, no help from the government),"" Marie said. 
Mark (not his real name), a resident doctor at PGH who asked not to be named, said masks and alcohol are their ""only line of defense at the moment.""
“We are grateful for those who have donated, but there still remains a shortage of the said materials,” he said, adding that full gowns and headgears are reserved for workers directly supervising people suspected of carrying the virus. 
Some organizations have taken it upon themselves to address the problem government health workers are facing. 
The student council of the University of the Philippines Manila, the institution that operates PGH, started a donation drive for health masks and other basic hospital needs. (READ: How to help healthcare workers, frontliners during coronavirus pandemic)

Not enough manpower
Beyond the lack of basic supplies, one glaring characteristic of the country's healthcare system is the lack of manpower. 
There are about 721 public hospitals, with at least 3,131 doctors and 5,975 nurses. Many of them are underpaid, compared to their counterparts abroad, with an entry-level nurse earning P15,000.
The current roster pegs the ratio of government doctors to population at 1:33,909 – far from the ideal 1:20,000 – and 1:17,769 for nurses.
""Some of our colleagues have fallen ill and are warranted to go on a 14-day quarantine, thinning out our workforce,"" Mark said, adding that this has pushed residents to their limit.
On a normal day, there are about 10 nurses assigned at the PGH ER while the number of doctors varies, depending on the day's load. 
The management suspended its outpatient services to deploy some workers to other wards. It has also welcomed over 100 interns who volunteered, despite an earlier suspension of internship programs.
The mass transportation may lead to more problems, however. In fact, two of Marie's colleagues were barred from crossing the QC-Manila border even if they showed their IDs. They were just told by authorities to walk the distance to PGH – a near-impossible task as much as it was ridiculous, especially under the heat of the sun.
In the end, they were left with no choice but to go home, possibly missing a day's wage.
Helping themselves
In Quezon City, health department head Dr Esperanza Arias said that hospitals are augmenting their staff by pulling in personnel from other departments. They are filling in the slots left by those assigned to an isolated area where patients suspected of having the coronavirus are being held.
The city was also able to procure several PPEs before the threats of the virus increased in the metro. 
""Sabi namin, kumuha na kami kasi (We said we should already get because) if we will not be able to use them now, we will still find use for it, in case,"" she said.
Local governments outside Luzon are also preparing for a possible increase in confirmed cases. 
Beyond Metro Manila
Dr Leonell Quitos is no stranger to the issues faced by government hospitals, having just completed his fellowship in Adult Infectious Diseases at PGH in 2019. 
The 33-year-old is now on the frontlines as the only infectious diseases specialist in Iligan City in Northern Mindanao, doing his best – along with at least 300 doctors – to protect a population of at least 342,618 people against the coronavirus.
""Iyong problems noon, nakikita ko pa rin ngayon (The problems I saw then, I still see today),"" he said. 
As the city is placed under a state of calamity over its first confirmed case, Quitos and his colleagues are working double time to manage the situation, including a plan to set up a hospital solely for suspect cases.
On top of doing rounds, Quitos has been reaching out to officials to see their plans through. 
He takes calls from colleagues and even the occasional media while driving to meetings – one of the few moments he's free. 
""Sama-sama natin tapusin itong problema (Let's work together to end this problem), they will be properly compensated,"" he added, urging doctors and workers to join them.
Megan (not her real name), a health practitioner also in Iligan City meanwhile, said doctors are trying to raise funds to be able to buy them in bulk for distribution to all health workers.
""The implication is the fear, especially if you don't have masks or alcohol, some doctors are thinking of not holding clinic hours anymore, including those who are not working directly with departments against the virus but are still exposed nonetheless,"" she said.

Too many lives at stake
There is much to be desired in the way the Philippine health system is handling the novel coronavirus outbreak, and the ball is in the court of the national government. 
On Twitter, PGH consultant neurosurgeon Dr Ronnie Baticulon acknowledged that many health workers are afraid of what could possibly happen in the near future because they’ve seen this health care system let them down before. 
“Too much, too many lives are at stake,"" he wrote. 
Marie of PGH will go on shift Thursday. To avoid more problems, she already asked help from her barangay, requesting a shuttle service to her hospital. But not all have the same cooperative and helpful local officials.
To address this, PGH started a carpool system. Dormitories have already been prepared for some health workers, though Marie admits that it will most likely not benefit all those in need. 
But she said PGH is now handling the situation better than before, even without direct help from the national government.
For Cristy of JRRMMC, however, the following days don't show reason for optimism. 
""Ina-accommodate namin pa rin ang mga taong pumupunta sa ospital as much as possible, kahit kami mismo hirap na hirap na rin, kasi pasyente iyan eh na dapat bigyan ng treatment na nararapat sa kanila,"" she said. 
""Pero gustuhin man namin na ibigay ang lahat, hindi namin kayang kumilos na 100% kasi hindi sapat ang pangangailangan ng mga ospital.""
(We accommodate those who go to the hospital as much as possible, even if we're having difficulty, because those are patients who need treatment. But even if we want to give them our all, we can't do so 100% because hospital supplies are inadequate.)
Clearly they need help. – Rappler.com

PAMPANGA, Philippines – The Clark Freeport Zone (CFZ) here and the Subic Bay Freeport Zone (SBFZ) in nearby Zambales province both shut their doors to foreign and local tourists in compliance with Malacanang’s Luzon-wide lockdown to stop the spread of the novel coronavirus.
“Effective on 18 March 2020, only employees in specific business enterprises will be allowed to and from the Freeport. These include workers in the food sector (groceries, supermarkets, duty free shops, convenience stores), gasoline stations, clinics and hospitals, drug stores, banks, payment and remittance centers, waste management (garbage collection), utility companies (power, water, telcos), logistics, grounds maintenance (street sweeping, grass cutting), BPOs and manufacturing,” the Clark Development Corporation (CDC) said in a press release emailed to Rappler. 
The CDC ordered on Wednesday, March 18, the closure of CFZ’s Sapang Bato and Don Juico Avenue’s gates, both located in Angeles City. The main gate, Friendship Road gate, Mabalacat gate, and the 2 entrance points from the Subic-Clark-Tarlac Expressways remain open.
President Rodrigo Duterte ordered Monday, March 16, the Luzon-wide lockdown, which the government called enhanced community quarantine.
Housed inside freeport
The government-owned and controlled corporation also said that business process outsourcing and manufacturing companies must provide housing to their workers inside this free port.
It urged locators and stakeholders to use the CDC online services for their transactions. 
“In a bid to discourage personal appearances for transactions and processing of documents in CDC offices, the state-owned firm is encouraging locators and stakeholders utilize the online services of CDC and other forms of communication such as telephones, email, and teleconferences,” it said.
In the SBFZ, the Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority announced the strict checking of vehicles and its occupants at the Tipo gate, Rizal gate, 14th St. gate, Kalaklan gate and Morong gate of the free port.
The SBMA said that in its public advisory on the implementation of the enhanced community quarantine that only employees of businesses providing basic necessities like food and medicines will be allowed to enter SBFZ.
It said that workers of business process outsourcing and export-oriented industries will also be allowed inside the free port if their companies would provide their housing needs.
“Business process outsourcing and export-oriented industries shall remain operational, provided that strict social distancing measures are observed and that their respective personnel shall be given appropriate temporary accommodation arrangements by March 18, 2020,” the SBMA said.
The SBMA also announced that its Pass and ID Division would issue SBMA identification cards to free port employees only until March 18. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – Filipinos abroad and their families, and permanent residents can return to the Philippines  even while Luzon is on lockdown, Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles said on Wednesday, March 18.  
Nograles, spokesperson of the Inter-Agency Task Force on the novel coronavirus outbreak, made the clarification during a Laging Handa briefing after restrictions were put in place to prohibit land, air, and sea travel from Luzon. 
“Filipinos abroad can return to the Philippines anytime, including their foreign spouse and children. Other permanent residents of the Philippines may also return,” Nograles said.  
A memorandum issued by Malacañang hours before the lockdown also said holders of diplomat visas issued by the Philippine government will be allowed to enter, subject to quarantine measures. 
What to expect. Filipinos returning from China, Hong Kong, and Macau will be made to undergo a mandatory 14-day quarantine in a government-designated facility, while those arriving from other countries will be required to undergo home quarantine.  
Nograles likewise reiterated overseas Filipino workers, balikbayans, and foreigners leaving the Philippines from Luzon will be allowed to continue with their trips during the lockdown. He added that they will need to provide proof that their departure is 24 hours from the time they leave their homes or hotels. 
People who are traveling to any international airport in Luzon to catch a flight will be allowed only one companion.
Why this matters. The Philippine government has put in place strict social distancing measures, which include limiting the movement of people in Luzon, to prevent the further spread of the new coronavirus. 
Health officials earlier reported a steep increase in infections with the number of confirmed cases in the Philippines spiking from 6 to 193 in less than two weeks. The confirmed cases included 14 deaths and 7 recoveries.  
The increase in cases prompted President Rodrigo Duterte to declare “enhanced community quarantine” measures be imposed on the entirety of Luzon starting midnight of Tuesday, March 17 until April 12. He also placed the country under a state of calamity. (READ: GUIDELINES: Luzon 'enhanced community quarantine') – Rappler.com "

Disclaimer: Our aim is not to spread further discord and distrust in our government and jail personnel in the time of the coronavirus crisis. We believe that they are doing their best efforts given the dire circumstances. However, we felt that no one is paying attention to the plight of the Persons Deprived of Liberty (PDLs) and we are compelled to share our research on the best practices in other jurisdictions to guide our policy makers.Disclaimer:
The Philippine government placed the entire Metro Manila under “enhanced community quarantine.” The Philippine Supreme Court issued a circular suspending all court hearings. The Bureau of Jail Management and Penology (BJMP) has suspended all jail visitations nationwide. These are all pre-emptive steps to slow down the spread of the novel coronavirus that infected hundreds of people in the Philippines and hundreds of thousands worldwide. CROWDED. Social distancing is impossible in the Philippines' jails. Photo by Jean Paul Caelen
Indeed, one of the most susceptible areas to the spread of the virus is the jails and prisons. With an overcrowding rate of 350%, the Philippines has the most congested correctional system in the world. If one of the PDLs gets infected in the congested jails, it could be a catastrophe. Our jail staff would be tremendously strained to handle the infection once it starts. Despite their best efforts and even in normal circumstances, they lack medical facilities and doctors to handle routine health problems. We have recently witnessed jail unrest in more resource-endowed jail and prison facilities in Italy and the US. We are not sure what the outcome would be if similar unrest began in the Philippine correctional system.
A temporary relief could be the granting of medical furlough to first-time, low-risk, non-violent, and bailable offenders for humanitarian considerations. PDLs who are charged with offenses such as gambling, theft of less than a thousand pesos, drug use, etc., especially those who are old (above 60 years old) and sickly, could be prioritized for release. These are PDLs that, with money and resources, could have bailed out and could have been released, but largely due to poverty, they are languishing in our jails while undergoing prolonged trials. 
CROWDED. Social distancing is impossible in the Philippines' jails. Photo by Jean Paul Caelen 
The BJMP could initiate the process by writing a letter to the Supreme Court on its assessment of the current jail health capacities. The Supreme Court-Office of Court Administrator could then utilize this as a basis for corrective action. A Supreme Court Circular could then be issued where the jail wardens nationwide would be able to identify first-time, low-risk, non-violent, bailable offenders for release. The Public Attorney’s Office, could also make a national pleading on behalf of all the PDLs, similar to what was done in other jurisdictions. The list could then be submitted to the respective judges, and the judges, using their sound discretion could release the PDLs on their own self-recognizance, or even on “One-Peso Bail.” As a condition, the PDLs could provide a promise to appear on the court-appointed dates. The wardens would get their addresses and the contact information of their relatives for monitoring.  
These low risk PDLs are not a threat to public safety. Releasing them would ease the over-congestion in our jails. This would give a better chance for our jail staff to concentrate their resources on recidivists, higher risk, violent, and non-bailable offenders (who are also still presumed innocent). By keeping them all in jail at the moment places them in a susceptible condition to acquire the coronavirus. In our over-congested jail, this will be tantamount to a death sentence. Releasing low risk, first-time, non-violent bailable offenders under this medical furlough remedy could be our best chance to avert this incoming tragedy.

,"March 18, 2020",nCov,[OPINION] Thoughtless and callous: Is the coronavirus bringing out the worst in us?,Jayeel Cornelio,"
 
 
Crises are supposed to bring out the best in us. 
In our experience as a nation, our virtuous spirit has shone through many times during earthquakes, typhoons, and other disasters. 
Think about it. Volunteerism is alive whether it’s among the youth, the religious, or neighbors in a community. Whenever donation drives are organized, we can expect even strangers to pitch in.
Indeed, it’s during extraordinary circumstances when the values that truly define our relationships emerge.  
At the same time, however, extraordinary circumstances bring out the worst in us as a people. 
From a sociological perspective, the reason is not that people are inherently selfish.
It is because of inequality. In our society, social divisions are undeniable and the moral views to which we subscribe are necessarily shaped by our privileges and limitations. 
Unfortunately, these views color the way we see each other. COVID-19 has rendered this far more visible.
The celebrities among us
Celebrities became moralists overnight. A statement, echoed by a few of them, went viral:
“To those who are complaining about the quarantine period and curfews, just remember that your grandparents were called to war; you are being called to sit on the couch and watch Netflix. You can do this.”
Lea Salonga and James Deakin were heavily criticized for what came across as insensitive remarks. Responding to criticisms, Deakin asserted that he was referring a to a specific group of non-essential workers. It was, of course, too late a defense. (READ: [OPINION] The out-of-touch, elitist gaps in our lockdown)
Other influencers gave it a religious meaning. 
Iza Calzado commented on Lea Salonga’s post: “I agree with this and have been thinking about how the COVID-19 situation is actually the Universe’s way of making the world a better place moving forward. Praying for the best.” 
Martin Nievera offered 3 praying hands and a heart. 
Admirers came to their defense, demanding that people should shut up. In two different videos, a teenager ranted about the government’s vocal critics who, in her view, should “shut up” and “wash your hands” because “this will pass.” She wanted all of us to “be encouraging to one another” and “cooperate with the government” because “writing isn’t gonna help anyone.” (READ: [OPINION] Loving your country is very different from loving your government)
Lost in their moralism was the state of the working class.
Failure of leadership
Questioning this government does not mean the critical among us wish the virus to continue spreading.
Whenever we ask questions or make comments it is because we believe that things could be (so much) better.
It’s not as if we don’t know what we’re talking about.
Medical practitioners have turned to social media because that is the only platform where they feel they could be heard. On Twitter, Dr. Gia Sison, for example, was compelled to negate Panelo’s claim that bananas will kill the coronavirus.  
And yet one does not even have to be an expert to realize that the government’s drastic policies were bound to fail. Did the cabinet secretaries really expect that locking down the capital without giving ample time to transition was going to succeed?
Managing change is both an art and a skill that people who work with communities know very well. 
Truth be told, people do understand that placing everyone on quarantine is necessary. To do so is more urgent now that data scientists project that 26,000 might be infected by the end of March.
But no one can make sense of it if even the president himself does not know how to speak intelligibly. Worse, Panelo, his insufferable spokesperson, spreads fake news.  
The anxieties people now feel derive precisely from the failure of leadership. That our leaders took a while to prepare for the problem is in itself an indication of this failure. 
The result: chaos. 
Tragedy
“In times of crisis, we must all decide again and again whom we love.” These are the words of Frank O’ Hara, an American poet, in Meditations in an Emergency. 
Although written more than 60 years ago, these words ring true. The only difference is that in our present context, some of us have decided that some are worth loving more than others.
This is the blind spot that comes with thoughtless and callous remarks. The words of Cat Arambulo-Antonio are telling. Upon seeing the news about people at checkpoints, the blogger exclaimed,  “Why don’t you motherfuckers just stay at home?”
What a tragic mistake.
It’s not that Filipinos are undisciplined. The problem is that the most vulnerable among us already bear the brunt of ill-conceived policies. 
These are the poor and the working class — those who struggle on a daily basis to make ends meet. That’s why they’re still in the streets, a reality that the privileged will never understand.
In the final analysis, the COVID-19 crisis — a decisive moment that should have brought out the best in us — has only sharpened the division in our society. 
The privileged few are watching Netflix. The rest are stuck at the borders. – Rappler.com

(What if there's an emergency, especially in places only tricycles can reach? Even if we have our Libreng Sakay program, it's not enough.)
""Let us also remember that not everyone has access to private cars. Not to mention that sharing private, enclosed vehicles may actually be more conducive to the spread of the virus, as compared to a tricycle with a maximum of two passengers.""
""Sana makita po ng mga ginagalang nating lider na may perspektibo kami sa local government unit na maaaring 'di nakikita mula sa mas mataas.""
(I hope our esteemed leaders would see that we in the local government unit have a perspective that might not be visible from a higher vantage point.)
""I am not yet even considering the social and economic effects of prohibiting tricycles. We are talking about the potential damage to public health and a possible loss of lives,"" Sotto concluded.
Sotto on Tuesday, March 17, said he would allow tricycles to make limited trips around Pasig to service essential workers and commuters needing to buy food or seek treatment at hospitals or health centers. They are, after all, exempted from President Rodrigo Duterte's lockdown order.
However, the national government insisted on the total ban of public transportation, which includes tricycles, under pain of prosecution.
In Pasig, where many neighborhood streets are too narrow for other modes of transport, tricycles are the most common and least expensive way of getting from door to door, as opposed to jeepneys that have set routes and are confined to main thoroughfares.
The city government is using its public buses and other vehicles to service exempted workers and commuters on essential travel, but Sotto said these are not enough to accommodate everyone.

'Community quarantine'
Duterte placed Metro Manila on lockdown beginning Sunday, March 15, and then the rest of Luzon starting Tuesday, cutting public transportation and urging businesses to downscale operations to discourage people from moving around.
The ""enhanced community quarantine"" of Metro Manila is set until April 14. For the rest of Luzon, it's until April 12.
The measure exempts health workers, security forces, media personnel, and employees of essential services such as groceries, drugstores, and local governments. It also allows people to buy food and supplies, and to travel for health reasons.
On Tuesday, the first day of the stricter lockdown, droves of people struggled to catch rides, forcing many to walk all the way to their destinations.
Some local governments and agencies such as the Office of the Vice President have deployed vehicles to service commuters who have legitimate reasons to travel during the lockdown.
The government hopes to quell the coronavirus by limiting the movement of people, urging them to stay home and practice ""social distancing,"" or keeping at least a meter away from one another to avoid contagion.
As of Wednesday, the Philippines has had 193 confirmed cases of infection, 14 deaths, and 7 recoveries. Experts from the country and the World Health Organization estimate that cases could peak to 75,000 by June if not properly contained.

MANILA, Philippines – China will donate thousands of testing kits, protective equipment, and masks to the Philippines to aid frontline workers in responding to the novel coronavirus, Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr said on Wednesday, March 18. 
Locsin made the announcement on Twitter, saying Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi informed him that China has allotted 100,000 testing kits, 10,000 N95 masks, 10,000 personal protective equipment sets, and 100,000 surgical masks for the country. 
""Notifying DOH. Notifying Customs of perishability of kits and imperative of cold temperature. Thank you, my brother,"" Locsin tweeted on Wednesday.  
Locsin said China would transport the items through a chartered flight, though it was unclear when the donations would arrive.
""I am asked to please alert Customs to let donation through pronto – and the rest of the bureaucracy not to throw a monkey wrench,"" he added.  
Locsin had earlier said that masks and protective equipment were supposedly stuck at the Bureau of Customs warehouses, prompting the finance department to clarify that the delays were due to suppliers, not the BOC.

China earlier donated 2,000 ""high-tech fast test kits"" while Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said another 10,000 such kits were expected to arrive on Wednesday. 
Additional test kits are expected to aid health workers in testing more people for COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. The Philippines’ testing capacity is currently limited as the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) in Muntinlupa – the country's main testing hub – can only test some 300 people daily. 
With the lack of test kits, health officials rationed available kits to more urgent cases or patients who were showing more severe symptoms of the disease. 
The World Health Organization earlier urged countries to test ""every suspected case"" of coronavirus, as this was the ""backbone"" of response to the pandemic.  
The Philippines has recorded at least 193 cases of the coronavirus, including 14 deaths. The confirmed cases include 7 recoveries.  
President Rodrigo Duterte earlier declared a state of calamity in the Philippines as cases of COVID-19 continued to increase. 
Worldwide, the death toll due to the disease surpassed 7,800 cases while over 189,600 people were infected across 146 countries. More than 68,000 have since recovered from the coronavirus. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – The administration of President Rodrigo Duterte will be borrowing some $1 billion or around P51 billion to combat the novel coronavirus pandemic.
In a text message to reporters, Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III said they are negotiating the terms, but declined to say whether the loan would come from a multilateral lender or another country.
The amount is on top of the P27.1-billion package previously announced by the economic team.
The borrowing comes at a time when government revenues are projected to drop by over P91 billion due to weaker economic activity.
The Philippines already secured a $3-million grant (P45 million) from the Asian Development Bank, mainly for emergency medical supplies and delivery of health care services. 
The World Bank has also earmarked a $100-million (P520 million) fast-track loan to the Philippines to enable the Department of Health to procure personal protective equipment for health care workers, along with testing and laboratory materials, quarantine areas, isolation rooms, and other essential equipment.
As of last week, the government projected that the pandemic would shave a full percentage point off the Philippines' economic growth in 2020. The tourism sector is the hardest hit among all sectors.
Assuming that the economic impact of the virus would last until June, economic managers foresee the country's budget deficit hitting as high as 3.6% of gross domestic product. – Rappler.com "

DOH Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said on Wednesday, March 18, that this was the projection of experts from the DOH, WHO, and Filipino epidemiologists based on the total number of cases recorded worldwide, which currently stands at over 189,000.  
“Ang ibig sabihin ng 75,000 na ito, that in two to 3 months, it can reach that peak kung saan 75,000 ang puwedeng magkaroon ng infection. Pero sinasabi natin na we can flatten this curve, meaning kaya natin pigilan ang ganitong numero,” Vergeire said during the “Laging Handa” press briefing aired on state-run PTV-4.

(This means that in the next two to 3 months, the positive cases can peak wherein 75,000 may possibly get infected. But we're also saying that we can flatten this curve, meaning we can stop this number from becoming reality.)
“Ito po ay isang modeling estimate na ginawa po ng ating mga eksperto kasama ang WHO, ang ating mga epidemiologists dito sa ating bansa. At sinasabi po na ang 75,000 ay aabutin natin kung hindi tayo maglalagay ng interventions na appropriate,” the DOH official added.
(This is a modeling estimate that we did along with experts from the WHO and our epidemiologists here in our country. We're saying that we could reach 75,000 cases if we do not put proper interventions.)
Their findings showed it was possible for one patient with COVID-19, the disease caused by novel coronavirus, to infect two persons “in just one sitting.” 
“Ito po ay nakuha natin base po doon sa statistics na mayroon tayo ngayon among all cases across the globe na sinasabi po na puwedeng magkaroon ng reproductive rate ang ating virus ng one person can transmit it to two persons in just one sitting. So isang interaction po ng isang tao,” added the DOH official.
(We got this based on the statistics we have so far among all cases across the globe, which says the virus can have a reproductive rate wherein one person can transmit it to two persons in just one sitting. So that's just based on one interaction of one person.) 
Data scientists Christopher Monterola and Erika Fille Legara have also computed that 26,000 patients in the Philippines could get COVID-19 by the end of March alone if its random spread is not contained. 
Still, Vergeire said it is possible to slow down the rate at which people get sick – what experts call as “flattening the curve” – as long as strict measures are implemented to contain the spread. 
“Puwede natin i-spread into many months 'yan if only we can implement stringent measures katulad nitong social distancing na sinasabi natin. (We can spread out the infections into many months, but only if we can implement stringent measures like social distancing),” she said. 
President Rodrigo Duterte already declared a state of calamity in the Philippines as the COVID-19 cases continue to rise, with total infections now at 193 with 14 deaths and 7 recoveries. 
The President also placed the entire island of Luzon on lockdown, where all residents are ordered to stay home unless deemed by necessary under the guidelines set by the national government’s inter-agency task force.
Several provinces, cities, and municipalities in the Visayas and Mindanao have also declared localized lockdowns and placed their localities under a state of calamity.

MANILA, Philippines – Business tycoon Manny Pangilinan approved the advanced release of 13th month pay for employees of some of his businesses to ease their burden due to the novel coronavirus pandemic. 
In a tweet on Tuesday, March 17, Pangilinan said employees of PLDT, Smart, and Manila Electric Company (Meralco) will receive their 13th month pay in advance.
Other companies will continue to receive salaries and benefits. Vacation and sick leaves will not be used up.
Pangilinan said that employees, especially field personnel, will receive vitamins. Around 500,000 tablets are set to be delivered starting Wednesday, March 18.
Work-from-home arrangements are also being set up across the conglomerate.
The Pangilinan group of companies heeded President Rodrigo Duterte's call to help out the government in cushioning the impact of the coronavirus.
Its health workers have been sent to various areas. Face masks and other medical equipment were donated as well.
""The group will be helping frontliners by donating an initial supply of alcohol of 4,000 liters from Roxas Holdings for government and group hospitals by tomorrow (March 18). We will be raising more funds to help in the coming days,"" Pangilinan said in a tweet.

MANILA, Philippines – Only one person per household will be allowed to leave to purchase necessities during lockdown, Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles said on Wednesday, March 18.
""Only one person per household will be able to buy or access basic necessities,"" Nograles said during a Laging Handa press briefing. Nograles also stands as the spokesperson of the government's Inter-Agency Task Force on handling the coronavirus outbreak.
This does not mean that one person will be identified and fixed as the only one allowed to go out, but that only one person per household can leave for needs at a time, aside from members who are out for work. (READ: GUIDELINES: Luzon 'enhanced community quarantine')
Why does this matter? The announcement comes as the government heightens measures to prevent the further spread of the coronavirus, which already threatens the entire Metro Manila and which warranted a lockdown over the island region of Luzon.
Limiting the persons outside maximizes the opportunity for social distancing – the act of keeping distance from other people to prevent the spread of diseases, including COVID-19, disease caused by the coronavirus.
How will it be enforced? Nograles said the new directive should be enforced by barangay captains.
President Rodrigo Duterte earlier called on barangay officials to step up during the crisis, and warned them about eventually facing administrative complaints if they do not deliver for their constituents during the outbreak. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – The Ayala group of companies adopted an emergency response package worth P2.4 billion to support its employees and partner employers amid the coronavirus pandemic.
The country's largest and oldest conglomerate said the amount would allow all employees, including retail workers, construction workers, service providers, security guards, and employees of similar businesses, to receive wages.
P600 million was allotted for the salaries of displaced workers from construction sites, shuttered malls, and retail spaces of Makati Development Corporation and Ayala Malls.
Globe Telecom has earmarked P270 million for its retail store support staff and vendor partners, while all other Ayala companies will reserve another P130 million in personnel-related financial support.
Ayala Malls also waived rental fees, worth around P1.4 billion, of businesses that are not allowed to operate during the lockdown in Luzon.
""For its own employees, Ayala will continue to provide salary continuance and financial support where possible as most of these employees will be getting their mid-year bonuses normally paid in April starting today (March 17) through the end of March,"" Jaime Augusto Zobel de Ayala and Fernando Zobel de Ayala said in a Facebook post.
Ayala has also postponed employee loan payments and introduced special financial assistance programs at subsidized rates.
Ayala Corporation, through its subsidiary Ayala Healthcare Holdings, distributed over 10,000 N95 masks to public hospitals on Monday, March 16.
From January to September 2019, Ayala Corporation's net income nearly doubled to P46.2 billion, driven by the growth of Ayala Land, Bank of the Philippine Islands, AC Energy, and Globe.

MANILA, Philippines – Malacañang said it would provide transportation to health workers as well as outbound overseas Filipino workers (OFWs), after these people were seen walking for hours from their homes to their destinations as public transportation was suspended during the Luzon-wide lockdown that began on Tuesday, March 17.
Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles announced this in a late night briefing of the Inter-Agency Task Force on Tuesday, where officials addressed some of the problems raised during the first day implementation of the lockdown.
""The Department of Transportation (DOTr), in cooperation with Local Government Units, and upon consultation with the Department of Health, shall develop a system of point-to-point transport services for all the aforementioned health workers,"" Nograles said.
The point-to-point transportation covers both public and private health workers, as well as workers and volunteers of the Philippine Red Cross and the World Health Organization. (READ: LIST: Transport options provided by local government units)
Transpo for OFWs
Nograles also announced a latest policy change for outbound international flights: All nationalities are now allowed to fly out of airports from Luzon for the entire duration of the lockdown.
Nograles said the rationale behind this is to accommodate overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) who are bound by their contracts to return overseas, as well as Balikbayans who have to return to their countries of residence where they have families.
The government said OFWs would be provided transportation.
""OWWA (Overseas Workers Welfare Administration) may provide transportation services to OFWs intending to leave for abroad,"" said Nograles.
Nograles added that when the passengers travel to the airport, they should show their ticket to prove that their flight is in 24 hours.  They should also be accompanied by only one person.
He added said that the government will also provide transportation for arriving Filipino passengers so they could go home.
""OWWA shall provide transportation services for returning OFWs for the purpose of ferrying them from international ports to their respective destinations in Luzon,"" said Nograles.
The DOTr said returning filipinos, their spouses and children, those with permanent residence visa, and diplomats can take flights to the Philippines.
Special passes for essential workers
For the other essential workers like those in the food, food delivery, food supplies, medicine, medicine supplies, medicine manufacturing services, the government will provide a special pass.
""Agencies with jurisdiction over those exempted from the strict home quarantine requirement are likewise tasked to issue official Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF) accreditation IDs,"" the Palace oficial said.
These IDs shall be ready by March 21 at the latest, Nograles added.

DAVAO CITY, Philippines – The imposition of lockdowns in various areas in mainland Mindanao has affected the delivery of food supplies, especially rice, to Tawi-Tawi and other island provinces, Mindanao Development Authority Chairman Emmanuel Piñol said on Wednesday, March 18.
 
Piñol said Tawi-Tawi Governor Yshmail Sali called him on the phone to seek help in getting enough rice supply to his province.
“With the imposition of lockdowns by the different local government units, the movement of food supplies has been affected, especially the transport of goods to remote areas,” Piñol said.
He said the most vulnerable to the lockdowns were also in Basilan, Sulu, and other small island communities in the area, which depend on the Zamboanga provinces, including Zamboanga City, and Sabah for their supply. (READ: Coronavirus Outbreak | MINDANAO: Provinces, cities, towns on lockdown)
Tawi-Tawi, Basilan, and Sulu, collectively known as the Basulta areas, have a combined population of more than 1.56 million people.
The governments of Zamboanga del Norte and Zamboanga Sibugay declared lockdowns beginning Tuesday, March 17, while Zamboanga City will be on lockdown starting Friday, March 20. This is to keep the areas off limits to outsiders to prevent the spread of the new virus, which has killed 14 people in the country and affected 187 others as of Tuesday.
Even commercial ferry operations between Zamboanga City and the Basulta areas had been suspended, hampering the flow of goods to the island-provinces from mainland Mindanao.
To address this, Piñol said MinDA had coordinated with the Philippine Air Force and the Philippine Navy to ensure that the “the food needs of the remote areas and isolated islands are provided for.”
He said that the MinDA Executive Director and Undersecretary Janet Lopoz was tasked to look after the needs and requirements of the different agriculture and fisheries sectors of Mindanao.
“Usec Lopoz started coordinating with the PAF yesterday for the transport of the biologics and veterinary supplies for the poultry and livestock sectors,” Piñol added.
He said MinDA also initiated a monitoring system to “determine the sufficiency of food and other critical household items, especially in the island-provinces.” – Rappler.com

,"March 18, 2020",nCov,"[OPINION] The out-of-touch, elitist gaps in our lockdown",Gaby Baizas,"
 
I write this from the comfort of my home.
My parents came home from the grocery with more food to keep us fed for a few weeks. I just made my second cup of tea for the day as I waited for Duterte’s address to air. After the address, I had a video call with my high school friends and we stayed up until 2 am catching up and playing online games together. I could afford to sleep in because we at Rappler set efficient work-from-home measures to prioritize everyone’s safety in the midst of this fiasco.
Needless to say, this lockdown is just a minor adjustment for me and my family. Just admitting this privilege almost feels like a sin. For most Filipinos, the lockdown is an inconvenience at best, a matter of life and death at worst.
I admit that I come from a place of privilege as a middle-class citizen. But I’ve seen way too many Filipinos run into so many hurdles because of how poorly this lockdown was implemented. I can't help but be angry. Several workers braved the traffic just to get to work, because they couldn’t afford to take days off without pay. Later, mass transportation was suspended, which affected thousands of commuters. The Department of Justice stated violators of the Luzon lockdown can be arrested even without a warrant, which is bound to put many people’s lives at risk.
These measures might not affect me, but they will affect many other Filipinos. I guess that’s where a lot of my frustration comes from – not a lot of upper-class and middle-class Filipinos realize how good they have it in the midst of this lockdown. They forget to check their privilege, and come off as incredibly insensitive and narrow-minded.
I saw titas on Facebook share that James Deakin post, where he said we shouldn’t be complaining about the quarantine and curfew because all we’re being asked to do is to “sit on the couch and watch Netflix.” Cat Arambulo-Antonio, watching workers get arrested on her widescreen TV, gratuitously filmed an Instagram story for her followers, saying, “God, why don’t you motherfuckers just stay at home?” These are the kind of people who forget many Filipinos don’t have that kind of option, who fail to realize these people wouldn’t even leave their houses in the middle of a rampant outbreak if they had a better alternative.
And what angers me so much about this is that well-off Filipinos have the audacity to say we should all just cooperate with our government. First of all, I’m allowed to criticize the government’s implementation of the lockdown while cooperating with them – they’re not mutually exclusive. I can be a perfectly behaved, law-abiding citizen while thinking the government can do a better job, because we deserve better than this. ([OPINION] Loving your country is very different from loving your government)
Secondly, cooperation is a two-way street. The elites talk a lot about cooperating with our government, but have they considered asking what the government is doing for its people? Have they wondered if the government was meeting the people where they are, implementing inclusive, intersectional policies? Do they realize not everyone can just “trust the government” to know what its constituents need, let alone give them what they need?
This kind of narrow-mindedness isn’t exclusive to internet personalities and “woke” influencers; it bleeds into the way public officials are responding to the crisis. When the lockdown was imposed on the national capital, Trade Secretary Ramon Lopez told informal workers to just sell outside Metro Manila. After public transportation was suspended, Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles left citizens with only two options: to take a private car or walk. When people asked about how the harsh lockdown conditions will affect access to food, Presidential Spokesperson Salvador Panelo said, “Walang namamatay sa gutom.” (No one dies of hunger.)
It’s these out-of-touch remarks and anti-poor policies that make me realize how detached our government is from reality. Responding to a crisis like this in ways that only serve the upper class is bound to backfire and fail. It doesn’t sit well with me that I’m one of the few that can afford to live comfortably despite the lockdown, when every Filipino deserves a competent government that addresses all their needs in disastrous times like these. A government tasked to serve the public must serve all of the public.
I write this from the comfort of my home, and I go to sleep tonight knowing tomorrow I’ll have enough food to eat and that I can stay in to keep myself healthy. I can only hope this government does enough to ensure everyone gets the same kind of liberties. – Rappler.com

LOCKDOWN. Cotabato City Mayor Cynthia Guiani-Sayadi discusses the city's lockdown with local officials. Photo from Cotabato City's Facebook page CEBU CITY, Philippines – Cotabato City Mayor Cynthia Guiani-Sayadi placed the entire city on lockdown starting Tuesday, March 17.
The move came a day after Guiani placed the city on community quarantine.   “I know this is an abrupt move but I am appealing to the public to understand the drastic measures that we are implementing as of the moment,” Guiani said in a statement. “We are still awaiting for the official statement coming from our health authorities, but as of now, the lockdown is only a precautionary measure.”     During lockdown, residents will not be allowed outside for non-essential travel, and restaurants, bars, and other establishments where people gather will also be closed. There is also a curfew between 8 pm and 5 am. 
“Once we can say that it’s safe for our residents to enter and leave Cotabato City, we can open it again at our entry points, but for now, we are locked down,” the mayor said.
While the Inter-agency Task Force (IATF) combatting COVID-19 recommended only community quarantine if there were 2 or more confirmed cases in an area, many local government units have already begun locking down their cities and municipalities as a precautionary measure.Kidapawan City under quarantine
Meanwhile in Kidapawan City, Cotabato, the city was placed under community quarantine on Tuesday, March 17.
Executive Order No. 25 was signed by Mayor Joseph Evangelista and takes effect on Wednesday, March 18, after operational guidelines have been established.   Under Kidapawan’s quarantine, residents are asked to stay at home unless necessary.   The city may profile residents for travel history and possible exposure to the virus.
Public gatherings are prohibited, and businesses are asked to alter operations to give their employees “flexible arrangements.”
Disinfection points will also be set up across the city and quarantine areas readied in government and school buildings.
According to Kidapawan’s EO, if 2 or more cases are found positive in the city, the mayor would then declare a lockdown.
“In case of lockdown, all means of transportation entering Kidapawan City, whether through public or private vehicle, shall be prohibited, except when the vehicle is used by Kidapawan City residents or when the vehicle is registered under the name of a resident of Kidapawan City,” the clause read. “In the event of a lockdown, non-residents of Kidapawan, even those working in the city, shall be prohibited from entering the same.”
The Philippines has 187 cases of the coronavirus as of Tuesday, with 14 deaths and 4 recoveries. Globally, there are more than 175,000 cases, with over 7,000 deaths across 145 countries. – Rappler.com  "

MANILA, Philippines – The government has prohibited hotels and similar establishments from accepting bookings during the “enhanced community quarantine” of Luzon meant to prevent the novel coronavirus from spreading further.
Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles announced the operating guidelines of the lockdown, including this restriction on hotel operations, in a media conference that ran from late Tuesday night, March 17, until past midnight on March 18.
Hotels and other hospitality businesses may only operate during the lockdown if:

They have guests who booked their stay on or before March 17.
They have guests who have existing long-term leases.
They are housing employees of establishments exempted from the lockdown.

The lockdown order issued by Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea exempts health workers, security forces, media personnel, and employees of essential services such as groceries, drug stores, and local governments.
Besides these restrictions, hotel operations must be limited to “the provision of basic lodging to guests,” the guidelines stated as read out by Nograles.
The government earlier temporarily banned the entry of non-Filipinos and non-residents of the Philippines from countries with local transmissions of the novel coronavirus. The move is bound to impact the tourism and hospitality industries.
President Rodrigo Duterte placed Metro Manila under “community quarantine” on Sunday, March 15, and then ratcheted up the measure on Tuesday, March 17, to an “enhanced community quarantine” covering the entire island of Luzon. (READ: GUIDELINES: Luzon 'enhanced community quarantine')
With a population of more than 57 million, Luzon residents comprise roughly half of the national population. Other parts of the country have also declared community quarantines to quell the coronavirus. (LIST: Areas in PH under quarantine, curfews, state of calamity)
In areas on lockdown, malls and other non-essential commercial establishments are urged to temporarily close or scale down operations until the quarantine period is lifted. 
Metro Manila is set to be locked down until April 14. The rest of Luzon will be on lockdown until April 12.
As of Tuesday, the Philippines has had 187 confirmed cases of infection, 14 deaths, and 4 recoveries.
Experts posit that the number of local cases may reach 26,000 by the end of March if the current spread of the virus is not contained.

MANILA, Philippines – The Armed Forces of the Philippines deployed its trucks and buses to help convey stranded health workers and employees of essential services in Metro Manila amid the ""enhanced community quarantine"" meant to avert the spread of the novel coronavirus.
The Philippine Army sent out 9 large military trucks starting Tuesday night, March 17, to ferry workers from the Mall of Asia in Pasay City to EDSA-Santolan in Quezon City and vice versa, according to Army spokesperson Colonel Ramon Zagala.
The Army has sent another 9 trucks to service workers from EDSA-Santolan in Quezon City to Masinag in Antipolo, and vice versa.
The General Headquarters of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) also sent two buses and 4 large trucks to take stranded workers from EDSA-Santolan to Balintawak in Quezon City, and vice versa, starting Tuesday night, said acting AFP spokesperson Major General Ernesto Torres Jr.
The Philippine Navy has also dispatched M35 trucks to EDSA corner Roxas Boulevard in Pasay City, and also to the Cavite Expressway, South Luzon Expressway, and areas of Marikina to ferry workers.
""They will ply this route and determine volume and need so a schedule can be determined. This will be regular and daily, to ferry health workers, and other essential and authorized personnel,"" Zagala said.
The Army will adjust their routes according to demand, he added.
Those who need a ride on the military trucks must present their ID to show that they are covered by the lockdown exemptions.
President Rodrigo Duterte placed Metro Manila on lockdown on Sunday, March 15, and then the rest of Luzon on Tuesday, March 17, cutting public transportation and urging businesses to downscale operations to discourage people from moving around.
The Luzon-wide ""enhanced community quarantine"" will last until April 12.
The measure exempts health workers, security forces, media personnel, and employees of essential services such as groceries, drug stores, and local governments. It also allows people to buy food and supplies, and to travel for health reasons. (READ: GUIDELINES: Luzon 'enhanced community quarantine')
On Tuesday, the first day of the stricter lockdown, droves of people struggled to catch rides, and many were forced to walk all the way to their destinations.
Some local governments and agencies such as the Office of the Vice President will also deploy vehicles to service commuters who have legitimate reasons to travel during the lockdown.
The government hopes to quell the spread of the coronavirus by limiting the movement of people, urging them to stay home and practice ""social distancing,"" or keeping at least a meter away from one another to avoid contagion. (LIST: Areas in PH under quarantine, curfews, state of calamity)

IG RANT. Cat, on IG stories, ranted about people who didn't stay home during the lockdown. Screenshot from Twitter 
MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – Filipinos online are blasting Instagram influencer and mommy blogger Cat Arambulo Antonio for her ""insensitive, anti-poor"" remarks on workers stranded at checkpoints as the national government implemented ""enhanced community quarantines"" to stop the spread of the coronavirus.
Cat was reacting to a CNN Philippines report aired Tuesday, March 17, about authorities ""strictly inspecting travelers at checkpoints."" The clip also showed a police officer leading a handcuffed male worker into a police car.
While the report played on Cat's flat screen TV, she said in her original Instagram Story, ""God, why don't you motherf*ckers just stay at home?""
""Stay at home! Don't you guys get it? Tigas ng ulo (So hardheaded). This is exactly why they need the military because you f*ckers won't stay at home. Guys, come on.""

Filipinos online were quick to react, calling out the socialite for her ""ignorant"" remarks on daily minimum wage workers who scrambled to get to work, and back home, just to make a living despite the lockdown.
Before the Luzon-wide lockdown took effect on Tuesday, March 17, only Metro Manila was under lockdown from Sunday, March 15, to Monday, March 16
The first quarantine meant movement to and from Metro Manila was tightly regulated, with checkpoints set up across the borders dividing the megacity from neighboring towns and municipalities. While public transport was still allowed, ""social distancing"" (an important practice to avoid the spread of the virus) and long waits at the checkpoints meant modes of transport were scarce. 
In the Philippines, many minimum wage workers only receive pay if they show up to work. They usually don't have the option to work remotely from home, a scheme many companies have allowed because of the coronavirus threat. 
Meanwhile, all modes of public transportation are suspended under the island-wide ""enhanced community quarantine.""
""This is devoid of compassion for the poor. I am at wit's end why they could not understand that social distancing is for the rich and privileged,"" Twitter user @kbomolina said.
""Just shut up and be thankful that your family has something to f*cking eat even if you don't work for a month. A lot of people already struggle to eat on a daily basis even before the pandemic,"" another Twitter user wrote.

Alot of people already struggle to eat on a daily basis even before the pandemic. Just fucking polish your ivory tower or sumthing— MARIANG MAKLINGI (@RizalNaWalangL) March 17, 2020 
 
""Cat Arambulo"" eventually trended on Twitter on Tuesday. After the online backlash, she posted an apology on Instagram, explaining the reason behind her outburst. But as of this posting, Cat took down the series of videos. 
 She explained that her remarks were not for the frontliners, but for Filipinos who weren't listening to the government, ""'yung mga pasaway (the hardheaded).""
She went on to say that ""everyone is affected right now,"" that self-quarantine was crucial, and that the Philippine health care system would not be able to handle an influx of sick people.
""Our hospitals can collapse. For me the real purpose of that message was directed to people who aren't listening.... I sincerely apologize if people were affected,"" she said.

""I get your point naman po on why people need to stay at home, but not everyone po kasi is privileged to lounge and stay at the house. People are out there po to earn and put food on the table to their families,"" an Instagram user commented on her video.
""Do you realize how much of what you said is actually an enunciation of the wide socioeconomic gap in our country? How much more of your views do not speak of the anxiety of people without secure income, health care, food, shelter?"" another user replied.
Cat also took to Twitter to share an apology note over the ""harsh words"" she used.
""It's just so frustrating to see that some people who have the option to stay home are still not following the government's efforts. I'm sorry for how it sounded like but do know I only have the best intentions – our collective safety and that this will end soon,"" she wrote.
She posted another apology on March 18, this time over her insensitivity. ""I didn't mean to undermine anyone — hurt and offend everyone. I should have been more considerate of others who are trying to cope with this crisis,"" she said.
She also apologized to brands ""who got affected"" by the backlash. Cat works with several brands, either as an endorser or partner.

All public transport facilities are told to limit their passenger capacity and to conduct disinfection of units.
Catamco also ordered the police, the military, the Bureau of Fire Protection, medical practitioners, select government officials and employees to be on 24/7 alert status.
She said a 4-day workweek would also be adopted at the provincial capitol so that basic government services would not be disrupted. However, travels of government employees and officials outside of the province had been temporarily banned.
Catamco also ordered government officials to adopt “online transactions and meetings” as alternatives.
She also imposed a provincewide curfew starting 9 pm until 5 am.

On Tuesday, the MOH reported another imported case from the Philippines, this time involving a 30-year-old female Singaporean. Identified as Case 259, the Singaporean was in the Philippines from March 7 to 9, and tested positive for COVID-19 on Tuesday morning.
The Philippines is one of the countries that have exported coronavirus cases to Singapore, which is now experiencing a surge of imported cases from Southeast Asia and Europe. Before this, when the city-state was dealing mostly with local cases, Singapore had fewer new patients each day.
On Tuesday, Singapore recorded its highest number of new cases in a day – 23 patients, of which 17 are imported cases. (READ: Singapore cautions nationals vs traveling to Philippines)
To stop this wave of imported cases, Singapore tightened border restrictions against affected countries. Filipinos entering Singapore, if coming from the Philippines, now need to stay home for 14 days after entry into the city-state. Penalties include prosecution under Section 21A of Singapore's Infectious Disease Act, and revocation of their work or reentry permits.
Recent Filipino coronavirus cases here include a 28-year-old Filipina preschool teaching staff member, who is linked to a 32-year-old American male who had been in Japan from February 29 to March 8. Others include two Filipina domestic workers under the same employer who also contracted COVID-19. (READ: Coronavirus sa Singapore: Tips para sa mga Pilipino)
Singapore has had 266 coronavirus cases as of Tuesday evening. At least 114 of these cases have fully recovered from COVID-19. Most other patients are stable and improving in the hospital, while 14 are in critical condition. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – There is a faint hope that the world title fights of Jerwin Ancajas and Johnriel Casimero would push through as scheduled, after Top Rank Promotions on Monday, March 16 (Tuesday, March 17, Philippine time) canceled all of its scheduled events in March and April
Following the move of rival Premier Boxing Champions, Top Rank, which promotes Ancajas and Japanese Naoya Inoue – who was supposed to be Casimero's opponent in a bantamweight unification on April 25 at Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas – issued the following statement:
""Due to the coronavirus pandemic, Top Rank has postponed all events scheduled for March and April. We are monitoring the situation closely and will reschedule the shows as soon as it's safe and reasonable to do so.
'The health and safety of our fighters, staff and ESPN's incredible production team is the most important thing as we plan our next steps,' said Top Rank chairman Bob Arum. 'We look forward to the day when we can bring our loyal fans world-class boxing once again, but exercising caution is the most prudent thing to do at this moment.'""
With the latest development, MP (Manny Pacquiao) Promotions president Sean Gibbons visited Ancajas and trainer Joven Jimenez at their condominium unit in Makati on Tuesday, and advised them to continue training until further notice at Survival Camp in Magallanes, Cavite, for Ancajas' ninth title defense on April 11 against Mexican Jonathan Javier Rodriguez. 
Ancajas, who, according to Jimenez, is 95% ready to defend his International Boxing Federation super flyweight crown for the ninth time against Rodriguez, spent training camp at the rest house of Big Boss Cement president Gilbert Cruz in Dipolog City before flying back to Manila on March 15 to beat the community lockdown.
Jimenez said he and Ancajas will proceed to secluded Magallanes, where there's minimal chances of contracting the virus, early Wednesday March 18.
Casimero, who was already in Las Vegas for what was supposed to be the final phase of his training for Inoue, remained thankful the fight for his World Boxing Organization crown and Inoue's World Boxing Association and International Boxing Federation's belts wasn't shelved, just postponed.
Slouched in a sofa while relaxing during a lull in training at a rented apartment in Las Vegas, Casimero announced the development via YouTube with older brother Jayson in tow.
According to Casimero, he was already gearing up for war against Inoue, claiming his weight is down to 126 pounds – just 8 pounds over the division limit.
But on a lighter note, Casimero said the postponement will give him ample time to prepare for Inoue, who's being launched by Top Rank to the global arena.
Casimero's preparations under trainer Nonoy Neri and assistant trainer Ting Lucas Sugar are being hampered by social distancing, however, as they need to do their workouts at home.
Both Ancajas and Casimero were assured by Gibbons their respective fights would be rescheduled and could happen in May. – Rappler.com   "

MANILA, Philippines – President Rodrigo Duterte ordered a price freeze on basic commodities, emergency medicines, and medical supplies, as Luzon and many other parts of the country are on lockdown to avert the spread of the novel coronavirus.
Duterte on Tuesday, March 17, issued Memorandum Circular No. 77, ordering national government agencies and local government units to comply with price control measures earlier issued by the health, agriculture, and trade departments.
This immediately followed Duterte's order placing the entire Philippines under a state of calamity for 6 months due to the coronavirus pandemic. (READ: LIST: Areas in PH under quarantine, curfews, state of calamity)
The Department of Health and the Department of Trade and Industry earlier ordered a price freeze on emergency medicines and medical supplies.
The Department of Agriculture, meanwhile, provided suggested retail prices for basic agricultural and fishery commodities in Metro Manila.
Duterte's order cites Republic Act No. 7581 or the Price Act, which prohibits hoarding, profiteering, and cartels in the supply, distribution, marketing, and pricing of goods during times of calamity or emergency.
The Price Act protects consumers from price manipulation at times when the demand for basic items tends to shoot up because of public disturbances.
Duterte had placed Metro Manila under ""community quarantine"" starting Sunday, March 15, then ratcheted the measure up on Tuesday to an ""enhanced community quarantine"" covering the entire island of Luzon.
With a population of more than 57 million, Luzon residents comprise roughly half of the national population. Other parts of the country have also declared community quarantines to quell the coronavirus. (READ: GUIDELINES: Luzon 'enhanced community quarantine')
In areas on lockdown, malls and other non-essential commercial establishments are either ordered or encouraged to temporarily close until the quarantine period is lifted.
Metro Manila is set to be locked down until April 14. The rest of Luzon will be on lockdown until April 12.
As of Tuesday, the Philippines has had 187 confirmed cases of infection, 12 deaths, and 4 recoveries.

“I have been an OR nurse for 6 years. And so even if I am already in the food industry, my NMMC family will always remain in my heart. And what do families do? We help each other – especially in trying times like this,” Uapal said.

People may present their NMMC ID and a copy of their night shift schedule to avail of the meal. The redemption must take place on the same day, right after the employees’ night shift. 
“More than the yummy breakfast, it is really the thought of people thinking about them that made them grateful,” Uapal said. 
The free meal will be available until March 31.
Casa Marga
Casa Marga a hotel in 15th-26th Street in Barangay Nazareth, together with some volunteers, initiated a relief drive that accepts in-kind or cash donations to help vulnerable sectors during the community quarantine through the distribution of kits comprised of essential items.
In separate Facebook posts, Kaye Quiblat and Jireh Cuarto, among the key contacts of the outreach project, said they distributed the hygiene, sanitation, and food kits around the city last March 19.
“We will prioritize distribution to the homeless and elderly who do not have the resources and support to aid them,” they said.

You can drop off your donations at Casa Marga. Please just inform us ahead by giving us a message through our page. Thank you! Layout by Jireh CuartoPosted by Casa Marga on Sunday, March 15, 2020

To strengthen information awareness on the new virus and its effects, Chicco Libarnes, another volunteer, offered to lay out essential information coming from the Department of Health on COVID-19 for infographic flyers. 
The flyers feature a background on the new coronavirus, causes, symptoms, and steps for prevention. The flyers were distributed together with the goods that they collected.

The infographic flyer also contains a list of hotlines for COVID-19 response in all barangays of Cagayan de Oro.

Local hotlines of all barangays in the city tasked to respond to COVID-19 concerns were added to the infographics. All texts were carefully translated to Bisaya for Kagay-anons to fully comprehend the details in their native language.
XU Development Communication Society and Department
The Development Communication Department of Xavier University-Ateneo de Cagayan is  leading an information drive to help locals better understand the coronavirus pandemic.
It's been posting several infographics featuring tips and reminders from various government, news, and health agencies in the Kagay-anons' native language. These translations and visually attractive graphics were done by the students themselves.

Some students have written extensively about the coronavirus pandemic through their intro to multimedia writing class.
XU Development Communication Society is also bolstering efforts to make coronavirus-related topics easier to understand.
They made a graphic differentiating a person under monitoring (PUM) from a person under investigation (PUI) written in Bisaya  to inform the public on certain terminologies used when diagnosing someone suspected of having COVID-19.

Illustration by Nico Villarete
MANILA, Philippines – In the beginning, 2020 was turning out to be a great year for music.
By the end of February, the 10th Malasimbo festival had been checked off people’s bucket lists. Alanis Morissette, Avril Lavigne, Green Day, and the Pussycat Dolls were all scheduled to arrive, and fans were patiently waiting.
Ebe Dancel had played his first solo concert and released a new album Baliktanaw – perhaps the biggest gift a musician can give to longtime listeners. Ben&Ben released two feels-inducing music videos in the lead up to dropping another new love anthem. The annual Wanderland Music and Arts Festival was on the horizon, with a lineup that included the likes of Joji, Foals, Sabrina Claudio, and IV of Spades.
All the music was almost loud enough to drown out the news of the coronavirus spreading across the world. In the Philippines at the time, we already had several confirmed cases and a death – but the virus still felt like a distant threat as people went about their lives normally and looked forward to hearing more from their favorite artists.
Then one by one, international acts pulled out of their Manila stops. The Wanderland Festival lineup was changing week by week as artists canceled their trips to Asia.
The organizers tried heroically to keep things going by replacing each cancellation with an artist of the same caliber – but ultimately, on March 4, just a few days before the festival was set to begin, they announced that they would be postponing the festival until further notice.
OFFICIAL ANNOUNCEMENT:#WANDERLANDMUSICFEST 2020 pic.twitter.com/F7ltJak7pI— Wanderland Festival (@wanderlandfest) March 4, 2020
 
Wanderland’s cancellation was a big blow to music fans – but on the same day that it happened, another big gig was announced – a sliver of hope that the music scene would stay as it was. The Rest Is Noise announced that their 5th anniversary show was happening in April.
Pedicab, Dicta License, and Orange & Lemons were going to play long sets to celebrate their debut albums. Everything was going to be alright – the world might have been changing day by day, but the music was going to keep playing.
But on March 12, the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic. On March 13, The Rest Is Noise postponed their annniversary show. On the same day, the government had announced that it would be placing Metro Manila under a “community quarantine” beginning on March 15, limiting the movements of people in and out of the metropolis.
When the announcement was made, people flocked to the supermarkets and the malls in a panic-buying rush.
In one Makati mall, a jazz band played in the middle of the crowd as shoppers ignored all directives to practice “social distancing.” That same day, in one particular restaurant, a cover band sang their version of Bill Withers’ “Lovely Day.”
It was perhaps the last bit of live music that bystanders would hear for a long time – the next day, the government heightened the lockdown by announcing that it would enforce an “enhanced community quarantine” on March 17, not just over Metro Manila, but over the entire island of Luzon.
After this, bars and restaurants were shuttered, and people were forbidden to roam the streets unless absolutely necessary.
Music in the time of quarantine
The move came down hard on people who earn their income by the day and do not have the luxury of working from home – among them the buskers and the “no play, no pay” musicians whose regular spots have been boarded up to comply with the lockdown.
Michael Puyat, vocalist of the band Anything Goes, held two regular spots or puestos where he would play in on Wednesdays and Saturdays – but since the lockdown, those spots have been closed.
“I was texted by the managers that everything has been suspended, and since we are not employees, we don’t have any reprieve from the management,” he said.
“So basically the income stopped already, almost two weeks na… for example, if you’re doing 3 or more puestos in a week and you’re making an average of P1,500 per head... that disappeared.”
Michael said that he isn’t hit as hard by the loss because he also runs a business that provides another source of income. But he can’t say the same for many of his fellow puesto musicians, whose bread and butter was music.
“You know what they’re feeling right now? Despondent. The word is despondent. They think it’s a bad dream, and they’re just at home waiting to wake up tomorrow and it’s just a bad dream,” he said.
“They’re professionals who’ve been peforming for 20 years, they’re literally crying for clear help for any agency, any asssociation, any NGO. No one is speaking to them, the no play, no pay musicians,” Michael said.
Without the safety net of a label, or the backup of having music out on streaming platforms, some puesto musicians have gotten creative. One of them, busker Nick Mangubat, took his busking online, performing nightly via Facebook live and virtually laying out his hat by leaving his GCash and Paypal details for those who want to help him makeup for his lost income stream.

 
Ultimately, those who have lost their income will need to resort to more creative ways to make up for it.
Michael said that he hopes that after these musicians have accepted it, they can figure out how to move forward, throwing out some ideas for how working musicians can keep working during the lockdown.
“For example, maybe my friends can do online tutorials and get paid without leaving the house. Another thing they can do is compose, send files, and get paid without leaving the house. They can arrange backing tracks, or they can record professionally until the final product, recorded material is ready to place on online platforms.”
The internet of concerts
Online – that’s where the music is nowadays.
The internet, as it turns out, is a powerful tool – whether you’re a no play, no pay musician trying to make ends meet in a new way, or an artist who has the privilege of playing to raise funds for other people.
Singer-songwriter Martin Riggs, an artist signed with label O/C Records, has also had to face a blanket cancellation of gigs since the lockdown was imposed. The last gig he played was on March 9, but the day after that, all the shows he had lined up were cancelled. As the leader of the Busking Community PH and a busker himself, he also made the call to urge his fellow street musicians to stay home.
From home, Martin has been busy coming up with new music – and the internet is allowing him to get playful with it. While stuck at home, he's taken to Instagram to do live videos and engage his followers in writing new songs on the spot. He is also keeping busy as the A&R for O/C Records, which is another thing that helps him keep a steady income even as he has been unable to play on the streets.
Unlike the displaced puesto musicians, there’s no pressing financial need for Martin to keep performing – but that doesn’t mean he’ll stop. His label is currently planning an online concert (“O/C”), that people can view from the safety of their own homes.
“In very depressing and dark times, parang kailangan ata ng tao ng music and entertainment. Yun yung point ng entertainment eh, to entertain, especially at the point na walang entertaining na nangyayari – may bulkan na puputok, may bird flu, may nCov, may gobyernong hindi nagiisip ng maayos,” Martin said.
(In very depressing and dark times, it seems that people need music and entertainment. That's the point of entertainment, to entertain, especially at the point when nothing entertaining is going on anymore. There's a volcano that explodes, bird flu, nCoV, there's a government that isn't thinking straight.)
“Ang daming nangyayari eh, so parang kahit man lang tugtugan lang from their favorite artists, just to give hope na ‘uy may music pa,’ ‘uy may kalayaan pa somewhere out there,’” he added.
(So many things are happening, so even a small jam from their favorite artists can give hope, as if to say 'hey, there's still music,' 'hey, there's still freedom somewhere out there.')
Aside from providing entertainment, many artists have recently been using their music to raise funds for those most in need – from daily wage earners who have lost their income, to vulnerable urban poor communities, to frontliners and healthcare workers in need of supplies.
Music as relief
The first of these efforts came from National Artist for Music Ryan Cayabayab, who announced a series of online concerts called Bayanihan Musikahan, where musicians livestream performances on Facebook while encouraging people to donate towards food and health kits for the urban poor.
So far, the likes of Sponge Cola and Ebe Dancel have already performed – and even more are on the line up.
In a single online show, Matteo Guidicelli's initiative One Voice Pilipinas raised over P4 million for families affected by the Luzon Lockdown, with the likes of Kean Cipriano, Janine Tenoso, Jason Dy, and Sarah Geronimo performing.
Ben&Ben also announced on March 22 that they would be holding an online show to raise funds to purchase supplies for frontline heathcare works and relief goods for daily wage earners.
New platform
Watching a performer on a live stream is obviously not the same as attending a gig or a concert. The music comes across differently, and technical problems abound, especially with laggy connections. But many people who have tuned in did so seeking a small sense of comfort – and found it.
“Although we are all quarantined and forced to stay in our homes which we should all be doing in my opinion…I am not alone, and I want you to know, ikaw na nanonood, hindi ka nagiisa (you there, watching, you aren't alone). You have me, you have me tonight,” Ebe said when he performed in the first round of Bayanihan Musikahan concerts.

At some point in his performance, he stopped to point out just how different it is to take his performance off the stage and online: “This is so strange, performing in front of 34,000 people tapos walang pumapalakpak (and no one's applauding).”
The applause, it seems, now comes in the form of comments – through which listeners are able to fully express what the performance means to them.
“Thank you sir, this is the best night ever since lockdown po,” one fan responded as Ebe played one of his signature songs, “Burnout.”
“Was so down today, thanks for comforting us with your music,” another viewer said as he played “Cuida.”
The world has changed so drastically in the span of a few weeks – and like everyone else, the music industry has been hit hard by this shift. But there is a comfort to be had in knowing that while the streets may now be eerily silent, that’s about as far as the silence reaches.
Whether they’re playing for a living or to raise funds for coronavirus relief, the point is Filipino artists are still playing – and they're showing no signs of stopping. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – Senator Aquilino ""Koko"" Pimentel III has tested positive for the novel coronavirus, making him the second senator to contract COVID-19.
In a statement sent to reporters, Pimentel said he took the test on March 20 and was  informed about the result late Tuesday, March 24.
""Since the last day of session March 11, I had already tried my best to limit my movement. I will call (to the best of my ability) those I remember meeting during those crucial days so that I can inform them of my test result,"" Pimentel said.
""I have quarantined myself upon the doctor’s advice and consistent with the protocol. I feel I am, with God’s help, on the way to recovery,"" he added.
As he went into self-isolation, Pimentel said he could not be with his wife Kathryna, who was due to give birth in a few days.
""I would like to ask for your prayers, especially for my wife Kath, who is about to give birth in the next few days to our first baby girl, and with whom I cannot be at this very important point in our lives as parents,"" the senator said.
He also urged the public to observe physical distance and the enhanced community quarantine, as well as exercise good hygiene.
Pimentel was not able to attend the special session on Monday, March 23, when the Senate approved the law granting Duterte special powers to deal with the pandemic.
Senate Majority Leader Juan Miguel Zubiri was the first senator to test positive for COVID-19 on March 16.
Zubiri and Pimentel were among the 12 senators who went into self-quarantine after Senators Sherwin Gatchalian and Nancy Binay announced they would take the measure beginning March 11 after learning that one of the resource persons in a March 5 Senate hearing tested positive for the COVID-19.  Gatchalian and Binay tested negative for the disease.
At the time, two weeks ago, there were 49 patients who tested positive with COVID-19 in the Philippines, two of whom died.
As of Tuesday, March 24, the Philippines had 552 confirmed cases of coronavirus, with 33 deaths and 20 recoveries. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – The National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) recommended ""widespread"" testing for the novel coronavirus as it unveiled a 3-point plan to ease the impact of the health crisis on the economy.
""The key to a successful medical response is widespread testing,"" Socioeconomic Planning Secretary Ernesto Pernia said in NEDA's report released on Tuesday, March 24. (READ: #MassTestingNow: Online petition calls for urgent action on PH coronavirus outbreak)
""A patient who is diagnosed earlier could be given care to prevent secondary infections. Moreover, early diagnosis will lead to early initiation of quarantine procedures and, therefore, limit or prevent the spread of the virus,"" NEDA said.
Due to lack of test kits, the Department of Health implemented a decision tool that is supposed to prioritize testing for persons manifesting severe symptoms and have either traveled to a country with local transmission or have been exposed to a positive case.
But several asymptomatic politicians and VIPs were able to get tested immediately, with their results released ahead of ordinary Filipinos – most of whom now have to wait for about a week for their COVID-19 test results.
NEDA pointed out, though, that the cost of testing might overburden the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation and crowd out PhilHealth funds for non-COVID-19 cases.
Usual sources of test kits would also be constrained given the huge global demand.
Coordination
NEDA released a 3-step plan to contain the spread of COVID-19 and mitigate its socioeconomic impact. These are:
Phase 1a: Clinical/medical response. This involves early detection and diagnosis, effective quarantine systems, effective management and treatment protocol, research and epidemiological studies, and ensuring easy mobility of human resources for health.
This step also involves providing care or treatment at the early stages of the disease, isolating persons under monitoring and persons under investigation from the non-infected population, and research.
Phase 1b: Public health response. This step recommends travel bans, promoting proper hygiene, bans on crowded gatherings, school closures, work suspensions, flexible work arrangements, work continuance in essential sectors, and enforcement of the rule of law.
""The Amelioration Fund of the Department of Labor and Employment is worth P1.5 billion, which can cover 300,000 workers. The Unconditional Cash Transfer has an appropriation of P36 billion under the 2020 General Appropriations Act, which covers 10 million individuals,"" NEDA said.
Phase 1c: This entails short-term augmentation of health systems capacity. NEDA recommended setting up makeshift outpatient consultation facilities and the establishment of quick referral protocols.
This step also deals with the increased supply of personal protective equipment and hospital equipment, increased remote quarantine facilities, and industries shifting production activities toward needed items.
Phase 2: Rebuild consumer and business confidence. Once the lockdown is lifted, NEDA said reduced economic activity is expected. The best way to address this is to assure the public of adequacy of improved health care systems.
Phase 3: Resume a new normal state of economic activity that is more prepared for another possible pandemic. 
As of Tuesday, March 24, the total number of coronavirus cases in the Philippines stood at 552, 35 of whom died, while 20 recovered. – Rappler.com "

PAMPANGA, Philippines  – Dr Marcelo Jaochico, the provincial health chief of Pampanga, died on Tuesday, March 24, after losing his own battle with COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. 
In a Facebook post Tuesday evening, Cielo Jaochico, Marcelo’s daughter, confirmed his father’s death. According to her, they received Marcelo’s COVID-19 test on the day of his death. 
“We received the result of his test after 8 days. At least 'di siya naunang pumanaw bago dumating ang diagnosis po niya (At least it didn't arrive after he died),” she said.
Cielo said his father started experiencing the symptoms of COVID-19 on March 11. 
""He experienced loss of appetite, fatigue, diarrhea, and shortness of breath. He was home quarantined. He underwent CBS test and the results are normal. He was given IV fluids while in his home in Pampanga until Sunday, March 15,” she disclosed.
According to Cielo, her father was tested for the virus on March 16 and was transferred to an intensive care unit isolation room of a government hospital on March 18 for close monitoring.  
Cielo added that she does not want her father to be remembered as “someone who just died because of COVID-19.”
“Nagmamakaawa akong sabihin niyo na sa mga magulang niyo ngayon kung gaano niyo sila kamahal (I'm telling you now to tell to your parents how much you love them). Noong 18 ako (when I was 18), who would’ve thought that after 3 years, I’d lose my dad,"" Cielo wrote.
A Jose P. Rizal Memorial awardee, Marcelo served as a 'doctor to the barrios' in Calanasan, Apayao for about 16 years. He was obstetrician, pediatrician, and family physician for rural folks.
He also worked at the Bureau of Local Health Systems and Development of the Department of Health before becoming provincial health officer in 2013.
In her March 20 Facebook post, Cielo said that she had flu-like symptoms and was undergoing self-quarantine.
“I am also exhibiting cough and colds since March 18, and I am one of the last persons he (Dr. Jaochico) was last in contact with when he was still in Caloocan (March 6-8). I have not left the premises of our house since March 8 with the exception of getting checked on March 19 because I had to get prescriptions for my supportive management,” she said.
Cielo added: “I am now under strict isolation for 2 weeks because we can’t afford to infect other people, lalo na yung lolo at lola ko na mayroong napakaraming mga co-morbidities (especially my grandparents who have many co-morbidities). We have informed our barangay leaders as well.""
The Pampanga public information office has not issued any information about Marcelo’s death yet.
Pampanga’s public information office said that as of Tuesday, March 24, the number of deaths due to the virus in the province still stands at one, with 3 confirmed cases, 39 persons under investigation.

ALBAY, Philippines – The provincial government of Masbate has suspended the collection and payment of electricity and water bills due to the socio-economic impact of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. 
Executive Order No. 07 gave Masbateños a one-month respite from paying their bills to the Masbate Electric Cooperative (MASELCO), the Masbate-Mobo Water District (MMWD), and Aroroy Water District (AWD), from March 21 to April 30. 
MASELCO serves consumers in one city and 14 municipalities: Masbate City and the towns of Esperanza, Pio V. Corpuz, Placer, Cataingan, Palanas, Dimasalang, Uson, Mobo, Baleno, Aroroy, Mandaon, Milagros, Cawayan, and Balud. 
MASELCO said in a statement posted on Facebook that it will not impose any penalties for its due collections on the said date. 
Seedlings, fresh produce in Albay
Other local governments in Bicol have also implemented measures to help vulnerable sectors.
In Albay, every municipal agriculture officer is tasked to coordinate with their local farmers to buy their produce and therefore limit their movements.  
The fresh vegetables were initially distributed in the province, in addition to relief goods. 
A total of 1475 cans and repacked vegetable seedlings were also initially distributed to different households in the province to encourage backyard planting while under quarantine. These include seeds of eggplant, tomato, string bean, ampalaya, squash and other vegetables.  
In Libon town, Mayor Wilfredo Maronilla announced that tricycle drivers and operators affected by the community quarantine would receive vegetables and relief items.

,"March 25, 2020",nCov,U.P. Mindanao keen to serve as coronavirus testing site in Davao Region for free,Michael Noel Bonghanoy,"
 
MANILA, Philippines – The University of the Philippines (UP) Mindanao is proposing a diagnostic program that can give free testing for the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the Davao Region. The program includes establishing a P15-million biosafety molecular lab, which will have to be attached to a hospital and is expected to supplement the ongoing tests in the Southern Philippines Medical Center (SPMC). SPMC is currently the only medical facility in Mindanao recognized as a subnational reference laboratory that can test for COVID-19. 
Philippine Genome Center (PGC) Mindanao director Dr Lyre Anni Murao, a professor of virology at UP Mindanao and author of the proposal, wrote, “To back up the existing facility in SPMC and to prepare for the unprecedented peak of outbreak of the disease, it is only imperative to consider the establishment of another diagnostic facility for faster and efficient diagnosis for coronavirus. For example, the Marikina local government has established its own diagnostic lab for free COVID-19 testing of local health workers and suspected cases.”
The proposed lab will be made from two container vans – the easiest way to set up the facility – and equipped with a real-time polymerase chain reaction or PCR detection system and other equipment. The facility will also be designed to handle infectious materials based on guidelines from the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Department of Health (DOH). 
Dr. Murao stated, “The role of PGC Mindanao is capability building. We will organize trainings for our partner hospital on biosafety procedures and molecular diagnostics. During the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, our staff can also assist in the testing if there is a need for extra personnel. But eventually, our partner hospital will have to run the lab itself. That’s why it is important for this lab to be attached to a hospital so its operations will be sustainable in the long run.” 
When operating in full capacity at 96 tests per day, monthly operational costs for the lab (procuring kits, reagents, and consumables, as well as costs for other requirements) are pegged at P10.3 million.
WHO recommends that interrupting human-to-human transmission through community quarantine, physical distancing, and other measures should be coupled with aggressive testing in order to identify, isolate, and treat patients early. These strategies in concert are known to be effective as in the case of China, Singapore, and South Korea. But as WHO has repeatedly announced, lockdowns and physical distancing are not enough.
In a recent study, UP Mindanao bioinformatics expert Dr May Anne Mata notes, “With the current landscape of COVID-19 in the region, testing asymptomatic individuals or COVID-19 carriers is necessary since they may show no symptoms but can freely transmit the disease if not regulated.”
Her mathematical model’s projections show that the total COVID-19 carriers in Davao Region will likely reach a maximum of 3,000 individuals with a testing rate of 0.1% per day – that is, for every 1,000 COVID-19 asymptomatic individuals, only 1 is tested. But if the testing rate is increased to 70% to 100% per day, the number of COVID-19 carriers will reach 0 within a faster period compared to the status quo testing capacity.
The study has not yet been published, but an early draft will be presented to local authorities to help guide policies in the region moving forward. 
Last Friday, March 20, a UP Mindanao delegation consisting of the chancellor Dr Larry Digal, the vice chancellor for academic affairs Dr Nilo Oponda, and PGC Mindanao director Dr Murao met with officials from the city council and DOH, as well as advisors from SPMC, to discuss the proposal. The delegation also met with SPMC chief Dr Leopoldo Vega afterwards.
“Testing is really necessary. In fact, some local government units have already expressed interest in investing in such a lab facility. For the Davao Region, we are exploring all options on how to fund this initiative, particularly a private-public partnership. We already have contacts from the private sector who are willing to help in procuring much-needed equipment like PCR machines compatible with available test kits. The machine needs to be imported and is a costly investment. For now, we are awaiting formal response from DOH and the Davao Region COVID-19 Task Force to see how we can proceed,” said Chancellor Digal.
Dr Murao added, “This lab can also serve as a model that can be replicated in other sites of the country for accurate and timely detection of the disease. The lab also has future use for other infectious and emerging diseases, making the country even more prepared for crisis such as this.”
As of 12 noon, March 22, the Davao Region has recorded 3 patients testing positive for COVID-19, with 58 out of the 104 persons under investigation (PUIs) admitted (5 deaths: 2 cleared; 3 awaiting confirmation) and 6837 out of the 8285 persons under monitoring (PUMs) still under observation according to DOH XI. – Rappler.com

MANILA, Philippines – Utilizing 3D printers in its 8 campuses, faculty members and staff of Philippine Science High School (PSHS) collaborate to provide face shields for medical workers and security officers to protect them from COVID-19. 
The PSHS Main Campus, Ilocos Region, Bicol Region, Eastern Visayas, Central Visayas, Caraga, SOCCSKSARGEN Region, and Southern Mindanao campuses are simultaneously producing face shields. (READ: IN PHOTOS: Volunteers, medical frontliners improvise PPEs amid shortage) 
Engr. Kevin Daga-as, in-charge of Makerspace, a learning and innovation area where students can come together to design and learn to develop creative projects, started the initiative at the SOCCSKSARGEN Region Campus, which eventually became a PSHS System-wide project.
Challenges
However, because of the community quarantine, they are having difficulties getting acetate films and 3D printer filament, Daga-as said.
PSHS System Executive Director Lilia Habacon already called for assistance through her Facebook post to help the PSHS campuses look for suppliers of acetate so that more face shields can be produced.
Benito A. Baje, Physics Unit Coordinator and Makerspace-in-charge at PSHS-Central Visayas Campus said that they have a few issues with fabrication because of scarcity of materials. Their campus is far from Cebu City which strictly regulates travel due to the lockdown. 
“In terms of workforce, good thing that some of our faculty members and staff responded to our call for assistance. So far, we have received requests for face shields from different sectors, which is why we are looking for materials and supplies to produce more face shields,” Baje added.

Safety of frontliners
“This started when I saw in the news that doctors and nurses are being also hit by COVID-19 because they lack Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). I began searching online about the market standard design of face shields. Then, I came across a Facebook page on 3D print-for-a-cause,"" said Daga-as, an Arts and Design Technology teacher.
According to Daga-as, the SOCCSKSARGEN Region Campus started producing face shields last March 19, after getting the go signal from Campus Director Chuchi Garganera to prioritize medical personnel.
FACE SHIELDS. Engr. Kevin Daga-as, in-charge of Makerspace at PSHS-SOCCSKSARGEN Region Campus loads the face shields for distribution in Koronadal City. 
“Considering that none of the doctors in Argao Hospital in Cebu have PPEs, we started designing and mass printing upon the approval of Campus Director Rachel Luz Rica,” Baje said. 
The PSHS face shields will be donated to front line health workers in hospitals, the Provincial Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Office (PDRRMO), city health units, ambulance teams for COVID-19 patient response, and security personnel at checkpoints.
Creation process
The improvised face shield can be assembled using a 3D-printed frame to act as handle and support, and an acetate sheet to act as shield. 
“It took 1.5 hours to finish one frame using the original design. I decided to redesign the frame until I came up with a final design that only took 36 minutes to print. It will save me time printing and save filament, the thermoplastic feedstock for fused deposition modeling 3D printers use,” Daga-as added.
To make the face shield frame, we need to slice the design into several horizontal layers, and this is done with a 3D-slicing software like Cura. After the design is ready, the file is uploaded to the 3D printer, where molten plastic is extruded through a tiny nozzle that moves around precisely under computer control. It prints one layer at a time to the top layer of the design,” Daga-as added.
“The estimated printing cost per face shield is P15.00 each, including the acetate and 3D-printed frame, plus the electricity, Daga-as added.
According to Bicol Region Campus Director Lorvi Pagorogon, her team is targeting to release 600 face shields for the first batch and to provide shield replacements.
“We have been in contact with doctors of Bicol Medical Center in Naga City and Bicol Regional Training and Teaching Hospital in Legazpi City. Then, other provincial hospitals in Bicol shall follow, and they will check our design and give feedback on how they can better use the face shields,” Pagorogon said. – Rappler.com

MANILA, Philippines – President Rodrigo Duterte on Tuesday, March 24, expressed his gratitude to doctors who died from the novel coronavirus disease, praising them as heroes for joining the front lines against the virulent disease. 
Duterte also gave his thanks to health workers and others on the front lines for their courage in caring for patients with the coronavirus, despite the risks. 
“I am saddened by the news that the virus has claimed lives of our doctors on the way. Lahat po sila ay bayani (They are all heroes) and not only that,” Duterte said in a televised message. 
“Talagang bilib ako. Bihira ako sumasaludo ng tao pero mga doktor natin, mga health workers na nadisgrasya, talagang saludo ako sa inyo. Wala na kayo sa itong mundo pero ganun nalang ang pagtingin ko sa inyo,” he added.  
(I really admire them. I rarely praise people, but to our doctors and health workers who have been affected, I salute you. You may no longer be on earth but that is how I will remember you.) 
Fighting the outbreak, at least 5 doctors have died after contracting COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. Meanwhile, hundreds of others doctors and nurses serving in hospitals were forced to undergo quarantine after possibly becoming infected with the coronavirus disease.
Health workers, who are most exposed to the disease, have raised the alarm on the dangerously low supply of personal protective equipment needed to shield them against the virus. Despite this, most health facilties are unable to acquire the essential items as global supplies for them are in shortage. (LEFT IN THE DARK: Little protection for government's coronavirus frontliners)
Stay home
Duterte also told the public to stay home and observe physical distancing measures, as cases in the country soared to 552 on Tuesday.
“Nothing is more important than your cooperation. I repeat: stay home, huwag matigas ang ulo (do not be stubborn). The outcome of this war depends largely on you as well,” he said.  
Duterte sought to assure the public the government was “on top of the situation,” as he announced a “national action plan” would be implemented to combat the outbreak.  
The Duterte government has been criticized for their lack of preparedness in addressing the disease as cases slowly climbed since January 2020.  
On Wednesday, March 25, Duterte signed into law an act that would grant him 30 special powers to address the rising number of coronavirus cases.

MANILA, Philippines – Pasig City has reported an increase in its number of coronavirus cases on Tuesday, March 24.
As of Tuesday evening there were 26 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus in the city, with 2 deaths, according to the Pasig Public Information Office, citing data from the Department of Health (DOH).
This was higher than the 14 cases mentioned by Pasig Mayor Vico Sotto in Malacañang’s televised Laging Handa media briefing on Monday morning, March 23. Sotto then said he expected the DOH to give him an updated tally of his city’s coronavirus cases later that day.
These figures denote the number of Pasig residents who've caught the disease, not coronavirus patients in hospitals located in the city.
Also on Tuesday, Pasig reported 88 current persons under monitoring (PUM) for the virus, and 97 current persons under investigation (PUI).
Some 29 PUMs and 15 PUIs in Pasig were earlier deemed free of the virus.
A PUI is someone who has two or all of the following: 

History of travel in the past 14 days to countries with local transmissions and risk of importation of the virus
History of exposure to a confirmed case
Symptoms of respiratory illness (cough and/or colds) and/or fever

Meanwhile, a PUM is someone who has a history of travel to a virus-hit country or exposure to a coronavirus patient.

The local government has tapped Dahlia Hotel in the city’s motel strip as a quarantine facility that can take in 300 patients at once. It has been preparing another similar establishment for the same purpose.
The city's Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Office's telephone hotline for reporting possible coronavirus cases is 8-643-0000. ""Super Health Centers"" are located in barangays Nagpayong, Santolan, San Joaquin, Manggahan, Sumilang, and Rosario.
The city government urges Pasigueños to be vigilant and stay home.

COVID-19 is the disease brought by the novel coronavirus.
The Ministry of Health and Prevention (MoHAP) announced on its website on Tuesday, March 24, that there are 50 new cases of the coronavirus disease belonging to at least 25 nationalities including the Philippines. It was the single biggest number of confirmed cases announced since January. 
The new cases are from Sri Lanka, the UK, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Tunisia, South Africa, Belgium, South Korea, Bulgaria, France, Czech Republic, Australia, Lebanon, Kenya, Maldives, Sudan, Iran, Ireland, Morocco, Pakistan, and Sweden; Italy, Egypt, UAE, Spain, Netherlands, Jordan, the Philippines; the US, Bangladesh, and Palestine, and India.
In a press briefing on Monday, Dr. Farida Al Hosani, spokesperson of the UAE health sector, said that the 45 cases that day included nationalities from Iraq, Tunisia, Syria, Kuwait, Italy, Peru, Ethiopia, Lebanon, Somalia, the UK, Sudan, Egypt, Ireland, Russia, Montenegro, France, and Poland; Canada, Bangladesh, Pakistan, the US, and the UAE and India.
The MoHAP said that the patients are “in a stable condition and receiving the necessary medical care.”
According to the MoHAP, 3 people— 2 Nepalese and an Iranian—have fully recovered from COVID-19 after receiving the necessary healthcare last Monday. Another 4 individuals  completely recovered on Tuesday. With these, the total number of recovered cases has reached 45.
The UAE has 2 fatalities.
Al Hosani called for calm and patience after the UAE recorded the 45 new cases of COVID-19. This batch of cases included a person who returned from abroad and did not quarantine himself, infecting 17 others such as family members, relatives, and his co-workers.
She also reminded the people to refrain from circulating rumors, pointing to the Attorney General's recent statement regarding the enforcement of the law for violators.
Al Hosani also stressed the importance of adhering to the preventive measures issued by the relevant health authorities in the country.
""The protection of our homeland, families, and people is the responsibility that our leadership has placed upon our shoulders. Our compliance with preventive health measures contributes directly to efforts aimed at overcoming this challenge. Today, there is no time for courtesy at the expense of the health of our families and community,” she said.

MANILA, Philippines – The number of Filipinos abroad confirmed to have the novel coronavirus increased to 169, the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) said on Tuesday, March 24.  
At least 169 confirmed cases have been recorded across 25 countries, including Italy, the United States, Japan, Korea, and Singapore, among others. The confirmed cases include two deaths, one each in India and France. 
The DFA also listed 90 Filipinos who have since recovered from the disease, and 77 more still undergoing treatment. 
Below is a breakdown of cases per region:
Asia Pacific

Total: 111
Undergoing treatment: 24
Recovered or discharged from hospital: 86
Deaths: 1

Europe 

Total: 20
Undergoing treatment: 17
Recovered or discharged from hospital: 2

Undergoing treatment: 16
Recovered or discharged from hospital: 2
Deaths: 0

Americas 

Total: 20
Undergoing treatment: 20
Recovered or discharged from hospital: 0

Of the 169 cases, 128 were officially confirmed by the Department of Health, which tracks cases based on International Health Regulations.
Unlike in earlier reports, the DFA did not provide a complete list of countries where cases of COVID-19 positive Filipinos have been recorded.
The agency said this was primarily due to countries where privacy restrictions were in place, prohibiting the release of nationalities of infected patients to avoid discrimination.  
The latest count registers an increase of 16 cases from the 153 cases earlier announced on Monday, March 23.  
As of Tuesday, the Philippines has recorded 552 confirmed coronavirus cases, with 35 deaths and 20 recoveries. 
The global death toll, meanwhile, has reached 16,961, with 6,077 of the fatalities in Italy and 3,277 in China (excluding Hong Kong and Macau).

SPECIAL POWERS. President Rodrigo Duterte signs into law the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act. Malacañang photo 
MANILA, Philippines – President Rodrigo Duterte signed on Wednesday, March 25, the bill that grants him 30 special powers to address the novel coronavirus outbreak in the Philippines. 
Duterte's former aide and now Senator Bong Go confirmed this in a message to reporters.
Duterte signed the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act of 2020 past midnight of Wednesday – a day after Congress passed the bill, a result of a special session that ran from Monday morning until past 3 am Tuesday. A copy has yet to be released to media.
The law was parsed through by lawmakers, who removed unconstitutional budgetary provisions and controversial provisions on the takeover of businesses. The earlier version of the bill had proposed to grant Duterte emergency powers.
Provisions that would have given the President authority to extend his special powers were also deleted. 
The law declares a state of national emergency, which comes on top of a month-long Luzon-wide lockdown, and earlier declarations of a state of calamity and  a state of public health emergency in the country. 
What are Duterte’s special powers? Based on a final version of the measure passed by the Senate and adopted by the House of Representatives, Duterte is allowed 30 powers.
Among the items listed in the law is the authority to give 18 million low-income families P5,000 to P8,000 in emergency cash aid, depending on the prevailing minimum wage in the region.
The measure also ensures that health workers get a special risk allowance on top of their regular hazard pay. It also directs the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth) to shoulder all medical costs of workers exposed to the coronavirus during the duration of the emergency.  
The law also mandates that P100,000 be given to public and private health workers who contract severe coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Families of health workers who died of COVID-19 in the line of duty will receive P1 million, effective retroactively. 
The powers outlined in the Bayanihan Heal as One Act are based on Article VI, Section 23 (2), of the Constitution. This provision allows Congress ""in times of war or other national emergency"" to pass a law authorizing the President “to exercise powers necessary and proper to carry out a declared national policy.""
The law grants Duterte the power to take over private medical facilities and public transportation. Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea earlier said the provision was merely to provide Duterte a ""standby power."" 
This was based on Section 17 of Article XII of the Constitution, which allows the State ""during the emergency and under reasonable terms prescribed by it, [to] temporarily take over or direct the operation of any privately owned public utility or business affected with public interest.""
Budgetary concerns: The law also grants Duterte the power to discontinue appropriated programs or activities of any agency of the executive branch, including government-owned and controlled corporations. Savings will be prioritized for the following:  

Department of Health (DOH)
Philippine General Hospital
National Disaster Risk Reduction Fund
Department of Labor and Employment programs
Department of Trade and Industry livelihood program
Department of Agriculture assistance programs
Department of Education school-based feeding programs 
Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) assistance programs 
Local government units (LGUs)
Quick response funds of department such as, but not limited to, DOH and DSWD

The measure allows the lifting of the 30% cap on amounts appropriated for the Quick Response Fund. 
This is in stark contrast to an earlier version of the measure, which had no breakdown of some P257 billion to be tapped to respond to the outbreak. 
Is this necessary? Several lawyers criticized the measure for being “superfluous.” Duterte, they insisted, did not need these special powers, as existing laws already vested  the executive branch such powers. 
In particular, the Free Legal Assistance Group (FLAG) said, Republic Act No. 11332 or the Mandatory Reporting of Notifiable Diseases and Health Events of Public Health Concern Act already gives Duterte powers to respond to a pandemic.  
Several lawmakers echoed this, saying the measure did not address the root cause of the health crisis seen in the Duterte government’s lack of a comprehensive plan against the outbreak.
Duterte has to report to Congress: The law requires Duterte to submit to Congress weekly reports on the utilization and realignment of funds related to the measure.
Meanwhile, those who violate the law may face imprisonment of up to two months or a fine of not less than P10,000 but not more than P1 million. Among possible violations include LGUs which do not follow national policies; private health facility owners who do not comply with the order; hoarders; and individuals or groups found to be ""creating, perpetuating, and spreading false news"" online and on other platforms.
The Bayanihan to Heal as One Act will be valid for 3 months unless extended by Congress or terminated earlier through a concurrent resolution or a presidential proclamation.
As of Tuesday, the Philippines has recorded at least 552 confirmed coronavirus cases, including 19 recoveries, and 35 deaths. – Rappler.com  "

MANILA, Philippines – The Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) has ordered its armed wing, the New People's Army (NPA), to observe a ceasefire with government forces as the country battles the novel coronavirus pandemic.
The truce will begin at 12 am Thursday, March 26, and will last until 11:59 pm on April 15.
This coincides with the ceasefire earlier declared by the Philippine government on March 19, which also lapses on April 15.
""The purpose of this unilateral ceasefire is to ensure and facilitate necessary, unhampered, and immediate medical, health, and economic assistance, support, and movement of the people brought about by the exigencies of the current [coronavirus] worldwide pandemic that has affected a growing number of Filipinos and non-Filipinos alike,"" the CPP said in a statement on the website of its political wing, the National Democratic Front of the Philippines (NDF), on Tuesday night, March 24.
""This ceasefire is also a gesture towards national unity and based on humanitarian principles in the context of the serious public emergency to ensure the health, safety, and welfare of all,"" the group added.
The ceasefire declaration is its ""direct response"" to United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres' call for an ""immediate global ceasefire"" to help conflict-stricken countries respond to the pandemic.
CPP-NPA-NDF founder and leader Jose Maria ""Joma"" Sison said earlier on Tuesday that he had set in motion the series of recommendations that would enable the CPP to declare a ceasefire.
President Rodrigo Duterte first asked the NPA for a ceasefire on March 16, as he announced that he would place the entire island of Luzon on lockdown to slow down the spread of the virus.
Sison hesitated to reciprocate Duterte's call, even when Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana officially ordered the military to stand down on March 19.
Both sides have harbored distrust, with each accusing the other of violating earlier ceasefires. Lorenzana said communist guerrillas use ceasefires as an opportunity to regroup even as they continue harassing civilian communities and attacking government troops.
Now that they are on ceasefire, both sides instructed their forces to remain on guard against any possible attack from the other.
Duterte wanted a ceasefire to enable the police and military to focus on enforcing the ""enhanced community quarantine"" in Luzon and in other parts of the country where local governments have enforced the measure to contain the virus.

MANILA, Philippines – The Baguio General Hospital installed the Artificial Intelligence COVID-19 Scan Analyzer on Monday, March 23 to help doctors detect COVID-19 cases using the CT scan of the patients. 
Dr. Ricardo B. Runes, Jr, BGH director, said that the application, a technology introduced by Huawei Company in China, will have the CT scans of patients compared to the database of positive COVID-19 cases examined by doctors in China, where the novel coronavirus originated. The n-CoV 19 was first detected in the city of Wuhan in December last year.
“The AI will determine the specific findings in the CT scan if there are similarities with those in China,” Runes said.
Baguio City's first COVID-19 patient is a 61-year-old Overseas Filipino Worker (OFW) who came from Italy, now the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak. 
Baguio City Mayor  Benjie Magalong said that the technology transfer will be the first of its kind in the country.
“For the past two days, our city through our Management Information and Technical Division (MITD)  under Executive Asst. V Philip Puzon has been working together with the technical team of Huawei and Baguio doctors to set up the system in BGH. It will be the first of its kind in the country,"" Magalong said, adding that the technology is given for free.
On Monday, Magalong inspected the AI CT Scan System, expressing hope that this would be “up and running by Monday or Tuesday.”
The AI analyzer takes only 2 minutes, compared to the current screening test kits that take 4 to 5 days, Magalong said.
The AI analyzer’s results are “not conclusive and confirmatory but will give the city a heads-up on whether or not a patient is a probable COVID-19 case,” the mayor added.

In a statement, Huawei said it has developed an AI-assisted version of the CT scan, producing accurate results in less time and with less manpower. 
The AI technology, known as Huawei Cloud, can automatically scan for lesions in a matter of seconds and without needing as much legwork.
The Huawei Cloud can scan images multiple times to increase diagnosis efficiency. According to Huawei, Huawei Cloud uses Ascend AI chips to accomplish this task. – Rappler.com "

NEW PLAN. President Rodrigo Duterte holds a meeting with some members of his Cabinet to discuss updates on the coronavirus disease on March 24, 2020. Malacañang photo  
MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – As the number of people infected with the novel coronavirus continues to rise, President Rodrigo Duterte on Tuesday night, March 24, said the government is set to implement a ""national action plan"" to combat the deadly outbreak. 
Duterte made the announcement in a taped public address, saying the plan will complement efforts of the Department of Health (DOH), the main agency addressing developments on coronavirus cases. 
""The Department of National Defense (DND) and the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG), along with the Armed Forces of the Philippines and the Philippine National Police, are now ramping up the implementation of the National Action Plan or NAP, as we speak, to reinforce the efforts of the Department of Health in containing COVID-19,"" Duterte said in a televised message.
In a message to reporters, Justice Secretary Menardo Guevarra said the NAP is the ""overall national strategy to deal with the COVID-19 problem and its aftermath.""
It is also related to a bill seeking to grant Duterte 30 special powers to address the coronavirus outbreak.
""The bill gives the President the special powers to implement the NAP in the most expeditious manner,"" Guevarra said.
What to expect? Details on the said plan were not disclosed as of this posting. Duterte said progress reports on the implementation of the NAP will be completed regularly.  
Duterte said Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana will chair the group in charge of the plan, while Interior Secretary Eduardo Año will sit as its vice-chairman. 
Along with the the DND and DILG, the President said the DOH and the Department of Social Welfare and Development are among the ""most important departments that are now in action.""
The group handling the NAP will operate alongside the Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF) earlier formed to combat the coronavirus. The IATF is headed by the DOH. 
Why this matters. Before this announcement by Duterte, the DILG was on top of implementing the Luzon-wide lockdown and the ""enhanced community quarantine"" in other parts of the country that have implemented the measure to avert the spread of the virus. 
On March 13, days before Metro Manila was first placed on ""community quarantine,"" Lorenzana said the military, supervised by the DND, would take a secondary role to the police in enforcing the lockdown.
Thus far, the police, as supervised by the DILG, have been in charge, and military contingents are deployed to augment the police's presence at checkpoints.
The military has helped out by deploying vehicles and other assets to help health workers and other essential business employees in their commute, and to convey medical equipment, supplies, and aid to areas on lockdown.

SINGAPORE (UPDATED) – A 9-year-old boy who recently visited the Philippines is the 15th Filipino to test positive for the novel coronavirus in Singapore, the country's Ministry of Health (MOH) said on Tuesday evening, March 24.
Singapore classified the 9-year-old boy as an imported case, which means he likely contracted the coronavirus overseas. His most recent travel history was to the Philippines.
Identified only as Case 523, the boy is a long-term pass holder in Singapore. He tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, on Monday, March 23. He is now confined at the KK Women's and Children's Hospital here. 
The MOH said the boy is a family member of Case 394, a 66-year-old Filipina long-term pass holder who is also classified as an imported case.
The 9-year-old Filipino is among the 49 new coronavirus cases in Singapore on Tuesday. Of this number, 32 are classified as imported while 17 are local.
Singapore has had 558 coronavirus cases as of Tuesday. Of this number, 155 patients have recovered, 17 remain in critical condition, and two have died. Most are stable or improving in the hospital.
The Philippines is one of the countries that have exported coronavirus cases to Singapore, which is now battling a surge in imported coronavirus cases.
The rise in imported cases in recent days, mostly from the United Kingdom and the United States, have prompted Singapore to tighten its border restrictions and physical distancing measures. One of these is the ban on all tourists and transit passengers starting 11:59 pm Monday.
Stricter rules
On Tuesday, Singapore also published its strictest measures yet to ensure physical distancing to fight the pandemic. These measures will be in effect from 11:59 pm on Friday, March 26, until April 30, but Singapore said it might extend the effectivity if the coronavirus situation fails to improve.
These measures include the following:

closure of all bars and entertainment venues such as discos, night clubs, cinemas, karaoke outlets, and theaters
ban on groups of more than 10 persons, including diners, in public venues such as malls, museums, and other attractions
required one-meter spacing between patrons in queues or waiting areas
required one-meter spacing between tables or groups of diners in food and beverage outlets, even as related diners such as family members or couples can sit together at one table
suspension of organized tours in public venues

 
Singapore on Tuesday also suspended all religious services in the country. The Roman Catholic Church in Singapore had earlier voluntarily suspended Masses starting February 15 due to the coronavirus.
Measures vs traveling Singaporeans 

Singapore is also cracking down on Singapore residents and long-term pass holders who continue to travel abroad despite government warnings. 
The MOH warned: ""Any Singapore resident or long-term pass holder who leaves Singapore from March 27, 2020, in disregard of the prevailing travel advisories, will be charged at unsubsidized rates for their inpatient stay at public hospitals, if they are admitted for suspected COVID-19 and have onset of symptoms within 14 days of returning to Singapore. Singapore residents will also not be able to claim from MediShield Life or Integrated Shield Plans for these treatments at public and private hospitals.""
At the same time, ""any work pass holder or his/her dependent who leaves Singapore from March 27, 2020, will be deprioritized for entry approval and could see significant delays before they are allowed to return to Singapore if they persist in traveling abroad and return infected.""
As for Singaporean residents, many of them students, returning from the US or the UK, the Singaporean government is requiring them to stay indoors for 14 days in designated hotels. These returning residents will receive a 14-day Stay Home Notice (SHN) from the Singaporean government, under which they will be penalized if they leave their hotels within these 14 days.
""To prevent potential spread of infection from the UK and US returnees to their family members, we will work with hotel operators to provide dedicated facilities for the returnees to serve their 14-day SHN. Transportation will be arranged to send the returnees directly from the airport to the hotels. Each will have their own room/toilet, and will be provided all their meals, so that they may avoid physical contact with other individuals. These SHN requirements will be strictly enforced so as to reduce the risk of community transmission from imported cases,"" said the MOH.
Singapore has not imposed a lockdown unlike other countries, but warned that it might have to implement more drastic measures if the coronavirus situation here does not improve.
""Many countries have imposed total lockdowns to prevent the spread of the virus. Such lockdowns have significantly disrupted lives and economies throughout the world, but were deemed necessary to ease the strain on health care systems in those countries,"" said the MOH.
""We therefore cannot afford to be complacent in Singapore. We must implement tighter safe distancing measures now to minimize activities and exposure, so as to significantly reduce the risks of seeding new local clusters. For safe distancing to be effective, all Singaporeans must take it seriously and do their part. Otherwise, we will need more drastic measures later,"" the ministry added. – Rappler.com "

SPECIAL POWERS. The proposed Bayanihan to Heal as One Act would give President Rodrigo Duterte the special power to punish people spreading fake news about the coronavirus. RTVM screengrab 
MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – A last-minute amendment to President Rodrigo Duterte's special powers bill to contain the novel coronavirus was an expansion of the section on penalties, which now specifically punishes the spreading of fake and alarming information by up 2 months in prison and up to P1 million in fines.
The Bayanihan to Heal as One Act, which is now up for Duterte's signature, was deliberated on the floor up to the wee hours of Tuesday, March 24, with some amendments that were not caught by the Senate livestream.
The final version that the Senate released noontime Tuesday, and which the House adopted, specifies acts under Section 6 that will be penalized by ""imprisonment of two (2) months or a fine of not less than Ten Thousand Pesos but not more than One Million Pesos, or both such imprisonment and fine, at the discretion of the court.""
Section 6(6) punishes ""individuals or groups creating, perpetuating, or spreading false information regarding the covid-19 crisis on social media and other platforms, such information having no valid or beneficial effect on the population, and are clearly geared to promote chaos, panic, anarchy, fear, or confusion."" (READ: Why Duterte doesn't need special powers to address the coronavirus outbreak)
It also punishes ""those participating in cyber incidents that make use or take advantage of the current crisis situation to prey on the public through scams, phishing, fraudulent emails, or other similar acts."" 
Apart from fake news, Section 6 punishes the following:

Local officials disobeying;
Hospitals who refuse to cooperate with the president;
Hoarding, profiteering, cartels;
Refusal to accept contracts for essential materials, services;
Refusal to give 30-day grace period to payments, loans, etc;
Failure to comply with suspension of transport;
Impeding access to roads, bridges, etc.

Is it legal?
Former Supreme Court spokesperson Ted Te said the subparagraph on the punishment of fake news ""would be void.""
There is no law that punishes, or even defines, fake news.
""Since there is no law that criminizalizes or defines fake news as a crime, and the special powers law does not also define what fake news is, it cannot be criminalized. That would be void,"" said Te.
Te also said it would step on the constitutional right to free speech.
""That can be questioned as being vague as well as overbroad considering that it trenches on freedom of expression and of speech,"" said Te.
Section 6(6) punishes ""perpetuating, or spreading"" false information.
In the landmark case Disini vs DOJ, the Supreme Court struck down as unconstitutional the part of the Cybercrime Law that punishes ""aiding and abetting"" in a case of cyber libel.
In the Supreme Court landmark decision Chavez vs Gonzales, the High Court said that government regulations that restrict free speech must have a compelling state interest. One of the tests to determine this is the presence of a clear and present danger to the public.
In an earlier department order to investigate the spread of fake news, Justice Secretary Menardo Guevarra said ""the clear and present danger is ""causing undue panic and alarm in part, but also undermining government efforts for a unified and coordinated approach to a common threat that affects us all.""
Duplication
The acts punished under Section 6 are already punished by existing laws.
For example, disobeying local executives can be punished under the Code of Conduct of Public Officials and even graft. Duterte has always threatened disobeying local officials of charging them with dereliction of duty.
The Department of Justice (DOJ) has even cited Republic Act 11332 or the broad Mandatory Reporting of Notifiable Diseases which punishes 'non-cooperation' in a health emergency.
The DOJ even said warrantless arrests can be implemented under this law.
""That being said, much of those enumerated in sec. 6 are already prohibited by special laws or punished as felonies,"" said Te. – Rappler.com  "

In a Facebook post in Filipino, Dualan said that after “several tests” were done on the swab taken from him on March 18, the doctors declared him “positive but in good condition.”  
He said he had been advised to go into “strict self-quarantine.”

“Sa awa ng Panginoon, alam kong malalampasan natin ang lahat ng ito,” the mayor said. (By God’s mercy, we will overcome this.) 
On March 20, Dualan posted on Facebook that he sought to get tested on March 18, a day after he went into quarantine. The initiative to isolate himself came when he learned of the news that Mayor Ferdie Estrella of Baliuag, Bulacan, had tested positive for COVID-19. 
Dualan said he was at the general assembly of the League of Municipalities of the Philippines, which Estrella also attended. 
With Dualan directing local government operations from home, Naic has imposed a liquor ban, and workers have been disinfecting major roads, among other measures to arrest the coronavirus outbreak.

BACOLOD CITY, Philippines – A Bacolod resident’s complaint about overpriced bottles of alcohol led to the arrest of three employees of an aesthetics store on Tuesday, March 24.
Agents of the National Bureau of Investigation-Bacolod office set up an entrapment operation on Tuesday afternoon after the resident reported buying 2 250 ml bottles of ethyl alcohol from the store for P90.
It was double the P41 price ceiling set by the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) to ensure that sellers will not take advantage of the high demand for ethyl alcohol amid the coronavirus outbreak. 
Medical experts strongly urge people to wash their hands thoroughly with warm water and soap to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Using 70% disinfectant ethyl alcohol augments the recommended hand hygiene, which led to people stocking up on it since the coronavirus exploded worldwide. (READ: 'Customer not always right': Alcohol hoarders should be sent out of stores, says DTI)
The suspects, all residents of Barangay Tangub, work at L-Power Skin Care and Beauty Enhancer located on Galo Street.
NBI- Bacolod chief Renoir Baldovino said that the sellers and the store’s owner will be charged for violation of Republic Act 7581, or the Price Act. (Hoarding, overpricing would lead to criminal charges, warns DTI)
Aside from arresting the sellers, the NBI agents also recovered 37 gallons of ethyl alcohol, and 104 bottles of alcohol in 250 ml size.
Baldovino said that the recovered alcohol will also be tested to determine its content. He said that additional cases will be filed if the alcohol was illegally produced.
Meanwhile, Baldovino reminded the sellers not to take advantage of the difficult situation brought by the coronavirus pandemic.

MANILA, Philippines – A senior military officer and his wife have tested positive and are being treated for the novel coronavirus, Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) chief of staff General Felimon Santos Jr said in a statement to reporters on Tuesday, March 24.
Santos himself is under home quarantine because he had come into contact with the infected officer, he said.
The said officer has “a history of foreign travel.” He and his wife were admitted to the AFP Medical Center in Quezon City on March 15 as persons under investigation (PUI) for the coronavirus.
The couple have been undergoing “proper medical management,” and the officer is now asymptomatic, Santos said. He declined to identify the officer to the media.
The military chief, meanwhile, said he was working from his quarters in the AFP General Headquarters, Camp Aguinaldo in Quezon City. (READ: Distrust on both sides as government starts ceasefire with communist rebels)
Although he did attend a conference with the infected officer, Santos said they were already practicing physical distancing at the time, and he did not come within one meter of the patient then.
Santos put himself in quarantine “just to make sure, and undergo the protocol for the safety of everyone,” he said, adding that personnel at headquarters have observed a “no touch” protocol since the local outbreak of the virus began in late January.
Santos said he is physically well, and not experiencing any symptom of infection.
Strict measures
Camp Aguinaldo is under strict measures to protect its military and civilian personnel from the virus, Santos said.
Since Metro Manila went on lockdown or “community quarantine” on March 15, only two of the camp’s 6 gates have been opened to better monitor the movement of people. More officers with thermal scanners have been assigned to check people’s body temperature at entry and exit points.
The AFP’s Commissioned Officers’ Club, which has a café and restaurant, is temporarily closed. The Soldier’s Mall, which has stores and eateries, remains open.
The camp’s golf course, the AFP Finance Center, and other financial establishments within the camp are also temporarily shut.
Religious services in the camps’ chapels and prayer halls are closed to the public but are broadcast live by the Civil Relations Service, AFP.
The Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Personnel, J1, has allowed civilian employees to work from home, but military personnel remain in camp as they are on call. (READ: Joma Sison takes cue from UN, calls for ceasefire with government)
Military contingents have been deployed to checkpoints to assist the police in enforcing the “enhanced community quarantine” or lockdown of Metro Manila, the rest of Luzon, and other parts of the Philippines.
For this, the Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Logistics, J4, provides important equipment and supplies for soldiers on duty, Santos said.
Treatment facility
A Military Treatment Facility has been opened in Camp Aguinaldo to cater specifically to AFP personnel manifesting symptoms of the coronavirus disease or COVID-19.
Personnel from the General Headquarters Support Command and the station hospital have been conducting an information drive for the camp’s residents, urging them to take precautions agains the virus.
“Protocols from the Department of Health…[are] being strictly implemented, including intensified contact tracing to ensure the safety of military and civilian personnel in the General Headquarters,” Santos said.
Besides checkpoint duty, the military’s different service branches – the Army, Navy, and Air Force – have deployed vehicles and other assets to assist essential workers in their commute, and to transport medical supplies, equipment, and relief items to areas on lockdown.

""Met EU CDA Thomas Wiersing who delivered the bad news that foreign tourists are sleeping in open air without shelter or roof over their heads because their hotels kicked [them] out once their booking ends,"" Locsin said. 
""Yes, it is our problem. A number of them have medical conditions including pregnancy. Shet (Shit),"" he added.
Like many other countries, the Philippines recently implemented wide travel restrictions banning all non-Filipinos from entering the country to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus. 
The Department of Foreign Affairs suspended all visa issuances, canceled previously issued visas, and stopped visa-free arrivals, with some exceptions. This comes on top of restrictions on domestic land, air, and sea travel put in place along with the Philippine government's move to lock down the entire island group of Luzon. 
Worldwide travel restrictions have also left a vast number of international flights grounded, forcing countries to arrange chartered flights to take their citizens home. (READ: Philippine Airlines suspends all flights)

What can be done? A proposed solution being considered, Locsin said, would be to observe a 24-hour window ""until the last foreign tourist is out.""
""They should be allowed to board flights and vessels to take them to international airports even without tickets [because] how the fuck would they have tickets; they're in our fucking provinces,"" he tweeted.
Locsin said among the ""pressing"" calls of the EU which the Philippines needs to respond to are to increase domestic transport to service tourists bound for international ports, and to ensure they have shelter if no flight is available, ""out of plain human decency.""
The foreign affairs chief further suggested sanctioning local government units who would prevent tourists from leaving. The hotels that kicked tourists out, he added, should be named and blacklisted.
Locsin called on the Department of Transportation to aid tourists and appealed to EU embassies to fill up flights back to Europe.
Foreign Undersecretary Brigido Dulay said the issue would be raised in the meeting of the government's coronavirus task force on Tuesday.

MANILA, Philippines – A youth group in Cordillera is working to ensure frontliners battling the spread of the coronavirus outbreak in the area are well-protected.
Even before Luzon was placed under lockdown on March 17, members of the Cordillera Youth Brigade of Youth for Peace and Development Movement (YFPDM) noticed how some frontliners in Tabuk City, Kalinga, were heading out into the field without personal protective equipment (PPE). (READ: Left in the dark: Little protection for government's coronavirus frontliners)
Comprised of young people aged 15-30 who are graduates of Youth Leadership Summits conducted by their local government units, Cordillera Youth Brigade led an initiative to help provide PPEs to military, police, health workers and barangay council officers on duty in the area. 
Their inspiration for the project was the military, police, and health workers on the frontlines who were working to prevent the spread of the virus without enough protection. Their call is to help our protectors to have the protection they need to work effectively. (READ: Frontliners battle fear to confront novel coronavirus)
 
 
Using their own money to buy the materials, volunteers of the Cordillera Youth Brigade improvised face shields using acetate and face masks from fabric cloth. They’re also distributing hand disinfectants to frontline workers battling coronavirus in their barangays. (READ: Filipinos find ways to improvise safety in the time of coronavirus)
The organization prepared 280 face shields, 50 face masks, and hundreds of liters of hand disinfectant, distributing it to all checkpoints and all 42 barangays in Tabuk City. The nearest barangay from the city is just a one-minute drive away, while the farthest is Brgy. Dupag – a one-hour trip from the center of town.
The group hopes that through their simple efforts in providing PPEs, however improvised, frontliners will have ample protection, ensuring they can go home to their families safely.
 
 
The group said that they chose to prioritize Tabuk City because it is also considered as a center of livelihood, both in the province and in the region. Tabuk City is one of only two cities in Cordillera aside from Baguio City.
Due to a lack of acetate, the group had to improvise again, using 6-liter plastic bottles of mineral water for the face shields.
Their next plan is to provide for all the municipalities of the province if they can have enough materials. And after ensuring that all frontliners are given protection, they also plan to provide some for their fellow students.
They also recently started distributing to neighbor municipalities in Pinukpuk, Tanudan, Lubuagan and Rizal.
 
After being contacted by the Kalinga Provincial Hospital, Kalinga District Hospital and several rural health units and private clinics, their volunteers are again making free PPEs to be distributed to these medical centers.
Aside from getting positive feedback, they also received donations in the form of raw materials from doctors, store managers and private personalities in Kalinga. A sewing machine was also lent to them so they can make more improvised face masks.
Several youth groups from Mountain Province and Bukidnon also contacted them and asked for their assistance in replicating their project.
Among the groups that adopted their initiative is POINTY Bukidnon (Propelling Our Inherited Nation Through our Youth Bukidnon).
The group has been distributing free hygiene kits which include anti-bacterial soap, tissue, and leaflets on COVID-19 symptoms and proper handwashing to commuters and locals at the Maramag-Quezon border in Bukidnon.
They hope the distribution of almost 160 hygiene kits will help commuters and locals remember how proper hand-washing can help minimize the spread of the virus.
Loverne Abbacan, YFPDM Cordillera Youth Brigade Regional President, highlighted the importance of the youth in nation-building, especially during difficult times. Through their initiative, they hoped to show the contribution of the youth in Kalinga, and were touched how even professionals recognized the importance of the youth-led project. (READ: Filipino bayanihan spirit shines through amid coronavirus outbreak)
""We decided to help to show the role of youth in nation-building lalo na sa mga ganitong nangyayaring sakuna, para maipakita po na bilang kabataan, may ma-i-aambag po kaming maganda at kapaki-pakinabang sa lipunan,"" said Abbacan.
(We decided to help to show the role of youth in nation-building, especially during crises, to show that the youth can contribute to society.)
 
 
With the ongoing crisis due to rise of confirmed coronavirus cases in the country, the region is putting in place measures to contain the spread of the virus. It currently houses a Huawei Al CT Scan System in Baguio City, which is being test run for faster infection detection of coronavirus among patients.
While the results are not conclusive and confirmatory, Baguio City Mayor Benjamin Magalong said he hopes the technology will help give a heads-up if the patient is a probable COVID-19 case.
As of March 23, 4pm, Tabuk City has no confirmed cases of coronavirus. However, they have 17 persons under investigation (PUI) and 868 persons under monitoring for COVID-19, according to Tabuk City Health Office.
Meanwhile, the first COVID-19 case in Cordillera was a 39-year-old seafarer from Abra who tested positive on March 14. Nine days later, a 61-year-old woman who had traveled to Italy became the first confirmed case in Baguio City, according to DOH Cordillera Regional Director Dr Amelita Pangilinan.
The aim of Cordillera Youth Brigade is to render limited services for a peaceful, united and well-developed community, specifically to their area of responsibility.
Cordillera Youth Brigade is still accepting donations, especially raw materials. They can be contacted through their mobile number at 09218827083, and email address at cordillerayouthbrigade.yorp@gmail.com. – Rappler.com "

BACOLOD CITY, Philippines – Drivers of public utility vehicles in Bacolod City cried for help, saying they have no more food to feed their families a week after the city imposed community quarantine measures to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus disease.
Diego Malacad, secretary-general of the United Negros Drivers Operators Center (UNDOC), asked the local government and the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) to allocate financial assistance to affected drivers.
The Negros Island city has a population of more than 500,000. It reported its first confirmed case of coronavirus last week, March 20. 
Some of UNDOc members have stopped working due to fears they will get the disease. Malacad said he will continue to work because he has to feed his family.
“We are not afraid of the virus. We are afraid because we have no more money to feed our families. Gutom na kami (We are all hungry),” he said.
He said he makes sure to practice physical distancing as much as possible and avoids touching his face. “I also disinfect and tell my family not to go out of the house,” he said.
He stopped wearing a mask because it made him touch his face more.
Lower income
The curfew and strict physical distancing measures in place has taken a toll on the income of drivers, however.
They can only have few passengers each trip. “Jeepneys can accommodate 16 passengers before. But now, it is down to 8 passengers,"" Malacad said. 
They used to earn P400 a day. He said they're lucky to bring home P200 these days.
It's worse for tricycle driver Danny Tingson, resident of barangay Mandalagan. He said he also used to earn P400 a day. It is now down to P150. 
Tingson has been driving for the past 20 years. Tricycles carried 6 passengers each trip before the quaratine measures were put in place. They are now allowed to carry only one or two people.
“Right now, we earn P10 or P20 each trip. We used to earn P60,” he said.
He does not earn enough anymore to be feed his family. ""Pang bugas nalang gid (It can only buy rice),” he said.
“It is really hard for us drivers. The virus may not kill us, but hunger and poverty will,” Malacad said. – Rappler.com

MANILA, Philippines – The Department of Health (DOH) on Tuesday, March 24, said that patients healed of the coronavirus disease or COVID-19 do not need to undergo another test if their vital signs have returned to normal.
“Kapag wala na pong sintomas ang ating COVID-19 positive case, bumalik na rin sa normal ang ilang tests tulad ng CBC at chest X-ray ay maari na po siyang pauwiin, (If a COVID-19 patient doesn't experience any symptom of the disease anymore and if the CBC and chest X-ray have returned to normal, the patient can be discharged),"" said DOH Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire in a press briefing. 
According to Vergeire, the discharged patient, though, would still have to undergo a 14-day home quarantine. A repeat test will be done after this quarantine. 
“Ang pag-uulit po ng test ay isinasagawa lamang pagkatapos sumailim sa 14-day home quarantine ang pasyente pagkatapos siya ma-discharge (A test will only be conducted after the 14-day home quarantine of the patient upon release),"" Vergeire added.

Navarro said he might have been infected with the virus during a recent trip to Japan when in the return flight a co-passenger was severely coughing.
 
After 14 days of confinement at the Research Institute of Tropical Medicine and St Luke’s Medical Center, Navarro was able to return home.  He, however, was put under a 14-day home quarantine while waiting for the result of his test.  
“My doctor cleared me [that] my pneumonia has improved and I don’t have symptoms anymore. He told me I can go out and take care of myself,” Navarro said in a Rappler Talk interview. 
According to the DOH, a COVID-19 patient will undergo two to 3 tests while in isolation. Navarro was tested 6 times. (WATCH: Rappler Talk: COVID-19 PH4 on battling the coronavirus)

,"March 24, 2020",nCov,"Groups urge gov’t, companies to prioritize BPO workers’ welfare amid pandemic",Kurt dela Peña,"
Photo from Shutterstock 
MANILA, Philippines – Days into the enhanced community quarantine triggered by the coronavirus pandemic, various groups called on the government and on Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) companies to guarantee the safety and income of workers.
The government, in its bid to arrest the spread of the coronavirus, imposed a month-long lockdown in the entire island of Luzon, implementing strict quarantine for all households and suspending public transportation.
The measure strictly limits the movement of at least 57 million people across Luzon. Despite the situation, BPO companies remain operational, so long as workforce arrangements are skeletal, social distancing measures are observed, and temporary accommodations are available.
This poses challenges to workers, however, especially with the suspension of public transportation, as they are forced to find ways to head to their offices and show up to work to ensure their income. (READ: LIST: Who are allowed out during Luzon lockdown?)
This did not sit well with several groups, prompting them to launch online petitions urging companies and the government to prioritize the rights and welfare of BPO workers by letting them work from home in light of threats posed by the coronavirus.
“Amid this extraordinary time, we call on the Philippine government and BPO companies to put employees’ health and well-being a top priority. Let BPO workers stay at home,” the Business Process Outsourcing Industry Employees Network (BIEN) expressed in its change.org petition.
As of today, the online petition already has more than 4,000 signatures.
According to BIEN, while arrangements have been set up by a few companies, some workers are forced to consume their leave credits while some “are still lost in the dark” after their companies ceased operations without guaranteeing employees’ incomes.
No work, no pay
Naming the companies that refuse to close their offices and let their employees work from home, the University of the Philippines’ Alyansa ng mga Mag-aaral para sa Panlipunang Katwiran at Kaunlaran (UP Alyansa) was among those that promoted an online petition asking for flexible working arrangements for workers.

 
According to the group, the companies named in the petition “demand that people come into the office in order to be paid, implementing strict ‘No Work, No Pay’ policies.”
As of writing, the petition has gotten at least 10,893 signatures.
“UP Alyansa strongly disagrees with these policies and calls on these call centers to prioritize the welfare of their employees. The Philippines is one of the main locations for worldwide call-centers employing thousands of our fellow Filipinos. In this public health crisis, survival also entails food and job security,” the alliance said.
In an interview with Rappler, BIEN President Mylene Cabalona said it is high time for the government and private companies to recognize workers as “economic drivers” by providing them with social protection.
Cabalona shared that, in a survey conducted by their group, some BPO companies were not prepared as regards the arrangements set by the government.
“Meron pa ring mga work from home pero hindi sila prepared. May mga nag-provide ng accommodation, pero apparently, sa lounges nila sa office nag-stay ang mga empleyado at dahil sa dami, hindi na ma-accommodate, ” she said.
(There are work-from-home arrangements but companies are not prepared. There are companies providing accommodation but apparently, employees are staying at the office’s lounges and due to the number of workers, they can no longer accommodate them.)
According to BIEN, companies should suspend on-site work and set-up efficient work-from-home arrangements while guaranteeing income and paid time off for affected employees without reducing their leave credits.
Workers’ demands during quarantine
Amid the plight of workers during the lockdown, labor group Kilusang Mayo Uno laid out 4 demands: “guaranteed income, free mass testing and treatment, food supply, [upholding] people's rights and welfare.” 
The group said daily wage earners should be given a paid quarantine leave. Meanwhile, workers who still need to go to their offices should be provided with enough protection, such as personal protective equipment. Additionally, there should be disinfection of workplaces and free testing, along with safe and regular means of transportation.
According to BIEN, the government and companies should provide socio-economic support for BPO workers to mitigate the adverse economic impacts of the pandemic outbreak.
“Now more than ever, the government must act to protect the rights and livelihood of workers. Companies are summoned to practice due diligence to prevent the spread of COVID 19 and contribute in alleviating its impact on the livelihood of workers and our families,” the group said. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines– Hoping to be productive while under quarantine, mother Hycinth Clor de Arta set up a mini sari-sari store at home for her children in Davao del Norte, complete with rules, prices, play money, and even ""salaries.""
The whole province of Davao del Norte has been under community quarantine since March 16, in a bid to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus. Because of the quarantine, classes in all levels have been suspended.
De Arta shared how her 4 children have spent most of their free time watching TV, movies, and YouTube while holed up at home.
Seeing that their fridge was fully stocked, De Arta decided to set up ""Mama's home quarantine store"" in their living room on the first week of the lockdown. She displayed their junk food, biscuits, candies, and fruits in a stand by their living room to serve as the makeshift sari-sari store.

""We came up with an idea that would change their daily routine. I believe that putting up a mini store inside our house for our kiddos using play money would be the best activity to do,"" De Arta said.
To purchase food from the sari-sari store, the kids will have to do their chores to earn enough play money. Each chore such as sweeping the floor in the kitchen or throwing the trash has its own corresponding amount ranging from P200 to P500.
""They get an opportunity to do some household responsibilities and earn from it accordingly. They will learn how to save their earned money and spend it wisely. [It's] one way to teach them financial literacy. And the best thing of all is we get to bond as a family. We are all enjoying it,"" she added.
Through the sari-sari store, De Arta also teaches her children the importance of personal hygiene, cleanliness, and physical distancing to guard against the coronavirus.
Among her rules is a ban on people without face masks, as well as using alcohol first before buying. Physical distancing is also a must when lining up. Those caught fighting or crying will be banned from the store for 3 hours, too.
Even with the chores, De Arta said her children were excited about having a sari-sari store in their home.
""They were happy and very much excited to earn money,"" she added.
For those interested to set up their own sari-sari stores for their kids, De Arta suggested placing food and other items that kids are interested in, so they'll be eager to participate.
""Educate them how to get those things so they will work for it. I know all parents couldn't bear their children crying if they really want to get what they want. As a parent, all you have to do is motivate them and guide them how to get things done,"" she said.
Online, several netizens lauded the initiative and noted how it instills the value of hard work at a young age.

TEST KITS. File photo of test kits for the novel coronavirus disease 
DAVAO CITY, Philippines – The Southern Philippines Medical Center (SPMC) in Davao City on Tuesday, March 24, said it is now capable of local testing of samples for the novel coronavirus disease. 
Anabelle Yumang, head of Department of Health (DOH) Region 11, said there are limited supply of test kits, however. 
“The current protocol is to test only those who are admitted in the hospital,” she said during a press conference on Tuesday. 
There were demands for ""targeted mass testing"" in the entire Mindanao, citing the experience of South Korea which conducted as many as 20,000 tests a day in order to identify and isolate positive coronavirus cases. 
""Mindanaoans should unite in calling for mass and sustained testing as recommended by the World Health Organization,"" Bishop Melzar Labuntog, chairman of humanitarian group Balsa Mindanao, said in a statement on Tuesday. 
The bishop said the region should be prioritized because of its vulnerable population, citing the prevalence of seasonal workers, farmworkers, contractual workers, street peddlers, poor peasants, indigenous peoples, and countless of unemployed.
""Given current limitations, we need to prioritize and target mass testing for persons under monitoring, persons under investigation, the elderly, and those vulnerable due to chronic health and nutrition problems like poor women and children, indigenous peoples, workers in frontline services including health workers, and the urban poor,"" he said.
Balsa Mindanao also encouraged the mobilization of barangay health workers in preventing the spread of the disease, distribution of cash subsidies and food assistance to vulnerable population, government purchase of agricultural products for distribution to the people, and price control of basic commodities among other suggestions. 
Mass testing is 'doable'
Yumang said mass testing is ""doable in the Davao region"" if the test kits are available.
Cleofe Tabada, head of the Regional Epidemiology Surveillance Unit (RESU) for Davao, said they have tested at least 65 samples at SPMC since the hospital received test kits from the DOH national office on March 19.
Tabada said these initial results from the local tests will still go through validation tests at the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) in Muntinlupa City. 
The hospital will conduct tests in full swing after RITM completes initial tests.
DOH Assistant Secretary Roy Ferrer, coordinator of the Emergency Operations Center for the Visayas and Mindanao, said 200 more test kits arrived in Mindanao on Monday and 5,000 more are expected after RITM completes initial validation tests.
“There is also a potential to expand the testing capacity in Mindanao,” Ferrer said. A secondary test center was proposed. – Rappler.com "

“Both hospitals have already exceeded maximum capacity and admitting more COVID-19 patients will seriously impact our ability to deliver the critical level of care and attention patients need at this time,” they said.
Hospital management said that they were also treating non-COVID patients whose health conditions cannot be compromised.

MANILA, Philippines – The 18th Congress has a total of 326 legislators in both houses, but only 10 voted no against the bill granting President Rodrigo Duterte 30 “special” powers to help fight the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic.In the House of Representatives, 9 lawmakers thumbed down House Bill (HB) No. 6616, while Senator Risa Hontiveros was the lone dissenter against Senate Bill (SB) No. 1418, which the House later agreed to adopt early Tuesday morning, March 24. (READ: Special powers bill to deal with coronavirus now up for Duterte's signature)
Once Duterte signs SB 1418 into law, he would have the authority to exercise these special powers for 3 months, with the ultimate goal of containing the spread of the novel coronavirus that has infected 501 people and killed 33 in the country as of Tuesday. 
Under the bill, Duterte’s special powers range from reallocating government savings to programs aimed to stop the disease, to “directing the operation” of privately-owned medical facilities and transportation to ferry health workers.
The dissenting legislators argued that Duterte already has the power to do these things even without SB 1418. They said that the bill does not address the root cause of the health crisis: the Duterte government’s lack of a comprehensive plan to stop COVID-19.

Several lawmakers from both chambers also said they voted yes ""but with strong reservations.""
Here are the salient points of the 10 dissenters’ explanation of their no votes against the special powers bill: 
Risa Hontiveros, senator
Hindi special powers ang sagot sa pandemic na ito, kundi political will para isulong ang mass-testing, ibigay ang PPEs at hazard pay sa mga frontliners, at ihatid ang cash assistance sa mga mahihirap na pamilya at nawalan ng kita. Bakit special powers na ang hinihingi habang hindi pa tuluyang nagamit ang kasalukuyang mandato at kapangyarihan na mayroon ang Pangulo? 
Ang hinihingi ng publiko ay klarong programa laban sa krisis na dulot ng COVID-19. Sana ay iwasan natin ang isa pang krisis na maaring dalhin sa taumbayan ng korapsyon at pang-aabuso sa kapangyarihan ng pamahalaan. 
(Special powers is not the answer to this pandemic but the political will to pursue mass-testing, give PPEs and hazard pay to frontliners, and deliver cash assistance to poor families and those who lost their livelihood. Why are they already asking for special powers when the President's current mandate and powers have not been exhausted?
What the public demands is a clear program against the crisis caused by COVID-10. Let's avoid another crisis brought upon the people by government corruption and abuse of power.)
Gabriel Bordado, Camarines Sur 3rd District
The powers proposed to be given to the President in order to realize the purposes of the bill are already in our laws, wisely apportioned and distributed to the many agencies and offices under the Executive Department and widely decentralized to local government units in order to make the burden lighter for everyone.
Instead of freeing the President of the tasks that departments under him are doing, local government units are undertaking, and the private sector is efficiently executing, our approval of this bill will unduly burden our leader with numerous tasks, disabling him to direct the different courses of action for all of us to succeed. 
Arlene Brosas, Gabriela Women’s Party 
Gabriela Women’s Party together with the Makabayan bloc made an effort to propose amendments to ensure that the funds will directly go primarily for health services and and economic relief, and of course for the purpose of transparency and providing safeguards, but to no avail. I also asked for the concrete plans, but my questions were not properly answered.
Hindi tayo papayag na magbigay ng malaking perang pamalengke na hindi sinasabi sa atin kung ano ang mga bibilhin. Hindi natin matitiyak na ito ay para sa kapakinabangan ng nakararaming mamamayan, at hindi para sa bulsa ng iilan (We can't agree to give a huge budget for procurement without letting us know the items to be bought. We cannot be certain that it would benefit the greater number of people and not the pockets of a few). For these reasons, we in Gabriela Women's Party strongly vote no to the granting of emergency powers to President Duterte.
Manuel Cabochan III, Magdalo
By approving this bill, we, the Congress, are effectively passing all the work and conferring all the powers to the President as if making him a lone savior of the crisis we are facing now. Nagawa na 'yan noon sa Martial Law sa Mindanao, hindi pa din nakabangon ang Marawi (That was done under Martial Law in Mindanao, but Marawi has yet to recover). COVID-19 cannot be solved by a legislative measure giving blanket powers to the President, the duration of which is ""as may be determined by the President.” 
The COVID-19 crisis requires a whole-of-government approach. Every branch of government and every agency have roles and powers to help in addressing the COVID-19 crisis. We should recognize and make use of all of these arms of government to serve the Filipino people. No extra powers needed, just servant-leaders and our people doing the right thing, proper coordination and utmost cooperation. I appreciate the noble intentions of the authors, but for this representation, emergency powers are not necessary.  
Eufemia Cullamat, Bayan Muna
Inisyal na tagumpay ng mamamayan ang pagtanggal ng mga unconstitutional na probisyon sa panukalang batas na ito…. Gayunpaman, walang komprehensibong plano ang administrasyong ito at hindi emergency powers ang sagot dito. Ang kawalan ng komprehensibong plano ay magbubukas lamang ng oportunidad para sa abuso at korapsyon. 
Sa kalagitnaan ng krisis pangkalusugan, hindi solusyon ang paghingi ng dagdag na kapangyarihan upang tugunan ang COVID-19. Hindi dapat pansinin ang paghingi ng Pangulo ng emergency powers. Dapat bigyan natin ng ibayong tuon ang paglaan ng sapat na pondo para sa libreng testing kits, pagpapagamot ng mga infected ng virus, at tuluyang pagsugpo sa COVID-19. Gayundin, higit na litaw ngayon ang pangangailangan para sa pagsasaayos ng serbisyong pangkalusugan ng bansa. 
(The removal of unconstitutinal provisions in this bill is an intial victory of the people.... However, this administration has no comprehensive plan and emergency powers is not the answer. The lack of a comprehensive plan would only provide opportunities for abuse and corruption.
In the midst of a health crisis, seeking more powers is not the solution to respond to COVID-19. The President's request for emergency powers should be ignored. We should give greater focus on providing free testing kits, treating those infected with the virus, and totally eradicating COVID-19. Also, has been highlighted is the need to put the country's healty services  in order.)

Furthermore, this Congress is entrusting to the President these tremendous emergency powers over the budget despite the failure of the administration to present to the public concrete solutions and a comprehensive, health-based, rights-respecting, and people-centered plan to defeat COVID-19. What we are only saying is this: If the executive wants emergency powers to tinker with the budget and off-budget funds, it must first show its plans. Without these plans, the people are left with no assurance that their taxes will indeed be spent for the battle against COVID-19 
We maintain the position that emergency powers are not needed as there are huge funds that the President can realign to defeat COVID-19 if only he wants to: Calamity Fund, Contingent Fund, confidential and intelligence funds, and presidential pork barrel. Sa ngalan ng mga tunay na bayani sa laban kontra-COVID-19 – ang ating mga doktor, nars, health workers, barangay workers, at volunteers – at sa mamamayang Pilipino – bumoboto kami ng no sa House Bill 6616 (In the name of the true heroes fighting COVID-19 – our doctors, nurses, health workers, barangay workers, and volunteers – and the Filipino people – we vote no to House Bill 6616.)

Dahil sa pangangalampag ng taumbayan, tinanggal na rin ang mga unconstitutional na probisyon tulad ng pagbibigay ng blanket authority sa kahit anong appropriation sa national budget, takeover ng malawak na bilang ng utilidad at telecommunications, at pagpapahaba ng bisa ng emergency powers sa tanging diskresyon ng Pangulo mismo. 
Sa kabila ng ating inisyal na tagumpay, hindi ito sapat upang komprehensibong sumalamin sa kailangang pondo para sa isang ""health-focused, rights-based"" na pamamaraan sa pagtugon sa public health emergency na posible kahit walang emergency powers. Nananatili ring vague ang mga partikular na nilalaman ng HB 6616 na maaaring pagmulan ng mga abuso at maling paggamit.
(Because of the outcry of the people, the unconsitutional provision like giving blanket authority to any appropriation in the national budget, takeover of a wide number of utilities and telecommunications, and extending the effectivity of the emergency under the sole discretion of the President, have been removed.
Despite our initial victory, this is not enough to fully reflect the needed funds for  ""health-focused, rights-based"" means of responding to the public healthy emergency that is possible even without emergency powers. Particular provisions of HB 6616 remain vague and may lead to abuse and misuse)
Kabataan Party-list votes no, mainly because the executive has already more than enough power under the declaration of public health emergency. We cannot entrust this regime with overly broad and vague emergency powers that are prone to more abuse and misuse. What the people needs now are emergency actions, not emergency powers.

No ang vote ng kinatawan ito at mahalagang maipaliwang ang dahilan sa ganitong pagboto. Wala pa man ang COVID-19, dumarami na ang bilang ng nawalan ng trabaho bunga ng maraming dahilan, at lalo pa itong lumala dahil sa kasalukuyang emergency. Ngunit walang detalye kung anong tulong ibibigay sa kanila tulad ng pagkain, panustos, gamot, kuryente, tubig at ibang mahahalagang gastusin.
Kaya't muli po, babalik ako sa naging batayan ng aming kritisismo. Nasaan po ang ganitong komprehensibong plano? Ano ang buong detalye ng pagtugon ng pamahalaan sa pangangailangan ng mamamayan? Ano ang mga detalyeng magbibigay ng matibay na dahilan sa hinihingi ng Pangulo na pagpapalawak ng kanyang kapangyarihan?
Nakakatakot na bigyan ng napakalaking kapangyarihan ang Pangulo na ‘di malinaw kung paano ito gagamitin.
(This representation votes no and it's important to explain this vote. Even before COVID-19 came here, there was an increase in those who lost their jobs because of may reasons, and things got even worse because of the current emergency. Bit no details were given on the kind of help to be given to them like food, cash aid, medicine, electricity, water, and other important expenses.
So again, let me go back to the basis of the criticism. Where is the comprehensive plan? What are the full details of the government's response to the needs of the people? What are the details that would give strong basis to the President's request for greater powers?
It's frightening to give such huge powers to a President when it's not clear how these would be used.)
Edcel Lagman, Albay 1st District
The grant of additional emergency powers to the President to combat COVID-19 is unnecessary because he has express and inherent powers as Chief Executive which he has been discharging nationwide to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus. 
In all other countries assaulted by COVID-19, no national parliament has granted its President or Prime Minister additional emergency powers to fight the pandemic, and no other President or Prime Minister has requested for any additional powers to address the public health emergency.
What is needed is a well-prepared supplemental budget, which must be adopted after the resumption of sessions starting May 4, 2020, to adequately fund an economic stimulus package to ameliorate affected citizens and displaced workers, and provide relief to distressed businesses, particularly micro and small industries; and fully replenish the amounts disbursed from the funds originally appropriated to the concerned national agencies which were disbursed to address the pandemic.

Ginoong Speaker, mga kapwa mambabatas: Hindi ang dagdag kapangyarihan, hindi ang paglusaw sa mga demokratikong proseso at institusyon ang kasagutan sa suliraning ating kinakaharap sa kasalukuyan.

Kaya naman, no ang boto ng Bayan Muna at ng kinatawang ito sa House Bill 6616.
(Mr Speaker, fellow lawmakers: The problem we're currently facing cannot be answered by additional powers, the dissolution of democratic processes and institutions. Instead, we would strengthen united, collective, and democratic processes and measures to address the true needs of our citizens up to the most marginalized and vulnerable sectors. 
That's why Bayan Muna and this representation voted no to House Bill 6616.)

MANILA, Philippines – The Pasig City government has devised a way to lessen people’s need to leave their homes to buy food during the coronavirus lockdown: roving stores.
On Tuesday, March 24, the city government began a Mobile Palengke (market) effort, sending cargo trucks with market goods to sell around Pasig.
Pasig Mayor Vico Sotto posted photos of the project’s test run on his official social media accounts.
“Upang mabawasan ang dami ng tao sa Pasig Mega Market at mga talipala, inilunsad namin ang Mobile Palengke. Presyong palengke, mas malapit sa mamimili, at tulong na rin sa mga maninindang Pasigueño,” Sotto said in a message accompanying the photos.
(To cut the number of people at Pasig Mega Market and at community markets. we launched Mobile Palengke. Prices are at public market rates, it’s closer to buyers, and it’s also a way of helping Pasigueño vendors.)
The city’s 5 roving stores will cover different areas of the city every morning, and the schedule will be posted on the Pasig Public Information Office’s Facebook page.

All the meat, fish, and produce that will be sold on the Mobile Palengke will be sourced from vendors at the Pasig Mega Market, to sustain their income during the “enhanced community quarantine.”
‘Parallel effort’
The roving stores are a “parallel effort” to the distribution of some 400,000 food packs to the city’s poor communities, Sotto said.
The distribution of the grocery bags, which began on Monday, March 23, will take 7 days, he added.
Each bag contains 3 kg of rice, and 2 cans each of sardines, corned tuna, corned beef, and meat loaf. The food pack project is worth an estimated P158.8 million. (READ: Pasig City to punish hoarders of food, goods)
‘Social distancing’
The effort to bring food to residents’ homes is a way to ensure food security while promoting physical distancing, or “social distancing” as the government calls it.
People must be at least a meter apart of one another order to avoid the contagion.
Pasig Mega Market, the city’s bustling main public market near city hall, ordinarily draws shoppers even from outside Pasig because of its sheer size and affordable prices.
Sotto earlier said the Mega Market will remain open throughout the lockdown, but the number of shoppers will be limited to maintain physical distancing. The building is disinfected for an hour daily.
On Sunday, the mayor noted the relatively high number of people seen around the talipapa or community market in Barangay Rosario along Ortigas Avenue. Because going out to buy food is allowed during the lockdown, Sotto said the only thing to do was to limit the number of people in an area at one time, and to make sure only one person per household is out to market.
With the Mobile Palengke and the food pack projects, Sotto hopes to cut the crowds at public markets. – Rappler.com "

CAGAYAN DE ORO, Philippines – Two more persons under investigation (PUIs) for the novel coronavirus died in a Cagayan de Oro hospital as the region confirmed 3 new confirmed cases, authorities revealed on Tuesday, March 24. 
Northern Mindanao Medical Center (NMMC) chief of hospital Jose Chan said the two patients died on Monday from severe acure respiratory illness, which under the Department of Health (DOH) guidelines should be treated as possible case of Covid-19 disease.
NMMC is the biggest public hospital in the northern Mindanao region. It was designated as the referral hospital for novel coronavirus cases. 
The deaths brought the total number of fatality among PUIs at the hospital to 4. Chan said one of the latest victims was a resident of the city. No further personal details were provided.
""One of the patients had been there [for a while]. The other [was] just admitted at the hospital, but died immediately,"" Chan said.
The hospital was attending to 12 more persons under investigation for coronavirus as of Tuesday, March 24. Chan said they were placed in isolation rooms. 
Department of Science and Technology Region 10 earlier donated laboratory supplies as the hospital announced it was running out of much needed personal protective equipment for its health staff. 
DOST Region 10 laboratory personnel, headed by Chemical Laboratory’s Technical Manager Ronya Mae Bayan, handed over 15 boxes of sterile gloves at 50 pairs per box, 200 pieces of shoe covers, 20 pieces of N-95 masks, 100 pieces of surgical caps, and 50 pieces of surgical masks.
Chan also asked the public to heed government's call for them to stay at home to stop the spread of the disease.
3 new cases
The region also confirmed 3 new cases of coronavirus on Tuesday. Department of Health Region 10 director Adriano Suba-an said one was admitted to a hospital in Iligan City while two others were admitted to Amai Pakpak Medical Center (APMC) in Marawi City.
APMC is the apex hospital of Lanao del Sur, one of the provinces of the Bangsamoro region, but the hospital is under the direct supervision of DOH Region 10.
The country's confirmed cases of coronavirus rose to 501 by Tuesday morning, March 24, including 33 deaths and 19 recoveries.
Meanwhile, the global death toll of the coronavirus pandemic has reached 15,189, with 5,476 of the fatalities in Italy and 3,270 in China (excluding Hong Kong and Macau).
The number of cases worldwide has risen to 341,300, with 81,093 cases in China and 59,138 cases in Italy. The virus has spread to 174 countries. – with a report from Agence France-Presse/Rappler.com "
,"March 24, 2020",nCov,Palawan designates hospitals in case of coronavirus outbreak,Keith Anthony S. Fabro,"
 
PALAWAN, Philippines - Governor Jose Alvarez prepared the province in the event of an outbreak of a novel coronavirus infection by assigning tasks to different government health facilities here.
The Ospital ng Palawan (ONP) in Puerto Princesa City,  and Culion Sanitarium and General Hospital in Calamianes will handle persons under investigation (PUI) suffering from worsening conditions.
In case hospitals in referral centers in Puerto Princesa City are filled to capacity, the patients may be transferred to the isolation building of Southern Palawan Provincial Hospital in Brooke’s Point town.
Private hospitals were also asked to designate isolation rooms, personnel and equipment for care of PUIs with severe symptoms or COVID-19 positive patients who need higher levels of care.
COVID-19 is the illness caused by the novel coronavirus.
For critically ill COVID-19 patients who need care beyond what is available in Palawan, they will be referred to Level 3 hospitals identified by the DOH in Manila.
Meanwhile, PUIs with mild symptoms but need hospitalization possibly due to other health issues could be admitted in the provincial government hospitals in Aborlan, Narra, Rizal, Brooke’s Point, and Bataraza in southern Palawan, and Roxas, Cuyo and Coron in northern Palawan.
PUIs with mild symptoms who do not need hospitalization but could be carriers of the virus are required to be quarantined for 14 days in the following designated facilities:

For southern Palawan – the Regional Evacuation Center in Brooke’s Point town
For Calamianes Island Group – the Regional Evacuation Center in Coron town
For northern Palawan – the newly constructed provincial hospital in San Vicente town

Patients from the municipalities who were treated or admitted in facilities in Puerto Princesa City will undergo 14 day-quarantine in a facility designated by the Provincial Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council. Patients who are city residents would undergo the quarantine in a facility designated by the City Health Office (CHO).
As of Monday, March 23, Palawan has recorded 62 PUIs, 16 of which tested negative as of March 19, Provincial Information Office data showed. A 26-year-old Australian male tourist was reported to be the province’s first positive patient.
ONP, meanwhile, has been eyed as Palawan’s centralized testing center for COVID-19 upon approval of the DOH, according to the governor’s executive order.
The provincial government has placed Palawan under state of calamity since last Friday, March 20, to access its P150-million calamity fund and P100-million trust fund to help buy essentials to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. The fund will also provide aid to residents affected by the month-long enhanced community quarantine.
Alvarez's executive order also included a provision for “heroes’ pay” as additional compensation for health workers and other frontliners, including non-regular ones. – Rappler.com "

AKLAN, Philippines – As many as 150 foreign tourists may still be in Boracay Island and are unable to return home after the government enforced travel restrictions in the light of global coronavirus pandemic.
Aklan governor Florencio Miraflores said the Department of Tourism (DOT) had ramped up efforts to help stranded travellers with mercy flights out of Boracay Island.
So far, mercy flights has airlifted home around 500 holidaymakers in Boracay Island in recent weeks.
Their only option was to fly from Caticlan airport in Malay town in Aklan to Clark International Airport in Pampanga, and take the emergency repatriation services offered by the government.
Miraflores said the Russian Embassy was also aiding more than 100 Russian nationals for a repatriation flight from Boracay.
“The embassy should also work alongside the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP) for repatriation of Russian citizens stranded in Boracay,” the governor added.
Even as the government announced the mercy flights, the growing frustration on government-ordered lockdown was troubling those trapped tourists. These marooned travellers have no choice but to wait for the government-backed repatriation.
Desperate tourists are pleading the local DOT office in Boracay to assist them so they could be flown home early as flight cancellations and the lockdown in Luzon complicated their return journeys.
The agency is also facing calls from stranded tourists in the island affected by the sudden shutdown of airports in Aklan to handle the situation better.
In other developments, Aklan has introduced travel and border restrictions and closure of non-essential businesses to discourage the spread of the pandemic.
Along with a nine-hour curfew, the government also imposed self-isolation of residents to their homes except for essential business like heading to a hospital or buying food.
Weeks ago, airline companies cancelled routes and grounded their aircraft due to coronavirus crisis.
Meanwhile, the global death toll of the coronavirus pandemic has reached 15,189, with 5,476 of the fatalities in Italy and 3,270 in China (excluding Hong Kong and Macau).

MANILA, Philippines – The next elections are two years away yet, but #Halalan2022 already trended on Twitter in the wee hours of Tuesday, March 24, as Filipinos channeled online their frustrations with government's response to the coronavirus.
""Incompetence"" and ""abuse of authority"" are what Filipinos get for voting for the wrong people, the tweets said.
The hashtag started to trend in the early hours of Tuesday, at about the same time that senators and members of the House of Representatives deliberated on – and later approved – a bill granting President Rodrigo Duterte special powers to address the coronavirus pandemic. 
Hours before this, on Monday afternoon, March 23, Filipinos fumed after seeing House members roll out manila papers that said, “Together with doctors and frontliners, we went to work for you, so please stay at home for us.” 
At around 8:50 am on Tuesday, #Halalan2022 was at number 5 top trending with at least 13,500 tweets.

MANILA, Philippines – With various sports federations around the world clamoring for the postponement of the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, Philippine Olympic Committee (POC) president Abraham ""Bambol"" Tolentino said a delay would also benefit our national athletes. 
""It’s better to postpone the Tokyo 2020 Olympics rather than have a cancelation so as not to lose [the Philippines] our chance for our first gold medal—or even more golds,"" said Tolentino. 
 ""(If the Games are postponed), more Filipinos have more chances to qualify."" 
Earlier this month, Tolentino bared that the Filipino athletes should also focus on preparing for the 2021 Southeast Asian (SEA) Games in Vietnam, following the country's overall championship when it hosted the regional biennial meet last year. 
But if the Olympics are moved a year later, the schedule will still be ""ideal enough"" for the POC chief. 
""I favor a postponement because the health and safety of everyone in sports—both in the Philippines and all over the world—is paramount in this COVID-19 pandemic,"" added Tolentino.
""The POC advises all athletes, coaches, officials and stakeholders to stay safe, stay at home and observe government and Health Department protocols so we could defeat this virus."" 
Team Philippines chef de mission to the Tokyo Olympics Nonong Araneta has been hands-on in monitoring the status of the Filipino Olympic hopefuls. However, the hiatus on all sporting events due to the coronavirus has also affected the Olympic qualifiers of various sports federations. 
""For those that are still aiming to qualify, this will give them an opportunity to prepare better given the current situation we are in,"" Araneta told Rappler.
Only 4 Filipinos – pole vaulter EJ Obiena, gymnast Carlos Yulo, and boxers Eumir Marcial and Irish Magno – have secured slots to the quadrennial meet. 
The postponement, though uncertain of a final date, also gives the Filipino hopefuls time to readjust their training programs as the IOC remains firm that a cancelation is not an option. 
""For those that have already qualified, they can concentrate more on their preparations rather than thinking about the pandemic that is affecting everyone."" 
There are currently 64 Filipino athletes bidding to qualify to the Olympiad. These athletes are coming from: archery, athletics, swimming, basketball, boxing, cycling, canoe-kayak, fencing, golf, gymnastics, judo, karate, rowing, skateboarding, table tennis, taekwondo, triathlon, weightlifting, and wrestling.
Out of the 64, 18 athletes have above average chances of booking a ticket to the largest quadrennial games this year. 
Araneta also said that the athletes are safe. He added he continued to get regular reports from the national sports associations.  – Rappler.com

TEST KIT. A COVID-19 test kit at Newton-Wellesley Hospital in Newton, Massachusetts, on March 18, 2020. Photo by Joseph Prezioso/AFP 
MANILA, Philippines – Foreign governments and other donors planning to give crucial supplies for the  Philippines' fight against the coronavirus disease must first ensure that they comply with the guidelines set by the Department of Health (DOH).
Department of Foreign Affairs Undersecretary Brigido Dulay issued the reminder, saying the donated test kits and equipment must be approved by the Food and Drug Adminisration (FDA), to ensure their quick release by the Bureau of Customs.  
""'Yung mga equipment at test kits, 'yun lang po ang kailangaan dumaan sa pagsusuri ng FDA. 'Pag ito naman ay meron nang approval ng FDA, puwede na po tong lumusot na mabilis (Equipment and test kits need to be reviewed by the FDA. When these have the FDA’s approval, they will be released quickly),"" Dulay said in a Laging Handa press briefing on Tuesday, March 24.  
Why this matters. The Philippines is currently seeking more test kits as it moves to ramp up its screening for coronavirus-positive patients.  
Despite this, the kinds of tests used by authorized laboratories and medical facilities remain limited, as the DOH has prioritized the use Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) based kits. 
Such tests, as opposed to rapid test kits, focus on tracing the genetic makeup of the coronavirus in accredited and equipped labs like the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM).
The FDA has so far approved 8 commercially available test kits for use. 
Other items: Dulay gave assurances that the BOC would immediately clear other donated items such as masks, googles, and hazmat suits –  personal protective equipment (PPEs).
Dulay said this was agreed upon with the BOC and Department of Finance, considering the urgent need to supply more hospitals and health facilities with PPEs.
As the Philippines continues to see an increase in coronavirus cases, medical workers have raised the alarm on the dangerously low supply of PPEs needed to protect frontliners caring for the sick. While waiting for the supply to reach them, many have improvised using everyday materials. (IN PHOTOS: Volunteers, medical frontliners improvise PPE amid shortage)
Singapore, South Korea, and China are among the countries that have donated test kits, PPEs, and other equipment to the Philippines.

MANILA, Philippines – The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) further boosted efforts to pump liquidity into the economy, as the country struggles to contain the novel coronavirus pandemic.
BSP Governor Benjamin Diokno on Tuesday, March 24, announced a 200-basis-point cut in the reserve requirement ratio (RRR) or the amount banks need to hold in their reserves.
The cut will take effect on Monday, March 30, and is expected to free up to P200 billion into the financial system.
""The [RRR] cut is intended to calm the markets and to encourage banks to continue lending to both retail and corporate sectors,"" the BSP said.
The decision comes a day after the BSP announced that it would buy P300 billion worth of government securities and a week after the Monetary Board trimmed interest rates by 50 basis points.

MANILA, Philippines – Taking his cue from the United Nations (UN), Jose Maria “Joma” Sison, the exiled founder of the Communist Party of the Philippines, called for a ceasefire with the government as the world battles a pandemic of the novel coronavirus.
Sison on Tuesday, March 24, advised the negotiating panel of the National Democratic Front of the Philippines (NDF) to recommend to the group’s national council “the issuance of a unilateral ceasefire declaration by the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) to the New People’s Army (NPA),” he said in a statement on the NDF website.
The Philippine government already declared a unilateral ceasefire with the communist rebel group last week, with Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana officially ordering the military to stand down on Thursday, March 19.
Sison’s call for a ceasefire is “in order to respond to the call of UN secretary general Antonio Guterres for a global ceasefire between warring parties for the common purpose of fighting the COVID-19 pandemic.”
“The NDF and the broad masses of the people themselves need to refrain from launching tactical offensives to gain more time and opportunity to fight the COVID-19 pandemic and to look after the health and over-all welfare of the people in both urban and rural areas,” Sison added.
UN chief Guterres earlier on Monday, March 23, called for an “immediate global ceasefire” to help the world fight the virus, saying armed conflict debilitates affected countries from responding to the pandemic.
""To warring parties, I say: Pull back from hostilities. Put aside mistrust and animosity. Silence the guns; stop the artillery; end the airstrikes,"" Guterres said in a speech at the UN headquarters in New York.
Distrust
President Rodrigo Duterte had broached a ceasefire with the communists during his televised address on March 16, when he expanded the lockdown of Metro Manila to cover all of Luzon island, and to restrict all non-essential activities for nearly a month.
Sison declined to reciprocate the truce at the time, and called it “premature, if not insincere and false.” He also criticized the “enhanced community quarantine” of Luzon as a “militarist” move meant to intimidate and immobilize the populace.
Lorenzana also then expressed distrust in the rebels, and instructed the military to remain on guard against possible guerrilla attacks.
Similarly, Sison said, ""While the [NPA] can cease and desist from launching tactical offensives against the military, police and paramilitary forces of the [government], it must be vigilant and be ready to act in self-defense against any tactical offensive.""
The Duterte administration attempted to negotiate peace with the CPP-NPA-NDF, but efforts bogged down in November 2017 when Duterte accused communist guerrillas of violating a ceasefire.
The government has since determined to stamp out the rebellion, with Duterte wanting full victory by the end of his term in mid-2022.
In December 2018, Duterte began a “localized” tack in combatting the rebellion by enticing guerrillas to defect with offers of cash incentives and livelihood packages. Meanwhile, military offensives against communist targets continued.
In December 2019, Duterte again offered to talk peace with Sison, but both men have so far failed to agree on a venue. 
Now, both sides have officially agreed to temporarily cease hostilities as the country struggles to contain the coronavirus outbreak. Luzon is set to remain on Lockdown until April 12, and Metro Manila, until April 14. Other provinces, cities, and municipalities have also gone on lockdown as they reported local cases of the disease.
The Philippines has recorded 501 confirmed cases of the virus, with 19 recoveries and 33 deaths as of Tuesday morning.
Around the world, at least 341,300 people have contracted the disease, with more than 15,100 deaths. The virus has spread to 174 countries. – Rappler.com "

PAMPANGA, Philippines – The Mabalacat City government announced on Monday night, March 23, a ""24-hour curfew"" that set different schedules for residents of its 27 barangays to go out for groceries.
“Please be advised: Enhanced Community Quarantine Advisory. 24-hour Curfew starting 8:00 PM tonight, March 23, 2020. 24-hour curfew will be strictly enforced. As per City Government,"" the city government announced on its Facebook page.
The curfew limited the grocery runs of its residents to a fixed schedule. Only persons with Home Quarantine Pass (HQP) from their respective barangays are allowed to go out.  

Monday and Thursday, 5 a.m. to 12 noon – residents of barangays Atlu Bola, Tabun, Bundagul, Sta. Maria, Cacutud, Dolores, Sapang Biabas, Bical, and San Joaquin 
Tuesday and Friday – residing of barangays San Francisco, Duquit, Mawaque, Dapdap, Calumpang, Marcos Village, Mangalit, and Poblacion

Pending – residents of barangay Dau, the city's biggest barangay, will wait for instructions from the barangay chairman

Mabalacat City Mayor Crisostomo Garbo told Rappler the restrictions were based on a provincial ordinance. ""It is an Ordinance from the Province that is why we should follow,” he said.
Pampanga provincial administrator Charlie Chua said Governor Dennis Pineda did not issue any directive or executive order placing any area of the province under a ""24-hour curfew"" but he said Malacañang's order to place Luzon in lockdown ""technically"" has the same effect.
Chua said the governor did not use a power the Sangguniang Panlalawigan earlier granted him to impose curfew. But he said Malacañang curfew supersedes all curfew orders. 
There were residents who complained that they have not received passes from their barangays. Garbo told them to wait for the barangay captains to issue them and explain the new restrictions.
""I’ll simplify it. Do not go out if it is not important like buying essential goods such as food and medicine. But only one member of a family will be named in the quarantine pass that they will give you. The only ones exempted [from this] are those whose jobs are approved by the DTI (Department of Trade and Industry],"" the mayor said. 
""So starting tomorrow, if you get out, the police may warn you or send you home. Second offense, you may be charged,” the mayor said. 
The national government's COVID-19 Inter-agency Task Force did not prescribe window hours for Luzon residents to go out of their homes for necessities. 
Other towns and cities have imposed different curfews.
Pampanga was placed under state of calamity on March 16 after it confirmed positive cases of coronavirus among its residents.

The improvised equipment, along with the other commercially available PPE equipment, should be discarded properly.

BAYANIHAN ACT. Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea, Justice Secretary Menardo Guevarra, and Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez stay at the Senate until the wee hours of Tuesday, March 24, 2020. Photo courtesy of Secretary Guevarra 
MANILA, Philippines – The final version of the proposed Bayanihan to Heal as One Act that was hammered out by lawmakers early Tuesday, March 23, removed President Rodrigo Duterte's authority to extend his special powers. But human rights lawyers say this doesn't address concerns that those powers could still be abused.
""Not really, because as FLAG has said in its position paper, we don't see the need for emergency powers to be given, perhaps narrow amendments or adjustments to existing laws that would address the needs arising from the pandemic,"" said former Supreme Court spokesperson Ted Te of the Free Legal Assistance Group.
In the previous versions of the bill, Section 9 allowed that the special powers be extended ""if the calamity persists as may be determined by the President.""
Congress fixed that and the measure now up for the President's signature says he can only exercise such special powers for 3 months – ""unless extended by Congress.""
That the extension is now up to Congress doesn't make the bill less"" objectionable and scary,"" said National Union of Peoples' Lawyers (NUPL) president Edre Olalia. Congress has proven that it will follow and obey the President’s wishes and submit to his commands, he added. 
As an example, Congress has allowed Duterte to extend martial law in Mindanao for 2 and a half years. 
The proposed law would give Duterte the power to direct the operations of private medical facilities, purchase goods in a manner that can be exempt from procurement law, and touch the savings of other executive offices to augment that of ""quick response funds lodged in various relevant departments such as, but not limited to the DOH and DSWD.""
Trust?
During the deliberations in the Senate late Monday night, March 23, Duterte's former aide, Senator Bong Go, said that the special powers bill operates on trust.
""We are passing this measure out of trust, and we hope your conscience will guide you in implementing this measure,"" said Go.
Olalia said the ""atrocious record"" of Congress and Duterte on laws and measures that violate basic rights does not give Filipinos comfort at this time.
""Regrettably, such formal assurances does not ease the pain of a broken trust,"" said Olalia. 
""These measures, even if arguably well-meaning, will crash land on all of us,"" the lawyer said. – Rappler.com "

People within a 500-meter radius from these houses are also under strict monitoring.

SURPRISE INSPECTION. President Duterte talks to cops manning a checkpoint at the Valenzuela-Meycauayan boundary on March 17, 2020. Photo of PSG Commander Colonel Jesus Durante, posted on the Facebook page of PCOO Usec Lorraine Badoy  
MANILA, Philippines – In less than 24 hours, both houses of Congress drastically improved President Rodrigo Duterte's special powers bill to remove all the ""dangerous"" provisions, especially his budgetary powers, but lawyers insist he does not need these special powers.
""The emergency powers proposed to be granted by Congress are either superfluous and unnecessary, as they are already vested in the Executive Branch by existing laws,"" the Free Legal Assistance Group (FLAG) said in a position paper on Tuesday, March 24.
FLAG said Republic Act No. 11332 or the Mandatory Reporting of Notifiable Diseases and Health Events of Public Health Concern Act, signed by Duterte himself in 2019, already gives powers to the government to respond to a pandemic.
Under Section 4 of RA 11332, the government is mandated, among others, to:

Ensure the establishment and maintenance of relevant, efficient, and effective disease surveillance and response system at the national and local levels
Establish effective mechanisms for strong collaboration with national and local government health agencies to ensure proper procedures are in place 
Provide sufficient funding to support operations needed to establish and maintain epidemiology and surveillance units at the DOH, health facilities, and local government units (LGUs) 

""These powers are already extraordinary as they contemplate precisely an emergency, i.e., a public health emergency,"" FLAG said.
Not a national policy
The bills invoke Article VI, Section 23(2), which says: ""In times of war or other national emergency, the Congress may, by law, authorize the President, for a limited period and subject to such restrictions as it may prescribe, to exercise powers necessary and proper to carry out a declared national policy."" (emphasis ours)
FLAG said that the bill, the proposed Bayanihan to Heal as One Act, is not a national policy as required by the Constitution.
""Instead of a national policy, as required in Article VI, sec. 23(2) of the 1987 Constitution, the proposed bills simply set forth objectives,"" said FLAG.
A national policy would have laid out greater vision to curb the effects of the pandemic, such as economic policies to mitigate impacts; or policies to provide for better research as it is also RA 11332's mandate for the government to have stronger disease surveillance.
The bills, FLAG said, merely laid out objectives which can be accomplished using existing laws, like RA 11332.
""Republic Act No. 11332, a law passed precisely to meet these objectives, already provides in its various sections, among others, for a definition of public health emergency, a response to such, and specific objectives, powers, and penalties,"" the group said.
Former Supreme Court spokesperson Ted Te, a FLAG member, said, ""In fact, strengthening the protections already in RA 11332 would have been a clearer statement of national policy.""
Amending and strengthening RA 11332 could have also been expedited if certified as urgent – as in the case of the special powers bill, which was passed in one day.
'Takeover'
The final bill also removed the provision in the Malacañang version that would allow Duterte to take over private businesses, including, telecommunications, which could also cover broadcast media.
In the passed version, Duterte is now only able to ""direct the operations"" of private medical facilities.
Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea said the provision was merely to provide Duterte a ""standby power.""
Again though, Duterte does not need special powers to do so because Section 17 of Article XII of the Constitution allows the State to ""during the emergency and under reasonable terms prescribed by it, temporarily take over or direct the operation of any privately owned public utility or business affected with public interest.""
FLAG said the speed in which Congress was able to convene for the special session – which lawmakers joined virtually – is proof that the situation is not so dire that Duterte would need takeover powers.
""That Congress was able to convene in special session in one day and conduct its business through virtual means contradicts any compelling need for this power to be included in any Emergency Powers Act to be passed at this time,"" said FLAG.
Budgetary provisions
The bill that Congress passed also amended the budgetary provisions which  retired Supreme Court justice Antonio Carpio deemed to be unconstitutional.
The administration versions of the billl would have allowed Duterte to tap any budget, including outside the executive department, when laws only allow the President to touch savings (not any budget) to augment existing projects within the executive department only.
In less than 24 hours, with the persistence of progressive lawmakers, those budgetary provisions were amended to be more consistent with existing laws.
However, Carpio pointed out that Duterte doesn't even need special powers to touch savings because Section 25(5), Article VI of the Constitution already allows him to do so.
It states:  ""No law shall be passed authorizing any transfer of appropriations; however, the President, the President of the Senate, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, and the heads of Constitutional Commissions may, by law, be authorized to augment any item in the general appropriations law for their respective offices from savings in other items of their respective appropriations.""
The passed bill retained the provision that would allow Duterte to ""undertake the procurement of the following as the need arises, in the most expeditious manner, as exemptions from the provisions of Republic Act No. 9184 and other relevant laws.""
Experts said Duterte does not need this because RA 9184 or the Government Procurement Reform Act, already gives him the power to make emergency purchases.
Experts pointed out that if RA 9184's guidelines on emergency purchases were to be followed, use of funds under the special powers law would most likely be subjected to stringent audit. – Rappler.com "

Still, religious leaders who will administer the burial rites should be allowed by cops to travel from their homes, Eleazar said.

DAVAO CITY, Philippines – Thirty-two of passengers aboard a trans-island bus from Manila, including a pregnant woman and a one-year old child, were blocked from entering Davao region.
The Philtranco bus left Manila on March 16 despite the Luzon-wide lockdown. The passengers were bound for Davao City. 
Davao City Mayor Sara Duterte said her initial decision was to send the bus back, but she reconsidered and put the passengers and crew under quarantine instead. 
“They are actually in a farm near the entrance of Davao de Oro,” Duterte said.
“They are now in quarantine for 14 days,” she said. The passengers were not allowed to disembark from the bus. They will be provided meals and will be monitored for symptoms of the novel  coronavirus disease.
“That's the win-win solution that we saw instead of asking them to turn around and go back to Metro Manila,” Duterte said. 
Davao de Oro authorities intercepted the bus on Saturday evening, March 21, at a regional checkpoint in Monkayo town.

MANILA, Philippines – Economists from the Ateneo de Manila University appealed to both the government and the private sector to ""set aside growth targets"" and revenue goals this year and focus on addressing the socioeconomic needs of people amid the novel coronavirus pandemic.
""Economic stimulus to induce economic growth is not useful at this stage of the pandemic,"" the Ateneo Center for Economic Research and Development and faculty members of the Ateneo Department of Economics said in a joint statement.
They recommended the reallocation of significant portions of the 2020 national budget to health and medical services, full protection of health workers, providing social protection to the poor, and efforts to address the economic and social costs of the Luzon-wide lockdown.
""In addition, there is still a large unused budget for 2019 with an unobligated P1.1 trillion. Based on [Republic Act No.] 11464, funds in 2019 are allowed to be used in 2020 hence this can also be reallocated to fund these tasks,"" the economists said. (WATCH: Rappler Talk: Saving the economy from a pandemic)
For the private sector, they asked for the top 30 companies in the Philippines to contribute P1 billion each.
The following are some of their other recommendations to government and the private sector:

Large-scale procurement of personal protective equipment (PPE) for frontline health workers and systems to protect frontliners from the virus. Incentivize local clothes manufacturers to refocus production to PPE.
Ensure adequate testing kits, testing equipment, ventilators, life support, medical supplies, and health infrastructure to accommodate critical patients. Give additional funds to government hospitals, especially those critical in providing assistance to infected patients.
Appropriate P50 million for each Department of Health hospital (about 69 based on the agency's website) or about P3.5 billion for PPE and medicine.
Set up a common fund for hospitals where everybody can donate to buy medical needs, support health workers, and other frontliners.
Request technical support from China based on their Wuhan experience on the production of PPE, health protocols, etc.
Include the Philippines in ongoing trials of potential coronavirus vaccines.
Provide income support by expanding the unconditional cash transfers to address needs of the vulnerable population.
Call on large food producers to work together to guarantee food supply throughout the year. Ration food supplies in the immediate short term to guarantee availability and access to sufficient food supply for everyone.
Hire logistics and movers to move food, medicines, and medical staff. This would cost about P10 billion, based on the income of public transport workers per month.

ILOILO CITY, Philippines – Nurses working in the hospital where Iloilo's first coronavirus patient was confined are being shunned by local stores, boarding houses, and even their own barangays and homes.
The chief of the hospital where the patient was admitted confirmed stories circulating on social media that their staff members were experiencing discrimination not only in business establishments but also in their own communities and homes.
“We didn’t expect this to happen,” Dr Felix Ray Villa, chief executive officer of Medical City Iloilo, told Rappler. “We’ve had around 50 staff members report back to us saying that after heading home, they werent allowed entry into their boarding house, they were barred from their barangays. They even had a difficult time going home because of the transportation situation, and on top of that, not allowed to enter their own homes,"" Villa added.

HOSPITAL CHIEF. Dr Felix Ray Villa is the CEO of The Medical City Iloilo. Photo from Medical City Iloilo 
Medical City Iloilo assured the community that it had been following proper quarantine and containment procedures in February, or weeks before it admitted the COVID-19 patient in March.
“Our quarantine protocols have already been in place even before this positive result. We have taken each possible precaution to make sure that this is contained. There is no cause for panic as the proper protocols have been observed and followed,” the hospital said in a statement.
The precautionary measures include a ""no visitor"" policy, a single entry way for patients, and the strict assessment of the health condition and travel history of all those who enter TMCI – as well as separate help desk for persons under investigation (PUIs) and patients under monitoring (PUMs). 
Villa said the hospital has over 500 employees, at least 300 of them handling PUIs and PUMs. The nurse-to-patient ratio is one-to-one for all PUIs and PUMs, to minimize contact with vulnerable patients.
“Our frontliners are our frontliners because they have the willingness to do so. We did not even force our people to handle these sensitive patients, we asked them who wanted to volunteer to care for these PUIs and PUMs, and a lot of our staff raised their hand. We all know the risk and sacrifice this time will take,” he said.
Villa said he was especially proud of the nurses who showed ""no fear or signs of panic"" when the first coronavirus case was confirmed.
“This is largely because we all know we’ve been operating effectively. They know they can trust our system; they know they can trust each other. We’ve done everything to fully mitigate and prevent the spread of the infection. We won’t leave anyone behind, together us Ilonggos can get through this tough time,"" he said.

Iloilo City Mayor Jerry Treñas, who also received the reports of discrimination against the hospital workers, reminded business establishments of the important role of the medical workers in public health.
“I have been receiving messages today that our fellow Ilonggos who are in the medical field are discriminated. Buses reject them, carinderias won’t sell to them, their landlords evicted them. We should not allow this to happen,"" he said.
“Please keep in mind that if they cannot eat or sleep well, they cannot go to work. Who will take care of you if you will be infected? Would you also want them to treat you the same?” Treñas added.
The mayor designated an area in Iloilo City College, also in Molo district and just walking distance to Medical City Iloilo, as temporary dormitories for all medical staff in the city who have no place to stay.
Local hotels have lent their beddings, pillows, and blankets for use in the dorms, and donated toiletries as well.
The mayor said the temporary dorm can host up to 72 workers and is open to staff of all major hospitals of the city. The city government will also provide transportation for them.
Villa thanked Treñas and also private individuals who have offered to help their staff.
""We’ve also been overwhelmed and swamped because of the outpouring of support we are getting from the Ilonggos and private individuals who want to help us. A handful of people have even offered their own unoccupied apartments in the city for the use of our staff members,” he said.

MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – The Department of Health on Tuesday, March 24, confirmed 90 new cases of the coronavirus, bringing the total number in the Philippines to 552.
The DOH also confirmed two new patients have recovered from the virus. The total number of recoveries in the Philippines is now at 20.
Two more patients have also died from COVID-19, raising the total number of fatalities in the country to 35. 
There were 501 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the country with 33 deaths when the DOH first reported Tuesday morning. 
The World Health Organization (WHO) warned on Monday that the coronavirus pandemic is clearly ""accelerating,"" but said it was still possible to ""change the trajectory"" of the outbreak. 
Meanwhile, at past 3 am Tuesday, the House of Representatives adopted the approved Senate version of the bill, Senate Bill No. 1418, which would grant Duterte at least 27 powers, including the authority to declare savings and use them to fight the pandemic.
The global death toll has reached 15,189, with 5,476 of the fatalities in Italy and 3,270 in China (excluding Hong Kong and Macau).

LEGAZPI, Philippines – In an effort to provide personal protective equipment (PPEs) for the hospitals' 500 frontliners, physicians from the Bicol Regional Training and Teaching Hospital (BRTTH) in Albay launched a fundraiser on Sunday, March 22, dubbed “Tarabangan para sa frontliners (Help for the frontliners).” (READ: LIST: How to help healthcare workers, frontliners during coronavirus pandemic)
The fundraiser asks Bicolanos to each donate a set amount of P850 for the purchase of PPEs and other vital medical equipment for the under-equipped BRTTH – one of 3 referral hospitals in the region tapped by the Department of Health to handle patients with COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. 
""By saving our frontliners, we save our families and our community,” Dr Eric Raborar, chief of BRTTH's Health Emergency Management Staff (HEMS), posted on his Facebook wall in reference to the campaign. 
“Please share po. Maraming salamat sa tabang nindo! Kaya ta ini ma abot!!! Tarabangan sana! (Please share. Thank you for your help! We can make it as long as we help each other!)” he wrote.
 
In an update Sunday evening, just 12 hours since the campaign began, Raborar's daughter Gabrielle Faye posted on Facebook that they had reached their P625,000 target.
""We have reached our target, and more! Now, we can buy more than just PPEs but also masks and shoe covers. Maraming salamat po sa pagtabang nindo! (Thank you for your help)!” she wrote. 
The campaign is still ongoing to ensure there are enough funds for the frontliners' future needs. (READ: Left in the dark: Little protection for government's coronavirus frontliners) 
Call for government funding
Meanwhile, Albay 2nd District Representative Joey Sarte Salceda said that Philhealth Vice President Orlando Iñigo will release a total of P254 million in funds on Monday, March 23 to the following hospitals:

P102 million for BRTTH
P120 million for Bicol Medical Center
P22 million for Josefina Belmonte Duram Memorial Hospital
P10 million for Bicol Region General Hospital and Geriatric Medical Center

The funds are for the hospitals' needs in general, but can be used specifically for addressing coronavirus frontliners' needs. 
Salceda also recommended that the coronavirus Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF) conduct a headcount of all government doctors nationwide, especially those in regions not yet affected by the virus, including doctors to the barrios. (READ: Braving a pandemic: Frontliners battle fear to confront the novel coronavirus)
“Start talking to medical societies and recruit for volunteers from areas not yet affected. This will help us with our increasing manpower needs. That include nurses and paramedical people,” the lawmaker said.
He asked that field hospitals be set up as well.
“Look for areas where we can set up field hospitals. Call all businesses that sell ventilators, IVs, masks, PPEs, and make an inventory for government to purchase. Have a meeting with industries, clothing companies that can make gloves, gowns, masks, and ask them to increase their production through 24-hour operations,” he said.
As of Monday, the Philippines has 462 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus, with 33 deaths and 18 recoveries.

PUNISHMENT. Alleged curfew violators are forced to sit under the sun. Photo from the Facebook page of Barangay San Isidro, ParaÃ±aque 
MANILA, Philippines – A barangay in Parañaque has been punishing curfew violators caught during the Luzon lockdown by forcing them to sit under the sun, even if the penalty was not prescribed by the city's curfew ordinance.
In a Facebook post, the official Facebook page of Barangay San Isidro in Parañaque posted two photos of a cluster of chairs in an open area, one without people and another with a handful sitting while a cop stood watch.
""Sa lahat po na mahuhuli namin sa curfew, dito po namin lalagay (Everyone violating the curfew we will placed here),"" said the barangay's Facebook post, which, as of Tuesday morning, March 24, has been shared over 6,000 times, gathering criticism from many users.
""This is torture. If they won't get heatstroke, they'll get tons of mosquito bites at night,"" said one commenter.
Under Republic Act No. 9745 or the Anti-Torture Act of 2009, physical torture is defined as ""a form of treatment or punishment inflicted by a person in authority or agent of a person in authority upon another in his/her custody that causes severe pain, exhaustion, disability, or dysfunction of one or more parts of the body.""
It includes ""Harmful exposure to the elements such as sunlight and extreme cold.""
Illegal detention: Because it violates the right against illegal detention – the detention of people without due process – the penalty of detaining people outside after violating curfew hours is not sanctioned by the curfew ordinance of the local government of Parañaque.
Under Section 4 of Parañaque's Ordinance No. 2020-03 signed on March 15, cops and barangay officials have been tasked to enforce the curfew. They were not told to detain people but to to make sure they are ""directed to return to their respective residences, dwelling, or usual place of resting.""
Arrests can only be made, the ordinance said, if there is ""deliberate or willful refusal to comply with the lawful order of the public officer.""
But even if there were arrests made, they should not be detained outside. Under Rule 113, Section 3, of the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedures, arrested persons must be brought ""to the nearest police station or jail without unnecessary delay.""
This comes after barangay officials in Sta Cruz, Laguna also drew flak for their implementation of their curfew, after they caged alleged curfew violators. 
Rappler has sought the comment of the barangay through its Facebook page and the police chief of Parañaque City, Colonel Robin King Sarmiento, but neither have replied as of posting. – Rappler.com "

ADDRESS TO CRITICS. Speaker Alan Peter Cayetano delivers a speech during the special session on March 23, 2020. Photo by Darren Langit/Rappler 
MANILA, Philippines – Speaker Alan Peter Cayetano lashed out at critics of his “Stay at home for us” gimmick in the House, saying he would do it again if it meant protecting people from the coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Cayetano delivered a midnight address on Monday, March 23, minutes after the House of Representatives approved the bill granting President Rodrigo Duterte 25 special powers to address the COVID-19 pandemic. 
In his speech, the Speaker defended the now-viral manila paper signs that House and Cabinet members held up during the special session urging the public to stay home because their leaders and frontline workers went to work for them. (READ: Pinoys online livid over ‘Stay at home for us’ gimmick in House) 
“Tayo pong mga kongresista, there’s no doubt: whatever happens, trabaho nating pumunta dito. Nasusunog ‘tong building na ‘to pero kailangan ng session, nandito tayo. That’s why nga ginawa natin ‘yong ganitong arrangement ‘di ba? But what about the staff to my right? The staff to my left? The staff that is in the lounge? The guards that are outside?” a visibly irked Cayetano asked.
(For us congressmen, there's no doubt about this: whatever happens, it is our job to go here. This building may be on fire but if we need to hold a session, we'd be here. That's why we did this type of arrangement, right? But what about the staff to my right? The staff to my left? The staff that are in the lounge? The guards outside?) 
“If you ask me to hold up a sign again, and even if the sign curses at me but it gets people to read and gets people to stay home, I will do it again and again and again,” Cayetano said.
The Taguig City-Pateros congressman then apologized to Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea and Interior Secretary Eduardo Año, both of whom were part of the “Stay at home for us” gimmick.
Cayetano said Medialdea, who had “something with his heart fixed,” and Año risked possible exposure to COVID-19 by attending the special session on Monday. The Speaker lauded both Cabinet members for still going to the House anyway. 
“We meant well. Now if people will criticize us for meaning well, as long as alam natin tama ang ating ginagawa, [okay lang ‘yon] (as long as we know what we did is right, then that’s okay),” the Speaker said. 
‘Not the time for politicking’ 
In the same speech, Cayetano did not mince words against critics of the government’s tragic mismanagement of the COVID-19 pandemic.  (READ: Hell on earth: The agonizing confusion over coronavirus testing in PH) 
“Hindi time [para] mamulitika. Hindi time para i-weaponize itong COVID-19. We have a leader. Ako, it’s my choice to trust him,” Cayetano said, referring to Duterte. 
(This is not the time for politicking. Ths is not the time to weaponize COVID-19. We have a leader. For me, it's my choice to trust him.)
“It’s a war. Did anyone here predict the war? You’re saying government is not prepared? Well, where was your plan for us to be prepared?” the Speaker added.
But no matter what Cayetano says, these criticisms are not unfounded. From just 3 positive cases in February, the Philippines now has 462 patients with COVID-19. Of that number, 33 have died while only 18 have recovered.  
Some Filipinos have even perished without even knowing that it was the fast-spreading disease that had killed them. 
Health workers and medical facilities across the country are also in dire need of protective gear, medical supplies, and test kits.
Those who are able to get their swabs taken for a COVID-19 test are forced to wait for at least a week for the results they hope would come back negative. Meanwhile, VIPs who do not meet the Department of Health’s criteria for priority testing still manage to get their results ahead of ordinary Filipinos. (READ: VIP treatment in coronavirus testing not a policy, says DOH)
Duterte already declared a state of public health emergency and placed the entire island of Luzon under lockdown in a bid to contain the pandemic. Other local government units were also allowed to impose localized lockdowns in their respective jurisdictions.

 CEBU, Philippines - No more dining in restaurants will be allowed in Cebu province, Governor Gwendolyn Garcia told reporters during a press conference on Monday March 23.
The governor also announced she would soon release another executive order serving as a mitigating measure against COVID-19, and that it would be effective within 24 hours.
""We will not allow you to dine in. People can't sit in restaurants to eat anymore,"" she said.
Those who want to buy food from restaurants can order delivery or drive through. The governor said, however, that they might allow pick-ups, but is worried that pick-ups still might pose a risk of transmitting the virus because customers will be crowding enclosed spaces.
In a previous order, Garcia already disallowed gatherings of 20 or more people.
Carenderias and other smaller establishments will be given 48 hours to prepare for compliance with Executive Order 5-G. 
""How greedy are you as businesses? Is money the only thing you think about, when the lives of Cebuanos are put in danger?"" Garcia said.
She was reacting to photos of an unnamed restaurant that were still allowing patrons to crowd inside.

MANILA, Philippines – The bill that would give President Rodrigo Duterte special powers to deal with the coronavirus oubreak is now up for his signature.
At past 3 am Tuesday, March 24, the House of Representatives adopted the approved Senate version of the bill, Senate Bill No. 1418, which would grant Duterte 30 powers, including the authority to declare savings and use it for coronavirus disease (COVID-19) measures.
As the Senate special session closed, Senate President Vicente Sotto III said on Tuesday that an enrolled copy will be sent to Duterte.
SB 1418 greatly differs from the original bill. Controversial provisions on the takeover of businesses and the unconstitutional budgetary items were taken out.
The bill would grant 18 million low-income families in the country an emergency cash aid worth P5,000 to P8,000, depending on the prevailing minimum wage in the region.
SB 1418 would also give public and private health workers who would be severely infected by the virus a compensation of P100,000. Families of those who contracted the virus and died while on the line of duty would receive P1 million, effective retroactively.
Health workers would also be given a special risk allowance on top of their regular hazard pay.
If signed by the President, the bill would be effective immediately after publication in a newspaper or on the Official Gazette. It will be valid for 3 months unless extended by Congress or terminated earlier through a concurrent resolution or a Presidential proclamation.
House approved on third and final reading its counterpart measure late Monday, March 23, close to two hours ahead of the Senate. The lower chamber's version sought to give the President 25 special powers, excluding the lifting of the 30% cap on the quick response fund, which was in the Senate version.
As of Monday, the Philippines has 462 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus, with 33 deaths and 18 recoveries.
The global death toll has reached 15,189, with 5,476 of the fatalities in Italy and 3,270 in China (excluding Hong Kong and Macau).

MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – Voting 19-1-0, the Senate of the Philippines on Tuesday, March 24, approved on third and final reading a measure that would give President Rodrigo Duterte 30 special powers to deal with the coronavirus outbreak in the country.
Senate Bill (SB) No. 1418, the substitution bill, ""cured"" the unconstitutional provisions of the SB 1413, which initially sought to realign any appropriations in the executive branch to be used for coronavirus disease (COVID-19) measures.
Technically, there were 20 senators who ""cast"" their votes, with 8 of them doing so through phone call. But officially, the affirmative votes of the 12 senators who were at the plenary will be counted. The rest will still be on Senate records.
Still, only Senator Risa Hontiveros voted against the measure through phone call. Senator Francis Pangilinan, meanwhile, voted yes ""with serious reservations."" Senate Minority Leader Franklin Drilon, Senator Imee Marcos, Senator Aquilino Pimentel III, and Senator Leila de Lima were not able to ""vote"" even through phone call.
Under the approved bill, Senate would give Duterte ""authority subject to limitations"" granted by the special powers listed in the measure.
The controversial budgetary provision on SB 1413 which allows the President to ""reprogram, reallocate, and realign from any appropriations"" now reads under SB 1418 as ""reprogram, reallocate, and realign from savings on other items of appropriations"" in the 2020 budget of the executive branch.
Only savings are allowed by law to augment funding in the existing items in the budget. (READ: Heal as one? Why Duterte's special budget powers bill may be unconstitutional)
SB 1418 also identified which departments and programs would receive additional funding from savings. These include the following:

Department of Health
University of the Philippines-Philippine General Hospital
National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Fund
Department of Labor and Employment, particularly Tulong Panghanapbuhay sa Ating Disadvantaged/Displaced Workers and COVID-19 Adjustment Measures Program
Department of Trade and Industry, on Livelihood Seeding Program and Negosyo Serbisyo sa Barangay
Department of Agriculture, on Rice Farmers Financial Assistance Program
Department of Social Welfare and Development programs
Allocations to local government units
Quick response funds in relevant departments

The approved bill would also amend Section 67 of the General Provisions of the 2020 General Appropriations Act, which defines ""savings."" It would allow the projects – which purposes were abandoned to be used for COVID-19 measures – to be funded in the next two fiscal years.
Other powers
SB 1418 would also grant Duterte the power to ""direct the operation"" of any privately-owned hospitals, medical and health facilties, and other establishments and passenger vessels to ferry frontliners, only when the public interest requires. 
Here are the other special powers:

Adopt and implement measures to prevent or suppress further transmission and spread of COVID-19 through effective education, detection, protection, and treatment
Streamline the accreditation of testing kits, facilitate the prompt testing of persons under investigation and persons under monitoring, and immediate isolation and treatment of patients
Ensure all local government units are ""acting in line"" with the rules set by the national government
Continue to enforce measures against hoarding, profiteering, manipulation of prices, and other acts that would affect the supply and distribution of food and other goods
Ensure there will be no delays in the donation, acceptance, and distribution of health products necessary to fight COVID-19
Undertake ""in the most expeditious manner"" procurement of goods like protective gear for health workers, testing kits, medical supplies; goods and services for social amelioration measures for affected communities; lease of real property for use of health workers or to serve as quarantine centers; construction of temporary medical facilities; utilities, telecommunications, and other critical services in relation to the operation of quarantine centers and other medical services
Engage the services of humanitarian agency Philippine Red Cross
Hire temporary human resources for health
Lower lending rates of interest and reserve requirements of lending institutions
Liberalize grants for incentives of manufacture or importation of supplies needed to address the pandemic
Require businesses to prioritize and accept contract for services that would help fight COVID-19
Regulate and limit the operation of all forms of land, sea, and air transportation
Regulate traffic on all roads and bridges
Authorize alternative working arrangements for employees in the executive branch and, if necessary, other branches of government, constitutional bodies, and the private sector
Regulate the distribution of power, fuel, energy, and water
Move statutory deadline and timelines for the filing of any document, payment of taxes and fees, and the grant of any benefit
Direct all banks and other financial institutions like the Government Service Insurance System, Social Security System, and Pag-ibig Fund to implement a 30-day grace period for loan payments
Provide 30-day grace period for the payment of residential rents falling during the enhanced community quarantine
Implement an ""expanded and enhanced"" Pantawid Pamilya Program
Lifting of the 30% cap on the quick response fund
Undertake such other measures ""as may be reasonable and necessary"" to respond to the pandemic

Assistance
The House of Representatives approved the counterpart measure of the bill on final reading late Monday, just before midnight, giving the President 25 special powers similar to the Senate version, save for the lifting of the QRF cap.
If the House decides to adopt the Senate version, a bicameral conference committee would no longer be convened, and the bill will be sent to Malacañang for the President's signature.
If signed by the President, the bill would grant 18 million low-income households in the country an emergency cash assistance worth P5,000 to P8,000, depending on the prevailing minimum wage in the region.
It would also give public and private health workers who would be severely infected by the virus a compensation of P100,000. Families of those who contracted the virus and died while on the line of duty would receive P1 million, effective retroactively.
Health workers would also receive a ""special COVID-19 risk allowance,"" on top of their regular hazard pay, if the bill is signed into law.
The marathon Senate session on Monday started at around 10 am, but quorum was officially declared past 12 noon, when Senator Richard Gordon arrived.
SB 1418 was sponsored at around 7 pm, and was approved on second reading as well as on third and final reading nearly 6 hours after.
Senate President Vicente Sotto III ""stopped the lock"" when it reached midnight on Tuesday, which meant that even if the bill was passed on final reading past 1 am, on records it was officially approved 11:59 pm Monday.
The House later adopted the Senate bill past 3 am Tuesday.
As of Monday, the Philippines has 462 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus, with 33 deaths and 18 recoveries. The Medical City in Pasig City accounted for 18 confirmed cases and 3 deaths.
The global death toll has reached 15,189, with 5,476 of the fatalities in Italy and 3,270 in China (excluding Hong Kong and Macau).

MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – The House of Representatives passed the bill that would declare a “state of national emergency” and grant President Rodrigo Duterte 25 special powers to address the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic.  
At 11:45 pm on Monday, March 23, an overwhelming 284 lawmakers voted yes to House Bill (HB) No. 6616 on 3rd and final reading during the lower chamber’s first-ever special session conducted through Zoom teleconferencing. Only 9 House members voted no, while none abstained from the vote. 
Three hours later at past 3 am Tuesday, March 24, the House agreed to just adopt the Senate version of the measure. This means both chambers no longer need to convene the bicameral conference committee and the bill can now be sent to Duterte for his signature.
HB 6616 would put the country under a state of national emergency due to the continuing surge in COVID-19 cases, which stands at 462 as of Monday. 
It would also authorize Duterte to exercise 25 special powers “necessary and proper to carry out” the declared national policy. 
Lawmakers, however, noticeably took out the controversial provision that authorizes Duterte to ""temporarily take over or direct the operation"" of privately-owned businesses and utilities. (READ: Duterte's request to take over private business 'merely standby power')
Instead, Duterte would be authorized to “direct the operation” of any privately-owned hospitals and medical facilities to house health workers and serve as quarantine areas. The President may also “direct the operation” of public transportation to ferry frontliners from one destination to another. 
The controversial “takeover” of operations clause is still retained in HB 6616, but this time it only covers medical facilities and public transportation necessary to aid frontline workers. 
Section 4(4) states: “If the foregoing enterprises unjustifiably refuse or signify that they are no longer capable of operating their enterprises for the purpose stated herein, the President may take over their operations subject to the limits and safeguards enshrined in the Constitution.” 
If passed into law, HB 6616 would take effect immediately once it is published in a newspaper of general circulation or in the Official Gazette. It would have the full force and effect of law for 3 months, unless Congress extends it. 
HB 6616 underwent major revisions in a span of 14 hours – from the time the measure was initially filed on Monday, to its approval by the committee of the whole, to its final passage in the House. Several lawmakers and lawyers alike have pointed out that parts of the original version of the bill may be unconstitutional. (READ: Heal as one? Why Duterte's special budget powers bill may be unconstitutional)
Why is it needed? HB 6616 argues a state of national emergency is imperative to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 and immediately mobilize assistance to Filipinos – especially indigents – who are affected by the lockdowns imposed across the country, including the entire island of Luzon.
The same goes for the grant of special powers to the President.
“In order to optimize the efforts of the President to carry out the tasks needed to implement the aforementioned policy, it is imperative to grant him authority subject to such limitations as hereinafter provided,” HB 6616 said.
What powers would be granted to the President? Duterte would have the power to “re-pogram, reallocate, and realign” parts of the P3.757-trillion national budget in 2019 and the current P4.1-trillion national budget in 2020 to “support operations and response measures which are necessary or beneficial in order to address the COVID-19 emergency.”
The President would also have the power to allocate funds held by any government-owned or -controlled corporation or any national government agency. 
The bill now explicitly states the following items would be prioritized for budget augmentation:

Department of Health (DOH): operational budgets of government hospitals, primarily those identified for COVID-19; prevention and control of other infectious disease; emergency preparedness and response; Quick Response Fund
University of the Philippines-Philippine General Hospital
National Disaster Risk Reduction Fund
Department of Labor and Employment: programs “such as but not limited to” Tulong Panghanapbuhay sa Ating Disadvantaged/Displaced Workers and COVID-19 Adjustment Measures Program
Department of Trade and Industry: Livelihood Seeding Program and Negosyo Serbisyo sa Barangay
Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD): programs “such as but not limited to” Assistance to Individuals in Crisis Situations, distribution of food and non-food items, and livelihood assistance grants
Allocations to local government units
Quick Response Funds lodged in the various “relevant” departments like DOH and DSWD

Still, the bill provides no clear breakdown of where these reallocated funds would go. Deputy Speaker Luis Raymund Villafuerte, who had sponsored HB 6616 in the plenary, earlier said the President could utilize a whopping P275 billion if the measure is passed.  
The President would also have the power to reprogram unspent, unutilized, or unreleased money under special purpose funds to help fight the pandemic. 
Other special powers to be granted to Duterte include the following:

Adopt and implement measures to prevent or suppress further transmission and spread of COVID-19 through effective education, detection, protection, and treatment

MANILA, Philippines – After an entire day of deliberations, the Senate passed a bill that would give President Rodrigo Duterte special powers, which includes compensation for health workers who would be infected by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
On Monday, March 23, the Senate plenary deliberated Senate Bill (SB) No. 1418, the substitution bill for SB 1413, which seeks to give President Rodrigo Duterte 30 special powers to deal with the coronavirus pandemic.
It was approved on third and final reading past 1 am Tuesday, March 24.
During the period of amendments, Senator Richard Gordon proposed that the families of public and private health workers who contracted COVID-19 and died while on the line of duty be compensated with P1 million.
Session was suspended for about 30 minutes as Senator Pia Cayetano, the primary sponsor of SB 1418, sought for comments on the proposed amendments.
Eventually, the amendments were adopted, including the proposal to compensate with P100,000 each health workers who contracted severe COVID-19 infection. 
SB 1418 was also amended to include a ""special COVID-19 risk allowance,"" in addition to health workers' regular hazard pay while on duty.
Under the bill, the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation would also be directed to shoulder health workers' medical expenses due to coronavirus exposure.
SB 1418's counterpart bill at the House of Representatives was approved late Monday, just before midnight. The Senate amendments for health workers were not included in the House version of the bill.
Senate President Vicente Sotto III said they are waiting on whether the lower chamber will adopt the measure. If so, then a bicameral conference committee will no longer have to convene.
If the House decides to ratify the Senate version, it could then be transmitted for the President's signature. If approved, the bill would be effective immediately after publication in a newspaper or on the Official Gazette.
President Rodrigo Duterte had called for a special session and sought for special powers from Congress to arrest the spread of coronavirus in the country. The Philippines is under a state of calamity due to the virus. 
As of Monday, the Philippines has 462 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus, with 33 deaths and 18 recoveries.
The global death toll has reached 15,189, with 5,476 of the fatalities in Italy and 3,270 in China (excluding Hong Kong and Macau). The number of cases worldwide has risen to 341,300, with 81,093 cases in China and 59,138 cases in Italy.

With 45 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus as of Monday, March 23, San Juan is currently the city in the Philippines with the highest number of patients per capita.
It became the country's ground zero in the fight against the spread of the coronavirus, after one of the first local transmissions, a man from Rizal, frequented a prayer hall located inside a mall at the Greenhills Shopping Center – a population-dense commercial center in San Juan City.
Similar to other local governments across the country, San Juan City is working double-time to prevent further spread of the virus and provide the needs of its disenfranchised citizens amid the ongoing lockdown.
How is San Juan City Mayor Francis Zamora and his fellow officials responding and planning for what is to come? He speaks with Rappler's Rambo Talabong in a Rappler Talk interview.

MANILA, Philippines – Mayor Marcelino Teodoro on Monday, March 23, called on the Department of Health (DOH) to be more responsive to initiatives by local government units (LGUs), and not just impose rules that may derail their response to the coronavirus outbreak. 
The city government had wanted to establish the Marikina Molecular Laboratory and procure test kits. However, the DOH said on Sunday that it had yet to certify the local laboratory, while the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases amended a resolution to reflect that “all LGUs must first coordinate with the Department of Health prior to acquiring, purchasing or utilizing testing kits within their respective territorial jurisdictions.”
""It is imperative for the DOH to be proactive to the initiative of the LGU in efforts to combat the threats of COVID-19, and not merely invoke regulations to follow and comply with as well as issue guidelines,"" Teodoro said on Monday.
""A system or network of health service delivery should be in place between the national and local governments to better serve the people in times of crisis,"" the mayor added. 
Teodoro and Dr Imelda Mateo of the Amang Rodriguez Memorial Medical Center gave assurances that all standards and protocols set by the DOH would be followed.
Teodoro asked the DOH not to treat Marikina City as a client applying for a license to operate a laboratory facility for COVID-19 testing, but as a partner. 
“It should be [treated as] a partnership. This is a whole of government approach kung saan nagtutulong-tulong ang lokal at national. Kung ano ang kakulangan sa national ay pinupunan ng mga lokal na pamahalaan,” Teodoro said in a statement on Monday, March 23.
(This is a whole of government approach where the local and national [governments] help each other. Whatever limitations the national has will be augmented by the local government.)
The mayor said that the Marikina Molecular Laboratory will also benefit nearby cities because it will be a shared facility. Ultimately, the goal is to save more lives, he said. 
Teodoro emphasized the importance of testing for detection so that the spread of the coronavirus will be contained. Mass testing, he said, is needed as soon as possible. (READ: Where are testing centers for coronavirus in PH?)
The World Health Organization (WHO) has classified the coronavirus as a pandemic that has affected hundreds of thousands and killing nearly 14,000 across the globe.
In the Philippines, the DOH reported 462 COVID-19 cases, 33 deaths, and 18 recoveries as of Monday night. (READ: Philippines coronavirus cases rise to 462, death toll hits 33)
“We should make these test kits commercially available for all. We should be able to ensure that testing is ‘democratized,’ open access sa lahat ng Pilipino, lalo dun sa mga mahihirap na hindi kaya magpatingin sa mga pribadong ospital (to all Filipinos especially to the poor who cannot afford to go to private hospital),” Teodoro said.
The Research Institute of Tropical Medicine will be working with the Marikina Molecular Laboratory, Dr Mateo said.
Teodoro also emphasized that the Marikina lab was set up under the supervision of experts from the University of the Philippines-National Institute of Health (UP-NIH). (READ: U.P. coronavirus test kits may be rolled out on March 16)
Marikina will procure 3,000 COVID-19 testing kits from Manila Health Te, the first biotechnology private company for health in the country, which also partners with the UP-NIH.

MANILA, Philippines – The University of the Philippines-Philippine General Hospital (PGH) has accepted Department of Health (DOH) Secretary Francisco Duque III's request to be one of the country's referral hospitals for coronavirus patients.
This means that ""centralized"" facilities at PGH will be dedicated to treating coronavirus patients who would be referred to the hospital.
PGH is just one of the referral hospitals being eyed by the Department of Health. The other hospitals include the Lung Center of the Philippines and Dr Jose N. Rodriguez Memorial Hospital. (READ: Medical industry leaders to DOH: Designate dedicated coronavirus hospitals now)
In a press briefing on Monday afternoon, March 23, PGH Director Gerardo Legaspi clarified that PGH will still accept other patients. According to him, the emergency rooms for regular patients are different from those for coronavirus patients. 
""We will treat cancer as an urgent case. Hindi siya elective so itutuloy po ang serbisyo dito (This is not elective so the service here continues). The Cancer Institute is still open. Marami po sa pasyente natin na ang kanilang pondo ay nanggagaling sa PGH at hindi po sila basta-basta makakalipat (We have a lot of patients whose funds are coming from the PGH, and they cannot just transfer),"" Legaspi said. 
Legaspi added that admission to PGH's referral center will be ""initially limited to mild persons under investigation (PUIs) who are at risk for deterioration (above 60 years of age and/or with comorbidities) and moderate to critical PUIs.""
""Eventually, when testing for COVID-19 has been made readily available, only confirmed COVID-19 patients will be sent to the referral centers,"" Legaspi said.
Meanwhile, those who are tagged as ""mild PUIs"" will be referred to their local health units and will be under quarantine measures. 
PGH, according to its website, is considered the biggest modern government tertiary hospital in the Philippines, servicing more than 600,000 patients every year. It remains as the only national referral center for tertiary care.
Legaspi said that representatives from DOH-retained hospitals and major private hospitals in Metro Manila, as well as those from different DOH offices were tasked to coordinate the management of the coronavirus outbreak in the country. 
""The stakeholders agreed that one of the solutions to this complex problem was to organize the hospitals in a manner that will rationalize the clinical approach and the utilization of resources in order to equip and enable the designated referral centers for a potentially protracted battle,"" Legaspi said in a statement on Monday.
As of this posting, the Philippines has 462 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus, with 33 deaths and 18 recoveries.

MANILA, Philippines – San Juan City now has 45 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus as of 4 pm Monday, March 23 – the highest number per capita among local territories in Metro Manila.
A city of over 120,000 people according to the 2015 census, San Juan is only second to Quezon City which has the highest number of coronavirus cases.
Quezon City has 61 cases as of Monday night, but it has a land area and a population about 19 times greater than San Juan's.
""We really have a high number of cases,"" San Juan Mayor Francis Zamora said in an interview with Rappler on Monday.
Why the surge? The prayer hall frequented by one of Philippines' first local transmission cases is located inside a mall at the Greenhills Shopping Center. Greenhills has the most number of people among barangays in San Juan. 
""It is within a mall. The people who got infected by this virus came from the mall, workers in the Greenhills Shopping Center, and eventually went home [to] [Barangay] West Crame,"" Zamora said in a mix of English and Filipino.
Of the 45 confirmed cases, 14 live in Greenhills and 12 live in West Crame. These are adjacent barangays. West Crame is also a barangay bordering Quezon City.
All the cases, Zamora said, were either admitted to private hospitals of their choice in other cities, or a hospital in San Juan. (READ: 14 coronavirus patients in Quezon City staying at home)
What San Juan is doing: Zamora said the two barangays have been declared as coronavirus ""hot spots,"" where virus containment efforts such as lockdown and curfew are being strictly implemented.
Greenhills Shopping Center has since closed indefinitely after Metro Manila mayors called for the closure of malls in the capital region.
Zamora added that the Philippine National Police has even deployed Special Action Force troopers to West Crame to enforce physical distancing and isolation efforts.
San Juan has also been disinfecting public spaces, but Zamora urged residents to disinfect their own homes and to always wash their hands and maintain their distance from other people. – Rappler.com "

,"March 23, 2020",nCov,Heal as one? Why Duterte's special budget powers bill may be unconstitutional,Aika Rey and Lian Buan,"
AT A GLANCE

President Rodrigo Duterte is asking Congress for special powers to deal with the coronavirus disease – spanning from takeover of private hospitals to realignmnent of government funds.
Some provisions on the special budget powers may not be needed and are actually unconstitutional, experts say.
The bill empowers Duterte to have a say on when to end his special powers.


MANILA, Philippines – Both chambers of Congress are busy deliberating on the bills that will grant special powers to President Rodrigo Duterte – as Malacañang had requested – to arrest the spread of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19). 
The one-month coronavirus lockdown is threatening to doom millions of ""No Work, No Pay"" Filipino families to hunger, as lawmakers pushed for interventions to blunt the crippling effects of the pandemic on the economy. 
COVID-19 first surfaced as a ""mysterious"" illness in China in November 2019. The Philippine government, as well as lawmakers, appeared to have overlooked the possibility of an outbreak in the country when the 2020 budget was passed.
Now, the Philippine Congress is scrambling to pass legislation that would fund the government's efforts to deal with the pandemic, as Duterte certified the measure as urgent.
But experts said that certain provisions in the bill – particularly what counts as ""savings"" – are unconstitutional. A throwback to the Disbursement Acceleration Program controversy?
House vs Senate bills
On Sunday, March 22, the initial version of the Malacañang draft had been leaked.
Malacañang's initial draft is asking for power to ""temporarily take over or direct the operation"" of private businesses needed during the coronavirus emergency, among others. This sparked anger on social media.
A revised draft was sent to both chambers of Congress later on Sunday. The business takeover provision was tweaked to include only private hospitals and health facilities.
Both Senate and House bills adopted the 19 ""authorized powers"" sought by Malacañang.

The main difference between the two is how they call the powers to be granted to the President.
Under Senate Bill No. 1413, co-authored by Senate President Vicente Sotto III and Senator Pia Cayetano, the last sentence of Section 3 or the declaration of policy did not carry the term ""emergency powers"":
 
Section 3. Declaration of policy. The COVID-19 pandemic has greatly affected nations worldwide, including the Philippines, and has caused and is continuing to cause loss of lives and disruption to the economy…xxx 
By reason thereof, and in order to optimize the efforts of the President to carry out the tasks needed to implement the aforementioned policy, it is imperative to grant him authority subject to such limitations as hereinafter provided. 

Meanwhile, HB 6616, introduced by the House leadership led by House Speaker Alan Peter Cayetano, states:
 
Section 3. Declaration of policy. xxx 
By reason thereof, and in order to optimize the efforts of the President to carry out the tasks needed to implement the aforementioned policy, it is imperative to grant him emergency powers subject to such limitations as hereinafter provided. 

It remains to be seen whether the term ""emergency powers"" will be adopted when the bill is passed. If both chambers pass their respective versions on 3rd and final reading, then lawmakers would have to meet to reconcile the differences. 
But the meatiest, and perhaps most contentious provisions, are the budgetary items.
Unconstitutional
Section 4(16) of the bill is unconstitutional, said two experts.
Section 4(16) would allow Duterte to ""reprogram, reallocate and realign"" any appropriation in the 2020 budget ""for whatever purpose the President may deem necessary and desirable"" to respond to the coronavirus. (emphasis ours)
Retired Supreme Court senior associate justice Antonio Carpio and UP constitutional law professor Dan Gatmaytan said Section 4(16) is contrary to Section 25(5) Article VI of the charter which says: ""No law shall be passed authorizing any transfer of appropriations.""
Carpio said only savings are allowed to be used to augment funding, not appropriations. An ""appropriation"" simply means that money has been set aside for specific purposes as authorized by law. Money for projects is sourced from the total amount of appropriations and once released by the Department of Budget and Management, funds can be ""obligated"" or committed for payment.
The remaining amount from the released funds – but which were not committed for payment – can be declared as ""savings."" Officially, Section 67 of the General Provisions of the 2020 General Appropriations Act defined savings as the ""portion or balances of any released appropriations in this act which have not been obligated.""
There could be remaining funds because projects were already completed or there was a policy to discontinue or abandon them. Government could have saved money by paying less, thus leaving available funds from the projected spending for projects.
""Section 4(16) is unconstitutional insofar as reprogramming and reallocation of appropriations are concerned because only savings from appropriations can be transferred,"" Carpio told Rapler.
Because the word ""any"" was mentioned in Section 4(16), it may also be interpreted as including the budget of other branches such as the judiciary and constitutional bodies.
""The President can only [transfer] savings from appropriations in the approved budget of the executive branch. He cannot [transfer] savings in the judiciary, the legislature, or the constitutional commissions. Section 4(16) should just be deleted,"" said Carpio.
A budget insider also cautioned against the liberal use of the phrase ""reprogram, reallocate, and realign"" in Section 4(16), citing the Supreme Court decision on the DAP or Disbursement Acceleration Program.
""[Savings] should not cross branches of government and it should not fund non-existent items in the GAA. Saying that the President has the power to realign, reprogram, and reallocate is unclear. It may or may not authorize the creation of new budget items,"" the insider said.
In short, the President cannot spend money on projects or programs that are not listed in the 2019 or 2020 GAA. This was part of contentions against the DAP controversy. For example, in 2013, ex-budget chief Benjamin Diokno questioned the P700-million worth of assistance to Quezon province funded by DAP, which was not in the 2013 budget.
In 2014, the High Court declared spending for items not listed in the budget as unconstitutional.
Savings
There are two subparagraphs in the authorized powers section that refer to ""savings:""

Section 4(14) which would allow Duterte to cancel some programs, projects, and activities of the executive branch, including government-owned and -controlled corporations, in the 2019 and 2020 budget. This means that these would no longer be continued in the meantime, resulting in savings that the President could use to respond to the coronavirus crisis; and
Section 4(15) where the purpose of any unutilized or unreleased balance in the special purpose fund would be ""abandoned"" so that it could be used to address the pandemic. An example of this would be the abandonment of the salary hike for government workers worth more than P30 billion lodged under the Miscellaneous Personnel Benefits Fund to free up funds for the COVID-19 crisis.

On Section 4(14), Carpio and former budget chief Florencio Abad share the view that Duterte does not need this bill because the Constitution is sufficient. 
For example, Section 25(5), Article VI of the Constitution says: ""The President... may, by law, be authorized to augment any item in the general appropriations law for their respective offices from savings in other items of their respective appropriations.""  
The proposed ""Section 4(14) is superfluous and only invites controversy because it empowers the President to cancel approved appropriations, a delegation of legislative power,"" said Carpio.
Carpio added: ""There is no need to cancel an approved appropriation if its purpose can no longer be achieved due to an epidemic, a situation which automatically creates savings out of the approved appropriation.""
In the coronavirus pandemic, for instance, the funds for government projects that have been canceled because of the lockdown and work stoppage automatically become savings. Duterte does not need a special power to cancel projects just to generate savings. 
What's problematic is Section 4(15).
Gatmaytan said that the bill is ""circumventing"" the DAP ruling by ""using the phrase 'unutilized or unreleased balance in a special purpose fund' whose purpose has been abandoned since the declaration of the State of Emergency.""
But here's the catch, as laid out in Section 67 of the 2020 GAA's General Provisions: ""If the case of final discontinuance or abandonment is used as basis in the declaration of savings, such discontinuance or abandoned program activity, or project, shall no longer be proposed for funding in the next two fiscal years."" (emphasis ours)
This means that if the salary hike fund is ""abandoned"" to be used for COVID-19 measures, for example, this fund cannot be added in the 2021 and 2022 budgets. The proposed bill did not list, too, which specific items in the special purpose funds would be abandoned. 
Other options
 Gatmaytan said there are other ways to look for money in the current setup – without additional presidential powers.
""If there is a need for money, perhaps Congress can enact a supplementary budget subject to Article VI, section 25(4),"" said Gatmaytan. This allows for a special appropriation bill that ""shall specify the purpose for which it is intended.""
All the government needs to do is get a certification from the National Treasurer that the funds are available, or ensure that government revenues will cover the cost.
In late 2014, for instance, the Aquino administration passed a P22-billion supplemental budget for post-Yolanda rehabilitation and MRT3 capacity extension.
There are also contingency funds that are under the President’s control that can be used.   These funds are lodged under the Special Purpose Funds, meaning, they can only be used subject to the approval of the President.
Abad said there are items in the 2019 and 2020 GAA with ""significant allocations"" amounting to a total of P250.9 billion from the Special Purpose Fund, Health Facilities Enhancement Fund, and Duterte's Confidential and Intelligence Fund.
Abad said these could be used to fund the requirements needed to address COVID-19, instead of passing the two bills.
""The use of the items does not require a new law. Just administrative tweaking at the level of the department head or the President, depending on the amount,"" Abad told Rappler.
""The law is already there. GAA 2019 and GAA 2020,"" the ex-budget chief added.
When will the special powers end? 
 Another issue is the discretion that the bill gives to Duterte to determine when his special powers will end.  
Section 9 of the bill says the powers may be withdrawn ""by means of a concurrent resolution of Congress or ended by Presidential proclamation."" (emphasis ours)  
Section 9 also says it will take effect for two months ""or longer if the calamity persists, without prejudice to the powers that the President may continue to exercise under the Constitution or other laws.""
  These clauses give Duterte the power to have a say on when to end his special powers.  
But Gatmaytan pointed out that Article VI, Section 23(2), the very constitutional provision being invoked by this bill, clearly says that the powers will end in two ways only, and neither involves the president.
  The two ways are: ""Unless sooner withdrawn by resolution of the Congress"" and ""such powers shall cease upon the next adjournment thereof.""  
""These are temporary measures that are needed to address contingencies, but wary of concentrating powers in the Executive, the framers wisely put restrictions in the grant of powers under Article VI, Section 23,"" said Gatmaytan.  
So even though the bill says the powers will end in two months, ""the problem is that the bill provides for other ways for the emergency powers to terminate,"" said Gatmaytan. The President could very well end up choosing to extend the duration of his powers. – with a report from Mara Cepeda/Rappler.com

PALAWAN, Philippines – Regional health authorities reported another confirmed coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patient in the MIMAROPA region, bringing the total positive cases to 2 as of Monday, March 23.
The Department of Health Center for Health Development (DOH-CHD-MIMAROPA) said that the second confirmed case is a 24-year-old Filipino male in Marinduque, who traveled from Parañaque. (READ: Philippines coronavirus cases rise to 462, death toll hits 33)
Currently, the patient is in “stable condition and under home quarantine and strict monitoring,” the DOH-CHD-MIMAROPA said in a statement released Monday afternoon.
The patient arrived in Marinduque on March 12 with fever and sore throat, and only got tested on March 15 after exhibiting COVID-19 symptoms. He was admitted to a local health facility until he was sent home on March 18 after his condition improved. (READ: HELL ON EARTH: The agonizing confusion over coronavirus testing in PH)
With the new confirmed case, the regional DOH reiterated that “there is no local or community transmission recorded in the region.”
However, it also continued to ask the public to observe proper hygiene, physical distancing, enhanced community quarantine, and other preventive measures.
Marinduque’s health authorities, alongside concerned local government units, are conducting contact tracing to identify people who had close contact with the COVID-19 patient. Strengthening of infection prevention and control protocols have also been done in the province. 
Locals who had known exposure to the confirmed case or those who experience symptoms attributed to COVID-19 like persistent fever, cough and difficulty in breathing are encouraged to call Marinduque’s COVID-19 hotlines: 0961 505 2764 or 0956 748 0503 for appropriate assessment.
“For patients under home quarantine, we advise them to adhere to the instructions given by our health personnel. Make sure that the patient is staying in a safe place and must be isolated from the family members,” said regional health department director, Dr Mario Baquilod. 
“Temperature shall be strictly monitored. If caring for the sick, practice frequent hand-washing and wear a face mask every time they will be in a close contact with the patient,” Baquilod said.
Meanwhile, the 37-year-old person under investigation who died in Palawan on March 18 tested negative for COVID-19 after his result was released on Monday morning.
A 26-year-old Australian male tourist was Palawan’s first confirmed case. Local health authorities issued him a clearance after his fever subsided, allowing him to fly back to his country through a “mercy flight” to Clark via Airswift on March 17 before his result came out on March 21. – Rappler.com

MANILA, Philippines – Health officials in Pangasinan on Monday, March 23, announced 3 new confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus, bringing the province's total cases to 4.
Anna de Guzman of the Pangasinan Provincial Health Office said 2 of the 3 cases had cough, colds, and fever – symptoms of respiratory illnesses.
These two patients – a 70-year-old male and a 54-year-old female – are both Filipinos from Malasiqui town in Pangasinan. They are undergoing treatment at the hospital.
The towns of Rosales and Malasiqui have been placed under total lockdown starting 8 pm Monday ""to contain the spread of the virus,"" according to De Guzman.
Meanwhile, the Filipino-American patient who died in Dagupan City on March 18, tested positive for COVID-19 – the disease caused by the novel coronavirus – on Monday.
This brings the death toll in the province to two, after the first patient from Bayambang town died at the Lung Center of the Philippines on March 20. 
As of Monday, Pangasinan has recorded a total of 18 patients under investigation. Nationwide, the number of confirmed cases has reached 462, with 33 deaths and 18 recoveries.
The global death toll has reached 15,189, with 5,476 of the fatalities in Italy and 3,270 in China (excluding Hong Kong and Macau). The number of cases worldwide has risen to 341,300, with 81,093 cases in China and 59,138 cases in Italy. The virus has spread to 174 countries. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – Bannered as a way to enable the government to respond to coronavirus problems much quicker, bills providing special powers to President Rodrigo Duterte are being heard now in both chambers of Congress.
In both versions of the Senate and the House, Section 4(6) would allow Duterte to ""undertake the procurement of the following as the need arises, in the most expeditious manner, as exemptions from the provisions of Republic Act No. 9184 and other relevant laws.""
The bills list the goods under the special procurement clause such as medical supplies, relief packs, medical facilities, housing facilities, utilities, telecommunications, and other critical services in relation to the operation of quarantine centers.
RA 9184 is the government procurement law. In the government, public bidding is the most common and most preferred process of procurement. 
But alternative modes are allowed, especially in emergency cases. (READ: Duterte's request to take over private business 'merely standby power')
Section 53.2 of the law's Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) allows government to resort to a negotiated procurement during a state of calamity, or ""when time is of the essence arising from natural or man-made calamities.""
Former Budget Secretary Butch Abad said this provision should be enough for Duterte. ""The existing rules on emergency or negotiated procurement suffice,"" said Abad. (READ: Duterte gov’t has no breakdown of P275B to be tapped for pandemic response)
Former Commission on Audit (COA) commissioner Jose Fabia told Rappler the special power may be ""unnecessary."" 
""[The procurement law] is enough to provide for legal cover. There is no harm in reiterating it, although unnecessary,"" said Fabia. Fabia said that ""in the end, it will be negotiated procurement"" or ""can be government to government in some cases.""
Alternatives?
A former COA official who talked to Rappler pointed out that even if Duterte has special powers, the problem in this specific emergency is not the ability to buy, but where to buy, as the global supply chain of essential medical supplies is now also hit.
""How would you speed up procurement if the problem is the market?"" the official said in Filipino, adding that even with special power, Duterte would still have to use mechanisms provided under the procurement law.
The official said that if Duterte really needs special powers, the bills could have been specific like changing amount limits — for example, the procurement law allows for shopping or directly transacting with a known supplier for readily available goods, provided it does not exceed P250,000.
The official added that if Duterte wants exemptions, it should be specified, and not as broad as exemptions from the entire procurement law.
Open to audit
""Anyway, when everything settles, COA can order a special audit on how these funds were utilized and how they had impacted on the life of the Filipinos. Performance audit is the best way to determine this,"" said Fabia.
But this might just be what government seeks to avoid. 
If they resort to a negotiated procurement on the basis of the procurement law, COA will look into it after.
""The concern here is that the bureaucracy favors open and public bidding because of fear of COA audit observations that may lead to an Ombudsman case. That’s what happened in Yolanda,"" said Abad.
The official agreed, saying that in negotiated procurements, audits are automatic.
""Diyan talaga ginagamit ang pandaraya eh (That's where corruption happens),"" said the official.
In 2014, Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) officials resorted to a negotiate procurement in buying P67.5 million worth of equipment in 2014 to respond to problems rooted from the territorial dispute in the West Philippine Sea.
They were indicted for graft. But the Court of Appeals eventually cleared them, finding the emergency purchase justifiable.
""So kapag binigay mo ang power na 'yan im sure merong makikinabang (If you give that power, I'm sure someone will benefit),"" the official said.
""Anything that involves negotiated procurement may be abused. However, in times like this, we should give benefit of doubt that our leaders will put the country's and its citizens' interest at heart over and beyond their personal interest,"" said Fabia.
That is also the messaging of Duterte's former special aide Senator Bong Go during the interpellation over Senate Bill 1413.
""We are passing this measure out of trust, and we hope your conscience will guide you in implementing this measure. Nagtitiwala kami sa inyong katapatan (We trust you will be honest),"" Go said, referring to the executive branch, to which he is still deeply attached – although he is now a lawmaker.
The question is: has the Duterte administration earned enough trust? And will they be able to keep that trust? – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – The Philippine Army canceled festivities to mark its 123rd founding anniversary originally set for Monday, March 23, to focus efforts on humanitarian assistance and disaster response amid the outbreak of the novel coronavirus.
Instead, the Army's various camps and bases held a simultaneous flag raising ceremony on Monday morning, led by Army chief Lieutenant General Gilbert Gapay at their headquarters in Fort Bonifacio, Taguig City.
Wearing face masks and sitting a meter apart from one another, Army troops at the headquarters witnessed a demonstration of disinfection procedures for soldiers returning from duty at checkpoints to barracks.
The Army's Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear unit showed off their personal protective equipment and gadgets they use to disinfect fellow soldiers.
The Army has deployed some 440 troops to checkpoints since the ""enhanced community quarantine"" or lockdown of Luzon began on March 17. It has also sent out 18 of its trucks to service health workers and employees of essential businesses in the absence of public transportation, which is grounded because of the lockdown.
Soldiers deployed to assist persons potentially infected by the virus are trained and educated about the disease, as the Army itself steps up precautionary measures in its camps, it said in a media release.
A soldier who had been posted at a checkpoint in northern Metro Manila came down with a fever, and is now a ""person under monitoring"" for the coronavirus, Gapay told reporters.
""Kakaiba ito sa ating mga tradisyunal na kalaban sapagkat hindi ito tao, ngunit labis na mapamuksa. Gayunpaman, mananatili tayong matatag sa pagtupad ng ating sinumpaang tungkulin – ang pagsilbihan at protektahan ang mga mamamayan at ating bayan kahit buhay man ang kapalit,"" Gapay said at the ceremony.
(This is different from our traditional enemies because this enemy is not human, but very deadly. Even then, let us stay strong in fulfilling our sworn duty – to serve and protect the people and our country even if it costs us our lives.)

New ambulances
Also on Monday, the Army received two donated ambulances: one from the Lucio Tan Group of Companies, and the other, from the Jaime V. Ongpin Foundation.
Both vehicles will be used by the Army General Hospital to ""enhance its medical capabilities in support [of] the enhanced community quarantine,"" the Army said in a separate media release.
The Army, as with the other branches of the military, is providing support to the police in enforcing the lockdown of Luzon and other parts of the Philippines to avert the novel coronavirus.
Although the Philippine National Police is the primary enforcer of the lockdown, there are checkpoints and outposts manned by the military.
As of Monday afternoon, the Philippines has recorded 462 confirmed cases of the coronavirus, with 33 deaths and 18 recoveries.
The Philippine Army traces its foundation to the establishment of the Philippine Revolutionary Government on March 22, 1897, in Tejeros, Cavite, with Emilio Aguinaldo as president and Artemio Ricarte as captain general.
The revolutionary government fought the Spanish colonial government for independence, which was first declared on June 12, 1898.
With more than 97,000 troops, the Army is the largest branch of service of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, which also includes the Air Force and the Navy. – Rappler.com "

CAGAYAN DE ORO, Philippines – Lack of flights to Manila delays specimen testing for their Persons Under Investigations (PUIs) for the novel coronavirus.
As if that isn't enough to worry about,  the Northern Mindanao Medical Center (NMMC) fears it will soon run out of personal protective equipment (PPEs) for its medical personnel.
The NMMC is the referral hospital for all coronavirus Persons Under Investigation (PUIs) in the region.
NMMC is taking care of 10 PUIs staying in individual isolation rooms, and has reserved another 14 rooms for the same purpose. It already has a plan in place on how to make room for more should there be a surge of patients who test positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus that has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO).
NMMC Chief of Hospital, Dr Jose Chan, said on Monday, March 23, that the hospital is running out PPEs. Their supply could only last this week if there are no new deliveries from the Department of Health (DOH) and their medical suppliers. (READ: LEFT IN THE DARK: Little protection forgovernment's coronavirus frontliners)
Chan said that they still have enough PPEs as of Monday. “But [the coming days] would be critical. We may have no PPEs in the coming days,” he said.
Chan added that NMMC’s medical team is conscious not to exhaust their PPEs that include surgical and N95 masks. He said that while they received donated PPEs from the private sector, these won’t be enough.
Challenges in transporting specimen, PPEs
Chan hoped that the DOH and the hospital’s PPE suppliers will be able to make these necessary tools available anytime.
But he is also realistic: ""I think that this is not just a problem of Cagayan de Oro but any place in the Philippines or even the entire world as we face COVID-19.”
It is worrisome, too, that the lack of flights to Manila does not only pose logistical problems. It has put on hold the testing of the specimens from 20 hospitalized PUIs, including NMMC's 10 patients.
COVID-19 testing is done at the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) while the DOH research laboratory is in Manila.
Chan said that they planned to send the specimens to Davao City's Southern Philippine Medical Center (SPMC) which has a COVID-19 facility but the hospital had run out of the Sars-Cov2 reagent.
""Sad to say, they have consumed their reagent for testing,"" Chan said.
Chan added that they have to wait at least 10 days for the results of a COVID-19 test.
The good news is, 14 PUIs from Northern Mindanao have tested negative for the coronavirus. The region still has a total of 172 PUIs.
The 40 NMMC frontline medical workers who took care of COVID-19 PH 40 are now on their 8th day of quarantine and “are fine”, DOH region 10 Director Adriano Suba-an said in an update on his Facebook page on Monday.
Another batch of 20 frontline medical workers will start their quarantine period on Tuesday, March 24, Suba-an said.
COVID-19 PH 40, the first COVID-19 fatality in Mindanao, passed away at the NMMC on March 11. He relocated to Pasig City after the Marawi siege and went home to Iligan City to seek hospital confinement on February 23. His wife had tested negative for the virus while their daughter is waiting for her test results.
Stay at home for PPEs to last one more week
Chan said that the only way for the hospital’s PPEs to last this week is for the public to cooperate with the government's plea for them to stay home and prevent the transmission of the coronavirus.
This is the way to protect the frontline medical workers, Chan said.
Physical distancing also plays a crucial role in preventing the spread of the coronavirus. (READ: Call it 'physical distancing,' not 'social distancing,' says WHO)
""By observing social distancing and staying at home, there will be less cases of PUIs that would be referred to hospitals,” Chan said, adding: ""If we won’t follow the warnings, like social distancing, more patients will come to our hospital.”
""The PPEs will last this week only if there are no new cases coming in or patients admitted. We cannot tell, from what it is, it is unpredictable,” Chan said, describing the coronavirus. – Rappler.com

MANILA, Philippines – The country's biggest business groups called for the immediate passage of a bill addressing the coronavirus pandemic, but added that it should still be well within the boundaries of the Philippine Constitution.
""We recommend that any law that is passed by Congress should be consistent with our constitutional and legal principles, and not be overly broad and overreaching,"" the 22 business groups said in a joint statement on Monday, March 23.
In particular, the groups zeroed in on provisions allowing President Rodrigo Duterte to realign and reallocate government funds, as well as the potential takeover of private enterprises.
The business chambers said these provisions should be within the ""guidelines laid down by the Supreme Court"" to ""avoid constitutional challenges that would delay implementation"" of the law.
They also urged Congress to consider the following proposals:

Limit the duration of the law to two months and any extension should be approved by Congress.
Authorize the President or his designated officials to grant special permits and exemptions from bureaucratic requirements under existing laws and regulations  to avoid delay in the use of the funds and procurement of requirements. 
Authorize the President to adopt measures minimizing disruption to the supply chain, especially for basic commodities and services.
Provide rehabilitation, special financing programs, and/or a stimulus package to help businesses, especially micro, small, and medium enterprises. This is to help them pay workers while on lockdown and to resume normal operations once the pandemic is under control.
Support any assistance that the President may seek from other countries and multilateral organizations to raise money if necessary.

""Some of the foregoing items can also be covered in a second bill if including them now will cause needless delay in the passage of the bill,"" the groups said.
The following groups signed the joint statement:

On Monday, March 23, the House of Representatives convened itself into a committee of the whole to tackle House Bill No. 6616, which would declare a ""national emergency"" and grant Duterte ""emergency powers"" to address the outbreak.
Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea defended before lawmakers Duterte's request to be granted with powers to temporarily take over the operations of private firms. He argued that this particular proposal is only meant to be a ""standby power.""
Duterte also wants Congress to allow him to reprogram P275 billion worth of public funds, but did not provide lawmakers a list of the things or services that need allocation. 
Of that amount, a lump sum of P200 billion would go to the Emergency Subsidy Program, while another P75 billion would be allotted for health services like purchasing COVID-19 test kits, protective gear for health workers, and equipping quarantine centers across the nation.
But the executive branch has yet to provide specifics on the number of testing kits, protective gear, and other supplies to merit that allocation. – Rappler.com "

CEBU, Philippines (UPDATED) – The Department of Health (DOH) in the Eastern Visayas confirmed its first positive coronavirus case in a press conference on Monday, March 23.
The patient is a 51-year old Filipino female from Catarman, Northern Samar, and was categorized as a person under investigation (PUI) – someone who was exhibiting influenza-like symptoms and traveled to areas where the virus was present.
The patient arrived in Manila from Japan on January 2 and came to Samar on March 3, when she started showing symptoms, Department of Health-Center for Health Development (DOH-CHD) Regional Director Dr. Minerva P. Molon said.
Molon assured the public the DOH was taking action to trace the contacts of the patient. Measures were also taken to protect the health staff who attended to her.
""We assure the public that the DOH (Eastern Visayas)  is on top of the situation,"" Molon said. ""With the laboratory result of the first confirmed case, we are able to manage the patient who had greatly improved and is now recovering. A team has been sent to the area to conduct contact tracing,"" she added.
To stop local transmission, Molon said that ""symptomatic contact will be isolated and samples collected."" 
She was admitted to intensive care on March 12 and was scheduled to be discharged on Monday, March 23, when her results from the Research Institute of Tropical Medicine in Manila came back positive.
""She would have been discharged today had the result been negative,"" said Molon. 
New samples will be collected from the patient. She will need to test negative for coronavirus two consecutive times before she may be discharged. 
Northern Samar was already placed on community quarantine on March 19.
Leyte and southern Leyte were also placed on community quarantine on March 18. (READ: Leyte placed under community quarantine)
According to Molon, there are a total of 237 PUIs in the Eastern Visayas. Northern Samar has the most number of PUIs at 59.

MANILA, Philippines – No, Filipinos are not exactly thanking the deadly virus. 
On Monday, March 23, Filipinos on Twitter slammed the Department of Transportation (DOTr) over a post which ""thanked the coronavirus,"" pushing the phrase to the top of the trending topics on Twitter.
In a post, the agency thanked the coronavirus ""for shaking us and showing us we're dependent on something much bigger than we think.""
pic.twitter.com/i8BMAk0DxB— DOTrPH  (@DOTrPH) March 23, 2020
 
The agency has since taken down the post and apologized, explaining that the poem they shared was ""meant to provide an enlightening and awakening narrative into this pandemic."" 
""We acknowledge that not all of our audience appreciate the underlying message of the poem and video and we understand taht some view it as an insensitive act,"" the agency added. 
Background
Regardless, the damage was done and the screenshot of the posts have circulated online. 
In the post, DOTR shared an original poem by Riya Sokol, a Polish poet. 
Poland, whose healthcare system is publicly funded, has a total of 634 positive coronavirus cases, with 627 active cases and 7 deaths as of Sunday, March 22,2020.
This roughly translates to 1.1% mortality rate, which is lower than the 3.4% global average for mortality rate declared by WHO director general Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.
The Philippines, which has a healthcare system ranking 102nd in the entire world according to 2019 Global Competitiveness report by the World Economic Forum, has 462 cases with a total death toll at 33 as of posting.
That translates to roughly a 8.3% mortality rate which is more than twice the global average.
Why post something like this? 
Why is a government agency posting something which many netizens call absurd and insensitive? 
On Twitter, Filipinos shared their outrage and expressed their disdain for the post. 
this ""thank you corona virus"" of DOTr post, taking in consideration, it's clear that they want to accentuate our Filipino value of looking at things with silver lining.

MANILA, Philippines – A resident of Malabon City has tested positive for the coronavirus disease, the first case for the northern Metro Manila city. 
In a Facebook post on Monday, March 23, Mayor Lenlen Oreta said that the Department of Health (DOH) reported the positive test result.
Oreta did not mention anything else about the patient, but added that contact tracing is now being done to identify the people with whom the COVID-19 case interacted. 

Also on his Facebook page, Oreta posted an infographic stating that the city also has 20 Persons Under Investigation (PUIs) and 98 Persons Under Monitoring (PUMs).
Oreta assured his constituents that it’s all right to be scared but urged them not to panic.
Oreta appealed to them to follow the Luzon-wide enhanced community quarantine, to remain at home, and make hand washing a habit. (READ: Malabon approves 8 pm to 5 am curfew starting March 16)

(The COVID-19 virus is no joke because we do not know who has it. We should be extra careful while contact tracing for this patient is being implemented and we are waiting for the results of the tests we have sent to the RITM.)
As of Monday, the DOH confirmed 16 new coronavirus cases, bringing to 396 the total number of cases in the Philippines.
Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire also confirmed that the death toll due to the disease has reached 33, with 8 new fatalities recorded. The number of recoveries increased to 18. – Rappler.com

MANILA, Philippines – Amid criticism from the public, the Department of Health (DOH) on Monday, March 23, insisted there was “no policy for VIP treatment” in the novel coronavirus testing, but also said it would offer tests to a subset of government officials in charge of national security and public health.
“The DOH assures the public that there is no policy for VIP treatment and all specimens are being processed on a first-in, first-out basis, with courtesy accorded to officials holding positions of national security and public health,” the DOH said in a statement.
The agency had been criticized for allegedly prioritizing government officials for COVID-19 testing even if they didn't show symptoms of the disease, at a time when patients experiencing severe symptoms were made to wait in hospitals due to the limited number of test kits. 
The DOH said its protocol on testing still followed the decision tool published on March 16. (READ: When should you get tested for coronavirus?)
According to the DOH decision tool, vulnerable sectors and persons under investigation (PUI) who are experiencing severe symptoms will be prioritized for testing.
“These are extraordinary times, but we are hopeful that with the arrival of 100,000 testing kits and accreditation of additional sub-national laboratories and dedicated COVID-19 referral hospitals, more cases will be detected and appropriately managed,” the DOH added. 
The DOH has rejected calls for doing rapid tests, saying these are not accurate enough to check for the novel coronavirus in patients.
Meanwhile, DOH Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said rapid test kits could produce false negative results as these test for antibodies, which often do not produce accurate results.
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has so far approved 8 commercially available test kits for use.
Despite this, the Philippines' capacity for coronavirus testing remains limited. The DOH says only 950 to 1,000 tests can be done per day, with the bulk coming from the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine.
As of Monday, the Philippines has confirmed 462 cases of coronavirus, with 33 deaths and 18 recoveries. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – A group composed of families of political prisoners on Monday, March 23, called on the Duterte administration to allow mass testing of prisoners amid the rise of novel coronavirus cases in the Philippines. 
In a statement, KAPATID spokesperson Fides Lim says this will ""assure us that jails under their jurisdiction are indeed '100% safe,'"" as claimed by Interior Secretary Eduardo Año.
""It stretches the imagination how the world’s most congested prison system can be kept '100% safe' from the virulent COVID-19 when it cannot even provide hygiene essentials like soap and water nor ensure nutritious food and space for social distancing, but that is the stuff of confabulation,"" she said.
""Amusing but dangerous when human life is at stake,"" Lim added. 
Año assured the public stringent measures against the virus are in place in jails under the supervision of the Bureau of Jail Management and Penology (BJMP).
He also rejected calls for the release of low-level offenders, among other persons deprived of liberty (PDLs) and claimed PDLs were much ""safer inside.""
At least 380 out of its 467 jails supervised by BJMP are congested, as of October 2019, posing a 450% congestion rate which translates to 6 detainees occupying space only meant for one.
Data from January 2020, meanwhile, shows Bureau of Corrections facilities have a 310% congestion rate, with 49,114 PDLs scattered across its 7 facilities that only have a total maximum capacity of 11,981.
BuCor Chief Gerald Bantag said they have disinfected the New Bilibid Prison (NBP) and have procured N95 masks, gloves, disposable ponchos, and alcohol.
KAPATID reiterated its appeal and added that the only way to protect prisoners is to carry out humanitarian releases of sick, elderly, and low-level offenders.
""The release of prisoners during this extreme public health emergency is now the worldwide trend, with the DILG's counterparts in other countries like Iran, the US, Ireland, and Spain rapidly working with the courts to release many prisoners, including political prisoners as in the case of Iran,"" Lim said.
The Philippines has recorded at least 462 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus as of Monday, March 23, with 33 deaths and 18 recoveries.
According to the tracker of the Department of Health, it already conducted 1,622 tests so far. (IN CHARTS: PH lags behind other countries in COVID-19 testing)

MANILA, Philippines – The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) will be giving the national government a P300-billion boost to fight the novel coronavirus pandemic.
The BSP Monetary Board on Monday, March 23, authorized the purchase of government securities from the Bureau of the Treasury (BTr) under a repurchase agreement worth P300 billion.
This means that the BSP will invest in debt securities from the BTr. The government will then use the amount to fund initiatives and programs in fighting the pandemic. (READ: Give cash to urban poor during coronavirus lockdown – experts)

Filipinos are fuming online after several lawmakers and Cabinet secretaries decided to compare themselves with the overworked health professionals on the frontlines of the novel coronavirus pandemic. 
Speaker Alan Peter Cayetano and Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea seemed to have planned a little side show during the special session of the House of Representatives on Monday, March 23. 
After Medialdea defended the bill requesting Congress to grant President Rodrigo Duterte emergency powers to help stop the spread of the COVID-19 disease, the officials and politicians at the Batasang Pambansa stood up and faced the cameras. 
They then held up manila papers that read, “Together with doctors and frontliners, we went to work for you, so please stay at home for us.”
Present during this photo op were the Speaker, the Executive Secretary, Interior Secretary Eduardo Año, Budget Secretary Wendel Avisado, and several lawmakers.
It was clearly ripped off from a social media campaign launched by frontline health workers, who have been posting pictures of themselves in protective gear to convince the public to stay at home during the COVID-19 pandemic.  
Twitter users would have none of it. 
Many were appalled by the gall of lawmakers and Cabinet secretaries to lump themselves with health workers – many of whom have long been appealing to the government to give them more supplies and protective equipment to fight COVID-19.

HUMAN RIGHTS. DILG Usec Martin Diño tells a radio show human rights disappear in a public health emergency. File photo by Loreben Tuquero/Rappler 
No, Interior Undersecretary Martin Diño, the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus is not suspended under a state of public health emergency. Human rights are not suspended.
It is as simple and as clear as that.
Diño said over radio DZBB on Saturday, March 21, that there are no more rights as Luzon is on lockdown and other areas under localized quarantines to contain the spread of the coronavirus.
""Wala na ho karapatan. Tandaan niyo state of emergency ngayon. Ang karapatang pantao nawawala pagdating ng state of emergency,"" Diño said.
(There are no more rights. Remember we are under a state of emergency. Human rights disappear under a state of emergency.)
Diño took it further: ""Kaya pag meron nga pong state of emergency your writ of habeas corpus ay nawawala na po 'yan."" (So if there is a state of emergency, your writ of habeas corpus also disappears.)
The writ of habeas corpus (produce the body) is a remedy for any person deprived of liberty. It is issued by the court requiring a public official to explain the reason for a person's detention. (READ: '24 hour-curfews are unconstitutional and excessive')
The 1987 Constitution allows the suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus if there is a proclamation of martial law, meaning, agents can arrest and detain a person without a court order, without being compelled to explain his or her detention.
But President Rodrigo Duterte himself said: ""It's not a martial law.""
And even under martial rule, the 1987 Constitution made sure that not all rights will disappear. Under martial law, even though agents can arrest and detain a person without a court order, the person still has to be judicially charged within 3 days, otherwise, he or she will be set free.
The Commission on Human Rights (CHR) reminded Diño that even the Department of the Interior and Local Government or DILG's own memorandum guarantees human rights even as local officials are ordered to strictly implement lockdown guidelines.
DILG Memorandum Circular No. 2020-062, Section 5.2.10 says, ""LGUs are to ensure that no violations of human rights are committed by any border patrol staff nor any employee or officer.""
""Tao pa rin tayo sa gitna ng anumang sakuna kung kaya ang ating mga karapatang pantao ay nananatili bagama't limitado. May obligasyon pa rin ang gobyerno na tratuhin ang kanilang mga nasasakupan ng patas, makatao, at sang-ayon sa batas,"" the CHR said in a statement.
(Even in a calamity we are still human, so our human rights remain though limited. The government still has an obligation to treat people fairly and humanely, as provided by the law.)
And while the Department of Justice (DOJ) said that warrantless arrests may be done for lockdown violators, the very law it is citing protects the rights of people to liberty.
""RA 11332 itself expressly states that the rights of people to liberty while maintaining and preserving public health and security must be respected,"" said Edre Olalia of the National Union of Peoples' Lawyers (NUPL).
RA 11332 or the Mandatory Reporting of Notifiable Diseases Act punishes ""non-cooperation"" in a public health emergency – a law seen as being too broad to implement in a lockdown. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – A father-and-son tandem was arrested by agents of the Philippine National Police (PNP) for selling fake medicine that they claimed could cure the coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Ismael Aviso and his son Ismael Aviso Jr were arrested on Sunday, March 22, after cops posed as buyers paid them P7,500.
Cops from the PNP’s Anti-Cybercrime Group (ACG) received a tip on Friday, March 20, that two men were selling fake medicine through social media.
While scientists all over the world have been working on overtime to find a cure, they have yet to release any treatment drug that has undergone proper clinical trial and can be sold in the market.
The PNP ACG said the older Aviso had a history of selling fake inventions, such as a motionless electric generator in 2011. In 2019, he tried to sell drugs to fight dengue when the national epidemic was declared by the Department of Health.
Both men will face complaints for estafa and unlawful publication and utterances in relation to the Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012.
Police did not disclose who, but one of them will also face complaints of resistance and disobediance to persons of authorities and unauthorized use of private documents.

MANILA, Philippines – A barangay captain was arrested by the Philippine National Police (PNP) in Lanao del Sur after selling quarantine passes during their province-wide lockdown to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus.
Cassar Abinal, chairman of Barangay Mantapoli in the municipality of Marantao, was arrested on Sunday afternoon, March 22, after an informant reported him to cops through a text message.
""Acting on said report, the police officers immediately responded and they saw a bond paper posted at the wall of the barangay hall asking for P20 for home quarantine pass,"" the report said.
Quarantine passes are pieces of paper distributed by local officials to make sure that only one person per household goes out to buy essentials at a time. This is to maximize physical distancing and prevent the transmission of the coronavirus.
The national government has repeatedly said that the passes should be distributed for free.
Because of this, Abinal is set to face criminal complaints for violation of Republic Act No. 3019 or the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act, and for violation of the Revised Penal Code's Articles 213 (2) and 214, which pertain to robbery and extortion. – Rappler.com "

In a statement on Monday, March 23, BDO warned that scammers are posing as bank personnel and pretending to offer a ""loan payment extension"" amid the lockdown, which was triggered by the novel coronavirus outbreak.

BDO gave the following reminders to avoid being victimized:

Do not share personal information such as bank account numbers, usernames, passwords, birthday, mother's maiden name, and even the street where one grew up in.
Do not click on website links given through emails, text messages, or messages via social media. These links often lead to fake sites mimicking a company's official site, with the intention of stealing personal information.
Do not share OTPs. ""For banks, OTPs serve as an account holder's sign-off to proceed with a transaction, like paying for utility bills."" BDO said real bank officers will never ask clients for their OTPs.

MANILA, Philippines – Baguio City recorded its first case of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) after a 61-year-old Overseas Filipino Worker (OFW) from Italy tested positive, a health official said.
The patient left Italy on March 2 just when the virus outbreak began in the European country. Italy has become the pandemic’s epicenter with 60,000 confirmed cases and more than 5,000 deaths. (READ: Italy sees signs of hope after slight drop in new virus deaths)
 
Baguio City’s patient is the second case in the Cordillera, the first being a 39-year-old OFW from Abra.
Both patients are now in stable condition in hospitals in Baguio City and La Union, according to Dr. Amelita Pangilinan, regional director of the Department of Health (DOH) – Cordillera.
Pangilinan said that the Baguio City OFW started manifesting COVID-19 symptoms like cough, cold, and a mild sore throat on March 7.
Dr. Donabelle Tubera-Panes, an epidemiologist with the City Health Office, said that they have talked to the patient’s daughter and they have done contact tracing.
Panes said that the patient left her house only twice and went to Tuba and Sablan towns in Benguet.
Panes said that they followed Mayor Benjamin Magalong’s directive to do contact tracing for the person under investigation (PUI) even before the test results came out.
PUI cases are those who either have a history of travel or close contact with a COVID-19 positive case.
“I believe our contact tracing on her was accurate and exhaustive,” Panes said.
Panes said that some of those contacted are now also considered PUIs. They are now under home quarantine.

Pangilinan said that Baguio City recorded 4 more serious PUI cases. One of them, however, passed away on March 18 before her coronavirus test results came out.
She was a 55-year-old female who went to Manila, Quezon City and Zambales and manifested COVID-19 symptoms on March 10.
Two others are still in the hospital: a 67-year-old female who came from Manila last March 6 and a 31-year-old male from Taguig and manifested symptoms last March 16.
Another PUI case is a 55-year-old male who came from Manila. He tested positive in the initial test in Baguio. He was transferred to a Makati hospital. – Rappler.com

,"March 23, 2020",nCov,Netizens slam Duterte’s bid for ‘emergency powers’ in coronavirus outbreak,Rappler.com,"
 
MANILA, Philippines – As the number of confirmed coronavirus cases continued to swell in the Philippines, some netizens rejected granting President Rodrigo Duterte’s request for emergency as solution to the outbreak.
Duterte has called on Congress to declare a “national emergency” and grant him the “emergency powers,” saying it is a “necessary” move to address the crisis.
The draft bill, which both chambers of Congress deliberated during a special session on Monday, March 23, seeks to allow Duterte to “reprogram, reallocate, and realign” funds. It would also allow him to ""temporarily take over or direct the operation"" of privately-owned utilities or businesses needed to address public needs during the coronavirus emergency, among others.
As Congress deliberated on Monday, the hashtag #NoToEmergencyPowers trended on Twitter in the Philippine, reaching over 21,200 tweets as of early Monday afternoon.
Several netizens pointed out that emergency powers weren't needed since the President had not even made full use of the powers and resources currently at his disposal. (READ: #MassTestingNow: Online petition calls for urgent action on coronavirus outbreak)
Mr. President, there is no need for emergency power. Because first of all, you do not lack power. You lack decency, honesty, empathy, compassion, calm intellectual sanity and most of all: the ability to listen to experts. #MassTestingNowPH #NoToEmergencyPower— direk (@kathpernicus) March 23, 2020

Others pointed out how local government units had managed to put in place effective measures to contain the spread of the coronavirus and heed the needs of those deeply affected without resorting to emergency powers. (READ: [EDITORIAL] Emergency measures? Show us the plan first)
In a bid to stop the spread of the coronavirus, the Philippine government placed the whole island of Luzon, home to over 57 million people, on lockdown.
The burden of implementation has been placed on local governments. Among the crucial tasks given to them is to find ways to feed residents and to bring workers in essential fields and services brought to their workplace.
Netizens urged Duterte to focus on empowering local government units, to help address needs on the ground, instead of requesting for emergency powers.
Duterte earlier warned local officials struggling to enforce a Luzon-wide lockdown to follow all the national government’s orders, or risk facing administrative cases.
The reminder came after several national officials rejected Pasig City Mayor Vico Sotto’s appeal to exempt tricycles from the travel restriction placed on public utility vehicles, so these can transport health workers and people in need of medical attention.

As of Saturday night, March 21, the country had 380 confirmed cases of the coronavirus, with 25 fatalities.
Despite the increasing number of cases, the Department of Health maintains there is no need to implement mass testing, even when it has procured more than a 100,000 kits from China, South Korea, and Brunei.
The Philippines only has 5 facilities approved by the World Health Organization to process coronavirus samples. The country, so far, has a testing capacity of 950 to 1,000 tests per day.

MANILA, Philippines – President Rodrigo Duterte issued an administrative order allowing hazard pay for government workers who physically report to work for the duration of the Luzon-wide lockdown until April 12.  
Duterte ordered this through Administrative Order No. 26 signed on Monday, March 23, where he laid out guidelines on how to grant workers in the executive branch daily hazardous pay of not more than P500.  
Those eligible to receive the hazard pay were workers in national government agencies, state universities and colleges (SUCs), and government owned or controlled corporations (GOCCs). 
Government employees who are already entitled to hazard pay, such as public health workers, social workers, science and technology personnel, uniformed personnel were also eligible for hazard pay under the order, or whichever amount is higher.  
What are the conditions? Heads of agencies can give pay to workers who meet the following conditions:

Employee occupies regular, contractual or casual positions; were employed through job order or contract of service 
Employee is authorized to physically report to work during the Luzon lockdown 

Each worker is entitled to receive P500 at most for each day they physically report to work.  
Where will funds come from? Agencies and SUCs can source the amount from their personnel services for regular employees, while the amount needed for employees on job orders was to be charged against available maintenance and other operating expenses.  
If there are not enough funds to give workers P500 each, heads of agencies can grant a lower but uniform pay to all qualified employees. 
What about other government workers? Duterte urged the legislative and judicial branches to grant hazard pay to workers part of their offices’ skeleton forces during the lockcdown, observing the same scheme for compensation.  
Hazard pay for local government workers will be determine by their respective Sanggunians, depending on available funds, and not exceeding P500. Local government units were advised to follow limitation on budgets as prescribed by the Local Government Code. 
Rates for employees in local water districts will be determined by their respective boards of directors, though these should not exceed P500.  
As for employees and agencies exempted from the Salary Standardization Law, agency heads and governing boards may determine the amount of hazard pay to be distributed, though these should again not exceed P500. 
Private hospitals and businesses establishments were strongly urged to grant similar hazard pay.
Granting of hazard pay will also be applied retroactively, from when the lockdown started on March 17. 
As the number of novel coronavirus cases continued to rise in the Philippines, Duterte suspended work in the executive branch’s offices in Luzon to prevent the further spread of the virulent disease. 
The Philippines counted 396 confirmed coronavirus cases as of Monday, March 23. The confirmed cases included 33 deaths and 18 recoveries. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – The Pasig City government has started distributing food relief packs to residents of poor communities, as it prepares financial aid for informal workers unable to earn during the coronavirus lockdown, Mayor Vico Sotto said on Monday, March 23.
The city is giving out 400,000 food packs containing the following:

3 kilograms of well-milled rice
2 cans of sardines
2 cans of corned tuna
2 cans of corned beef
2 cans of meat loaf

Each bag costs around P397, and the whole project is estimated at P158.8 million, classified as emergency procurement. (READ: Vico Sotto vows full salaries for all Psig government workers during lockdown)
Sotto emphasized that the effort is meant for the city's poor.
""Hindi po natin mabibigyan ang lahat. Tandaan na maaari pang tumagal ang krisis na ito, at hindi natin puwedeng ubusin ang resources natin sa isang linggo lamang,"" Sotto said in a social media post.
(We can't give [a food pack] to everyone. Remember that this crisis may go on longer, and we can't use up our resources in a single week.)
Last Christmas, Pasig also gave out 400,000 food packs as gifts to every family, but it was a one-time handout. This time, the distribution is ""targeted"" to make the supply last longer, Sotto said.
The mayor appealed for patience and cooperation as barangay workers distribute the goods. Recipients are urged to practice physical distancing when they claim their food packs. The local government is unable to deliver the packs door-to-door at the moment, Sotto said.

Financial aid
The Pasig government is also preparing financial assistance for informal workers who are displaced from their sources of income because of the lockdown.
""Susunod na rin po diyan 'yung financial assistance naman na ibibigay natin sa mga hindi makapagtinda na vendors, pati pa sa mga tricycle drivers, jeepney drivers natin,"" Sotto said during Malacañang’s televised Laging Handa briefing on Monday.
(Up next is the financial assistance that we will give to vendors who are unable to sell, and also our tricycle drivers and jeepney drivers.)
Rappler asked Sotto for further details, but he had yet to respond as of this posting.
The biggest challenge of the city government is to provide for its many constituents who are unable to earn a living during the lockdown, and although they understand the need for the measure, it will become a big problem when jobless families start to go hungry, the mayor said during the briefing.
Pasig, along with the rest of Metro Manila, will be on ""enhanced community quarantine"" until April 14. The lockdown on the rest of Luzon is set to be lifted after April 12.
During the lockdown, all non-essential work and travel are prohibited, and all modes of public transportation are grounded.
All these, to avert the spread of the novel coronavirus. The Philippines has recorded 396 confirmed cases as of Monday morning, with 33 deaths and 18 recoveries. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – The Commission on Human Rights reminded the government that both human rights and the writ of habeaus corpus are not suspended even during the fight against the novel coronavirus outbreak in the country.
""Tao pa rin tayo sa gitna ng anumang sakuna kung kaya ang ating mga karapatang pantao ay nananatili bagama't limitado,"" CHR said. ""May obligasyon pa rin ang gobyerno na tratuhin ang kanilang mga nasasakupan ng patas, makatao, at sang-ayon sa batas.""
(We are still humans in the middle of any crisis, that's why human rights are still in place, even if limited. The government still has an obligation to treat citizens with respect to the law and their human rights.)
The commission was reacting to a statement by Department of the Interior and Local Government Undersecretary for Barangay Affairs Martin Diño made in a March 21 interview with DzBB.
Asked about possible rights abuses over arresting individuals, Diño said that human rights and the writ of habeas corpus are suspended during a national emergency.
""Wala na hong karapatan... Tandaan niyo, state of emergency ngayon, ang karapatang pantao nawawala kapag state of emergency (There are no rights. Remember, it's state of emergency now. Human rights disappear under a state of emergency),"" he said.
In a statement, CHR spokesperson Jacqueline de Guia said that human rights should be ""at the center of government efforts"" against the virus. (LOOK: Vulnerable citizens in the time of enhanced community quarantine)
""In implementing policies and actions in support of the enhanced community quarantine, government officials must always be conscious of not violating any rights,"" she said. ""The protection of our human rights is the very reason why we fight COVID-19.""
The commission also reminded the public to be always be on guard for human rights violations in the conduct of measures. ""We then urge the public to support measures that would help us address this pandemic, but always mindful of your rights and vigilant against possible abuses,"" De Guia said.

Diño's statements also contradict the DILG's own Memorandum, which lays out the guidelines of the enhanced community quarantine in Luzon. (READ: No, DILG Usec, privilege of writ of habeas corpus not suspended)
Section 5.2.10 of the DILG Memorandum Circular 2020-062 explicity states that there should be no human rights violations.

Human rights under a pandemic
Despite the guidelines, there have been reports of alleged abuses across Luzon, involving citizens who were found defying restrictions, such as curfews. (READ: '24 hour-curfews are unconstitutional and excessive')
In Laguna, a barangay captain placed curfew violators in a small cage meant for stray dogs. He said that they cursed officials and resisted orders.
Many of alleged violators of restrictions are workers and household heads who are breadwinners of their respective families, according to news reports. 
Human Rights Watch (HRW), in its report about human rights dimensions of COVID-19 response, reminded governments that there ""sweeping and overly broad restrictions on movement and personal liberty"" should be avoided.
It recommended that governments should make sure that needs are met, especially of vulnerable communities, when an area is placed under lockdown. 
""Government strategies should minimize disruption in services and develop contingent sources of comparable services,"" HRW said. ""Disruption of community-based services can result in the institutionalization of persons with disabilities and older people, which can lead to negative health outcomes, including death,"" the human rights group added.

MANILA, Philippines – As public calls for mass testing grow, the Department of Health (DOH) rejected the use of rapid test kits, saying these are not accurate enough to check for the novel coronavirus in patients.
""Ang ating rapid test kits hindi nirerekomenda ng DOH na gamitin natin ito (The DOH does not recommend the use of rapid test kits),"" Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said in a Laging Handa briefing on Monday, March 23.
Why not? Vergeire said rapid test kits can produce false negative results as these test for antibodies, which often do not produce accurate results.
She explained that such tests may look at past infections or acute infections, which can give patients a false sense of confidence that they are not infected with COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.
This means that if a patient has COVID-19 but is still in the early stages of infection, this may not show up in rapid tests.
According to infectious diseases specialist Dr Edsel Salvana, such tests are also ""notoriously sticky,"" which means other viruses like the common cold can produce a cross-reaction, leading to a false positive.
In that scenario, tests will show the patient has COVID-19, when in reality, it is not the disease they are infected with.
What now? Vergeire said the DOH is sticking to tests approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the World Health Organization, which can be used by hospitals and laboratories with testing capacity. 
Tests currently focus on those that trace the genetic makeup of the coronavirus in accredited and equipped labs like the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM).
The FDA has so far approved 8 commercially available test kits for use.
Despite this, the Philippines' capacity remains limited. The DOH said only up to 950 to 1,000 tests can be done per day, with the bulk coming from RITM.

CRISIS. People wearing face masks amid the coronavirus pandemic. Photo by Jire Carreon/Rappler 
MANILA, Philippines – Several experts in business and economics urged the Philippine government to give cash assistance to the poorest Filipinos immediately, rather than spending on infrastructure amid the novel coronavirus pandemic.
Peter Lundgreen, chief executive officer of investment advisory firm Lundgreen Capital, told Rappler that the Philippines should do a cash assistance program similar to that of Hong Kong.
The Hong Kong government is giving each adult resident around $1,200 (P61,200), as well as tax breaks and financial aid for companies.
The United States is also thinking of following Hong Kong's strategy. 
""Many politicians want the most out of a fiscal stimulus, so they tend to use it for infrastructure expenses and do tax reliefs etc.... They are trying to maximize, but they need to think differently,"" Lundgreen said.
Lundgreen argued that the Philippines, a consumption-driven economy, must target the most affected families and ensure that they are able to meet daily needs. Doing so would keep the economy running and ease the burden brought about by the virus.
Economists from the University of the Philippines School of Economics shared a similar view, noting that the economy must ""contract"" or ""freeze"" in favor of public health.
In a discussion paper, the Filipino economists said the government must increase payments to poor households already identified in the conditional cash transfer program. Identifying new households in need of cash aid must be done immediately as well.
Alfredo Paloyo, one of the writers of the paper, recognized that distribution of cash will be difficult, as majority of Filipinos do not have bank accounts. (WATCH: Rappler Talk: Saving the economy from a pandemic)
Paloyo said food and non-food vouchers or food packs may be the better alternative. 
He added that the government must bridge the current liquidity gap by giving financial aid, as most cannot work due to the lockdown.
The government's economic managers will be spending P27.1 billion to combat the economic impact of the virus. More than half will go to tourism infrastructure projects. Only P2 billion is allotted for subsidies for affected workers.
""That's very curious because I haven't seen any plans on how they plan to spend that money.... That is very confusing to me because who will fly to the Philippines now? There are multiple travel bans,"" Paloyo said.
""It only makes sense to me if they are going to use it to bridge the gap for the workers, because a lot of the workers, precisely because nobody is traveling, are finding themselves without jobs,"" he added.
The economists urged the government to spend as big as P300 billion or more, bulk of which should go to social protection programs. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – There are 14 coronavirus-positive patients who are staying in their homes for self-isolation, the local government of Quezon City announced in a statement sent to Rappler on Monday, March 13.
""Given this, the local government has intensified its efforts by identifying facilities within which positive patients who do not have the capacity to undergo self-quarantine due to their living conditions will be accommodated,"" the government said.
Quezon City has been struggling to contain the virus given its large area and population. It is four times the size of the capital Manila, and it is a city of 3 million people.
Who are the 14? In an earlier interview with Rappler, Quezon City Mayor Joy Belmonte said that of the 14, 3 lived in urban poor communities, thus carrying the bigger risk of massively spreading the virus in their smaller households and population-dense communities.
Most of the rest, Belmonte said, were professionals who can self-quarantine and keep their distance from their families and their neighbors. This does not mean that they were told to go home by Quezon City hospitals. They are all just residents of Quezon City.
Why does this matter? The patients were told by different hospitals in Metro Manila to stay at home in an effort of the government to prevent an overload of coronavirus patients. Citing the Department of Health's Memorandum No. 2020-0108A, the Quezon City local government said they were advised to send people with non-critical symptoms to stay home as to not overwhelm hospitals.
In response to the expected rise of cases, the Quezon City local government has begun searching for alternate facilities to isolate coronavirus-positive patients and persons under investigation. They have already scouted one, said Mayor Belmonte. Those at home, meanwhile, will be ""strictly monitored"" by local health officials. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – Supermarkets, drugstores, and similar establishments should not require customers to wear face masks, said Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles on Monday, March 23.
Nograles, also the spokesperson of the government's Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF) on Emerging Infectious Diseases, said such establishments are only required to maintain physical distancing in their premises.
Physical distancing, or what the government calls ""social distancing,"" is maintaining ample space between people to prevent contagion. The IATF recommends staying at least one meter away from other people.
""Wala naman kaming inilabas na patakaran mula sa [IATF] na kailangang magsuot ng mask bago pumasok sa mga supermarket, ano po? Ang amin lamang patakaran, ang rules lang po natin, magkaroon ng social distancing sa mga supermarkets.... So ganoon na lang po ang sundin natin,"" Nograles said in the government's Laging Handa televised briefing.
(We never put out such a rule from the IATF that requires face masks when entering the supermarket, right? Our only directive, our only rule is to have social distancing in supermarkets.... So that's all we have to follow.)
Nograles was responding to a question sent in by a reporter, asking whether it was right that some supermarkets and drugstores were not letting people without face masks enter their establishments.
The reporter, whose question was read out by Presidential Communications Operations Secretary Martin Andanar, pointed out that face masks were in short supply, and many stores don't have them in stock either.
Nograles said only physical distancing is necessary inside stores, and it is up to the store managers to limit the number of people entering so that this can be practiced.
The entire island of Luzon and many other areas of the Philippines are on lockdown or ""enhanced community quarantine"" to slow down the spread of the novel coronavirus.
People are urged to stay home as much as possible, with only one person per household designated and authorized to step out and buy food and supplies.
Most businesses are closed except for essential ones like supermarkets and drugstores, where people sometimes queue for hours to wait for their turn to enter and shop.

This includes the 16 cases earlier reported by DOH on Monday morning. 
The number of total fatalities due to the virus rose to 33 after the health department reported 8 additional deaths. The DOH also announced a patient has recovered from the virus, bringing the country's total recoveries to 18.
In a press briefing on Monday afternoon, DOH Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said that the number of confirmed cases in the country will continue to rise in the coming days as the health department has extended testing laboratories nationwide and the testing kits from other countries have arrived.
""Mas marami na po tayong nagagawang test ngayon at nare-reduce na natin ang ating backlogs and because of that, baka artificial rise ito, so sabi ko nga, huwag kayo magugulat kung pataas tayo ng pataas dahil sa artificial rise,"" Vergeire said.
(We are able to conduct more tests now and reduce our backlogs. This rise in the number of positive cases may be artificial because of that, and as I've said, don't be surprised if this will keep on increasing.)
According to Vergeire, even though the rise is ""artificial,"" it doesn't mean that the number of cases is not rising.

MANILA, Philippines – Health workers serving on the frontline of efforts to combat the novel coronavirus disease do not need to obtain special identification cards that would allow them to leave their homes and report for work, Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles said on Monday, March 23. 
""Sapat na po iyong PRC (Professional Regulation Commission) ID o ID ng ospital o health establishment,"" Nograles said in a regular Laging Handa briefing on Monday morning. 
(Your PRC IDs or IDs from your hospitals or health establishments will be enough.) 
Why this matters. Health workers are among the limited number of people authorized to leave their homes during the Luzon-wide lockdown as they play a crucial role in both treating coronavirus patients and battling its spread. (LIST: Who are allowed out during Luzon lockdown?) 
While health workers were among those allowed to move despite travel restrictions, questions were raised online over whether or not they would need to obtain accreditation IDs from the government’s coronavirus task force. 
Similar accreditation IDs were required of media, while some local government units asked residents to obtain quarantine passes when going out to buy food and essentials. 
The Philippines has counted at least 380 confirmed coronavirus cases as of Saturday night, March 21. The new total confirmed cases is 150 cases more than the health department’s tally on Friday, March 20. 
The confirmed cases include 25 deaths and 15 recoveries. – Rappler.com "

EMERGENCY POWERS. Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea speaks before the House of Representatives on March 23, 2020. Screenshot from House video 
MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea defended before lawmakers President Rodrigo Duterte's request to be granted with powers to temporarily take over the operations of private business during the novel coronavirus outbreak.
Medialdea delivered a speech on Monday, March 23, before the House of Representatives, which convened itself into a committee of the whole to tackle House Bill (HB) No. 6616, which would declare a ""national emergency"" and grant Duterte ""emergency powers"" to address the outbreak.
HB No. 6616 – which the House committee of the whole already approved without allowing interpellations – is a carbon copy of the bill drafted by Malacañang.
Medialdea argued that this particular proposal requested by the President is only meant to be a ""standby power"" to respond to the fast-spreading COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus.
""And now I come to the requested power which is stirring some controversies since yesterday and I believe unjustifiably so – the power to take over private establishments. Even as originally worded, the intent of the proposal was simply to grant to government a standby power,"" Medialdea said.
""It is a power which [we] do not consider necessary to be exercised at all times because the establishments that are needed to deal with this crisis have, to their credit, have mostly been cooperating with government.  But we only desire such a power to be legislated because the virus we are up against is so unpredictable and can spread rapidly in a community,"" the executive secretary added.
He explained that the power to temporarily take over private business, if approved by lawmakers, would only be exercised by the Duterte government as a last resort.
""The power to take over is intended merely as a standby power in the event the crisis reaches its worst, when our most critical institutions are nearing total shutdown and government is left with no choice but to take over these establishments,"" Medialdea said.
The executive secretary delivered his speech from within the halls of the Batasang Pambansa, but a majority of the House members listened to it via teleconferencing app Zoom – the first committee of the whole meeting and House plenary session in Philippine history to be done through livestreaming.
Under HB No. 6616, Duterte would be allowed to ""temporarily take over or direct the operation"" of privately-owned businesses needed to address the needs of the public during the coronavirus emergency such as hotels, public transportation, and telecommunications.
The businesses the bill cited are needed to house health workers and serve as quarantine areas and medical facilities. The measure also states that the President's takeover of transportation and telecommunication companies would be used to service medical professionals and ""ensure uninterrupted communication channels between the government and the public.""
The lower chamber's rules state that when the House constitutes itself into a committee of the whole, it functions as one panel acting upon a bill or resolution. It will be conducting proceedings just like any other regular committee of the House.
Because the committee of the whole already approved HB No. 6616, the measure can now be tackled by the plenary. Duterte also certified the bill as urgent, which means the House can approve it on 2nd and 3rd reading on the same day.
The plenary session is ongoing as of posting time.

MANILA, Philippines – Senate President Vicente Sotto and Senator Pia Cayetano filed Senate Bill 1413, which seeks to give President Rodrigo Duterte 19 special powers to deal with the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak.
Under the bill, the senators are not seeking for emergency powers for the President, different from the initial Malacañang draft of the bill. Instead, what they seek is ""to grant him (Duterte) authority subject to such limitations.""
The Senate version of the bill likewise allowed ""directing of operations any private hospitals and health facilities"" to deal with the pandemic ""when the interest of the public requires"", granted that the management is still under the owners of the hospitals.
Here are the special powers sought by the senators:

Adopt and implement measures to prevent or minimize the spread of the coronavirus
Expedite testing and observation of persons under investigation and persons under monitoring
Ensure local government units (LGUs) follow protocols listed by the national government
Adopt measures to prevent hoarding, profiteering, price manipulation, and other practices that would affect the supply of food and other goods
Undertake “in the most expeditious manner” procurement of goods such a personal protective equipment, testing kits, and other medical supplies; utilities, telecommunications, and other services needed to operate quarantine centers, leasing of property to house workers; establishment of medical facilities
Expedite procurement
Lower lending rates of interest and reserve requirements of lending institutions
Liberalize grants for incentives of manufacture or importation of supplies needed to address the coronavirus outbreak
Require businesses to accept and prioritize contracts for services needed to address the outbreak
Regulate and limit the operation of transportation in both public and private road, rail, aviation, and maritime sectors
Regulate traffic of all roads, streets, bridges; prohibit putting up of road obstacles
Continue authorizing alternative work arrangements for government employees in executive branch
Conserve and regulate the distribution of power, fuel, energy, water
Cancelation of appropriated programs, projects or activities in the executive in the 2019 and 2020 budgets and utilize the savings generated from the cancelation
Unutilized and unreleased balances in the special purpose fund and money from collections or receipts to be used for the purpose of the state of emergency
Reprogram, reallocate, and realign any appropriation in the 2020 budget for social ameloriation, recovery, and rehabilitation 
Move deadlines for filing of taxes, and other charges required by law
""Undertake such other measures as may be reasonable and necessary"" to address the outbreak, subject to the bill of rights and other constitutional guarantees

MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – Philippine Council for Foreign Relations president Alan Ortiz died in Paris, France early Monday morning, March 23, due to COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. He was 66 and would have turned 67 this August.
His daughter Monica Ortiz announced his death on behalf of her mother.
""Dr. Alan T. Ortiz – our dearest Alan, beloved father, Kuya to his family, and indulgent Lolo – passed away in the early morning of March 23 due to complications from COVID-19,"" Monica said in a public Facebook post. 
""We entrust him completely to God and we give thanks for the blessings that God has given us through the abiding and steadfast love of our Papa. We grieve our loss and celebrate the life that God has blessed him with,"" Monica wrote.
""All the days of our lives, we will miss him, his laughter, his intelligence and his sense of adventure. We thank everyone who has stood by us and we ask you to pray for his eternal rest,"" she added.  
Monica also disclosed in her post that her father was last in Manila on March 3. ""He died in Paris, where he was invited by the French government for a security conference, and contact tracing has already been done. His last known contacts in the Philippines are in good health. His prior international travel history was in December [2019] to London to spend Christmas with his family to meet his grandson for the first (and sadly only) time.""
Public servant 
Before becoming the Philippine Council for Foreign Relations president, Ortiz was former president and chief operating officer (COO) of SMC Global Power Holdings Corporation, a wholly-owned affiliate of San Miguel Corporation. 
He was previously the president of the National Transmission Corporation and served as a board adviser to, and member of, the Philippine National Oil Company (PNOC) Energy Development Corporation and Manila Electric Company, respectively. 
Ortiz, who placed first in the 1981 Philippine Foreign Service Officer examinations, also served extensively in government.
He was assistant director-general of the National Security Council under former president Corazon Aquino and vice-chairman and COO of the Development Bank of the Philippines, among others. 
According to his official profile on the Philippine Council for Foreign Relation website, Ortiz also held chief executive positions in the Philippine divisions of the Economist Intelligence Unit, Edison Mission Energy, and Dharmala Corporation. 
He was also a fixed income associate with Goldman Sachs Company in New York and Tokyo. – Rappler.com "

120 adults and 15 minors sit in a physical distancing manner after they were apprehended by patrolling police for violating the curfew of the enhanced community quarantine at Barangay Batasan in Quezon City on Monday midnight, March 23. The residents were given a warning and later on released after giving their details to the QCPD Station 6. Photo by Ben Nabong/Rappler MANILA, Philippines – Under a state of public health emergency and in a lockdown to contain the coronavirus outbreak, human rights lawyers will admit restrictions to movement are warranted, but not 24-hour curfews.
""Ang 24-hour curfew ay outright denial of the right to travel and freedom of movement,"" human rights lawyer Chel Diokno said.
(A 24-hour curfew is an outright denial of the right to travel and freedom of movement.)
National Union of Peoples' Lawyers (NUPL) president Edre Olalia said 24-hour curfews are ""unconstitutional for being arbitrary and unreasonable, and an overbreadth of police power unwarranted under the present and foreseeable circumstances.""
The issue is a little tricky.
For one, as Luzon is put under an enhanced community quarantine (ECQ), everybody is ordered to stay home and not go out. Thus, a 24-hour curfew is, effectively, already being implemented. This is the line of reasoning often used by the administration when asked.
""The total lockdown in Luzon is in effect a 24-hour curfew. No one leaves the house, unless covered by the exceptions/exemptions,"" said Justice Secretary Menardo Guevarra, a senior member of the coronavirus Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF).
But as Guevarra himself said – there are exceptions.
The IATF guidelines allow people – or at least one member of the household – to buy food and medicine. In fact, food deliveries are still allowed to operate.
That is why, certain localities imposed curfews only on a limited window, like 8pm to 5am for some.
""Curfew impositions cannot be arbitrary, excessive or disproportionate. Measured by these standards, the 24-hour blanket curfews with vague or no exceptions or exemptions issued through ordinances by some local government units are open to serious legal challenge,"" said Olalia.
Penalties
Muntinlupa City, for example, has put all of its residents under a strict 24-hour curfew, ""unless he/she falls under the exemptions provided by laws or ordinance.""
Muntinlupa's Ordinance No. 2020-074 imposes penalties on the curfew violators: blotter and cancellation of city benefits such as scholarships on first offense; blotter and withholding of relief goods and assistance on 2nd offense.
This is illegal, said Olalia, as penalties must have a direct relation to a crime as defined by a law.
""In this context, the ordinance issued by some local government units cancelling for instance scholarship benefits are legally infirm,"" said Olalia.
Diokno also said that minors cannot be penalized for violating curfews. 
""Ayon sa Comprehensive Juvenile Justice Act, bawal patawan ng penalty ang mga minor para sa curfew violation. Dapat dalhin sila sa kanilang bahay o i-turn-over sa kanilang magulang,"" said Diokno.
(According to the Comprehensive Juvenila Justice Act, you cannot impose penalty on minors for curfew violation. They should be brought home and turned over to their parents.)
Section 57 of the Comprehensive Juvenile Justice Act says minors cannot be punished for status offenses. Status offenses include curfew violations under the said law.
Window hours
There is also confusion on window hours, as advisories are being passed around stating window hours when people can go out for their errands. 
The Philippine National Police (PNP) has clarified it has not issued a window hour policy, but said Local Government Units (LGUs) may do so.
In Manila, cops fell for a bogus window hour advisory, which the PNP had to disown so it's not used as basis for apprehensions.
Why can't the IATF just outrightly ban window hours?
""I understand that further measures to ensure uniform and easy implementation are being discussed,"" said Justice Undersecretary Markk Perete.
Who can impose curfews?
Olalia said LGUs may indeed impose curfews, like its barangay councils or city councils through valid ordinances.
Provincial boards, Congress, and the President can also do so, again, through valid orders.
Presidential Assistant for the Visayas Michael Diño released a memorandum ""ordering"" local government units (LGUs) in the Visayas island group to pass an ordinance that would impose a 24-hour ""curfew"" for students and senior citizens. (READ: Cebu province orders 24-hour home quarantine for students, elderly)
Interior Undersecretary Jonathan Malaya quickly said that Diño is not authorized to order LGUs.
""Only the ES (Executive Secretary) or the SILG (Secretary of Interior and Local Government) as alter ego of the President on local government matters has the legal authority to direct or enjoin LGUs,"" said Malaya.
Diño made a clarification saying that the memorandum only ""encourages"" LGUs and not orders them.
Supreme Court Spokesperson Brian Keith Hosaka said that courts would accommodate petitions challenging ordinances, orders, and the like related to the implementation of measures in a state of public health emergency.
Olalia said that NUPL lawyers are ""most certainly"" open to filing petitions if the need arises, but he has a concern.
""But is filing cases physically an exempted task that overzealous village guards, barangay tanods, MMDA blueboys, Highway Patrol Group, Philippine National Police, Armed Forces of the Philippines, National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict (NTF-ELCAC), city ordinance, emergency powers restrictions on movement and travel allow?""

MANILA, Philippines – Health Secretary Francisco Duque III clarified he did not sack Dr Celia Carlos as director of the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM), the country’s main novel coronavirus testing center now grappling with a backlog issue. 
Rather, the Department of Health (DOH) chief told Rappler he is designating Assistant Secretary Nestor Santiago to the RITM to help address the growing demand for testing.
“Dr Celia is still the director of RITM. Nobody is replacing her,” Duque told Rappler on Sunday, March 22.  
“Asec Santiago is designated only to oversee RITM and assist in easing some of its operational gridlocks,” added the DOH chief in a text message.
A copy of Duque’s Department Personnel Order (DPO) No. 2020-1011 made rounds on social media, which says Santiago has been appointed as ""OIC-director IV"" or officer-in-charge director IV of the RITM in a “concurrent capacity.” 
The RITM reorganization comes as the Philippines continues to struggle with a severe lack of test kits for COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus that has so far infected 380 people and killed 25 in the country. (READ: Hell on earth: The agonizing confusion over coronavirus testing in PH)
In the first 3 months of the outbreak, the Philippines had only the RITM to test COVID-19 samples. Now there are 4 other subnational laboratories duly accredited by the World Health Organization, but they are not yet in full capacity. 
The DOH is yet to give a specific number on the testing backlog that all these laboratories need to catch up on. But a Rappler study showed the Philippines has been conducting only around 12 COVID-19 tests for every one million people.
On Monday, March 23, Duque said his executive assistant supposedly just made a clerical mistake in the DPO.
“Nagkamali ‘yan. Inamin na ng aking executive assistant. Ang nailagay nila ang designation na director pero hindi, kasi Asec na siya eh. Ang sabi ko, magkaroon ng oversight lamang para makatulong kay Director Celia Carlos sa pagpapalawig ng testing capacity,” Duque told CNN Philippines. 
(There's an error there. My executive assistant already admitted to it. What was placed in the designation is director but that's not right, because he is an Asec already. I said he will just be performing an ovesight function to help Director Celia Carlos expand the testing capacity.) 
The DOH chief then vouched for Carlos’ technical expertise as RITM director.“Kasi siyempre overwhelmed na rin ‘yong Direktor ko na ‘yan who si technically competent so I have no doubt about her technical expertise. Kailangan lang niya ang management ng expansion ng capacity…so pinapasok ko si Asec, si Assistant Secretary Nestor,” Duque said. 
(This director of mine is already overwhelmed, but she is technically competent so I have no doubt about her technical expertise. She just needs help in the management of the capacity expansion...so I put in Assistant Secretary Nestor.)
DOH Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire previously said the country’s 5 subnational laboratories now have the capacity to process 950 to 1,000 tests per day, But the bulk still comes from the RITM, which averages 600 tests per day. – Rappler.com  "

MANILA, Philippines – Several student groups are pushing for the suspension of online classes, as the country grapples with rising numbers of confirmed coronavirus cases.
In a bid to contain the spread of the virus, several areas of the Philippines, including the whole island of Luzon which houses over 57 million residents, are on lockdown.
In Metro Manila especially, classes in all levels and government work are suspended until April 14, coinciding with the end of the 30-day lockdown in the area.
However, several schools are opting to make up for lost time with online classes, following an advisory from the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) that encourages schools to use “available distance learning, e-learning, and other alternative modes of delivery in lieu of residential learning if they have the resources to do so.”
Several student groups, however, have pointed out that imposing mandatory online classes as an alternative will greatly hurt the vast majority of students who do not have access to the internet. (READ: How metro schools continue lessons amid coronavirus threat)
In a position paper submitted to CHED on March 19, Student Council Alliance of the Philippines (SCAP) and Students’ Rights and Welfare Philippines (STRAW PH) pointed out that these online classes will force students to go to crowded places such as computer shops to access wifi or sari-sari stores to get cellular data.
They added that for some, these options are expensive, dangerous, and limiting, especially as students in Metro Manila are barred from public spaces due to the coronavirus threat.
“In the framework of online classes, only students who can afford to have internet installed at home are those who can access education. Thus, online classes are merely manifestations of the divide among social classes in our studentry, when education should not be limited to a certain few,” they said.
The challenges
Bolstering their stand, they conducted an online survey with 2,340 teachers and students from Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao as respondents to check the different challenges they face in online classes.
In its survey, over 72% or 1,748 people said they had difficulty understanding lessons from online classes. Meanwhile, 67% or 1,567 struggled with online classes due to loss of internet or stable connection.
The other 3 obstacles that respondents faced during online classes were the large volume of internet-intensive tasks (64%), strict guidelines such as attendance (43%), and lack of gadgets (22%).
The results spurred SCAP and STRAW PH to call on CHED to suspend online classes and assignments, as well as put in place mechanisms to help students or teachers who are on the losing end of these e-learning methods.
How online classes affect students, teachers
Several student groups including the Saint Louis University (SLU) Supreme Student Council, National Union of Students in the Philippines (NUSP), and University of the Philippines (UP) College of Education Student Council have echoed the call.
The Society of Mass Communication Students from the Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Marikina added that several students and teachers may face resource constraints and a lack of concrete guidelines on how activities and assignments may be coursed online.
UP College of Education Student Council, meanwhile, remarked how the government has not provided comprehensive guidelines and support for the transition to virtual learning, especially in the middle of an outbreak.
“Without clear mechanisms and sufficient resources for online learning, the burden to look for ways to conduct and attend virtual classes is just put [on] the students, teachers, and parents, especially in public schools...Our right to quality, accessible, and relevant education must not be hindered just because of logistical issues and state neglect,” they said.
They suggested for schools to utilize virtual learning classrooms, where lessons are already outlined and resources are easily downloadable anytime, so students can study if they have the means to do so.
NUSP agreed, saying some schools have no proper guidelines on online submissions or no learning management systems to fully plan, implement, and access specific learning processes during the outbreak.
SLU Supreme Student Council in Baguio City pointed out that the continuation of e-learning might affect the mental health of students, as they grapple between prioritizing their health concerns and their academics during this outbreak.
As of Sunday, the Philippines has already reported 380 confirmed cases of coronavirus, with 25 fatalities.
“Educational institutions must realize that the added academic pressure — especially in online educational platforms they were not trained to use — does nothing to contribute to the physical and mental welfare of our students,” SCAP added.
Instead of online classes, SLU Supreme Student Council proposed the extension of the academic year to make up for the 30-day class suspension brought by the Luzon lockdown.
“This would not mean that we are promoting academic negligence of students, but for quality education not to be compromised...during this state of calamity,” they clarified.
The student government of Technological University of the Philippines also explained that the suspension of online classes must also cover the online submission of requirements to allow families, especially the urban poor, to focus on the provision of necessities such as food, water, and medicines during the crisis.
“Even if only a few students are unable to comply without fault, the purpose of learning and education for all would ultimately be defeated should online classes and requirements push through. The priority of one’s health and the welfare of the community must be put above the need to find the means to online access at the cost of safety,” added University of the East-Caloocan Central Student Council.
According to CHED’s advisory, higher education institutions that have shifted their academic calendars can “adjust their semester as needed, adopt different delivery modes of teaching, and provide make up classes to compensate for the 30-day class suspension.”
Several institutions including UP, Ateneo de Manila University, De La Salle University Taft, and Lyceum of the Philippines University, among others, have canceled their online classes. Several others are still employing the e-learning method to catch up on their curriculum.

The Department of Education, meanwhile, has DepEd Commons, an online platform for public school teachers to support distance learning. Since the platform is still in its early stages, its use is not yet required. However, teachers with available resources and access to internet are encouraged to use online alternative platforms during class suspensions.
“We acknowledge the reality of [the] situation wherein DepEd Commons and its Open Education Resources (OER) are not accessible to all teachers and learners. Given that not everyone has access to a stable internet connection, online learning platforms are only given as an option for those who have access to such medium,” DepEd Undersecretary Alain Del Pascua said.
“We must start somewhere and work our way towards the ideal where all teachers and learners in the country can access such resources. Until that time, we offer DepEd Commons and OERs to those who can make use of them, as we continue to work for the connectivity of all our schools and offices,” Pascua added. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – Filipino economists urged the government to spend at least P100 billion to P300 billion or even more on social protection and economic recovery programs to avert a recession amid the novel coronavirus pandemic.
The policy recommendation released on Sunday, March 22, was written by Alfredo Paloyo of the University of Wollongong in Australia, and University of the Philippines School of Economics faculty Cielo Magno, Karl Jandoc, Laarni Escresa, Maria Christina Epetia, Maria Socorro Bautista, and Emmanuel de Dios.
So far, President Rodrigo Duterte's economic managers have said they will be rolling out a P27.1-billion fiscal stimulus package to address the economic impact of the virus. More than half of the amount would go to the tourism sector, while around P4 billion is set for loans.
The economists disagreed with the government's strategy and argued that billions of pesos should be spent ""to save people's lives, provide subsistence, preserve employment, and affirm social solidarity"" during the Luzon-wide lockdown and scaled-down market activities.
""Under a community quarantine, it makes little sense to speak of a 'fiscal stimulus package,' an unfortunate choice of words. For in times like these, even Keynes must sit in quarantine,"" the economists said, referring to British economist John Maynard Keynes, who advocated government infrastructure spending to boost economies during unrest.
They recommended the following programs that need billions:
Distribution of cash and non-financial aid to the poor - An increase in payments to poor households already identified in the conditional cash transfer program must be done. (READ: 'Pantawid quarantine': Duterte gov't eyes release of P8,000 each for millions)
The government must act quickly in identifying new households that have been thrust into poverty by the pandemic so that the cash can be distributed to them too.
Food and non-food vouchers should be distributed to poor communities to be claimed at any supermarket or grocery. (READ: Businesses raise P1.5 billion to feed the poor during coronavirus lockdown)
Special attention must be paid to the nutritional needs of young children, as the current conditions may affect their physical and mental development.
Financial relief -A moratorium on foreclosures and utility payments during the quarantine period is needed, especially for households earning below a certain income threshold. (WATCH: 'No work, no pay' workers grind despite traffic, coronavirus threat)
These payments can be collected at a later date at 0% interest, and over an extended period.
Rolled over credit card debt should not incur any interest if the credit limit is below a certain amount.
Individuals should be allowed to withdraw contributions from the Social Security System, Government Service Insurance System, and Pag-IBIG up to P50,000 to be repaid over an extended period at 0% interest.
Companies should give workers their salary in full for the first two weeks of the pandemic, and then 80% of their pay thereafter.
Government can then provide subsidies to affected workers, including those whose wages are paid on a daily basis.
Sick leaves - Paid sick leaves should be extended to a minimum of 14 days for the duration of the crisis, with government covering 80% of the salary for the first 7 days and 100% thereafter.
Employees should work from home as much as possible.
Janitors and other support services of government agencies must be given their salary even if they do not report for work.
Loans for small businesses - The government should provide emergency loans to small and medium enterprises to incentivize them to retain their workforce.
The loans can be channeled through existing financial institutions with the support of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas.
The following are their other policy recommendations:
Mass testing - More people must be tested for COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, with priority given to those at the highest risk and showing symptoms. (READ: Filipino scientists call on government to conduct mass testing for coronavirus)
The national government should anticipate the spread of the virus and allocate funds to provincial hospitals.
Relaxing rules on medical equipment and workers - Tariffs and non-tariff barriers that apply to personal protective equipment and other medical equipment to fight the pandemic should be suspended immediately.
Occupational licensing restrictions should be relaxed to allow nursing and medical students close to finishing their degree to assist in the efforts to combat the disease.
Preparing for hotel takeover - The national and local governments must stand ready to take over hotels, motels, and other accommodation services to use their beds should the health crisis require it. (READ: Vico Sotto readies Dahlia Hotel in Pasig as quarantine facility)
The military should be ready to build temporary treatment facilities to provide medical assistance through their trained medical personnel and engineers.
Securing supply chains - The necessary processes, including travel and production, for food and essential non-food items like water, electricity, medicine, packaging materials, soap, and disinfectants must be secured. (READ: Meat shortage looms in April if checkpoint issues persist)
For agriculture, the government must provide support to farmers, either through input subsidies or access to markets, so that they will continue to produce during this critical time.
When shortfalls become inevitable, the government should be ready to import more or incentivize the private sector to do the same.
Public transportation - The economists recommended that public transportation along arterial roads be made available, but with enhanced enforcement of physical distancing to the extent possible.
""Local governments, which have superior local knowledge, should be given the flexibility to manage their transportation requirements within reasonable bounds.""
Compassionate containment - There must be strong coordination between the Metro Manila Council and neighboring spillover cities and municipalities for a coherent, comprehensive, and compassionate containment plan.
This ensures supply chains will not be disrupted, contract tracing will be more efficient, transboundary movement of workers will not be blocked, and information will be shared seamlessly.

MANILA, Philippines – The novel coronavirus has forced the Philippines' capital region to come to a halt.
Amid a lockdown, authorities are scrambling to prevent the spread of the virus. One of the cities which has been actively responding is Manila.
Manila Mayor Isko Moreno first saw the gravity of the pandemic when he visited London in the first week of March. At that time, the United Kingdom had already recorded almost 400 coronavirus cases.
After Moreno returned to the Philippines, he went on self-quarantine. But he did not stop working.
Since then, Manila has become one of the first cities to pass a curfew ordinance, and the only city in Metro Manila which has built an infectious disease control center on short notice.
According to Moreno, ""they are managing,"" while also ""preparing for the worst.""
What have they done so far and how are they preparing for a potential massive outbreak that could further strain the health care system?
Watch Moreno answer these questions in an interview with Rappler reporter Rambo Talabong at 9 am on Monday, March 23. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – The country's top 20 business groups raised over P1.5 billion to feed urban poor residents in Metro Manila amid the lockdown triggered by the novel coronavirus pandemic.
In a statement on Sunday, March 22, Project Ugnayan, which is a collaboration of business groups and the Philippine Disaster Resilience Foundation, said the funds would be used to distribute P1,000 gift certificates to over one million households affected by the lockdown.
""In compliance with social distancing guidelines, gift certificates delivered door-to-door will be redeemable for food items from accessible groceries and supermarkets,"" the group said.
They tapped Caritas Manila's Project Damayan and ABS-CBN's Pantawid ng Pag-ibig for the door-to-door distribution of the grocery vouchers.
Distribution is ongoing in 4 pilot areas and will scale up in cooperation with project partners.

MANILA, Philippines – The Bureau of Immigration (BI) on Sunday, March 22, appealed for help for its personnel in the face of the novel coronavirus pandemic.
Immigration Commissioner Jaime Morente said the bureau's staff need donations of masks, gloves, and alcohol, adding that these supplies are vital for frontline personnel manning airports and seaports across the Philippines.
The Ninoy Aquino International Airport alone has at least 800 personnel, who would each need two masks per day.
While they have received donations, the supplies are already slowly diminishing.
""We are sourcing masks, alcohol, and other PPEs (personal protective equipment), but we are honestly finding it hard to procure these as there is a worldwide lack of supply,"" Morente said.
Justice Undersecretary Markk Perete said they have been coordinating with manufacturers to include the BI for priority delivery once supplies become available.
Even health workers, who are among the most vulnerable, are experiencing a shortage of PPE and other medical supplies. (READ: How to help healthcare workers, frontliners during coronavirus pandemic)
Doctors, nurses, and other staff have expressed fear and uncertainty regarding their safety. Immigration personnel are no different.
BI Port Operations Division chief Grifton Medina said some of the bureau's frontline personnel worry they might get infected, adding that this is understandable as they are the ones who interact with arriving passengers.
""Our men have resorted to using makeshift or reusable face masks to protect themselves,"" he said.

CONSULTATIVE MEETING. Presidential Assistant for the Visayas Michael Dino meets with community members in the Eastern Visayas. File photo from OPAV    
Does an appointed official have the authority to order elective officials?
Some think so. In a memorandum released Saturday, March 22, the office of Secretary Michael Dino, the Presidential Assistant for the Visayas, released a memorandum ""ordering"" local government units (LGUs) in the island group to pass an ordinance that would impose a 24-hour ""curfew"" for students and senior citizens to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus.
 
 
The memorandum, which outlined the importance of subjecting to quarantine senior citizens 65 years old and above, ""ordered"" LGUs in the Visayas to execute their respective ordinances.   
After all, it is this age group that's more susceptible to the coronavirus. On March 18, Cebu province reported its first novel coronavirus case – a 65-year-old patient who was already recovering. Nationwide, there are a total of 380 confirmed cases as of Sunday, March 22. (READ: Cebu province reports first coronavirus case)
Dino's memo came out after Cebu Governor Gwendolyn Garcia placed the elderly and students under a 24-hour ""curfew,"" or indefinite home confinement. (READ: Cebu province orders 24-hour home quarantine for students, elderly)
Garcia – like most local executives in Cebu – is allied with Dino himself, President Rodrigo Duterte's appointee in the Visayas region.
Item 6 of the memo read: ""In line with the foregoing guidelines all LGUs are hereby ordered to execute their respective ordinances, the effectivity of which should be no later than 22 March 2020 at 3 pm.""   
 ""The PNP and AFP to render full assistance to LGUs in the implementation of the respective ordinances in relation to the foregoing advisory,"" it further said. The memo ended with the phrase ""for strict compliance.""    
But can Dino, a mere appointed official ""order"" LGUs –  run by elected officials – to comply with directives via a memorandum? It would be no different from say, the head of the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority, ordering around the mayors of the metro.
Law professor and former Supreme Court spokesperson Theodore Te said a ""non-elective official"" does not have the jurisdiction nor the power to do so.
""Unelected Presidential Assistants cannot issue an 'advisory,' then use the word 'order,' impose a 24-hour curfew, command PNP and AFP, and then say the guidelines are for compliance until they are withdrawn,"" Te tweeted.

Unelected Presidential Assistants cannot issue an “Advisory”, then use the word “order”, impose a 24 hour curfew, command PNP and AFP, and then say the guidelines are for compliance until they are withdrawn. #VoidOnSoManyLevels
— Theodore Te (@TedTe) March 21, 2020
Dino's memo certainly raised not a few eyebrows. Even DILG Undersecretary Jonathan Malaya said in a text message to Rappler: ""Only the ES (executive secretary) or the SILG (secretary of interior and local government) as alter ego of the President on local government matters has the legal authority to direct or enjoin LGUs."" 
After a wave of criticism on Facebook, Dino's office was compelled to issue a clarification.
""Please be informed that LGUs are encouraged and enjoined to execute their respective community quarantine to curb the spread of COVID-19,"" Dino's office said, careful this time around to use ""encouraged and enjoined"" instead of ""orders.""
""[This is] all in line with national government policies and the aforementioned advisory on the imposition of a 24-hour curfew for [those] 65 year old and up, and students.""
Following the clarification, the memorandum was also taken down from Dino's official Facebook page.

Other memes reacted to how President Rodrigo Duterte is handling the coronavirus outbreak, evidently prioritizing military measures instead of health-oriented solutions. 
In a petition released Friday, March 20, the group Scientists Unite Against COVID-19 called on the national government to start mass testing for coronavirus. This call was echoed by an online petition on Change.Org calling for urgent action, including mandatory mass testing nationwide, to address the outbreak. 
Instead of ordering mass testing, President Rodrigo Duterte will be asking Congress to declare a “national emergency” and grant him emergency powers “necessary” to address the growing number of novel coronavirus cases in the Philippines.

MANILA, Philippines – Another PBA MVP award for Arwind Santos? Why not. 
Santos bared he does not discount the possibility of winning the highest individual honor as the MVP plum suddenly became up for grabs following the absence of San Miguel teammate June Mar Fajardo. 
The outspoken forward captured the coveted award in 2013 before Fajardo strung up 6 straight MVP wins – a run that is expected to stretch for years to come if not for his potential season-ending shin injury. 
""[L]ike my family told me, 'Why don't you target it? Maybe there's a chance.' Like they said, I was the last player to win MVP before June Mar so I should try it,"" Santos said in a mix of Filipino and English. 
""At least, I'm being motivated and it becomes positive for me."" 
Although already one of the oldest players in the league at 38, Santos displayed he still has plenty of gas left in the tank as he showed the way in their season-opening 94-78 victory over Magnolia. 
Santos churned out 18 points, 15 rebounds, 5 steals, and 3 assists – a performance reminiscent of his old MVP form. 
""I can take it as challenge so I can push myself,"" Santos said of winning his second MVP award. 
""Even if I don't get it, at least I'll be able to contribute to the team so it becomes positive,"" he added. 
Their campaign, though, was abruptly halted as the PBA suspended its season indefinitely due to the coronavirus crisis in the country.
PBA commissioner Willie Marcial said the hiatus might last for at least two months, depending on how the coronavirus situation turns out in the future. 
But as soon as the season resumes, Santos said San Miguel will be eyeing a top two finish, which merits a twice-to-beat bonus in the playoffs. 
""We know that we may fall short in the end so while we're still fresh, we need to win consecutive,"" he said. – Rappler.com "

,"March 22, 2020",nCov,Hell on earth: The agonizing confusion over coronavirus testing in PH,Mara Cepeda,"
MANILA, Philippines – Billie* sat alone in a white isolation tent of a small public hospital in Quezon City. It was hot and humid inside, not a single electric fan to keep the summer heat down. It was the 17th of March, a day after Billie learned someone she had gotten in contact with tested positive for the novel coronavirus.
She remembers speaking to that colleague face-to-face on March 11, but he would inform the office about his positive results only 5 days later on March 16. He made no mention to anyone at work that he was already experiencing symptoms and that he had gotten himself tested for COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus. 
Between March 11 to March 16, Billie started having a dry, scratchy throat. She suffered a headache for two days straight. Later on, she felt her lymph nodes getting swollen. Her throat would ache several times a day. 
These, according to the Department of Health (DOH), are among the symptoms of COVID-19. 
Billie decided to have herself checked after she confirmed she had direct exposure to a positive case. But because the entire island of Luzon was already on lockdown due to the outbreak, she could not commute. She didn't want to ask her father to drive her to the hospital either, out of fear she would infect him.
Billie started walking. 
She arrived at the hospital 40 minutes later. She was told to stay inside the isolation tent, and waited for 4 hours before a nurse donning protective gear from head to foot started getting her vital signs. The nurse took her specimens.
“Kukuhaan ka sa throat mo. Medyo maduduwal ka ‘pag ‘di mo kaya, kasi malalim talaga ang pagkukunan nila. Tapos lagpas sa bridge ng nose kukuhaan ka din so parang mag-si-sneeze ka after i-swab,” Bille said, describing the uncomfortable experience. 
(They’ll take a specimen from your throat. You'll end up retching if you can't take it because they’re going to take the sample from deep within your throat. They’ll also take a swab from inside your nose, higher than the bridge, so you'll feel like sneezing right after too.) 
STILL UNDER VALIDATION. A sample of the coronavirus test kit developed by scientists from the UP-NIH is presented to the media on March 12, 2020. Photo by Darren Langit/Rappler  
Billie was classified as a person under investigation (PUI) for COVID-19.
By the time the swabs were taken from her, it was already 6:30 pm. Billie knows from reading the news that the DOH had said COVID-19 test results normally take 24 to 48 hours to be released. She asked when her results would come. At least a week, the nurse said. Billie could only purse her lips. 
“‘Di daw sila makakapangako na agad makukuha ko ang result kasi even my case, mild symptoms lang ako. Siyempre i-pa-prioritize ‘yong severe and critical,” Billie said. “Naiintindihan ko naman, pero nakaka-add sa anxiety bilang isang tao na na-expose sa COVID-19.”
(They told me they couldn’t promise I would get my results immediately because my case is just mild. Of course they have to prioritize the severe and critical. I understand, but it just adds to the anxiety of a person like me who was already exposed to COVID-19.)
Billie is not alone. All over the Philippines, people are waiting in agony to learn if they really do have the deadly, fast-spreading disease. Many individuals already showing symptoms are being turned down by cramped hospitals struggling with lack of space and dwindling supplies. Worse, others die long before they could even confirm it was COVID-19 that had killed them.  
Left with no choice 
The situation isn’t any better in private hospitals. 
Michael* has been camped outside the emergency room driveway of a private medical facility in Pasig since March 19. He had to rush his 56-year-old father Ernesto* there after he started having difficulty breathing. 
Ernesto was also having on-and-off fever for over two weeks now, and eventually developed pneumonia. Ernesto is hypertensive, making his severe COVID-19 symptoms even more worrisome for his family.
Michael does not know yet if his father has the coronavirus. On March 16, Michael brought him to a clinic in Cainta because his father’s symptoms weren’t improving. A blood test and X-ray were done, after which they were sent home. Still, Michael said the clinic got in touch with the DOH to inform them about his father’s condition.
Two days later on March 18, a DOH team came knocking at their house and took swabs from Ernesto. Michael was told his father’s COVID-19 test results wouldn’t come until 3 to 5 days later.  
The next day on March 19, Ernesto couldn’t breathe properly anymore. Michael called medical facilities around Metro Manila asking if they would take in his father. They said no. Finally, the hospital in Pasig said yes. 
“He’s in a more stable condition now and we’re just waiting for a room in the ICU,” Michael told Rappler. “But getting to this point was hell on earth.”

It was pure chaos when father and son arrived. Michael recalled seeing people flocking to the hospital and trying to get themselves or their relatives tested. Doctors and nurses were scrambling for rooms. Most of the patients Michael saw being admitted were in their 50s – the age range of most of the 307 patients in the country who have tested positive for COVID-19 as of noon of March 21.
Ernesto was first moved to the hospital’s center dedicated for patients suspected of having COVID-19. On March 20, he was moved to a smaller isolation room, but it was still far from ideal as he was sharing the space with 3 other high-risk patients. 
But Michael knew the hospital had no other choice. 
“I’m so scared for people without the resources. I’m so fortunate that I have a health card, easy access to an ambulance, and I’m capable of paying bills in this hospital,"" Michael said. “I’m having a hard time as a privileged person. What more people without the help?” 
Disregarded triage for testing?
That the Philippines has a shortage of test kits is a tragedy felt across provinces. Many local government units outside Metro Manila are forced to battle COVID-19 without determining just how many of their people actually have the disease.
For the longest time, the Philippines had only the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) to test COVID-19 samples. Now there are 4 other subnational laboratories duly accredited by the World Health Organization (WHO), but they are not yet on full capacity. 
These are the Baguio General Hospital and Medical Center in Baguio City, San Lazaro Hospital in Manila City, Southern Philippines Medical Center in Davao City, and Vicente Sotto Memorial Medical Center in Cebu City.
The country is also mostly relying on donations from the WHO, as well as local and foreign bodies for additional test kits. This is compounded by the growing demand for coronavirus extraction kits around the globe, where at least 161 countries have recorded over 246,400 cases of COVID-19.

This is precisely the reason why the DOH updated its decision tool for testing on March 16 – to help ensure the more vulnerable of the population get to be tested first given the severe shortage of test kits. This decision tool guides healthcare workers in categorizing a patient as either a person under monitoring or investigation, or neither. (READ: Coronavirus mass testing not needed for now – DOH) 
Only PUIs showing severe symptoms and who have been exposed to a positive case or have traveled to a country with local transmission are supposed to be the first in line for testing. The elderly, pregnant women, and individuals with underlying medical conditions already showing symptoms – even if these are just mild to moderate – are to be prioritized, too. 
Persons under monitoring (PUMs) – people who exhibit no symptoms but either have history of travel or known exposure to a coronavirus patient – are not supposed to be tested yet. Rather, they are required to self-monitor while undergoing a 14-day home quarantine.  
Yet it's now clear the DOH decision tool is not being followed at all. One only needs to look at President Rodrigo Duterte’s family to confirm this. Swabs were taken at their homes in Davao City on March 17 even as people across the country have been denied testing because they do not meet the criteria. 
9-hour wait for a test that did not come
John* even experienced being downgraded from being a PUI to a PUM in a span of just 9 hours. 
A resident of Quezon City, where he works as an academic in a university, his job required him to spend a few days in February traveling around Malaysia and India to attend a conference. He returned to the Philippines on February 26, but his cough and cold came only about two weeks later on March 10.
He first went to a clinic but was told to proceed to a hospital already. Because he had a health card, John went straight to a private hospital at around 3 pm. He couldn’t enter the main hospital building and was told to stay at the waiting area outside the ER driveway, where a nurse and doctor interviewed him about his condition. 
John was told he was already a PUI given his symptoms and travel history. The doctor told him he would have to undergo both a blood test and a COVID-19 test. 
He was then moved to the emergency triage area for respiratory illnesses, a small, air-conditioned room not far from the ER. His blood test came back. The doctor said it ""did not turn up any urgent concerns.” He was told to wait a bit longer for his COVID-19 test swab. 
Hours went by until John was informed he had two options: he could either go home and undergo self-quarantine or just wait until the hospital gets the go-signal to take his swabs. The hospital staff was coordinating with RITM to determine if John really needed to be tested.

Another hour passed, another update from the doctor: John needed to be confined so he could get tested. He agreed; his health card would pay for it anyway. 
He was once again moved to a smaller ward labeled “Suspect Infectious Room.” John’s sister came to the hospital to help him process his confinement papers while he stayed in the isolation room.
Nearing midnight on March 19 – after 9 hours of waiting – a doctor entered the isolation room and told John he couldn't be tested after all.
“The reason relayed was that the countries I traveled to, India and Malaysia, weren’t high up anyway in the list of countries with cases. And that my symptoms weren’t very severe. I mean it’s cough and a cold,” John said.  
He asked the doctor if he was still a PUI. No, said the doctor. You’re just a PUM now.  
There was a tone of disappointment in John’s voice when Rappler spoke to him on the phone. “So that was a whole ordeal really of uncertainty and just confusion. We were astounded by the slowness of it all,” John said. “Why did it have to take several hours for them to make a determination whether I should be tested or not?”
The agony of waiting

The stories of Billie, Michael, Ernesto, and John are happening all over the country. They know there are qualifications they have to meet before getting tested, but the government does not inform them the whole process would take hours and hours. 
There are inconsistencies in how the DOH decision tool is being implemented. Billie got tested in a hospital even with just mild symptoms, while Ernesto – who already had pneumonia and difficulty breathing – had swabs taken right at home. John was classified as a PUI, only to be told hours later that he could not be prioritized for testing. 
There's a general feeling of confusion as even medical professionals – who are already overworked and are in dire need of supplies and protection – scramble to follow the health department's decision tool for testing.
The sad truth is this: the Philippine government was unable to anticipate an outbreak of this scale. But there are ongoing efforts to augment the country's testing capacity. 
When asked in a March 20 press conference why it is taking more than a week for COVID-19 test results to come out for many Filipinos, DOH Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire had to come clean.""So 'yon pong nababalita na medyo may delay, totoo po iyon (So those reports that there are some delays, those are true). We are being challenged right now,"" Vergeire admitted.  
DOH Secretary Francisco Duque III also said the delay in the release of results was due to RITM having to reconfigure its laboratory to ensure biohazard safety standards are still met despite the increasing number of specimens it needs to process.
There are assurances from DOH that testing capacity will improve in the coming days. Vergeire said the 5 subnational laboratories have the capacity to process 950 to 1,000 tests per day now, the bulk of which still comes from RITM. 
Two more subnational laboratories are being eyed to eventually become extension testing centers for COVID-19: the Western Visayas Medical Center in Iloilo City and the Bicol Public Health Laboratory.
The DOH is mobilizing the laboratory of the University of the Philippines-National Institutes for Health, which developed its own testing kit, to help improve the government's testing capacity. The Food and Drug Administration has also approved 4 novel coronavirus test kit products for commercial use, though these can only be purchased by hospitals and laboratories with testing capacity.
But the DOH has not disclosed just how much backlog these laboratories have. Whether the country has enough medical technicians skilled to interpret these COVID-19 samples is also an unanswered question.
Back on the streets, the already anxious are left with not much choice but to wait. They can only hope their test results – when they do finally arrive – would come back negative.  
“Na-prolong ‘yong agony ko. ‘Di ko alam if positive ba 'ko o hindi,” Billie said with a sigh. “Tinanggap ko na lang ‘yong sitwasyon.” (My agony is being prolonged. I don’t know if I’m positive or not. I just accepted the situation.)

MANILA, Philippines – Overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) returning to the Philippines will be allowed to seek accommodation in hotels and similar establishments, Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles said on Sunday, March 22. 
Nograles made the announcement in a bulletin aired on the People's Television Network, where he said that the government's coronavirus task force has amended guidelines on the Luzon lockdown to allow accommodation for distressed OFWs returning to the country.
This means they are now included among individuals allowed to stay in hotels. Nograles earlier said hotels and other hospitality businesses may only operate during the lockdown if: 

They have guests who booked their stay on or before March 17.
They have guests who have existing long-term leases.
They are housing employees of establishments exempted from the lockdown. 

How it will work: The Overseas Workers Welfare Administration will issue certifications to concerned OFWs, which would allow them to be housed in hotels after returning to the Philippines. 
This will be done in coordination with the Department of Foreign Affairs, Department of Tourism, and Department of Health.  
Why this matters: While government officials have put in place a Luzon-wide lockdown to prevent the further spread of the novel coronavirus, OFWs are still allowed to return to the country and to leave for work abroad. 
Repatriation efforts to bring home OFWs likewise continue despite the coronavirus outbreak. These workers may not be able to go to their residence right away if they live outside Luzon, so they will need a place to stay in during the lockdown.
The Philippines has confirmed at least 380 coronavirus cases as of Sunday afternoon, with 25 deaths and 17 recoveries.
The global death toll due to the disease has surpassed 13,000, while over 300,000 people have been infected across 169 countries. – Rappler.com "

PAMPANGA, Philippines – The Angeles City government assured its residents that the city remains “COVID-19- free” after a patient confined at the Rafael Lazatin Memorial Medical Center (RLMMC) and classified as a “person under investigation” (PUI) passed away on Saturday, March 21.
A photo supposedly showing a casket with the patient’s body being taken out of the RLMMC’s COVID-19 isolation room was posted on Facebook and circulated, sowing fear among Angeles residents.
In a statement released also on Saturday night, Mayor Carmelo “Pogi” Lazatin, Jr. said that Angeles City remains Covid-19 free.
The statement said that the 64-year-old male patient from Barangay Anunas died of “Acute Respiratory Failure secondary to Multiple Drug Resistant Tuberculosis” and not COVID-19, the disease brought by the novel coronavirus.
“We have the patient’s record. Since he [was] suffering from TB, he [had] the same symptoms of a person under investigation (PUI) of COVID 19. That [was] why we put him in isolation,” Dr. Froilan Canlas, officer-in-charge of the city hospital said.
Canlas said that the patient “was in RLMMC’s isolation room for six hours before he succumbed to death.”
Canlas said that the city hospital staff had to put the patient in the isolation room intended for COVID-19 patients because he was considered as a PUI after exhibiting symptoms similar to a coronavirus infection. (READ: When should you get tested for coronavirus?)
“Kahit PUI lang siya, kailangan sundin natin ang guidelines ng Department of Health,” he explained. (Even if he was only a PUI, we have to follow the guidelines from the Department of Health.)
Canlas said that they also had to put the patient’s body inside a sealed plastic bag and that no embalming must be done.
Lazatin appealed to business establishments that are not exempted under the Luzon-wide enhanced community quarantine to close shop and help limit the residents’ movement.
“Until now, may mga laundry shops na matitigas ang ulo at mga furniture shops (Until now, there are laundry shops and furniture shops who refuse to follow). I ordered the Business Permit and Licensing Division to revoke their business permits,” the mayor said.

SPECIAL POWERS. President RodrigoDuterte presides over a meeting with the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases on March 16, 2020. Malacañang photo 
MANILA, Philippines – President Rodrigo Duterte is asking Congress to declare a “national emergency” and grant him emergency powers “necessary” to address the growing number of novel coronavirus cases in the Philippines. 
In a document seen by Rappler, Duterte signed on Saturday, March 21, Proclamation No. 933 calling on Congress to hold a special session on Monday, March 23, to pass a bill for this purpose.  
Malacañang certified the need to immediately enact a bill that would declare a national emergency and give Duterte powers to “temporarily take over or direct the operation” of privately-owned utilities or businesses needed to address public needs during the coronavirus emergency, among others.  
Among others, the pertinent provisions included in the proposed bill give Duterte the power to “reprogram, reallocate, and realign” funds in the 2022 budget and reallocate savings in the executive department, including government owned and controlled corporations (GOCCs).
What’s the basis? A letter to Senate President Vicente Sotto III signed by Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea cites Section 15, Article VI of the Constitution, which allows the President to call for a special session “at any time.”  
Why is it needed? The proposed bill cites the declaration of a national emergency is needed to minimize the further spread of the coronavirus and immediately mobilize assistance and provide basic  necessities to families affected by the Luzon lockdown.
It also cites the need to immediately provide healthcare such as testing and treatment to patients with COVID-19 and those suspected of having the disease. 
Aside from this, the proposed measure said it was also ""imperative to grant Duterte ""emergency powers subject to such limitations"" to address the coronavirus outbreak in the Philippines.
What else does the bill propose? The still unnumbered Senate bill forwarded by Malacañang to Sotto cites the need to declare a national emergency as the increasing number of coronavirus cases, despite government intervention, rises to “an emergency of national proportions.” 
The bill, if passed in its form, will grant Duterte 18 powers based on Section 23 (2), Article VI of the Constitution. This provision allows Congress ""in times of war or other national emergency"" to pass a law authorizing the President to exercise powers necessary to address the objectives of the proposed bill. 
Powers to be granted to Duterte include allowing him to “temporarily take over or direct the operation” of privately-owned businesses needed to address the needs of the public during the coronavirus emergency such as hotels, public transportation, and telecommunication.  
The businesses the bill cited are needed to house health workers and serve as quarantine areas and medical facilities. Meanwhile, transportation was needed to service health workers and telecommunications to ensure “uninterrupted communication channels between the government and the public.” 
In this scenario, management will still be retained by owners of the said business, though they will be under the direction of the President or a designated representative.  
It will be up to the President to determine when the takeover is no longer needed.  
While Section 17, Article XII allows for such a takeover, this was not cited as basis for such in the proposed bill.  
Meanwhile, other authorized powers in the proposed bill include the authority to allow Duterte to do the following:  

Minimize the spread of the coronavirus
Authorize testing of suspected patients
Ensure local government units (LGUs) follow protocols listed by the national government
Adopt measures to prevent hoarding, profiteering, price manipulation, and other practices that would affect the supply of food and other goods
Undertake “in the most expeditious manner” procurement of goods such a personal protective equipment, testing kits, and other medical supplies; utilities, telecommunications, and other services needed to operate quarantine centers, leasing of property to house workers; establishment of medical facilities 
Lower lending rates of interest and reserve requirements of lending institutions 
Liberalize grants for incentives of manufacture or importation of supplies needed to address the coronavirus outbreak
Require businesses to accept and prioritize contracts for services needed to address the outbreak 
Regulate and limits the operation of transportation in both public and private road, rail, aviation, and maritime sectors 
Regulate traffic of all roads, streets, bridges; prohibit putting up of road obstacles 
Continue authorizing alternative work arrangements for government employees in executive branch 
Conserve and regulate the distribution of power, fuel, energy, water 
Realign and reprogram government funds 
Direct LGUs and GOCCs to “revisit their annual budgets and reprogram their priorities in accordance with existing laws” and rules to address the coronavirus outbreak 
“Undertake such other measures as may be reasonable and necessary” to address the outbreak  

Done deal? While the bill asks broad powers be given to Duterte, it still has to pass the scrutiny of Congress before it is approved. 
In a text message to reporters, Sotto said controversial provisions such as those allowing Duterte to take over private businesses “won’t fly in the Senate.” 
“The main proposal of the bill is to distribute cash to the 16.5 million families badly needing help,” he said. 
Sotto shunned the notion that special powers, if granted to Duterte, would be equivalent to emergency powers, saying Congress leaders and Malacañang “agreed” that it was not the case in a special meeting held Saturday.  
“Absolutely wrong (to say it is emergency powers) because that was precisely my point in the meeting yesterday that this is not an emergency powers bill. We agreed that it is not,” Sotto said. 
If passed, the declaration of a national emergency will last for two months “or longer if the calamity persists.” It may also be lifted sooner than two months by means of a Presidential Proclamation or concurrent Congress resolution. 
The Philippines has counted at least 380 confirmed coronavirus cases as of Saturday night, March 21. The new total confirmed cases is 150 more than the health department’s tally on Friday, March 20.  
The confirmed cases include 25 deaths and 15 recoveries.

MANILA, Philippines – The Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) ordered all local government units (LGUs) in the region to track and monitor 215 Filipinos who attended a tabligh event or religious gathering in Malaysia where some have tested positive for the coronavirus.
In a memo advisory on Saturday, March 21, the BARMM Ministry of the Interior and Local Government (MILG) directed all provincial governors, city and town mayors, punong barangays or village chiefs, and other local officials in the region to ""expedite tracking these attendees, determine their health status, and report immediately"" to the regional task force handling COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.
Minister Naguib Sinarimbo signed the memo advisory.
The MILG also ordered punong barangays through their barangay health emergency response teams to ramp up contact tracing and monitoring the tabligh attendees, who are now considered persons under monitoring (PUMs). 
""They shall ensure that they will report immediately to the higher LGUs [about] any identified persons who were in attendance"" at the gathering, it added. 
The National Commission on Muslim Filipinos reported that there were 215 Filipinos who joined the Itjima congregation at the tabligh gathering in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.
The 4-day gathering, attended by up to 16,000 Muslims, ran from February 27 to March 1. Reuters reported on Saturday that the tabligh ""has been linked to 714 COVID-19 cases"" in Malaysia, ""and at least 840 across Southeast Asia.""
One person who attended the tabligh had been probed for the coronavirus, but died last Tuesday, March 17, in Marawi City in Lanao del Sur while awaiting the test result. He was positive for COVID-19, reported ABS-CBN News.
Already, Lanao del Sur and many areas in Mindanao have declared lockdowns, imposed curfews and community quarantines, or declared a state of calamity.
Nationwide, as of writing, 380 coronavirus cases have been confirmed in the Philippines. A total of 25 deaths have been reported, while 17 cases have recovered. – Rappler.com "

RECOVERED. Carlo Llanes Navarro poses for a family picture with his wife Evie Medina and daughter Gia Navarro. Photo from Carlo's Facebook profile 
Rappler is republishing this with permission from Carlo Llanes Navarro, PH4 who recovered from COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.
My Covid19 experience - March 5, 2020
I was COVID-19 patient no. 4. As patient no. 4, I was the first Filipino to be confirmed positive after a lull of more than a month following the three Chinese travelers from Wuhan.
Where did I get it? We have our suspicions.
We knew we were taking a risk by travelling to Japan. At that time, Japan was not yet battling with community transmission. There were no rules yet on quarantine for returning passengers.
In Tokyo, we thought we were making-up for the risk by always wearing our masks, vigorously washing and rubbing our hands with alcohol and Thieves essential oil, and wearing disposable latex gloves which we regularly changed and threw away throughout our five days there.
We took our flight back home on February 25, Tuesday.
Gia and Evie sat together in one row and I in another. Behind me was a Filipino man coughing vigorously. Nothing could be done and we sat in that plane for more than 4 hours. We had our masks on the whole time. We suspect this is where I picked-up the virus.
Seven days later, on March 3, I came down with chills and a low-grade fever (sinat) of 37.7 C.
Days before symptoms appeared, I did not report to work. That night of March 3, I decided to play it safe and that I be immediately tested. St. Luke’s hospital did not see the need to test me. The hospital said my symptoms were mild, and Japan is not a Covid-19 hotspot.
I insisted. I had to insist! I was tested. I was discharged. I went home in BGC.
At this time, Evie was in Lipa and she instructed Gia and our helper to stay in Evie’s mom’s nearby place in BGC to isolate.
On March 5, Thursday, I had no more fever, but felt muscle pains and had a bad cough. I received the frightening call from the DOH that evening. I was promptly whisked away by an ambulance to RITM in Alabang.
Gia was frantic and started calling Evie in Lipa. The next day, my entire household had themselves tested - our drivers included.
At this point, while in RITM, I prayed fervently to spare all of them. My mind was raising with scenarios that Evie and Gia wouldn't survive in RITM. All their tests came back negative. Thank God! All I need now is to worry about myself.
It is easy to take the symptoms for granted. A cough. Sore throat. Muscle pains. One need not have a high fever to be Covid-19 positive. Looking at the DOH spreadsheet, one can even be totally asymptomatic.
The DOH Spreadsheet reveals that there are those who have had symptoms since February and early March who were only now tested and confined. This means that unbeknownst to them, the virus was spreading inadvertently by their non-quarantine and late testing.
For two weeks in the hospital, it was not the physical pain that is frightening! It was the psychological effect that made it difficult. I was vomiting endlessly and had diarrhea probably due to stress.
While in confinement, I learned so many things which is probably why God put me to that test!
I realized that ignorance and inaction will cause the virus to spread faster. That should anyone experience ANY symptoms, they should stay home and limit contact with others. They should NOT shrug-off any symptoms and downplay them. This community quarantine is something we need to protect the people that we love.
To my family, I was brave. I did not choose to get sick. But as soon as I did, I immediately had myself tested. I allowed myself quarantined in a hospital deprived of staff and funds. I was not in the most comfortable situation.
Because I got myself quickly tested, by my immediate confinement, I shielded my elderly parents. I shielded our senior household helpers. I shielded my family.
When people are NOT tested, they can walk around and socialize thinking they just have a cold or slight malaise.
Because I disclosed being infected to my workplace according to company protocol, all my contacts were tested by the Department of Health and quarantined. The DOH advised me that so far, my contacts have been cleared and are asymptomatic. For this, I am grateful.
We are still covering everyone and ourselves with prayer. So, God protect and bless us all.
In the two weeks I was in a hospital, I learned that there were many people who cannot afford a lockdown. They do not have food to survive! Our society has not given the proper dignity to our labor - depressed wages, poor working conditions.
I immediately took care of this when I was discharged from the hospital! I made sure that all the hands that feed us and help us will be financially capable to handle issues like this in the future!
I learned about the extraordinary love of my wife and daughter. Evie and her cousin, Annette, looked for people in the government that could help me while in RITM. Evie, together with her sister, Gela, tirelessly looked for a hospital that will take me in. Each and every one was refusing to take me in. I was desperate because the pneumonia that I acquired was from the hospital. I was coughing profusely, and chills were getting worse by the day. She kept me company for hours and days to keep me psychologically and emotionally sane! She prayed with me profusely! She called on people to pray for me. I knew I married right!
One day I heard a nurse say that there was an old man who tested positive and was waiting for a room in RITM. I cannot stay there anymore! And finally, God intervened. A hospital agreed to take me!
On day 15, I was discharged from the hospital with no symptoms! I never knew my test results and perhaps will never know. I know those doctors are busy with more severe and critical cases.
Today, I am thankful for the prayers and well wishes of friends and family! I may not have responded to you at my darkest hours, but I will remember and will be forever grateful for you.
God bless us all and keep safe!

ISOLATION. Quezon City General Hospital health workers prepare the isolation tent for person under investigation with suspected CONVID-19, amid the rise of cases of the virus in the country on Tuesday, March 10, 2020. Photo by Darren Langit/Rappler 
MANILA, Philippines – As hospitals across Metro Manila are stretched to their limits, coronavirus-positive patients have been told to stay home.
In an interview with Rappler on Sunday, March 22, Quezon City Mayor Joy Belmonte said at least 3 Quezon City residents who have tested positive for the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) were asked by hospitals they turned to in different parts of Metro Manila to stay home.
“In the past, when you test positive, they pick you up, they take you in into a facility. But what happens now is that when you test positive, you're just told that you just go home and you self-quarantine,” Belmonte said.
It’s not just Quezon City: The practice of sending coronavirus patients home is not just in Quezon City. Reading from their record of patients, Belmonte noted that of the 3 patients who were sent home in their city, two of them sought admission from a hospital in Manila and another hospital in Taguig.
“I am not saying that Quezon City is the one doing it, it is all over the country,” Belmonte said.
She explained that it was not a matter of national policy, but a need for hospitals to improvise given the lack of resources and manpower.
It’s not just 3: The 3 patients, Belmonte added, are not the only coronavirus-positive patients in Quezon City who have been asked to go home. They are only among a greater number of patients who were sent home.
Belmonte explained that the 3 are just the ones Quezon City sees as needing added attention as they live in urban poor communities, making their families and neighbors more vulnerable. Asked for a total number of patients sent home, she said they were still preparing their list.
These other people include a doctor, Belmonte said, and other professionals who live in more spacious homes and could afford to self-isolate while keeping their distance from their families and communities.
All these people who are sent home, the mayor said, are patients who do not have “serious cases” of the disease.
The barangay’s help: In a memorandum issued by the Department of the Interior and Local Government in February, all barangays were told to set up isolation facilities for cases that need not immediately be admitted to hospitals for intense care.
But Belmonte said not all barangays have complied, and that their isolation facilities mostly can accommodate only one person.
“They have not had a time to partition. Ideally, they are separated there,” Belmonte noted.
What about the severe cases? Patients with severe cases, meanwhile, could not be taken in by local hospitals, because their medical staff have neither enough equipment, the proper training, nor the manpower for caring for patients in critical condition. Even national hospitals are already overwhelmed.
This results in the hospitals prioritizing critical patients and sending those who have milder symptoms home.
“Realistically [there is] no more space for them to be accommodated in all the national government hospitals and even in the local government hospitals, and therefore they are asked to go home with precautionary measures,” Belmonte said.
There is no extraction: Belmonte said the local government is not attempting to extract the 3 patients from their homes as they are not missing. Instead, they are enforcing their “extreme enhanced community quarantine” in their barangays.
This means that the houses of these coronavirus patients are tightly monitored by the government and Quezon City residents would not be allowed to come near.
Why does this matter? The problems of Quezon City, the biggest metropolis in Metro Manila, gives a dark snapshot at how the steep rise in cases is overwhelming hospitals, forcing frontliners to make high-stakes compromises like sending virus-positive people home. 
The situation in Quezon City echoes the problems faced by many cities across the globe from China to Italy where the coronavirus outbreak proved to be unbearable for their healthcare systems.
“In an ideal situation, all COVID positives should be in an institution, or institutionalized in a hospital, but the problem is that there's really a lack of bed spaces in all our hospitals now,” Belmonte said. – Rappler.com "
,"March 22, 2020",nCov,#MassTestingNow: Online petition calls for urgent action on PH coronavirus outbreak,Samantha Bagayas,"
 
MANILA, Philippines – As numbers of confirmed coronavirus cases continue to spike in the country, thousands of Filipinos are calling for urgent action, including mandatory mass testing nationwide, to address the outbreak.
In an online petition on Change.org, more than 78,000 Filipinos have signed the call led by a group named Mass Testing Now PH as of Sunday, March 22. The petition was created on March 16, a day before Luzon was placed on lockdown in a bid to contain the spread of the virus. 
The lockdown is among the series of stringent physical distancing measures that the Duterte administration has put in place to combat the virus.
But on the ground, local governments have been left to figure out how exactly these measures would be implemented, as guidelines on the lockdown continued to be relayed piecemeal. Among the crucial tasks given to local officials included finding ways to ensure residents were fed and essential workers were brought to their workplaces.
The petition – translated in English, Bisaya, and Filipino – called on President Rodigo Duterte to act on the coronavirus outbreak, listing several demands to help in implementation. (READ: Filipino scientists call on government to conduct mass testing for coronavirus) 
Among the demands listed in the petition are the implementation of free. mandatory mass testing nationwide and the mobilization of local government units to set up local testing centers.
As of Sunday, the Philippines has already reported 380 confirmed cases of coronavirus, with 25 fatalities – which experts think might be a far cry from the true picture due to the lack of testing. 
However, the Department of Health continues to maintain that there is no need to conduct mass testing for coronavirus in the country, despite advice from the World Health Organization to scale up efforts in Southeast Asia to stop the spread of infection.
Due to a shortage of test kits since the outbreak began, the DOH has been prioritizing testing for severe and critical COVID-19 cases. Just recently, more than 100,000 new test kits from China, South Korea, and Brunei have arrived in the Philippines to help enable health workers to test more people for the virus.
The petition also called on the administration to distribute free face masks, hand soaps, alcohol, drinking water rations, and vitamins in every barangay, as well as implement massive disinfection in high-traffic locations regularly.
 It also said the military and police can aid in the sending test kits and basic goods to areas.
Helping the vulnerable and the marginalized
Among those feeling the brunt of the coronavirus outbreak are the healthcare workers and frontliners, who are experiencing a shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) and facilities.
The shortage of PPE during the outbreak has forced medical frontliners to improvise equipment using acetate as a safety precaution against the coronavirus. (READ: Filipinos find ways to improvise safety in the time of coronavirus)
With help from the government, the petition hopes necessary medical equipment such as face masks, gloves, and ventilators will be given to health workers. It said the administration can also urge private hospitals to share their stock of PPE, medical equipment, and facilities.
The petition said this might entail allocating available funds to aid the health sector and rechanneling intelligence and confidential funds of different government agencies to the DOH through a special session of Congress.
So far, the Philippines has 5 facilities in the country that can screen coronavirus samples. The country also has a testing capacity of 950 to 1,000 tests per day. (READ: Where are testing centers for coronavirus in the PH?)
Aside from provision of equipment, the petition urged the Duterte administration to convert public spaces such as gymnasiums and convention centers into temporary quarantine and health centers. These may also be used as evacuation centers for the homeless. (READ: Shelters kept unlocked for the homeless during coronavirus outbreak)
Helping workers and businesses
Hoping to help workers and small businesses, the petition also urged the President to require the private sector to give additional paid leaves for both contractual and regular workers, and possibly offer accommodation to health workers, as the country grapples with the outbreak. 
It added that guaranteeing cash grants for workers and small businesses, along with a payment freeze and disconnection moratorium for utilities will help Filipinos cope as some of their livelihoods have been put at a standstill.
Lastly, the petition called on the administration to set up a centralized information source, which will house daily briefings of health officials, important government announcements, statistical data, location information, and history of movement of confirmed patients in one place for transparency and public knowledge.
The petition continues to grow as it gains more traction and guns for at least 150,000 signatures. Those interested to pitch in their voice through the petition can sign here. – Rappler.com "

Additional test kits are expected to aid health workers in testing more people for COVID-19.
On Saturday, March 21, the Department of Health (DOH) said that the country's accredited testing centers so far have an average testing capacity of up to 1,000 per day, with the bulk coming from the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM). For now, the tests will be limited to severe and vulnerable cases, the DOH said.
Criticism has mounted over the Philippines’ limited testing capacity, as scientists urged the government to conduct mass testing for the disease. (READ: Filipino scientists call on government to conduct mass testing for coronavirus)
The World Health Organization earlier urged countries to test ""every suspected case"" of coronavirus, as this was the ""backbone"" of response to the pandemic. This was seen in South Korea, which has managed to control the spread of the disease through massive testing efforts.  
The test kits from Singapore, another country hailed for its handling of the disease, adds to additional test kits given by China and South Korea.  
But on Sunday, March 22, Singapore has also announced that starting Monday, March 23, it will impose a ban on all tourists as the number of imported coronavirus cases increased. (READ: Singapore bans all tourists as imported coronavirus cases rise)
The Philippine Food and Drug Administration has approved 4 coronavirus test kits for commercial use.  
Meanwhile, the test kits developed by the University of the Philippines National Institutes of Health (UP-NIH) would take some 2 or 3 weeks to be validated.
The Philippines has counted at least 380 confirmed coronavirus cases as of Saturday night, March 21. Among these cases, 25 have died while 15 have recovered. (READ: PH confirms 73 new coronavirus cases)

MANILA, Philippines – The Duterte government plans to hand out P8,000 ($157.25)* to around 17.9 million disenfranchised Filipino families to cushion the impact of the multiple and widespread lockdowns across the country intended to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus.
This was announced during the government-run Laging Handa advisory program on Sunday, March 22, by Albay 2nd District Representative Joey Salceda, saying that Congress plans to approve a P275-billion budget alignment during Monday's special session.
Who will get P8,000? Salceda said minimum wage earners who have been prevented from working because of a lockdown can avail of the assistance, which he dubbed as ""pantawid quarantine"" or aid to get by during the quarantine.
Others planned to be included are tricycle drivers, jeepney drivers, and farmers who could not work. The timeline remains unclear for the release of the proposed aid.
Why the aid? The congressman noted that the savings of many Filipinos under lockdown are already running out. Local governments have also sent out a cry for help as they reach for funds to respond to the outbreak.
""The national government really needs to step in,"" Salceda said.
The breakdown: Salceda said P144 billion of the P275 billion proposed realignment was set aside for the massive financial aid package.
Other proposed measures, Salceda said, included hazard pay for frontline workers, and nutrition supplements for senior citizens, who are the most vulnerable to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19). – Rappler.com

MANILA, Philippines – An alliance of more than 1,000 biologists, health experts, and other concerned individuals as well as 336 organizations in the Philippines have launched a petition calling on the national government to start mass testing for coronavirus. 
In the petition released Friday, March 20, the group Scientists Unite Against COVID-19 said that, in addition to physical distancing and quarantine measures, widespread testing is also key in containing the spread of the coronavirus. (READ: Without test kits, provinces, cities fighting blindly against coronavirus)
The group is also building a database of laboratories with qPCR machines, which can be used to test coronavirus samples.
Scientists Unite Against COVID-19, led by several University of the Philippines (UP) molecular biologists, echoed the call of the World Health Organization (WHO) for countries to “test, test, test.” 
They emphasized that mass testing would give the government a clearer picture of the extent of the infections in the country and respond accordingly. 
They added that by decentralizing testing from major hospitals to laboratories across different areas, the Philippines would be able to spot and contain localized outbreaks in communities around the country.
Testing will also help find asymptomatic carriers who need to be isolated (READ: WHO says 'aggressive' action needed in Southeast Asia to stop virus)
 
“Not only is mass testing a crucial public health measure; we can curb collective anxiety brought about by the fact that we are blindly fighting an unseen enemy and affirm the right of all Filipinos to be treated equitably in access to diagnosis,” the group said
“We need to increase our national testing capacity to facilitate decentralized, expanded testing across the Philippines,” they added.
The Philippines' testing capacity is 950 to 1,000 tests per day. A bulk of that is done by the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine in Muntinlupa City, which can perform an average of 600 tests per day.
Until Thursday, March 19, the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine was the sole laboratory in the country accredited by the World Health Organization (WHO) to screen novel coronavirus samples. (READ: Where are testing centers for coronavirus in PH?)
WHO has since allowed 4 other laboratories in the country to start coronavirus testing. These can be found in San Lazaro Hospital in Manila, Baguio General Hospital and Medical Center, Vicente Sotto Memorial Medical Center in Cebu City, and Southern Philippines Medical Center in Davao City. However, these centers have yet to achieve their full testing capacity, according to the scientists.
The government has also procured thousands of coronavirus test kits from South Korea and China, which will be used in parallel with the ones developed by the University of the Philippines (UP) National Institutes of Health.
The UP-developed test kit is still undergoing field validation to see if it can match the accuracy of other detection methods. The locally-made kit can reportedly screen samples in under two hours and will be 6 times cheaper than its foreign counterparts. 
“But test kits are only one part of the equation,” UP molecular biologist Joshua Danac told Rappler. “We also need more testing centers and more personnel to do the tests so that we can get results more quickly.”
To augment this, the scientists is building a database of laboratories with qPCR machines.
“Even though there are limited hospitals in the country with a qPCR machine, research labs across the country actually have the same qPCR equipment, and many of them – like my own – are sitting idle right now in the wake of the lockdown. If we can mobilize the resources from our research labs, each additional qPCR machine would greatly increase our testing capacity,” said Danac.
“Our healthcare system is already heavily burdened as it is. We can mobilize our research sector to help alleviate some of that burden by augmenting the testing capacity,” Danac added.
The group also offered a list of volunteers with the necessary skills to operate qPCR machines.
Meanwhile, the DOH said the Philippines still would not implement mass testing for coronavirus, even as the country received more than 100,000 new test kits from China, South Korea, and Brunei, and despite the steady rise of confirmed coronavirus cases in the country.
As of Sunday, March 22, the Philippines has already reported 380 confirmed cases of coronavirus, with 25 fatalities – which experts think might be a far cry from the true picture due to the lack of testing. (READ: [ANALYSIS] Coronavirus cases in PH could reach 26,000 by end-March if random spread not contained)
 “Each day we delay, more cases go undetected, and more people may die,” the scientists concluded.
