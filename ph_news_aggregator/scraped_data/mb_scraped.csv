The virus has spread to more than 60 countries around the globe — killing nearly 3,000 people and sickening 87,000 — prompting the World Health Organization to raise its risk assessment to its highest level. The decision to airlift the trapped South Africans came after President Cyril Ramaphosa on Thursday directed the repatriation of those who have asked to return home. “We were asked by the president to start the process immediately  — (so) within seven to 10 days (the evacuation team) must have completed the task,” Health Minister Zweli Mkhize said. The minister told a news conference at the country’s main OR Tambo International airport that there were 201 South Africans in Wuhan — the epicentre of the virus, and that “151 have indicated they want to be repatriated”. The group will be kept in quarantine for 21 days at a site authorities have refused to disclose. “The people we are bringing in are South Africans who are healthy and as far as we are concerned, are not infected,” Mkhize said. The repatriation process will be executed by the military. South Africa will be the latest country to extricate its nationals from Wuhan, where the deadly coronavirus outbreak first emerged in December. Until Friday when a case was detected in Nigeria, sub-Saharan Africa had largely escaped the fast-spreading epidemic.

Britain currently has 23 confirmed coronavirus cases, and Hancock said on Sunday it was still in a containment phase. The issue will become a standing item for all cabinet meetings and there will be more media briefings from health officials. Johnson wrote in the Sun newspaper that it was right to be concerned about the possible spread of the virus, but said a visit to a British hospital had left him “100 per cent confident in the medical resilience” The government is launching a new public information campaign this week, encouraging people to wash their hands for at least 20 seconds, and to do so more often than normal.

Italy’s Minister of Finance Roberto Gualtieri attends a one day Italo-Franco summit in Naples, Italy February 27, 2020. (REUTERS / Ciro De Luca / File Photo / MANILA BULLETIN) In an interview with La Repubblica newspaper, Gualtieri said this amounted to 0.2 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) and would come on top of an aid-package worth 900 million euros that was unveiled on Friday for the worst-impacted areas. Gualtieri said the new bill would include tax credits for companies that reported a 25 percent drop in revenues, tax cuts and additional funds for the health service. Italy has registered more than 1,100 confirmed cases of coronavirus since the contagion came to light in wealthy northern regions on Feb. 20 and at least 29 people have died. The economy minister said he was confident the European Union would approve the necessary hike in Italy’s official deficit target, adding eurogroup ministers would talk mid-week by telephone about the situation. Italy has the biggest debt pile in the euro zone after Greece, but Gualtieri said public finances were solid and predicted the 2019 budget deficit would come in at between 1.6 percent – 1.7 percent of GDP against an original target of 2.2 percent. The official data for 2019 is due to be released on Monday. Italy had forecast a deficit of 2.2 percent for this year, based on the assumption the economy would grow 0.6 percent in 2020. The government has yet to revise the growth forecast but analysts are saying a recession looks inevitable. The respected REF Ricerche think tank has warned the crisis could cut national output by 1 percent – 3 percent in the first half of 2020.

The city has imposed tough measures to contain the pathogen, restricting residents to self-quarantine at home. All urban public transportation services and outbound traffic channels at the airport and rail stations have been closed in the city since Jan. 23, two days before the Spring Festival, or the Chinese Lunar New Year, to curb the spread of the deadly pathogen. To facilitate residents’ daily life, the provincial department of commerce has taken a variety of measures including organizing suppliers to pack every three varieties of vegetables into a parcel each weighing around 5 kg and with a price of 10 yuan (about 1.43 US dollars) for household consumption. Daily deliveries of such vegetable parcels in the city have reached 200,000 bags.

South Korean President Moon Jae-In  (AFP Photo/Jung Yeon-je/MANILA BULLETIN FILE PHOTO) South Korea has the largest national total in the world outside China, after it saw a rapid surge in the number of coronavirus cases in recent days. Scores of events have been canceled or postponed over the contagion, while the country’s central bank has warned of a minus growth in the first quarter for the world’s 12th-largest economy, noting the epidemic will hit both consumption and exports. “The government is now waging all-out responses after raising the crisis alert to the highest level,” Moon said at an Independence Movement Day ceremony, scaled down due to the outbreak. “We will be able to overcome the COVID-19 outbreak and revive our shrunken economy,” he added. Samsung Electronics suspended operations at its domestic smartphone plant in Gumi — 200 kilometres (210 miles) southeast of Seoul — on Saturday for the second time in a week, after a third employee tested positive for the virus. Auto giant Hyundai Motor also stopped operations at one of its Ulsan plants after an employee tested positive for the coronavirus. Concerts by K-pop superstars BTS and the World Team Table Tennis Championships were among canceled events, while sports leagues have modified their seasons to contain the virus. K-pop star CHUNG HA was placed in self-quarantine when a member of her staff tested positive after visiting Italy last month, Yonhap news agency reported. The singer tested negative. Nearly 90 percent of the cases were in Daegu, the center of the country’s outbreak, and neighboring North Gyeongsang province, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a statement. The country reported one more death Sunday, taking the total death toll to 18. South Korea has an advanced health system and a free media, factors observers say improve the reliability of its statistics, with the numbers expected to rise as it checks more than 260,000 people associated with the Shincheonji Church of Jesus. A 61-year-old female member developed a fever on February 10, but attended at least four church services in Daegu — the country’s fourth-largest city with a population of 2.5 million — before being diagnosed. Around 60 percent of the cases were linked to the entity, the KCDC said. “Until now, the COVID-19 outbreak in the country has been excessively led by a specific group,” said KCDC vice director Kwon Jun-wook. Shincheonji apologized Sunday on behalf of its members who had kept their religion secret, adding: “It will be hard for our devotees to reveal their identity when political leaders… are recklessly criticizing Shincheonji as the epicenter.” Daegu has filed a police complaint against the local branch of the sect for submitting an incomplete list of its members, while other provincial governments have warned of taking similar action. The city’s streets have been largely deserted for days, aside from long queues at the few shops with masks for sale, with authorities urging the public to exercise caution. “The best way to prevent the COVID-19 is for the citizens to refrain from going outside,” said Daegu mayor Kwon Young-jin. But officials say they are not considering a citywide quarantine similar to Wuhan’s lockdown, where the virus first emerged. The new school term start has been delayed one week nationwide and three weeks in Daegu, while the US and South Korean militaries have postponed forthcoming joint exercises. Tags: ncov"

According to Carlo Suarez, president of Hotel Resort and Restaurants Association in Cebu (HRRAC), all hotels and resorts in Cebu were COVID-19-safe, and that they continue to closely coordinate with DOH, Cebu province, Bureau of Quarantine (BOQ) and the Bureau of Immigration (BI) so that all quarantine/health screening protocols are being followed. “We are all on top of this situation,” Suarez added.

Yap called for a Sangguniang Panlalawigan (SP) session on February 27 to put his appeal on-record through a resolution, which the council approved immediately. “Maintaining an attitude of compassion and care for all tourists must be without discrimination, whether local, Chinese, Korean or of other nationalities and any form of discrimination towards anyone will do more harm than good to public interest,” the resolution read.

Muhyiddin Yassin has taken oath as prime minister of crisis-hit Malaysia (AFP Photo/Mohd RASFAN / MANILA BULLETIN) The Southeast Asian nation was plunged into turmoil a week ago as Mahathir’s reformist “Pact of Hope” alliance, which stormed to a historic victory in 2018, collapsed after a bid to force out leader-in-waiting Anwar Ibrahim. Mahathir — who was the world’s oldest leader at 94 — then quit, triggering a race for the premiership which he ultimately lost to little-known Muhyiddin Yassin, who heads a coalition dominated by the country’s ethnic Malay Muslim majority. The decision Saturday by the monarch to pick Muhyiddin was greeted with shock as Mahathir’s allies claimed he had enough support to return as leader, and sparked widespread anger that the democratically elected government was being abruptly ejected. The king appoints the country’s prime minister, who must show he has the support of most MPs. Muhyiddin’s coalition includes the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), the party of disgraced ex-leader Najib Razak, as well as a hardline group that wants tougher Islamic laws. UMNO is the corruption-riddled lynchpin of the coalition thrown out at the 2018 elections amid allegations Najib and his cronies looted billions of dollars from state fund 1MDB. Najib is now on trial for corruption. Despite a last-minute bid by Mahathir and his allies to prove that the veteran politician had enough support to return as premier, Muhyiddin’s inauguration went ahead Sunday morning. Wearing traditional Malay dress, the 72-year-old took the oath of office at the national palace in Kuala Lumpur during an elaborate ceremony. But in a press conference shortly beforehand, Mahathir insisted that Muhyiddin did not have the support of most of the country’s 222 MPs. “This is a very strange thing… losers will form the government, the winners will be in the opposition,” he said. “The rule of law no longer applies,” he said, adding he would call for an urgent parliament sitting so that Muhyiddin can prove he has enough support. The veteran ex-leader — who served a first stint as premier from 1981 to 2003 — however conceded that the king had refused to see him to hear his case, and that the “Pact of Hope” alliance would now go into opposition. Public anger was growing at the ejection of the reformist alliance, with the hashtag “NotMyPM” trending on Twitter and more than 100,000 people signing a petition that said the move was a “betrayal” of voters’ choice at the 2018 poll. The political crisis began when a group of ruling coalition lawmakers joined forces with opposition parties in a bid to form a new government without Anwar and stop him becoming premier. After the government fell, Mahathir was appointed interim premier and he and Anwar initially launched separate bids for power, reviving their decades-old rivalry. But as Muhyiddin’s bid quickly gained support and it became clear that he could get into power with UMNO, Mahathir and Anwar joined forces again in an effort to stop him — but it proved too little, too late.

,"March 1, 2020, 7:21 PM",nCov,Angara urges DOLE to survey firms behind COVID-19 lay-offs,By Hannah Torregoza and Leslie Aquino,"By Hannah Torregoza and Leslie Aquino Senator Juan Edgardo “Sonny” Angara on Sunday urged the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) to conduct a survey of all companies that are laying off workers due to the COVID-19. Taking note of the Philippine Airlines’ (PAL) move to lay off 300 of its personnel, Angara warned the government cannot afford to be complacent in addressing the impact of the COVID-19 on the economy.  Senator Juan Edgardo “Sonny” Angara (Senator Sonny Angara Official Facebook Page / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN) “We have been spared from deaths caused by COVID-19 but sadly the pandemic has taken away the jobs of 300 hardworking men and women of our country’s flag carrier,” Angara said. “There is no end in sight yet and more countries are implementing drastic measures to keep their citizens safe, including our own,” he added. The DOLE is also verifying reports that dozens of foreign domestic workers in Hong Kong have been fired amid the COVID-19 outbreak. DOLE Assistant Secretary Benjo Benavides said said they will also verify the claim of a labor group that 7,000 workers are about to be laid off in the next six months as more enterprises are forced to implement retrenchment programs to cope with the business losses caused by the COVID-19. “First, we want to verify where these workers are, what province, region they are from, so we can extend the necessary help,” Benavides said. “If it’s about the virus, most likely they are in the service industry like hotels and restaurants. So, most probably they are in regions or provinces being visited by tourists,” he added. Benavides said if ever there are workers who will be retrenched, they should be given separation pay. Some companies, he said, offer a good separation packages. “There are those that give a much higher separation package and this is also what we are appealing to employers (to do),” said Benavides. Mechanisms Senator Angara, chairman of the the Senate Finance Committee, said it is imperative that the government has mechanisms in place to shield the economic sector from the negative effects of the coronavirus. “Our authorities should prepare for the worst and insulate, not only our people from the virus, but also our industries from being downed by COVID-19,” he added. As a first step, he said the labor department should already be conducting a survey of all companies that are laying-off its workers due to a slowdown of economic activity, be it COVID-19-related or other factors. He pointed out not all companies are the size of PAL, which could afford to provide separation packages to its affected employees. Angara noted there are smaller players, particularly those in the tourism sector such as the tour guides, bed and breakfast operators, and vehicle rentals who need the foreign visitors to put food on their tables. But for local constituents who lost their jobs due because their company went bankrupt, he said, DOLE offers financial assistance which they can use during their transition period. Under the 2020 General Appropriations Act, the DOLE has P112.62-million for its Adjustment Measures Program and P6.8-billion for its Tulong Panghanapbuhay sa Ating Disadvantaged/Displaced Workers or TUPAD. “Now more than ever our entire government should work together in making our domestic industries stronger, more competitive, productive, and resilient,” he said. “This way they will be less prone to external shocks and continue to provide jobs to our people, uplift their communities and bring the Philippines closer to being an industrialized nation,” Angara added. Employment crisis Labor group Defend Jobs Philippines on Sunday called on President Duterte and DOLE to resolve the growing number of terminated Filipino workers. According to the group, around 2,087 Filipino workers will be jobless in two months as various companies have already announced plans to terminate their workers due to planned plant shutdowns and streamlining reasons. Defend Jobs Philippines said the 2,087 workers who will be terminated are from Nokia (700 workers), Wells Fargo (700 workers), Honda (387 workers) and Philippine Airlines (300 workers). The labor group said the figure will add-up to the unemployed Filipino workforce which is now at 4.7 million. Thadeus Ifurung, Defend Jobs Philippines spokesperson, said that the sudden increase of mass lay-offs must be enough basis for alarm and for the government to take up preemptive measures to resolve the imminent “employment crisis” in the country.   Tags: ncov"

A man wearing a protective mask walks in piazza del Duomo on February 28, 2020 in center Milan. – Since the Covid-19 outbreak in Italy, the epicenter of the virus in Europe, Milan is strongly hit by economic downturn, causing residents and business owners concern, AFP reports on February 29, 2020. (Photo by Miguel MEDINA / AFP) The man in his 40s returned to Luxembourg “at the beginning of the week” and, after “more recently” exhibiting COVID-19 symptoms, had a test that confirmed the disease, she said. A second test is being carried out in the Netherlands and the results should be known on Sunday, she added. The patient was isolated in a Luxembourg hospital and his family members were in quarantine, the minister said, adding that the procedures had “gone as planned” for this scenario. Luxembourg, a small EU country of 610,000 inhabitants nestled between Belgium, Germany, and France, is the latest European country to register a case, as the new coronavirus spreads around the world. Lenert said the infected person had returned from Italy via Belgium’s Charleroi airport. Italy has Europe’s biggest cluster of new coronavirus infections in its north, with 29 deaths and more than 1,000 infections. Eighteen other Luxemburgers are currently in quarantine in a hotel on the Spanish resort island of Tenerife after an Italian man and his wife who stayed there tested positive for the virus.

,"March 1, 2020, 10:44 AM",nCov,Coronavirus: who is most at risk of dying?,By Agence France-Presse ,"By Agence France-Presse  
 As the number of confirmed coronavirus cases across 61 countries hit 86,000 Saturday with nearly 3,000 deaths to date, the profile of those most at risk of dying is coming into focus, experts told AFP.  This photo taken on February 29, 2020, shows a man wearing a face mask riding a scooter in Wuhan in China’s central Hubei province. – Wuhan’s 11 million resident has been under effective quarantine since January 23 as Chinese authorities race to contain the COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak. (Photo by STR / AFP) / China OUT / MANILA BULLETIN) But the overall mortality rate remains uncertain, they said. The World Health Organization raised its global risk assessment to its top-level Friday, with the global health crisis edging closer to a pandemic. Among those infected with the virus, older adults with preexisting heart conditions or hypertension face a sharply higher risk, according to preliminary statistics, including from a study covering more than 72,000 patients in China. Among a subset of 44,700 infections confirmed through lab tests as of mid-February, more than 80 percent were at least 60 years old, with half over 70, said the study, that was published in the official China CDC Weekly. Initial reports from outside China are similar, with the first 12 victims reported in Italy mostly in their 80s, and none under 60. Several had known heart problems. Men in the China study were more likely to die than women by a margin of almost 3-to-2. But whether that was due to behaviour — notably that most men in China smoke, while few women do — or biological factors, such as hormonal differences, is still unknown. One striking finding from the China study is the near absence of cases among children. The 10-19 age bracket comprised one percent of infections, and a single death. Children under 10 made up less than one percent, with no deaths reported. “We are still trying to wrap our heads around the deficit of cases among those under 20,” Cecile Viboud, an epidemiologist at the US National Institute of Health’s Fogarty International Centre, told AFP in an interview. “Is it because young children are less susceptible than adults, and thus simply don’t get infected? Or if they do, that they have less disease?” It is surprising infections of very young people are so low, she added, because they tend to be among the hardest hit by almost all respiratory infections — whether viral or bacterial. David Fisman, an epidemiologist at the University of Toronto, was also mystified. “Where are the infected children???,” he wrote in an email. “This is critical — perhaps kids are not being tested because they have mild symptoms.” Another possible explanation is that children in China were out of school for the lunar new year holiday when the virus began to spread widely in January. “But young children still live in households where they can be infected by their parents,” Viboud noted. A lower rate of infection among the youngest age groups was also seen during the 2002-03 outbreak of SARS, but was less marked. SARS, which is also a coronavirus, broke out in Guangdong Province and killed 774 people out of 8,096 infected. The death of 34-year old Wuhan doctor Li Wenliang in early February, along with several more health workers in their twenties sparked speculation they had died because of repeated exposure, or even sheer exhaustion. Li’s death sparked outrage in China because he had been muzzled by authorities for calling attention to the virus. Cellphone video images on social networks showed nurses and doctors, unable to cope with the caseload, breaking down in hysterics. “A more likely reason why young clinicians are getting infected is because they were operating outside their level of expertise and training,” John Nichols, a professor in the department of pathology at the University of Hong Kong, told AFP. “It is noble that the junior doctors pony up valiantly to help, but they most likely would not have had the necessary training in handling infectious patients.” The larger question of just how lethal COVID-19 is, remains unanswered. The ratio of confirmed cases to deaths suggests a mortality rate of 3.4 percent, but several studies have concluded that up to two-thirds of infections in China and elsewhere have gone undetected, which would make the virus far less deadly. “At the moment, we don’t have a good understanding of the real mortality rate,” Sharon Lewin, director of the Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity at the University of Melbourne told Australian television. “It is estimated at about two percent.” With SARS — which killed nearly one in 10 patients — early mortality figures turned out to be underestimates, in part because victims of the virus did not die quickly. With the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, however, the opposite happened, said Viboud. “Within a few weeks of the outbreak, the mortality estimate declined first 10-fold, and then 100-fold, as we moved from severe pneumonia to getting all flu cases.” “Here, I think we are somewhere in the middle,” she added, saying the current two percent mortality estimate could well decline. The seasonal flu has an average mortality rate of about 0.1 percent but is highly infectious, with up to 400,000 people worldwide dying from it each year. The China CDC study showed that COVID-19 was “mild” for more than 80 percent of confirmed cases. Tags: ncov"

(REUTERS/Amanda Perobelli / MANILA BULLETIN) The United States on Saturday reported its first death from the disease, a Washington state man in his 50s. Two of the state’s three cases have links to a nursing home, state officials said, where dozens of residents have symptoms of the disease. U.S. President Donald Trump and top officials said in a White House press briefing that travelers from South Korea and Italy would be subject to additional screening, and warned Americans against traveling to coronavirus-affected regions in both countries. U.S. Vice President Mike Pence said a ban on travelers from Iran entering the country would be expanded to include any foreign nationals who have visited Iran in the last 14 days. The United States may also restrict travel on its southern border with Mexico, officials said. However they encouraged Americans to travel around the country, including to states where some of the country’s more than 60 cases of the disease have been recorded. The outbreak is disrupting demand for flights and many airlines have suspended or modified services in response. After Saturday’s press conference, the White House held a call with airlines to discuss new travel restrictions. Ecuador on Saturday reported its first case, in a woman who had traveled from Madrid, while Mexico reported four cases, all in people who had visited Italy. Brazilian officials confirmed that country’s second case, a patient in São Paulo who recently visited Italy. As governments worldwide stepped up efforts to halt the spread of the virus, France announced a temporary ban on public gatherings with more than 5,000 people in confined spaces. It reported 16 new cases for a total of 73, and canceled a half-marathon of 40,000 runners scheduled for Sunday. Switzerland said it is banning events expected to draw more than 1,000 people. More than 700 tourists remain quarantined at a hotel in the Canary Islands, after several Italian guests there tested positive for coronavirus. Schools and universities in Italy, which is experiencing Europe’s worst outbreak of the disease, will stay closed for a second consecutive week in three northern regions. The country has reported some 900 cases and 21 deaths. Analysts have warned that the outbreak looks set to shunt Italy’s fragile economy into its fourth recession in 12 years, with many businesses in the wealthy north close to a standstill and hotels reporting a wave of cancellations. Iraq reported five new cases of the disease, bringing its total to 13, and Qatar reported its first Saturday, leaving Saudi Arabia as the only Gulf state not to have signaled any coronavirus cases. The majority of infections in other Gulf countries have been linked to visits to Iran or involve people who have come into contact with people who had been there. Tehran has ordered schools shut until Tuesday and extended the closure of universities and a ban on concerts and sports events for a week. Authorities have also banned visits to hospitals and nursing homes as the country’s case load hit nearly 600. One Iranian lawmaker, elected in Feb. 21 polls, has died from the disease along with more than 40 other Iranians, and several high-ranking officials have tested positive for the virus. Azerbaijan said on Saturday it had closed its border with Iran for two weeks to prevent the spread of coronavirus. Two Azerbaijanis who traveled to Iran have tested positive for the disease and quarantined. Mainland China reported 573 new confirmed coronavirus cases on Feb. 29, up from 427 on the previous day, the country’s health authority said. The number of deaths stood at 35, down from 47 on the previous day, and bringing the total death toll in mainland China to 2,870.

He was moved to a renovated facility with air-conditioning and the patient was now comfortable. “As of this morning, his condition has improved, he hasn’t developed any new symptoms, but he’s still got a mild fever,” he added. Several people from the company where he worked had been contacted and officials were trying to trace other people with whom he might have had contact, Abayomi added. Meanwhile, Nigeria consumer officials warned against arbitrary hikes in prices of protective kits and products. The Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (FCCPC) said suppliers of protective apparel and hygiene products, including face masks, latex gloves and hand sanitisers were taking undue advantage of the rush. It urged pharmacies and department stores to stop hoarding the products. Nigeria, Africa’s most populous country with some 190 million people, is viewed as highly vulnerable to viral spread given its weak health system and high population density. Prior to the case in Nigeria, the first in sub-saharan Africa, there had been just two cases on the continent — in Egypt and Algeria.

US President Donald Trump says there is “no reason to panic” over the novel coronavirus (AFP / Roberto SCHMIDT / MANILA BULLETIN) The virus has now hit 61 countries across the globe, prompting the World Health Organization to raise its risk assessment to its highest level. Worldwide, more than 2,900 people have been killed and nearly 86,000 infected since it was first detected in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year. Its rapid spread beyond China’s borders in the past week has caused stock markets to sink to their lowest levels since the 2008 global financial crisis over fears the disease could wreak havoc on the world economy. But global attention shifted Saturday to the United States, after authorities in the West Coast state of Washington confirmed the first fatality on American soil — and President Donald Trump hastily called a press conference to address fears. “We’ve taken the most aggressive actions to confront the coronavirus,” Trump told reporters at the White House. “Our country is prepared for any circumstance. (…) There is no reason to panic at all.” The fatality occurred in Washington state’s King county, which includes Seattle, a city of more than 700,000 people, health officials said. The victim was not immediately identified. “We will see more cases,” Health Secretary Alex Azar told the press conference. “But it’s important to remember, for the vast majority of individuals who contract the novel coronavirus, they will experience mild to moderate symptoms.” Although the vast majority of infections have been in China, more daily cases are now logged outside the country. South Korea, Italy, and Iran have emerged as hotspots. The United States imposed new restrictions on anyone who has traveled in the last two weeks to Iran. It also urged Americans not to visit hard-hit areas of Italy and South Korea. With the virus spreading quickly in some countries, France on Saturday canceled all gatherings of 5,000 people or more in a bid to contain the coronavirus outbreak. France’s latest restrictions came after 16 new cases were confirmed Saturday, bringing the country’s total to 73. Sunday’s Paris half-marathon and an agricultural symposium were among the events hit. South Korea, which has the most infected people outside China, reported its biggest surge in new cases on Saturday with 813 more patients confirmed, bringing its total to 3,150. Italy, the hotspot of the outbreak in Europe, also reported a jump in new cases on Saturday, with its number of infections exceeding 1,000 and the death toll jumping by eight to 29. In recent days, the epidemic spread to sub-Saharan Africa, and Qatar and Ecuador both confirmed their first cases on Saturday. Official data released in China on Saturday showed the extent of the damage caused to the world’s second-largest economy, with manufacturing activity falling to its lowest level on record as key industries ground to a standstill under drastic containment measures. China’s National Bureau of Statistics said the auto and specialized equipment industries were hit hard. Authorities in China have taken drastic steps to contain the virus, curbing the movement of people, temporarily closing factories across the country and quarantining central Hubei province, a key industrial region where the epidemic first appeared in December. More global events have been disrupted due to the epidemic, with the United States delaying a regional summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations due in Las Vegas next month. “This is not a time for panic. It is time to be prepared — fully prepared,” UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said. South Korea’s epidemic is centered in its fourth-largest city, Daegu, whose streets have been largely deserted for days, apart from long queues at the few shops with masks for sale. Three women in the Daegu area died of the illness, taking the national toll to 17, authorities said Saturday. South Korea’s total is expected to rise further with the screening of more than 210,000 members of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, a secretive entity often accused of being a cult that is linked to around half of the country’s cases.

(MANILA BULLETIN) Health officials said the man, from the east of Ireland, was “receiving appropriate medical care” after they followed “established protocols” in testing and diagnosing him with COVID-19. “The case is associated with travel from an affected area in northern Italy, rather than contact with another confirmed case,” the Department of Health said in a statement. The authorities were working rapidly to identify any contacts the patient may have had, “to provide them with information and advice to prevent further spread,” it added. Health Minister Simon Harris said the development was “not unexpected”. “We have been preparing for this since January,” he added.

Dr. Francis Riedo, Medical Director of Infection Control at EvergreenHealth Hospital speaks about the first patient death from novel coronavirus in the United States during a news conference in Seattle, Washington, U.S. February 29, 2020. (REUTERS/Ryan Henriksen / MANILA BULLETIN) The patient, who was chronically ill prior to contracting COVID-19, died at EvergreenHealth Hospital in Kirkland, near Seattle, and officials are unsure how he was exposed to the virus, said Jeffrey Duchin, head of the Washington health department’s communicable disease unit. The state has recorded two other “presumptive” coronavirus cases at a long-term care facility in Kirkland where more than 50 residents and staff could be showing symptoms, he said. “At this point we do not have widespread community-wide transmission locally. We have transmission that’s associated with an outbreak at this long-term care facility,” Duchin said. The two cases at the Kirkland facility were a health care worker in her 40s who is in satisfactory condition, and a woman in her 70s who lived there and is in serious condition. “It is a sad day as we learn a Washingtonian has died from COVID-19. Our hearts go out to his family and friends,” the state’s governor, Jay Inslee, said in a statement. “We are strengthening our preparedness and response efforts to keep Washingtonians healthy, safe and informed.” Most of the US cases have occurred in travelers who were repatriated from China, where the virus originated. But public health officials have also identified coronavirus cases in California, Washington and Oregon with no direct ties to the virus’ source in China, signaling a turning point in strategies needed to contain the disease in the United States. US health authorities say it means the respiratory disease that has infected nearly 80,000 people and killed more than 2,800 in China is no longer an imported phenomenon but has taken up residence in the United States. “We still judge the general risk to the American public to be low and that includes residents of long-term care facilities,” said Nancy Messonier, head of the Immunization and Respiratory Disease division at the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). Messonnier told reporters in a call on Saturday that the agency would send teams to support investigations in California and Washington into how patients contracted the virus and help trace who else may have been exposed.   PERSON-TO-PERSON TRANSMISSION Until this week, the CDC had counted just 15 confirmed cases in six states as having been detected through the US public health system since Jan. 21. Most were contracted by individuals while traveling in China. Only two person-to-person transmissions were documented among them, both between married couples. An additional 47 cases have been confirmed among people recently repatriated, either from the Diamond Princess cruise ship quarantined in Japan or from the Chinese city of Wuhan, the supposed epicenter of the outbreak, according to the CDC. Health officials said the advent of locally transmitted infections means authorities need to expand their focus from detecting a relatively limited number of cases, identifying close contacts and isolating them, to one that also emphasizes greater prevention among the public at large. In particular, individuals should be more vigilant about basic hygiene measures, such as washing hands often, avoiding touching their faces, covering coughs and sneezes and staying home from school or work whenever ill, health officials say. Coronavirus is spread primarily through tiny droplets coughed or sneezed directly from an infected person into the face of someone nearby, as opposed to the more contagious “airborne” transmission of a virus like measles, which can remain suspended in enclosed spaces and be breathed in hours after being exhaled by sick individuals, experts say. Coronavirus can also survive on surfaces, such as handrails and door knobs, for “a very long period of time,” and be picked up by hand that way, though the virus is “very susceptible” to cleaning products, Dr. Christopher Braden, deputy director of the CDC’s National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, said on Friday in Santa Clara County. Still, “It’s mostly a person-to-person transmission that we are concerned about for our communities,” he added. Tags: ncov"

Iran’s Health Minister Saeed Namaki warned on Friday of “a very difficult week” ahead in Iran, which only announced its first infections and deaths from the coronavirus on Feb. 19 and where the death rate among confirmed cases has been around 10%, compared to around 3% elsewhere. Tehran has ordered the shutting of schools until Tuesday and the government has extended the closure of universities and a ban on concerts and sports events for a week. Several high-ranking officials, including a vice minister, deputy health minister and five lawmakers, have tested positive for the coronavirus as outbreak forced Iran’s clerical rulers to close the parliament and impose internal travel bans. One lawmaker, elected in Iran’s Feb. 21 polls, had died of the coronavirus, Iranian media reported on Saturday. Iran’s government spokesman will hold his weekly news conference online due to the outbreak, the semi-official Mehr news agency reported. Iran’s foreign ministry advised Iranians to avoid trips to South Korea, which reported 594 new coronavirus infections on Saturday, taking its tally to 2,931 cases. Saudi Arabia is now the only Gulf Arab state not to have reported any cases of the coronavirus, which has infected about 80,000 people and killed more than 2,800, mostly in China. “This is an international problem and all nations should work together to overcome the coronavirus crisis,” Iranian President Hassan Rouhani told Qatar’s ruler Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani on Saturday by telephone, state TV reported.

,"February 29, 2020, 4:37 PM",nCov,Hoarding in the USA? Coronavirus sparks consumer concerns,By Reuters,"By Reuters American consumers awoke this week to the coronavirus threat and are beginning to display a symptom of the illness seen in Asia and Europe – hoarding.  Shoppers line up outside a Costco to buy supplies after the Hawaii Department of Health on Wednesday advised residents they should stock up on a 14-day supply of food, water and other necessities for the potential risks of novel coronavirus in Honolulu, Hawaii, U.S. February 28, 2020. *(Courtesy of Duane Tanouye via REUTERS / MANILA BULLETIN) Nothing in the United States yet resembles what Italy witnessed in recent days – where supermarket shelves were stripped bare and videos posted on social media showed consumers coming to blows over bags of pasta. But there is unquestionably a growing sense of urgency for people to stock up on staples and to prepare for lengthy home quarantines. “I’m buying some flu therapy and pain killers – If I wait until next week there may be nothing left,” said Dean McKnight, a engineer in Austin, Texas, as he motioned to shelves at the HEB supermarket that were empty of several over-the-counter medications, primarily flu treatment for children. McKnight worked in Hong Kong and China during the SARS outbreak and knows first-hand the stress that snowballing fears of a pandemic can cause, but said he is not panicked. “We got an extra month’s worth of inhalers for my wife, but we’re not stocking up on medications or food as if we expect to need to secure several months of supplies right now.” The coronavirus spread further globally on Friday. The latest World Health Organization figures indicate more than 82,000 people have been infected, with over 2,700 deaths in China and 57 deaths in 46 other countries. Panic purchasing has been seen of masks and other personal protective gear. But there is also a looming threat to retail across the board, analysts said. Several major retailers – including Walmart and Target – stand to see supply chains badly hit by the coronavirus and that could result in some empty store shelves starting in April, Ed Kelly, an analyst at Wells Fargo Securities, wrote in a research note this month. “We believe the time to start worrying about the supply chain risk of 2019-nCoV is here,” wrote Kelly. “It’s worth noting that big box players like Target and Walmart could be the first to experience out of stock issues.” That is because those stores operate on a just-in-time inventory model, Kelly wrote, and are highly dependent on China, where supply chains have been badly disrupted.   ‘Hard to keep up’   Stockpiling in states like Hawaii and Minnesota was spurred by messages from state health departments urging residents to buy supplies of non-perishable foods, prescription medications and sanitary supplies. The advice contradicted the message from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). CDC Director Robert Redfield on Thursday told a U.S. congressional hearing that there was no need for healthy Americans to stock up on any supplies. “We should have one unified message,” said Robyn Gershon, a clinical professor of epidemiology at New York University. “When there’s an absence of a good, strong and reassuring official voice, people will get more upset and start doing this magical thinking.” On Friday in Honolulu, Hawaii, retired telecommunications worker Duane Tanouye, 62, waited in line outside a Costco with more than 200 other people. “Nobody’s really panicking, but there’s a lot more people than normal,” Tanouye said by phone. Stores in Hawaii had begun limiting how much consumers could buy of some products, such as toilet paper, he said. Pandemic shopping lists have been going around online, with virologist Ian Mackay suggesting people not forget treats like soft drinks and chocolate alongside the grains and pasta. “But don’t panic buy and don’t hoard!” Mackay, an associate professor at the University of Queensland in Australia, said in his blog post, “So you think you’re about to be in a pandemic?” Minnesota’s health department said buying supplies now would make it easier to stay at home if family members got sick, or if people wanted to avoid sick people in their community. Hawaii told families to prepare as they did for hurricanes, with a 14-day supply of food, water and other necessities. At Cid’s Food Market, a natural food store in Taos, New Mexico, an area known for its off-the-grid communities, locals were filling shopping carts with sacks of rice, beans and oats. “It’s been hard to keep up this week, I’d say demand has at least doubled,” said Steve Sutherland, bulk manager at Cid’s. “People tend to stock up here anytime there is a problem.” Jason Robnett, a chef and jewelry designer from Taos, snagged the last 20-pound bag of pinto beans on the bulk department shelf as he was stocking up on items. “People need to stop reacting, just stay still,” he said. “If everybody just sits still until the readiness comes up to the right level, that’s better than running willy-nilly in every direction.” Tags: ncov"
,"February 29, 2020, 4:34 PM",nCov,How long can coronavirus survive on surfaces?,By Reuters,"By Reuters As a new coronavirus spreads quickly around the world, US health officials say they are “aggressively” assessing how long it can survive on surfaces to better understand the risk of transmission.  A general view of a display with the latest information on the spread of the novel coronavirus worldwide during a government crisis meeting in Berlin, Germany, February 28, 2020. (REUTERS/Annegret Hilse / MANILA BULLETIN) Based on what is known about similar coronaviruses, disease experts say the new outbreak of the virus, named COVID-19, is mainly spread from person to person through coughing or sneezing. Contact with fecal matter from an infected person may also transmit the virus. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says it may be possible for a person to become infected by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose or eyes. An analysis of 22 earlier studies of similar coronaviruses, including Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) published online this month in the Journal of Hospital Infection, concluded that human coronaviruses can remain infectious on inanimate surfaces for up to nine days at room temperature. However, they can quickly be rendered inactive using common disinfectants, and may also dissipate at higher temperatures, the authors wrote. It is not yet clear, however, whether the new coronavirus behaves in a similar way. “On copper and steel it’s pretty typical, it’s pretty much about two hours,” CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield told US lawmakers on Thursday, referring to how long the new coronavirus  may be active on those types of materials. “But I will say on other surfaces – cardboard or plastic – it’s longer, and so we are looking at this.” The agency said there is likely a very low risk of spread from products or packaging that are shipped over a period of days or weeks at ambient temperatures. A CDC spokeswoman, in an emailed statement, said the agency is still looking into how contagious the virus can be when deposited on more common, everyday surfaces. The Food and Drug Administration this week said it has no evidence that COVID-19 has been transmitted from imported goods, but the situation remains “dynamic” and the agency said it will assess and update guidance as needed. “The important big take-home message is that this is probably a small proportion of the transmission of respiratory viruses,” said Dr. Timothy Brewer, professor of epidemiology and medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles. “Out in the community, these viruses are probably not surviving for a long time on surfaces.” Brewer explained that such viruses tend to survive the longest in low-temperature, low-humidity environments, “that is why you see lots of respiratory viruses during the winter.” Tags: ncov"

Tourist wearing a protective respiratory mask tours outside the Colosseo monument (Colisee, Coliseum) in downtown Rome on February 28, 2020 amid fear of Covid-19 epidemic. – Since February 23, more than 50,000 people have been confined to 10 towns in Lombardy and one in Veneto — a drastic measure taken to halt the spread of the new coronavirus, which has infected some 400 people in Italy, mostly in the north. (Photo by Andreas SOLARO / AFP) “The virus circulated unnoticed for several weeks before the first ascertained cases… perhaps since mid-January,” Massimo Galli, the director of the Biomedical Research Institute, told AFP. Studying the virus in Italy “will help understand the epidemic better, and contain it”, he said. The virus mutates from person to person, he said, so researchers will be looking at why Italy has the largest number of cases in Europe and “the differences between this and the coronavirus in China.” That will help in terms of treatment and the potential development of a vaccine, he added. Some 650 people have tested positive for the virus in Italy, though only 303 are considered serious clinical cases. Galli’s team at the Sacco hospital in Milan, lead by immunology professor Claudia Balotta, worked on samples taken from three patients in the “red zone” around Codogno in Lombardy, home to Italy’s first known case of COVID-19. They isolated the Italian strain in just four days. The small town of Codogno in northern Italy is home to a 38-year-old man dubbed “patient one.” “Patient zero”, who passed the virus to the 38-year-old, has yet to be found, but “patient one” is considered the source of both the Codogno outbreak and another in the Veneto region. The 38-year-old, hospitalized a week ago, passed the virus to his heavily pregnant wife, a friend, and men who were regulars at a bar in Codogno, before going on to infect doctors, nurses and other hospital patients as well. The virus has killed 17 people in Italy over the past week — all of whom were either elderly or had pre-existing health issues. The number of cases of infection reported has risen steadily each day, though Galli said that did not mean the virus was spreading. Most were people who had caught it previously, but had not been tested until now. Balotta said it would “take weeks” to determine the exact date of arrival of this strain in Italy, saying results would likely only come “once the epidemic is over.” Tags: ncov"

Abe is expected to explain how the government will cope with impact of the closure of schools at a media briefing scheduled for Saturday, the report said. Abe’s call for local authorities to shut schools from Monday means students will be out at least until the new academic year starts in early April. Infections from the virus in Japan have topped 200, with five deaths – including one on Friday of a man in his seventies. That excludes more than 700 cases and six more deaths from the quarantined cruise liner Diamond Princess, docked in Yokohama. The northern island of Hokkaido, a popular destination among foreign tourists, on Friday declared a state of emergency. Its population of about 5 million people, including those in the capital Sapporo, the venue for the marathon for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, were told to refrain from venturing outside their homes over the weekend. “The impact of the state of emergency could be big,” said Yukihiro Watanabe, 57, an owner of a wine bar in Otaru city, north of Sapporo. “Restaurants in Otaru, many of which are small, will be hurt because the number of tourists is falling and local people may stop dining out,” said Watanabe, who decided to close his shop at the weekend. Hokkaido has 70 cases of infection, the largest number among Japan’s prefectures, followed by Tokyo’s 36, according to the website of a public broadcaster NHK.

Senator Richard Gordon (ALI VICOY/MANILA BULLETIN FILE PHOTO) Citing statements from tourism experts that the impact of the new coronavirus on tourism could ripple into 2021, Gordon said it will be advantageous for the country to carry out the RA 9492 as governments, including the Philippines, implement travel restrictions due to COVID-19. He said the law, enacted in 2007, helped local tourism industry when it was implemented. “Domestic tourism thrived when it was implemented during the Arroyo administration. In 2018, domestic trips totaled 111,350,293 or an annual growth of 15.1 percent,” said Gordon, a former tourism secretary. The Holiday Economics Act allows the rescheduling of regular holidays and national special holidays. Under the law, if the holiday falls on a Wednesday, the holiday will be observed on the Monday of the week. If the holiday falls on a Sunday, the holiday will be observed on the Monday that follows: Provided, that for movable holidays, the President shall issue a proclamation, at least six months prior to the holiday concerned, the specific date that shall be declared as a nonworking day. Gordon said the number of domestic trips could increase since the law would give people more time for travel around the country.
“It would also give families more time to spend together,” he added. Aside from this, Gordon added that implementing the law would also open up more local business opportunities, especially if moving holidays would be announced in advance at the start of the year so that businessmen can prepare. He recalled pushing for an increase in the 2020 budget of the Department of Tourism’s Regional Offices to boost local tourism. Due to the COVID-19, the Philippines had earlier declared a temporary ban on tourists coming to and from China, as well as its special administrative regions HongKong and Macau, except overseas Filipino workers.

It was a “critical moment” in reining in the spread of the virus, he said, adding, “Please stay at home and refrain from going outside and minimize contact with other people.” As many as 476 of the new cases were from southeastern Daegu city, the site of a church at the center of the outbreak, and 60 from the nearby province of North Gyeongsang, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) said. Health authorities have run tests on more than 210,000 members and 65,000 trainees of the church linked to a majority of cases after a 61-year-old woman known as “Patient 31” attended religious services there before testing positive. More than 88% have been checked, and about 3,300 have shown symptoms such as fever, Kim added. Some provincial officials want to press criminal charges against the church, saying it refused to release a complete list of members, although the church denied the accusation, and urged an end to “slander and oppression” of its followers.

Hundreds of Chinese tourists on vacation in Bali are scrambling to avoid going home, fearing both infection from the deadly new coronavirus and Beijing’s handling of the epidemic. (AFP / MANILA BULLETIN) Concerns over the rapidly-spreading outbreak prompted Indonesia to shut down all flights to and from China this month, hammering the bottom lines of restaurants, hotels, travel agents and interpreters on the popular resort island. But with more than 2,800 dead from the COVID-19 illness on the Chinese mainland, and entire cities under lockdown, immigration officials in Bali say nearly a thousand Chinese nationals have applied for emergency visa extensions. “I’m an international refugee,” Steve Li, the manager of a European firm in a major mainland city, told AFP at an upscale mall in the island’s capital Denpasar. “China is like a big prison, all the cities are locked down,” he added. Li says he does not believe Beijing’s assurances that the country is getting the epidemic under control. While he plans to return to work, Li, who asked not to be identified by his real name, is leaving his wife and two young children behind to wait out the public health crisis. “I’m managing the company so I can’t ask my guys to continue to work while I hide here,” he said. Around a million Chinese tourists visit Bali each year — the second-largest group of foreign arrivals after Australians — and inject hundreds of millions of dollars into the local economy. Thousands travelled there from the mainland for last month’s Lunar New Year holiday just as the virus outbreak was beginning to snowball, prompting the lockdown of China’s Hubei province where the infection was first detected. Beijing flew home groups of overseas tourists from around Asia last month citing the “practical difficulties” they faced abroad, as fears of the contagion prompted several countries to bar entry to arrivals who had recently been in China. Only a few dozen Chinese travellers in Bali took up the offer. “I wasn’t surprised,” Bali Tourism Agency chief Putu Astawa told AFP. “They don’t want to go back.” Zilong Wang of Beijing said he was postponing his return because he believed his government had underplayed the infection’s true toll. “I’d rather stay in Bali and watch the situation,” the 30-year-old told AFP outside an immigration office swamped with anxious Chinese tourists, waiting in line for hours in the hope of extending their stay. Wang said he was also wary of other Chinese travellers, despite the lack of confirmed virus cases in Indonesia. “I’ve been trying to stay inside the hotel,” Wang said. “I am nervous when I meet some other Chinese people especially when they don’t wear masks. I’m afraid of getting infected.” Some travellers are preparing back-up plans in case their requests to extend their stays are denied. Heather Wang, a real estate agent from eastern Zhejiang province, has been in Bali since late January and has no plans to return home — even if she cannot stay on the tropical island. She is waiting to hear back from the Australian embassy on whether her application for a tourist entry permit has been successful. “If Australia doesn’t approve my visa I think I’ll be going to Thailand,” the 26-year-old added.

Cherry blossom events in Tokyo and Osaka, which attract millions of people wanting to see the white and pink flowers, will not go ahead as planned in April (AFP Photo/Kazuhiro NOGI / MANILA BULLETIN) The traditional spring celebrations in Tokyo and Osaka, which attract millions of people wanting to see the white and pink flowers, will not go ahead as planned in April. “We are sincerely sorry for those who were looking forward to the viewing… but please give us your understanding,” the Japan Mint in Osaka said Friday. Other cherry blossom events — feverishly anticipated by locals and tourists — are likely to follow suit, according to local media. Organizers of Tokyo’s Nakameguro Cherry Blossom Festival said people could still enjoy the blooming trees that grow along public roads. Trees in Tokyo will soon be in full bloom, with friends, families, and colleagues typically flocking to parks for sometimes raucous, alcohol-fuelled celebrations. The cancellations come as authorities step up efforts to tackle the outbreak in Japan, which has reported more than 230 infections and five deaths. Schools are closed and the government is urging people to work from home or commute during off-peak hours and avoid large gatherings. The operator of Tokyo’s two Disney resorts — Disneyland and DisneySea — said Friday the parks would be closed for around two weeks due to the virus. Universal Studios Japan in Osaka has also shuttered for a fortnight. Tags: ncov"
,"February 29, 2020, 2:04 PM",nCov,"In virus-hit China, coat maker adapts to make hazmat suits",By Agence France-Presse,"By Agence France-Presse The coronavirus outbreak in China is preventing clothing manufacturer Ugly Duck Industry from resuming its normal production of winter coats, so it has pivoted to another in-demand product: hazmat suits.  Ugly Duck Industry in Wenzhou, eastern China, has switched production from winter coats to hazmat suits (AFP Photo/ MANILA BULLETIN) The company in the eastern China export hub of Wenzhou hastily repurposed its assembly line, putting the few dozen workers it could muster to produce thousands of single-use protective suits daily. Ugly Duck — referring to the proverbial duckling that becomes a swan — is among countless Chinese manufacturers heeding calls to address desperate shortages of face masks, medical equipment, and other supplies to fight the new coronavirus. The contagion has killed more than 2,800 people and infected some 79,000 in China, sparking global fears and a run on supplies. Wenzhou is one the hardest-hit areas, with 504 cases and one death as of Friday, compared with 337 infections in far larger Shanghai. Along with other cities in Zhejiang province, Wenzhou adopted harsh restrictions on residents’ movements on February 2. Ugly Duck was asked by local authorities to do its part. “As soon as we received this mission, we reorganised our production line within 60 hours,” company president Pan Yue told AFP. The suits are sold to the government at cost and intended for local epidemic-control efforts. But with the virus now hitting other countries, the company plans to continue hazmat suit production even after normal operations resume as expected in the coming weeks. “We are considering export to Italy or wherever they are needed,” Pan said. “We want to contribute to society and to the world.” Major production areas in the five-story concrete factory are ghostly quiet expanses of idle sewing machines — testament to the paralysis inflicted on Chinese manufacturing. But in one workshop nearly the size of a football pitch, the bright-white polypropylene material is first cut into basic shapes, then stitched together in stages, and finally folded and packaged on an assembly line by workers who are also clad in the head-to-toe suits to prevent contamination. Each worker has a bottle of hand sanitiser at their work table. Underlining China’s enduring ability to foster mass, collective efforts, companies across China — from iPhone maker Foxconn to car manufacturer BYD — have pitched in after news that doctors in front-line epidemic areas were treating patients without proper masks or suits, or were forced to reuse single-use equipment. Wenzhou, with around three million people in its main urban core, is famed for its commercial prowess. A trade entrepot for centuries, it was an early pioneer in China’s manufacturing-led economic transformation beginning in the 1970s and today produces a large portion of the world’s eyeglasses and shoes. But the city remains subdued, its factories hobbled. Much of Ugly Duck’s roughly 300-strong labour force are migrants from less-developed provinces like Yunnan and Guizhou in China’s southwest. Only half of the workers have managed to navigate travel restrictions and reduced rail and bus traffic. “The outbreak has impacted the company because (production) has been delayed for a month,” said Pan. “But we will do everything to recoup the losses.” Tags: ncov"

,"February 29, 2020, 9:06 PM",nCov,Number of U.S. coronavirus cases of unknown origin climbs to four,By Reuters,"By Reuters U.S. public health officials said they have identified four “presumptive” coronavirus cases believed to have emerged from community transmission of the infection, signaling a turning point in efforts to contain the disease in the United States.  A woman wears a mask in Chinatown following the outbreak of the novel coronavirus, in Chicago, Illinois, US January 30, 2020. (REUTERS/Kamil Krzaczynski/File Photo/MANILA BULLETIN FILE PHOTO) The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a statement on Friday citing three such cases newly diagnosed by state public health authorities – one each in California, Oregon and Washington state. If confirmed by the CDC, together with a previous case of unknown origin announced on Wednesday in California, that would bring to four the number of diagnosed individuals in the United States with no history of travel to a country where the virus is circulating and no close contact with an infected person. The three latest patients were diagnosed based on results obtained in their respective states from CDC-supplied test kits and are considered “presumptive positive” cases pending CDC confirmatory testing, the U.S. agency said. A fourth presumptive positive was also announced in Washington state on Friday, but that one is “likely travel-related,” the CDC said. Still, the three latest cases of apparent community transmission, plus the one identified earlier this week in California, are a sign the virus is now spreading within at least four separate locations up and down the U.S. West Coast. They span nearly 900 miles from California’s Silicon Valley region in Santa Clara County north to the Puget Sound near Seattle. “What we know now is that the virus is here, present at some level, but we still don’t know to what degree,” said Dr. Sara Cody, the chief public health officer for Santa Clara County, speaking of the newly diagnosed case there, the latest of three in her county and the 10th statewide. Even as confirmation was pending there, the CDC sent a team to assist local authorities in tracing close contacts the patient had with others in a bid to curb transmission. Until this week, the CDC had counted 15 confirmed cases in six states as having been detected through the U.S. public health system since Jan. 21, none fatal. Most were contracted by individuals while traveling in China, where the outbreak originated. Only two person-to-person transmissions were documented among them, both between married couples. An additional 47 cases have been confirmed among people recently repatriated from abroad, either from the Diamond Princess cruise ship quarantined in Japan or from Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the outbreak, according to the CDC. The latest flurry of cases came as the Trump administration said the United States would invoke a federal defense law to boost production of masks, gloves, gowns and other items needed to protect medical personnel from exposure. Around the world, more countries are reporting new infections, companies have curtailed travel and global stock markets have tumbled. President Donald Trump said at the White House on Friday the United States will decide “very soon” about whether to bar entry to travelers from countries other than China where community transmission has emerged. At a rally in South Carolina on Friday night, Trump defended his administration’s response to the coronavirus outbreak and accused Democrats of politicizing the disease. “This is their new hoax,” Trump said at the event, held a day before the state’s Democratic presidential primary. The U.S. State Department has issued travel advisories for several nations and on Friday it said Americans should reconsider travel to Italy, where nearly 900 coronavirus cases have been confirmed. A similar warning was issued earlier this week for South Korea, which has hundreds of infections. A government task force appointed by Trump to deal with the threat will meet at the White House on Saturday morning, according to an administration official. Latest figures from China, where the outbreak started late last year, indicated that nearly 80,000 people have been infected, with more than 2,800 deaths. The World Health Organization reported 57 deaths in 46 other countries. Dr. Anthony Fauci, who heads the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said in a closed-door briefing in the U.S. House of Representatives that sustained spread of the coronavirus meant there would be many more infections in the United States, according to a source. Fauci warned lawmakers the country lacked enough testing resources, the source said on condition of anonymity. The CDC said it has revised its criteria for who should be tested and is ramping up testing capabilities. “Our goal is to have every state and local health department online and doing their own testing by the end of next week,” CDC official Nancy Messonier told reporters. A vaccine may take up to 18 months to develop, health officials have said. The United States has decided to postpone a meeting with leaders of Southeast Asian countries it had planned to host on March 14 in Las Vegas because of worries about the outbreak. U.S. and global stocks plummeted as rattled investors braced for the prospect that a pandemic could further dent an already slowing world economy. The S&P 500 fell for the seventh straight day on Friday, suffering its biggest weekly drop since the 2008 global financial crisis. Stocks cut losses right at the end of the session. The Dow Jones Industrial Average  fell 1.4%. Trump this week said the coronavirus risk to Americans remained “very low,” but he has been increasingly alarmed by the reaction of the U.S. stock market, which he considers a barometer of the economy’s health.   Tags: ncov"

,"February 29, 2020, 9:20 AM",nCov,New York scrambles to replace US government’s faulty coronavirus test kits,By Reuters ,"By Reuters  New York health officials are trying to get their own coronavirus testing kits up and running after getting stuck with faulty tests from the federal government that they said left them unable to diagnose people quickly in the nation’s most populous city.  A woman wears a mask on Wall St. near the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, US, February 28, 2020. (REUTERS/Brendan McDermid / MANILA BULLETIN) New York state’s Department of Health filed an emergency application on Friday with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to be allowed to use a testing kit for the new coronavirus it has developed in-state, according to an official involved in the process. “Upon FDA approval, which we believe is imminent, New York State’s public health laboratory, the Wadsworth Center, can immediately begin testing,” Jonah Bruno, a spokesman for the state’s Department of Health, wrote in an email. Public health officials say the ability to test locally and get results within hours will be critical to a rapid response to the fast-spreading virus that originated in China, causing a sometimes fatal respiratory illness, and has spread to 46 countries. The weeks-long struggle to expand local testing has been criticized as an early misstep in the response by US President Donald Trump’s administration to the outbreak. Three weeks ago, the FDA gave the green light for state and local labs to start using a testing kit developed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). But most labs that received the kits complained they had faulty components and produced inconclusive results, which the CDC later acknowledged. And in New York City, the kit they received was even more faulty than most, meaning city officials could not use a workaround released by the CDC this week. Meanwhile, it has had to courier samples to CDC’s laboratories in Atlanta, adding a day or more to the process. There are 63 confirmed cases of the new coronavirus in the United States, most of whom fell sick while abroad then were repatriated. No cases have been detected in New York City, but Mayor Bill de Blasio and health officials have said its arrival here is inevitable. Health officials in New York, impatient with the wait for replacement kits to be sent out, copied the CDC protocol in developing their own test kits. The CDC kits were meant to work by comparing a sample swabbed from a patient’s nose or mouth against three distinctive stretches of the virus’ genetic material, which are in small tubes labeled N1, N2 and N3. Most labs only had issues with the kit’s third component, N3. After reviewing their data, the FDA and CDC told labs this week that the tests would work fine if they only looked for the N1 and N2 bits of the virus, ignoring the faulty N3 component. But in New York, both the state lab and the New York City lab said that in their kits the N1 component was also flawed, and that the workaround proposed by the CDC and FDA was of no use. The CDC advised those labs also facing problems with N1 not to use those kits. “That was unacceptable to New York,” said Scott Becker, chief executive officer of the Association of Public Health Laboratories, which represents state and local public health labs. “A handful of labs had this issue. It wasn’t very many. But in the case of New York, where they were following multiple people under investigation and with all the global air travel, they really have an urgent need to bring up testing.” Becker said New York’s was the first public health lab in the country to seek the emergency authorization, and that the FDA said it would act fast after the application was filed. “They’ve said it’s possible to do it in a day or two,” he said. The FDA declined to answer questions about the emergency approvals. As of Wednesday, only seven state labs had the ability to test for the coronavirus locally. Meanwhile, the CDC has been working to manufacture new kits that produce more reliable results. In a hearing before the House Ways and Means Committee on Thursday, Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Alex Azar said a newly manufactured CDC test can be sent to 93 public health labs as soon as Monday. Jennifer Rakeman, an assistant commissioner at New York City’s health department and the director of the city’s testing laboratory in Manhattan, said that even once the replacement CDC kits arrive it would take time to make sure they work. “It could be a number of days, and could be on the order of a week or weeks,” she said.

Cameron Nightingale adjusts his mask and gloves, a precaution to protect himself from coronavirus while walking by cable car in San Francisco, California on February 27, 2020.  (Photo by Josh EDELSON / AFP / file photo) The filing, which was seen by the Washington Post and New York Times, was submitted by a senior official in the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) who said she was improperly re-assigned after raising her concerns and threatened with being fired if she did not comply. According to the two newspapers, the incidents were in relation to two California air force bases, Travis and March. More than a dozen workers were sent to each site. Travis Air Force Base is in Solano County, where the first US patient for whom the source of new coronavirus infection could not be immediately identified is from. That case appears to be the first of so-called “community spread,” signaling a new phase in the battle against the virus in the US. The complaint said the HHS staff were sent into quarantined areas in the two bases, including a hangar where the evacuees were being received. At times, these teams worked alongside personnel from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who wore “full gown, gloves and hazmat attire,” the complaint said. The Washington Post said the whistleblower had decades of field experience and received two department awards from health secretary Alex Azar last year. The deployments took place in late January and early February, the newspaper said. Afterward, the workers returned to their normal duties, some taking commercial flights back to their offices around the country. US President Donald Trump has downplayed the potential spread of the novel coronavirus in the country, a message seemingly at odds with senior public health officials who have urged Americans to prepare to cancel mass gatherings and work from home. As of Wednesday, there are a total of 61 confirmed cases in the US, including 46 of which relate to people repatriated from abroad. Tags: ncov"

While the number of new cases rose from 327 on Friday, they remain in the hundreds, far below the huge, daily increases that China was recording more than 10 days ago. The World Health Organization said earlier this week that there were now more daily cases abroad than in China. China has placed 56 million people in Hubei under strict quarantine for more than a month and limited crowds across the country in an unprecedented effort to contain the virus.

This was after Atty.

Aside from requiring IDs, anybody coming in will be checked with a non-contact infrared thermometer check to check their temperature. With this procedure, the Capitols’ security personnel and Emergency Responders of Iloilo (E-ROI) are conducting Rapid Health Assessment (RHA) of all people entering the premises. Based on the memorandum, visitors or clients observed with symptoms such as fever, colds, cough will be given surgical mask for precautionary measures. There’s also going to be rigid questions if visitors or clients have visited COVID-19 positive countries such as China, Hongkong, Macau, South Korea for the past 14 days or have any close contact with people who had travel history in those areas.

Garcia also disclosed that “the crew of the vessel allegedly turned off its Automatic Identification System (AIS) from February 19 until its arrival to the Philippine waters on February 23. The vessel has 18 Vietnamese and five Indian crew members onboard. Under maritime international protocols, all ships engaged in international voyages must be equipped with AIS in order to track their location and movement in the sea. Turning the system off is already a violation under maritime laws, the Coast Guard said. It was further revealed that the vessel only turned its AIS on when it already entered Philippine waters “from nowhere.” It was later found out that it came from China, prompting the Coast Guard and NCWC to alert the Port of Poro Point. Due to the captain’s misrepresentation of its date of departure from China, the Bureau of Quarantine team boarded the vessel to conduct the health inspection among its crew members. “The 14-day quarantine period dictates that MV Harmony 6 and other vessels that came from any country with reported cases of COVID-19 shall have a 14-day period from its date of departure from China to its arrival to the Philippine waters, before the Bureau of Quarantine (BOQ) may conduct health inspection among its crew that is needed for the issuance of port clearance,” Garcia noted. The vessel was declared under temporary detention at the anchorage area while the investigation on the ship’s two violations — misrepresentation and turning off the AIS– is underway. Garcia said the Coast Guard will coordinate with Bureau of Quarantine to identify possible criminal charges if MV Harmony 6 will be found guilty of the violations. Tags: ncov"

Department of Health Secretary Francisco Duque III (Facebook) Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said that one of the repatriates experienced cough while the rest experienced throat discomfort. Of the five individuals, two have already tested negative for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). “Their specimens were collected and sent for testing at the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine,” said Duque during a press briefing at the DOH-Central Office in Manila. “While we are still waiting for the other test results, we assure the public that our referral hospitals are well-equipped and prepared to handle COVID-19 cases once they arise. Our health response team at the quarantine facility is being extra cautious to prevent further health risks,” he added. To note, there are 458 persons under quarantine at the Athletes’ Village in New Clark City. Of the said figure, 445 were Filipinos repatriated from the M/V Diamond Princess cruise ship, while the 13 others were part of the Philippine repatriation team. Asked if there is a need to establish a medical isolation facility inside the NCC for the management of those who manifested symptoms of COVID-19, Duque said that “there has been no recommendation to that effect.” “NCC has a polyclinic but if we put them there what more? when can already bring them straight to the isolation rooms of our [medical] facilities,” said Duque. Meanwhile, eight of the ten Filipinos from the said cruise ship who have since recovered from COVID-19 are already back in the Philippines, said Duque. “I am told that they are back in the Philippines and since they have tested negative following the Japan protocol, I believe that they make not be quarantined but however, they have to be monitored closely by our local epidemiology surveillance officers,” said the health chief. Duque added that any recommendation or proposal to include Japan for a possible selective or absolute travel ban is up for the task force to consider. Updates on persons under investigation (PUIs); world situation The health chief reported that as of Friday afternoon, there are now only 30 PUIs admitted in various health facilities. “A total of 585 patients have already been discharged. To date, 531 PUIs have tested negative for the 2019 novel coronavirus,” said Duque. “We are observing a steady decrease in the number of PUIs admitted in our health facilities and DOH is bent on sustaining this downward trend. While there is a looming prospect of positive COVID-19 cases among our repatriated kababayans, we call on everyone to continue to be vigilant partners of DOH in keeping the threat of COVID-19 at bay,” he added. Meanwhile, there were a total of 85 confirmed COVID-19 cases among overseas Filipinos (OF) around the globe. “Japan recorded the most OF cases with a total of 80 —70 admitted, 10 discharged– followed by UAE and Hongkong, with two cases each, and Singapore with one case,” said the health chief. “COVID-19 continuously affects our kababayans overseas. The Philippine government remains at their service, and would devotedly extend our assistance wherever they are in the world,” he assured. Duque said that the COVID-19 has already spread in 37 countries outside of China, “but has observed a decline in the number of additional cases globally.” “WHO (World Health Organization) Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus particularly noted that nine countries, including the Philippines, reported no new cases of COVID-19 for more than two weeks,” said Duque. “While the DOH welcomes this positive development, we cannot be complacent. We must remain steadfast in watching out for the health of the Filipino people, particularly our repatriates in NCC,” he added.   Tags: ncov"

The Korean tourists had to be tracked down since they came from Daegu City, which was considered as the epicenter of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak in South Korea. Dr. Jaime Bernadas, regional director of the Department of Health-Central Visayas 9DOH7), said 12 of the Korean tourists were found staying in separate hotels in Lapu-Lapu City while the 14 others were staying in Cebu City. Although the foreigners showed no signs of COVID-19 so far, they were considered Persons Under Monitoring (PUM) since they came from a place with cases of COVID-19, said Bernadas. Bernadas said the DOH 7 was still waiting for instructions from its central office on how to deal with the situation. “They are confined in their hotels while we wait for new guidelines. Practically we treat them as PUM,” said Bernadas. DOH 7 personnel will be stationed in the hotels to monitor the foreigners. The monitoring will last for 14 days, and, if the need arises, the foreigners will be transferred to a quarantine facility, said Bernadas. Tags: ncov"

(CEBU CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY / FACEBOOK / MANILA BULLETIN) CCCI president Virgilio Espeleta in a media statement said that, in view of the urgency and the worsening COVID-19 outbreak, “we urge for a multi-stakeholder support and collaboration in finding ways to help each other survive by reaching a consensus on how we could unitedly move forward.” Espeleta said that the CCCI strongly recommends the following measures: • For the management sector to continue operating even at break- even levels or subsidize operations to keep the business going. • To exhaust all venues to keep their workers in the payroll, instead of resorting to layoffs; e.g. availment of leave credits, allow leave without pay (LWOP), shorter week work, training or upskilling sessions (allowances will do during training days), utilize people on special projects, research, maintenance or renovations. Espeleta encouraged business owners to voluntarily slice profits or dividends for the sake of survival and likewise be ready to implement strategies; e.g. thorough health checks and monitoring, and implement precautionary measures to protect their workforce while ensuring continuity of operations. “We trust the proper authorities are doing its best to contain and prevent the spread of virus in our country; but while we let them take charge of this threat, we in the business sector must do our part to maintain social and economic imperatives in the midst of disruption,”Espeleta said. The second recommendation was for the labor sector to forego demands and suspend collective bargaining agreements (CBA) provisions that are non-essentials at this point in time. CCCI also suggested that the labor sector cooperates with management on cost saving and survival measures and voluntary LWOP, reduced work week and submit to stringent health requirements and monitoring and the labor sector to allow management to just pay them allowances for non-core jobs and training sessions. Other sectors included in the recommendations were the banking institutions, commercial space owners, utility companies, industry players and the government sectors. The CCCI recommended that the banking institutions to grant reprieve on amortization and waive interest payments for a six-month period to troubled businesses, especially those that are just starting but are already challenged by the epidemic and could barely operate. The commercial space owners including mall operators are encouraged to grant rental holidays for a six-month period for those opting to close, or a cut on rental rates for tenants sustaining losses due to very low traffic. Utility companies were called upon to suspend some charges or at least reduce rates and to provide a leeway or moratorium on late payment penalties or notice of disconnection. The industry players are also requested to share costs or cluster themselves to take turns operating; e.g. like a group of three-to-four hotels to take turns operating while their bookings are referred to cluster partners and cut down rates and launching attractive domestic travel packages. Lastly, the Philippine government was requested to devise ways to help businesses survive the crisis by supporting the affected industries, especially the small, medium enterprises (SMEs) e.g. stimulus package, tax rebates and incentives, and loosening some financial regulations, specifically a lenient tax regulation to affected businesses. Espeleta said that copies of this exhortation/recommendation were sent to the Regional Development Council (RDC7), concerned regional government agencies, local government units, the whole Cebu business community and the media.

Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe gives a policy speech at the start of the regular session of parliament in Tokyo, Japan, January 20, 2020. (REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon/ File photo / MANILA BULLETIN) Abe said the government still had sufficient reserves to tap for emergency spending related to the coronavirus epidemic, signaling that he saw no immediate need to compile a fresh spending package. “But I’m aware of views that if the virus spreads, it could have a huge impact on the economy,” Abe told parliament. “We’re therefore watching developments carefully.” “If developments change, we’ll ensure to take steps as needed to prevent the virus from becoming a huge downside risk to Japan’s economy,” he said. Japan’s economy shrank at its fastest pace in nearly six years in the December quarter, as soft global demand and last year’s sales tax hike hurt consumption and business spending. Some analysts expect the economy to shrink again in the current quarter and slip into recession – defined as two straight quarters of contraction – as the virus disrupts supply chains, triggers cancellation of events and keep shoppers home. “It’s true Japan’s economy is in a pretty tough condition,” due to cancellations of various events,” economy minister Yasutoshi Nishimura told parliament on Friday. “But the priority now is to prevent the virus from spreading.” Japan’s government compiled a fiscal spending package late last year to counter the hit to exports from soft global demand. But some ruling party lawmakers are beginning to call for fresh spending given the damage from the epidemic. The Bank of Japan is wary of topping up an already massive stimulus program given the rising cost of prolonged monetary easing. Goushi Kataoka, one of the most dovish members of the BOJ’s nine-member board, said he saw no immediate need to loosen policy further. Tags: ncov"

Passengers remain onboard the MSC Meraviglia cruise ship in Cozumel, Mexico, awaiting a decision on whether they can disembark (AFP / MANILA BULLETIN) President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador told reporters that the Meraviglia, which has been anchored off Cozumel island in the Caribbean since Wednesday, “is being allowed to dock” and those aboard may be allowed off. “We cannot act inhumanely. Imagine the desperation,” he said, referring to the 6,000 people aboard. The operator, MSC Cruises, lashed out at authorities for refusing to allow it to dock at its previous destinations for “acting out of fears” over the new coronavirus. A crew member was being treated for seasonal flu. Carlos Joaquin, governor of Quintana Roo state which includes Cozumel, said the passengers and crew would be examined by doctors “who will verify the health issues on board.” “If there is a risk to health there will be no authorization for disembarkation,” he added. Quintana Roo Health Secretary Alejandra Aguirre said two people — a 27-year-old Filipino crew member and a 13-year-old French girl — had shown signs of a respiratory infection that was unrelated to the new coronavirus which countries around the world are battling to contain. “There are no coronavirus cases aboard the cruise ship,” she said, adding that tests were being conducted to find out the nature of the respiratory infection. A final diagnosis was expected at 10:00 pm (0400 GMT) after which the port’s captain will have the final say on whether or not the passengers can disembark, Aguirre said. A handful of people wearing masks took part in a protest at the dock on Wednesday, one man shouting: “We don’t want the virus in Cozumel.” Coronavirus has hit more than 45 countries and killed more than 2,700 people of the 81,000 infected, the vast majority in China. The first case of coronavirus recorded in Latin America was confirmed in Brazil on Wednesday. Mexico’s health ministry said it was analyzing a possible case in Mexico City. The Cayman Islands and Jamaica had refused to allow the ship to dock over the coronavirus fears. The cruise firm said it was “extremely disappointed” that Jamaican authorities delayed a decision to give the ship clearance despite having been provided with medical records. It said Grand Cayman authorities had also turned the Meraviglia away “without even reviewing the ship’s medical records.” “In both instances, the ship was effectively turned away simply based on fears,” MSC said. “No other cases of type A influenza have been reported on board MSC Meraviglia. Moreover, no cases of COVID-19 virus have been reported on board MSC Meraviglia or any other ship in MSC Cruises’ fleet,” added the company, referring to the new coronavirus. The situation recalled the US cruise ship Westerdam, which was at sea for two weeks after it was rejected by five countries over fears its passengers could be carrying the new coronavirus. It was finally allowed to dock in Cambodia. Tags: ncov"

Ill-equipped North Korea has a weak medical infrastructure and has cut itself off from the outside world, closing its borders as analysts say prevention is its only option. “The problem is that right now the North Koreans closed the borders,” Heusgen said after a closed-door Council meeting about the reclusive state. The members of the Security Council called on North Korea “to allow this equipment in. So the population can be protected,” he said, without elaborating on the type of equipment. Pyongyang has not reported a single case of the virus known as COVID-19 which has killed more than 2,760 people, mostly in neighboring China, while adjacent South Korea has more than 1,700 cases. Heusgen said the Security Council had no idea about the number of known or suspected cases of the new coronavirus in North Korea. “This country is closed so the information coming out of the country is extremely limited,” he said.

Iranian sanitary workers disinfect the Masumeh shrine in the Shiite holy city of Qom, where a prominent local member of parliament is among the latest people infected with the coronavirus (AFP Photo/MEHDI MARIZAD) Health ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour told a news conference that the tally of infections had risen to 245 with 106 more cases confirmed — the highest number for a single day since Iran announced its first infections on February 19. The Islamic republic has the highest death toll from the virus outside China, where COVID-19 first emerged. Among the latest coronavirus sufferers is one of Iran’s seven vice presidents, Massoumeh Ebtekar, who oversees women’s affairs. Ebtekar, a former spokeswoman for students who took 52 Americans hostage at the US embassy in Tehran in 1979, is being treated at home and members of her team have been tested, state news agency IRNA reported. Mojtaba Zolnour, head of parliament’s national security and foreign affairs committee, also contracted the virus, appearing in a video posted by Fars news agency saying he was in self-quarantine. The cleric is a deputy for the Shiite holy city of Qom in central Iran where the country’s first cases were detected. According to media reports, among the deceased in Qom on Thursday was theologian Hadi Khroroshahi, who in 1981 was named Iran’s first ambassador to the Vatican. The announcement by Zolnour comes two days after another top official, deputy health minister Iraj Harirchi, head of the government’s coronavirus task force, said he too had contracted the virus. – Must ‘not gather’ – On Wednesday, Iranian authorities announced domestic travel restrictions for people with confirmed or suspected infections.

A women with the first-known US case of the new coronavirus acquired through community transmission was admitted to UC Davis Medical Center on February 19, 2020 (AFP Photo/JUSTIN SULLIVAN) The development raises questions about whether other similar cases were missed and comes as the western US state said it was monitoring some 8,400 people for possible infection. The woman was admitted to the University of California Davis Medical Center on February 19 and quickly placed on a ventilator. The same day, her doctors asked to submit a sample for a coronavirus test to federal authorities, Representative Ami Bera told a congressional hearing. But it was not until February 23, after her condition had worsened, that there was “an insistence and a strong push and ultimately the patient did get tested,” added Bera, a doctor who once worked at the same hospital. He said he learned of the case details from former colleagues. It took another three days for the positive result to return, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Wednesday declared it the first suspected case of community transmission. This means the source of infection is unknown, a sign that the pathogen is no longer contained. If confirmed, the development represents a new and more complicated challenge in the battle against the virus in the US. Bera, who chairs the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Asia, the Pacific and Nonproliferation, questioned CDC director Robert Redfield, who said the agency’s testing guidelines were updated Thursday as a result of the case. “The recommendation should be when a clinician or public health individual suspects coronavirus, then we should be able to get a test for coronavirus, so that’s the current guidance that went out today,” said Redfield. The official testified that what made the coronavirus particularly difficult to recognize is that infected people can show no symptoms and spread it. Or, they may have only mild symptoms like a scratchy throat or dry cough. Brian Garibaldi, a public health expert at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Maryland, said he expected the number of cases being tested in the US to surge as a result of the new guidelines. Speaking at an earlier news conference in California, Governor Gavin Newsom said travelers arriving from affected areas were being monitored and sought to reassure the public that the risk of contracting the virus remains low. Newsom told reporters his team was working with the CDC on making improved testing methods the top priority. “We are not overreacting but nor are we underreacting to the understandable anxiety,” he said. He added the state had only 200 testing kits and had appealed for more from the federal government. Redfield later told Congress more tests were on their way.

People with surgical masks look on at station Tanah Abang, following the outbreak of the coronavirus in China, in Jakarta, Indonesia February 13, 2020. (REUTERS / Ajeng Dinar Ulfiana / File Photo / MANILA BULLETIN) The sprawling Southeast Asian country of more than 260 million people has not recorded any cases though some of its citizens overseas have contracted the virus, including eight crew on the Diamond Princess cruise liner off Japan’s Yokohama. Health Minister Terawan Agus Putranto said 134 test samples taken from people suspected of having the coronavirus had turned out negative. “If until this second all came out negative, then it’s a blessing from the Almighty,” he told reporters. Putranto said tests on two patients who died this week after suffering symptoms associated with contracting the virus had been negative. On Feb. 23, a Singaporean man died after reportedly suffering fever and shortness of breath in the city of Batam, but the head of the local health agency said this was due to another unspecified disease. The death of a 37-year-old man in Semarang in Central Java who was suffering pneumonia after returning from overseas was not caused by the coronavirus, but by H1N1 flu, he said. Researchers at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, in the United States, said in a study this month that Indonesia should strengthen outbreak surveillance and control – especially as it had direct flights from the central Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak. The Harvard team said Indonesia’s lack of confirmed cases “may suggest the potential for undetected cases” as air travel may contribute to cases being exported from China. WHO IS “QUITE CONFIDENT” Indonesia has barred entry to visitors who have been in China for 14 days and stopped all flights to and from there. Indonesia has tested relatively few people in comparison to some neighbors and its population, but Putranto said tests were conducted when “doctors determine they have symptoms that point to that direction.” “Imagine if everybody who had a cough or flu was checked, then millions would be checked,” he said. Navaratnasamy Paranietharan, the World Health Organization’s Indonesia representative, has said the WHO was “quite confident that Indonesia is ready to be able to respond to this situation.” Separately, Indonesia will send a Garuda Indonesia (GIAA.JK) plane in the next few days to Japan to pick up 68 of its citizens working aboard the coronavirus-affected Diamond Princess, officials said. The crew could be quarantined for up to 28 days on Sebaru island in the Java Sea north off Jakarta, where 188 crew members from another cruise ship are also being held in quarantine. The coronavirus has infected more than 80,000 people globally and killed nearly 2,800, the majority in China. READ MORE: Indonesia says nothing to hide after no coronavirus cases detected Tags: ncov"

People wearing protective masks are seen in the Shibuya shopping district in Tokyo, Japan, February 24, 2020. (REUTERS / Athit Perawongmetha / File Photo / MANILA BULLETIN) The dramatic escalation of Japan’s fight against the virus follows rising criticism of what has been seen as a lukewarm government response. “This coming week or two are an extremely important period,” Abe told a coronavirus task force. “Prioritizing children’s’ health and safety above everything else, we will ask all the elementary, junior high and high schools across Japan to temporarily close from March 2 to spring break.” The Japanese school year ends in March, with spring vacation usually starting the last week of the month. A woman working as a tour bus guide was reinfected with the coronavirus, testing positive after having recovered from an earlier infection, Osaka’s prefectural government said. Her case, the first known of in Japan, highlighted how much is still unknown about the virus even as concerns grow about its global spread. The number of cases in Japan rose on Thursday to more than 200, up from the official tally of 186 late on Wednesday. On the main northern island of Hokkaido, 15 new cases, including two children under the age of 10, were confirmed. The government has urged that big gatherings and sports events be scrapped or curtailed for two weeks to contain the virus while pledging that the 2020 Summer Olympics will go ahead in Tokyo. But its handling of the virus has drawn increasing criticism, including from opposition politicians. Abe got support from the International Olympic Committee as its head, Thomas Bach, told Japanese media the IOC is “fully committed” to holding the Games on schedule. Bach told a conference call the committee “is fully committed to a successful Olympic Games in Tokyo starting July 24,” Kyodo News reported. HOW DO I GO TO WORK? Abe’s sudden announcement about schools set off a flurry of worries on social media among parents now scrambling to arrange childcare. “My honest feeling – all schools on break? It’s important to protect children, but what happens if they have working parents?” wrote @Kogoro1982. The cases reported in Japan do not include 705 reported from an outbreak on the Diamond Princess cruise liner that was quarantined off Tokyo earlier this month. A man in his 80s died in Hokkaido after contracting the coronavirus, the prefectural government said, bringing the total number of people who have died in Japan to eight, including four from the ship. The woman who tested positive twice, a resident of Osaka, in western Japan, tested positive on Wednesday after developing a sore throat and chest pains, the prefectural government said in a statement. The woman in her 40s first tested positive in late January and was discharged from hospital on Feb. 1 after recovering, according to the statement. Though a first known case for Japan, second positive tests have been reported in China – one on Feb. 21 – where the disease originated late last year. The outbreak has spread rapidly and widely, infecting about 80,000 people globally and killing nearly 2,800, the vast majority in mainland China. Health Minister Katsunobu Kato said in parliament the government would need to keep tabs on the condition of those previously discharged, as health experts analyzed the implications of testing positive for the virus after an initial recovery. “Once you have the infection, it could remain dormant and with minimal symptoms, and then you can get an exacerbation if it finds its way into the lungs,” said Philip Tierno Jr., Professor of Microbiology and Pathology at NYU School of Medicine. Tierno said much remains unknown about the virus. “I’m not certain that this is not bi-phasic, like anthrax,” he said, meaning the disease appears to go away before recurring. Asked to comment on prospects for the Olympic Games going ahead this summer, Tierno said, “The Olympics should be postponed if this continues … There are many people who don’t understand how easy it is to spread this infection from one person to another.” SCALING DOWN EVENTS The health ministry said on Thursday that with the Diamond Princess still located south of Tokyo, about 240 foreign and Japanese crew members who have tested negative for the virus would disembark from the ship over the next few days. Those with no symptoms would remain at a facility near Tokyo for further monitoring, the ministry said in a statement. An official could not immediately confirm the total number of crew on board the ship, which was carrying around 3,700 people when it first docked on Feb. 3. Japan’s biggest trading group, Mitsubishi Corp, said it was telling all of its 3,800 staff in the country to work from home for two weeks starting Friday.

(Attilio Fontana Facebook Live / REUTERS TV via REUTERS / MANILA BULLETIN) Attilio Fontana, who has held repeated news conferences this past week to explain how his region is dealing with the flare-up, announced the news on Facebook late on Wednesday and videoed himself putting on a surgical face mask. “For now I don’t have any type of infection so I can continue to work … but for two weeks I will try to live in a sort of self-isolation,” he said on Facebook. More than 300 people have tested positive over the past week for coronavirus in Lombardy, which is centered on Italy’s financial capital Milan, and 10 people have died in the region. Across all of Italy, more than 400 people have contracted the disease and 12 have died — the worst contagion so far recorded in Europe. World Health Organization (WHO) executive committee member Walter Ricciardi has suggested that the numbers in Italy might be exaggerated, saying only 190 cases had been fully confirmed in a two-step verification process. The other samples were still awaiting results. Ricciardi, who is also a consultant for the government in its fight against the virus, told Corriere della Sera newspaper that Veneto, the second-most impacted region, had decided to test hundreds of people, even if they showed no symptoms. He said some them were testing positive, even though they were clearly not ill, adding that this was unnecessarily fuelling the alarm. “Whoever gave the order to test even those without symptoms … made a mistake,” he said. Local authorities said on Wednesday that some 9,462 tests had been carried out in Italy over the past week. Analysts have warned that the outbreak could shunt Italy’s fragile economy into its fourth recession in 12 years, with many businesses in the wealthy north close to a standstill and hotels reporting a wave of cancellations. Claudio Marenzi, head of fashion at the industrialist lobby Confindustria, said the textile and clothing sectors were taking a battering, with international buyers pulling their orders out of an irrational fear that the product might be infected. “There have been a wave (of cancellations) driven by news of the spread of coronavirus,” he told Il Sole 24 Ore daily. “Speaking with colleagues and associates, we can consider that 2020 is lost.” READ MORE: Coronavirus cases rise in Italy, with children among new cases Tags: ncov"

Both people had recently traveled to Iran as part of large groups of pilgrims from Pakistan’s Shi’ite Muslim community.Health officials have said both were “stable.” Authorities shut schools in the southern province of Sindh, including the country’s largest city Karachi where the first case was reported, and the southwestern province of Baluchistan, which borders Iran. They also began to trace nearly 8,000 pilgrims who recently returned to the country from Iran. Pakistan’s Civil Aviation said it was suspending all flight operations with Iran starting from Thursday evening till further notice. “We have decided to close the flights with Iran,” the aviation’s spokesman Sattar Khokhar told Reuters. Three Iranian carriers run seven flights a week to and from Pakistan. Pakistan closed its border with Iran on Sunday following the outbreak in the neighboring country. Twenty two people have died so far from the new coronavirus in Iran, the official news agency IRNA reported in a chart. Sindh’s Provincial Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah said the 28 pilgrims whom the first cases were part of had been traced and would be scanned and monitored. “We’re going to the next step,” he told a news conference in Karachi, adding that the Sindh government was out to trace all the 1,500 people who had returned to his province from Iran in the month of February. There are a total 8,000 such pilgrims across the country, he said. “We’re locating each one of them,” Shah said, adding they will go through 15 days of strict monitoring before being allowed to leave their homes. Shah said all these people and anyone who had got in touch with them had to be isolated. The authorities, who have kept more than 200 of the pilgrims in quarantine at the border, have stepped up scanning measures at airports and other border crossing, including western Afghanistan, said government health adviser Zafar Mirza. He called on the people to not panic. “We don’t need to worry unnecessarily. We shouldn’t create any kind of panic,” he told a news conference Wednesday night. The health ministry has launched a media campaign to educate people, urging them to cooperate with authorities to help identify any suspected cases.

A man holds a smartphone with an image of a cartoon of Taiwan’s Premier Su Tseng-chang promoting the prevention of the deadly coronavirus epidemic (AFP Photo/Sam Yeh) Police say they are investigating a surge of stories spreading online and through social media claiming President Tsai Ing-wen’s government was trying to cover up an outbreak. “We suspect that mainland Chinese Internet trolls are making up and spreading the false messages based on the content and the phrases,” Taiwan’s Investigation Bureau said in a statement late Wednesday. “The intent is to cause misunderstanding among the public and to sow panic to seriously jeopardise our social stability,” it added. Tsai, who won a landslide second term in January and is loathed by Beijing, took to Facebook to warn people against believing rumours. While she did not mention China by name, she hinted at linguistic clues suggesting much of the misinformation was being written outside of Taiwan. “Some of the rumours even contain phrases not used in Taiwan,” she wrote. One key language difference is that Taiwan uses traditional Chinese characters, not the simplified versions used on the mainland. Despite its cultural links and close proximity to China, Taiwan moved swiftly against the outbreak, quickly restricting and then banning arrivals from the mainland, Hong Kong and Macau. It currently has 32 confirmed COVID-19 cases, with one death. The coronavirus outbreak has only added to tensions between Taiwan and China. Beijing regards the self-ruled democracy as its own territory and has kept it frozen out of international bodies including the World Health Organization. And the island has long been a target for Chinese nationalist internet trolls seeking to undermine public faith in Tsai’s government. Analysts say trolls have got better in recent years at deploying traditional Chinese and Taiwanese phrasing. But much of the current misinformation on the virus appears to be more rudimentary. Examples of disinformation given by the Investigation Bureau was one false social media message claiming to be written by the child of a ruling party councillor saying Taipei “dares not disclose over 500 infections and 200 deaths”. Another false message alleged that the administration of “Governor Tsai,” a term used by mainland Chinese to refer to the president, was covering up the cremation of bodies, the bureau said. Taiwan’s FactCheck Centre — an independent organisation that debunks misinformation — said there has been a surge in false posts deploying simplified characters or common phrases used in mainland China. “New variants of such disinformation keeping coming out to spread falsehoods in an attempt to create panic,” the centre wrote. “We urge readers not to forward these messages but to verify and discredit them.” Tags: ncov"

Cruise liner MSC Meraviglia is pictured while waiting for permission to dock at Punta Langosta after two Caribbean ports denied the ship entry due to fears, later disproven, that a crew member was infected with the coronavirus, in Cozumel, Mexico February 26, 2020. REUTERS/Florent Serfari Global cruise operator MSC Cruises said that Mexican authorities approved its ship MSC Meraviglia to dock in Cozumel. The vessel, which started a tour of the western Caribbean from Miami, was due to arrive late on Wednesday or Thursday. Jamaica and Grand Cayman had earlier barred passengers of the ship from disembarking on fears that one crew member, who has since been diagnosed with common seasonal flu, might have been infected with the coronavirus. Cruise ships have been in the spotlight after confirmed cases of the coronavirus on the British-registered Diamond Princess approached 700 with three deaths since the ship docked at a Japanese port on Feb. 3. A document from Mexico’s Health Ministry reviewed by Reuters said the MSC Meraviglia had been granted “free pratique,” or permission to enter the Cozumel port based on the assessment that it presented no risk of spreading disease. It was not clear whether the ship’s passengers would be allowed to disembark in Cozumel. MSC Cruises said the person with the seasonal flu was isolated for security measures but that no other cases of type A influenza have been discovered on board – and no coronavirus infections have been reported on any of its ships. “The crew member who was diagnosed with common seasonal flu is in a stable condition, receiving anti-viral treatment and medication, and is now free of fever and nearly recovered,” it said. Alejandra Aguirre, health secretary of Quintana Roo state, where the Caribbean island of Cozumel is located, said, “We have information regarding the patient and fortunately it is not a case of coronavirus.” Coronavirus, believed to have originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan late last year, has infected about 80,000 people and killed more than 2,700, most in China.

Morrison is one of the world’s first leaders to acknowledge the threat of the virus spreading beyond global containment efforts.

FILE PHOTO: People wearing protective masks are seen in the Shibuya shopping district in Tokyo, Japan, February 24, 2020. REUTERS/Athit Perawongmetha The second positive test comes as the number of confirmed cases in Japan rose to 186 by Thursday from around 170 the day before. Tokyo has urged big gatherings and sports events be scrapped or curtailed for two weeks to contain the virus while pledging the 2020 Olympic Games will still go ahead in the city. The 186 cases reported by Japan’s health ministry are separate from 704 reported from an outbreak on a cruise liner that was quarantined off Tokyo earlier this month. A total of seven people have died, including four from the ship. The woman, a resident of Osaka in western Japan, tested positive on Wednesday after developing a sore throat and chest pains, the prefectural government said in a statement, describing her as being in her forties. She first tested positive in late January and was discharged from the hospital after recovering on Feb. 1, according to the statement. The health ministry confirmed the case was the first in Japan where a patient tested positive for coronavirus for a second time after being discharged from hospital, the Nikkei newspaper said. Though a first in Japan, cases of second positive tests have been reported in China, where the disease originated late last year. The outbreak has spread rapidly and widely, infecting about 80,000 people globally and killing nearly 2,800, the vast majority in mainland China. “Once you have the infection, it could remain dormant and with minimal symptoms, and then you can get an exacerbation if it finds its way into the lungs,” said Philip Tierno Jr., Professor of Microbiology and Pathology at NYU School of Medicine. He said much remains unknown about the virus. “I’m not certain that this is not bi-phasic, like anthrax,” he said, meaning the disease appears to go away before recurring. Asked to comment on prospects for the Olympic Games going ahead in Tokyo this summer, Prof. Tierno said, “The Olympics should be postponed if this continues … There are many people who don’t understand how easy it is to spread this infection from one person to another.” Japan has changed its strategy in combating the contagion, seeking to slow its spread and minimize the number of deaths.

A total of 19 South Koreans arrived in Iloilo for the Run for Jesus event, which was supposed to be held Thursday and gather 20,000 delegates, including South Koreans. Iloilo City Mayor Jerry Treñas and Iloilo Governor Arthur Defensor Sr. decided to cancel the event to reduce the risk of COVID-19’s spread after South Korea registered the most number of COVID-19 cases outside of China with at least 1,261 cases and 12 dead. Fortuna said that some of the 19 South Koreans were from Daegu, the city that is the epicenter of the increasing COVID-19 cases. The South Koreans were checked by the Bureau of Quarantine (BOQ) prior to their departure. “They did not show any symptoms,” said Fortuna. Of the 19, 14 flew out of Kalibo International Airport in Kalibo town, Aklan province that has direct international flights to South Korea. The rest left via Iloilo International Airport. Local authorities are tightening quarantine inspections, particularly of visitors from COVID-19-hit areas in South Korea. Tags: ncov"

,"February 27, 2020, 7:50 AM",nCov,European nations step up coronavirus measures,By Agence France-Presse,"By Agence France-Presse As Italy sees a surge in new coronavirus infections, other countries in Europe and European institutions have stepped up measures to combat the spread. These measures often extend steps already in place since the outbreak first started in China. – Quarantining travellers –
The European Commission has advised its staff who have travelled through the red zone of 11 northern Italian villages subject to Italian quarantine to self-isolate for 14 days or until notified. At the moment it is not recommending the reintroduction of border controls in the Schengen area. The European Parliament has issued a similar two-week self-isolation order for its staff, though for a larger Italian region comprising Lombardy, Piedmont, Emilia-Romagna and Veneto, as well as China including Hong Kong and Macau, Singapore and South Korea. The Romanian government has said that all those coming from Italy’s affected regions, China or from the ship Diamond Princess will be held in quarantine for 14 days. In France, citizens returning from Italian regions hit by the coronavirus outbreak have been instructed to avoid “all non-essential outings” for two weeks after their return and keep their children home from school. Britain has requested travellers returning from affected areas in northern Italy, China, South Korea and Iran to isolate themselves and inform the authorities. Six schools were closed in the UK while others asked pupils or staff members who had visited northern Italy to remain at home. Bosnia has also advised those who have travelled to affected countries to see a doctor and stay at home. The mayor of Hungarian town Eger closed the city’s swimming pool and ordered it disinfected after its water-polo team trained in it following their return from a match in Italy. – Travel disruption –
Countries including Austria, Britain, Hungary, Luxembourg, Romania, Spain and Ukraine have warned their citizens not to travel to the affected areas in Italy. Finland is urging citizens to exercise “extreme caution” when in Italy and notify consular services of their travel plans, while Denmark too recommends travellers should be cautious. Bulgaria Air has cancelled all flights between Sofia and Milan until March 27. Austria said there could be further limited border closures following the temporary halt of railway traffic at the Brenner pass on Sunday. Austria’s Carinthia state, on the border with Italy, postponed a cross-country skiing competition where 300 participants from northern Italy were expected. And French train conductors on national rail operator SNCF’s Paris-Milan line are being replaced by their Italian counterparts when they reach the border. Croatia has cancelled all school trips for the coming 30 days. – Screenings, onboard precautions –
Several countries have extended airport screenings for passengers with fever symptoms arriving from Italy. Such screenings are done in Budapest and Debrecen, Hungary’s second-largest city, as well as airports in the Ukrainian capital Kiev and on buses at Ukraine’s land border with Hungary. Meanwhile, Ukraine International Airlines onboard personnel will wear rubber gloves and masks on flights from Italy. Czech capital Prague’s airport has also earmarked special gates with targeted screening and “increased hygienic measures”. In Poland’s capital Warsaw, medical personnel are boarding planes from Italy for temperature checks before allowing passengers to disembark. In Croatia, people returning from the virus-hit Italian regions will be questioned by border police, epidemiologists and sanitary inspectors. And Serbia said it would introduce interviews and medical checks for passengers coming from “areas with a high transmission rate of the virus” in the past two weeks. – Other measures –
Sweden’s health agency said it would not waste resources on “ineffective” airport controls, as infected people may not show symptoms. But the country has earmarked 40 million kronor ($4.1 million) for the World Health Organization (WHO) to help countries cope with the spread of the virus. Denmark has set aside 8 million kroner ($1.2 million) for the WHO crisis fund. US petrol giant Chevron has urged employees at its Canary Wharf office in London to work from home to cut the risk of exposure. Tags: ncov"

Israeli paramedics at a coronavirus national operations centre unload a containment chamber during a response training exercise in the central Israeli city of Kiryat Ono (AFP Photo/JACK GUEZ) A designated hotline launched on Saturday has been fielding around 6,500 calls a day, according to the Magon David Adom emergency services. The coronavirus response centre in the central town of Kiryat Ono is to send experts to take samples from Israelis in home quarantine, including those who encountered a group of South Korean pilgrims who were later found to have been carrying the coronavirus. “People are anxious and worried. They call saying they were near the Korean tourists in Beersheba, but not at the same time. We explain they are not among the group at risk,” said Yael Arava, a paramedic trained to deal with coronavirus. Nearly 200 pupils who were in proximity to the South Koreans during their February 8-15 visit were ordered to stay home for 14 days. Anyone who was in contact with the group should self-quarantine, the health ministry said. Israel has only two confirmed cases of people testing positive for the new coronavirus, both from the Diamond Princess cruise ship. The health ministry on Wednesday called on Israelis to “consider refraining from the necessity of flying abroad at all”. Under anti-coronavirus measures, Israelis returning from Japan, South Korea, mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, Singapore or Thailand must observe a 14-day home-quarantine. Tags: ncov"

,"February 27, 2020, 7:50 AM",nCov,‘Emotional epidemic’: Coronavirus fear takes mental toll in Italy,By Agence France-Presse,"By Agence France-Presse The sweeping measures taken in northern Italy to try to contain Europe’s worst outbreak of the novel coronavirus are starting to take more than just a physical toll, with mental health professionals reporting some residents falling victim to anxiety.  Panic and anxiety are rising with the number of coronavirus cases in Italy, which is suffering through Europe’s worst outbreak (AFP Photo/Miguel MEDINA) As 50,000 people stay in lockdown in infection hotspots and tens of millions are affected by the closure of schools and other institutions, psychologists and psychiatrists say there have been concerning signs in some aspects of public behaviour. Rome-based psychiatrist Rossella Candela points to the empty shelves in supermarkets due to panic buying as one example. “Certain people adapt. But others react as if they were under bombardment in the Second World War,” she told AFP. The rush to buy face masks — which have now all but sold out in pharmacies in the country’s north — is part of the phenomenon, she says. After the first wave of panic, there then comes a low-level permanent sense of anxiety, fed by the disruption of normal routines in many different fields. “In our small Lombard villages, cancelling Mass is crazy, unprecedented,” says Alessandra Braga, a psychotherapist in Brescia, a city in the worst-affected Lombardy region. The closure of schools and offices means that “many people are just spending all day at home watching television programmes where people are only talking coronavirus, it’s completely anxiety-inducing,” says Braga, adding that she was encouraging patients “to go out, to get some air”. But, she says, “it’s like an emotional epidemic, and emotions are hard to control”. – Fear and racism –
While authorities are trying to reassure the population, it’s difficult to combat fear when one is confronted by “something intangible, invisible, like a virus,” says psychologist Gabriele Zanardi in Pavia to the south of Milan. He says that paradoxically, the most worried seem to be outside the areas most heavily affected, as they haven’t experienced the reality of the outbreak. As a result of the invisible nature of the condition, “people try to put a face to this invisible enemy, be it a Chinese person, someone with a cold,” Zanardi says. Milan’s Chinatown has been deserted for three days. In a region governed by former interior minister Matteo Salvini’s far-right League, many Chinatown business owners have avoided ostracisation by closing shops and restaurants. In Turin, after the first death from the outbreak was announced, a 40-year-old Chinese woman was attacked in the street by strangers who shouted: “You have the virus, go away or I’ll kill you.” “Italy has become a fearful country,” Mariella Enoc, the director of Rome’s Bambino Gesu hospital told La Stampa newspaper. “The phobias linked to this virus are getting the better of reason and scientific discourse,” she said. – Humour –
Among the psychologists that AFP spoke to, the biggest worry in the current climate is misinformation. A fake announcement that all Italian schools were staying closed until March 5 had to be denied by officials on Tuesday. And there has been no shortage of conspiracy theories: that the virus survives for six days on packages from China, that the outbreak was aimed at destroying Lombardy’s prosperous economy… But another human reaction in times of crisis — humour — has not been entirely absent. Braga recounts one of her patients joking that “after a week all stuck in the house, if the kids don’t die of coronavirus, I’m going to kill them myself!” “I think we’ve seen the peak of the uncontrolled terror of this past few days,” says Zanardi. “Life is slowly getting back to normal. People are getting used to it, the exceptional will become normal.” Tags: ncov"

Authorities have urged the public to exercise extra caution, advising citizens to stay home if they have a fever or respiratory symptoms (AFP Photo/Jung Yeon-je) Most of South Korea’s novel coronavirus are linked to the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, an entity often accused of being a cult. After days of mounting public anger, the secretive Shincheonji group handed over a list of 212,000 members, the government said. Local authorities across the country — which has more coronavirus cases than anywhere else outside China — will check if they have symptoms of fever or respiratory disease and put them in quarantine at home if so, said vice health minister Kim Gang-lip. Shincheonji claims its founder Lee Man-hee has donned the mantle of Jesus Christ and will take 144,000 people with him to heaven on the day of judgement. A 61-year-old female member developed a fever on February 10, but attended at least four church services in Daegu — the country’s fourth-largest city and the epicentre of the outbreak — before being diagnosed. The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported 284 new infections Wednesday — its largest daily increase to date — taking the overall national tally to 1,261, with the death toll rising to 12. The vast majority — more than 80 percent — of Wednesday’s new infections were in Daegu and the neighbouring province of North Gyeongsang, which between them account for the bulk of the national total. An American soldier stationed at Camp Carroll 30 kilometres (19 miles) north of Daegu tested positive for the virus, commanders said, the first infection among the 28,500 troops Washington stations in the South to defend it against the nuclear-armed North. The 23-year-old serviceman had been put in self-quarantine at his home, US Forces Korea said, adding it was conducting “contact tracing” to determine whether other soldiers had been exposed. The streets of Daegu — population of 2.5 million — have been largely deserted for days, apart from long queues at the few shops with masks for sale. Authorities have urged the public to exercise extra caution, advising citizens to stay home if they have a fever or respiratory symptoms. But they say they are not considering putting the city in lockdown the way China did for Wuhan, where the virus first emerged. Scores of events have been cancelled or postponed as the outbreak has spread in the world’s 12th-largest economy, from K-pop concerts to the start of the K-league football season and the World Team Table Tennis championships, while museums and other public venues have closed. In Daegu, Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun told a meeting the government would “mobilise all resources and means” to try to control the outbreak. South Korea has an advanced medical system, a free press and a strong culture of public accountability, and observers say that its health statistics can be treated with confidence. Tags: ncov"

Both cases are being taken care of according to clinical standard protocols & both of them are stable. No need to panic, things are under control”, tweeted health advisor Zafar Mirza. A statement issued by the southern Sindh province’s health department stated that the first positive case was reported in Karachi in a 22-year-old male with a “history of travel to Iran where he has acquired the virus.” The officials didn’t confirm where the second case was reported. However, local media said it was in Islamabad. With porous borders, creaking hospitals and large illiterate populations, Pakistan faces a potentially devastating health crisis from the new coronavirus. The virus has spread to more than 30 countries, killing over 2,700 and infecting 80,000, mostly in China. But new outbreaks in Europe, the Middle East and in Asia have fanned fears of the contagion taking hold in poor nations which lack the healthcare infrastructure to cope. There are growing fears in Pakistan over how the country would deal with the outbreak. Islamabad has a history of failing to contain infectious diseases such as polio, tuberculosis and hepatitis. Meanwhile Pakistan’s neighbour Iran has emerged as a major hotspot, with a total of 139 cases and 19 deaths. And Afghanistan, which also shares a border with Pakistan, reported its first case of coronavirus on Monday. While Pakistan has closed land borders with Iran, it has maintained air travel to and from China — increasingly a source of trade and commerce for the country. “There is a limited concept of prevention unfortunately. I fear it’s not well prepared at all for any health emergency,” Pakistani public health expert Arshad Altaf told AFP. Pakistan this week moved quickly to quarantine at least 270 people near the Iranian border after a group of pilgrims returned and briefly mixed with other residents. Ziaullah Langove, home minister in southwestern Balochistan province, said there were nearly 10,000 Pakistanis still in Iran, mostly students and pilgrims that Iranian officials were planning to send back in small groups.

US President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump arrive aboard Air Force One after returning from a two-day trip to India, at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, US, February 26, 2020. (REUTERS / Al Drago / MANILA BULLETIN) Trump, back from a 2-day visit to India, said on Twitter that he would meet with US officials for a briefing on the coronavirus later on Wednesday and hold a news conference. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infections Diseases who will brief the president, said while the virus is contained in the United States, Americans need to get ready for a potential outbreak. As person-to-person transmissions spread in other countries outside of China, including South Korea, Japan, Italy and Iran, the coronavirus is likely to spread further, he said. “Things are stable here … and at the same time we need to be ready to do things to contain an outbreak if it were to occur, Fauci told CNN in an interview. Officials at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in a shift, on Tuesday said the virus’ march across the globe had raised concern about community spread in the United States, even as it remained unclear if and when that might happen, or how severe it might be. The Republican president has been largely out of Washington since Feb. 18, first visiting a string of western US states before heading off to India. During his travels, he praised US health officials while publicly downplaying the possible spread of the virus and its impact on financial markets, saying he hopes it will disappear with the arrival of warmer spring weather in the United States. Trump has been increasingly alarmed at the drop in the stock market, which he considers a key barometer of economic health. He has repeatedly touted his administration’s decision to bar foreign travelers who had been to China within the virus’ 14-day incubation period and to funnel flights from China to specific airports for screenings. CDC officials, who Trump said would be at the 6 p.m. (2300 GMT) White House news conference, have advised Americans to not visit China and South Korea, and to exercise caution when traveling to Japan, Italy or Iran. The CDC is also considering expanding airport screenings to target passengers from countries that have seen a recent spike in cases such as Italy and South Korea, NBC News reported, citing the agency. Meanwhile, the Trump administration is seeking $2.5 billion from Congress to boost its virus response, but Democrats have warned that amount falls far short of what is needed. Both Republican and Democratic lawmakers grilled two top Trump officials – Health Secretary Alex Azar and Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf – about the nation’s readiness on Tuesday. House lawmakers will also hear from Fauci, Azar and other officials at a budget hearing Wednesday afternoon. Trump’s request also included $1 billion for a vaccine, something Fauci told CNN was in development but would take at least 18 months “at best” to come to market.

Three Gulf Arab states recorded their first new coronavirus cases this week, all in people coming from Iran, the UAE’s neighbor across the Gulf which on Tuesday reported a total of 16 virus-related deaths, the most outside China. “We are quite satisfied that we have taken all the necessary steps needed to preempt the spread of the virus at all levels, without pushing the country into a state of unwarranted panic,” the UAE official said. Egyptian investment bank EFG Hermes said this week it had decided to cancel its annual One on One investment conference in Dubai, which was due to take place from March 2-5. “The spread of the virus over the past three days to multiple countries from which we expect guests has underscored the importance of guaranteeing the health and safety of all our employees, clients and guests,” the bank said in an email to clients. The disease, which originated in China late last year, has infected about 80,000 people and killed more than 2,700, the vast majority in China. Bahrain said on Wednesday the total of people diagnosed with the virus had risen to 26, some of whom had traveled through the UAE. Bahrain has suspended flights to Dubai. Kuwait, which last week evacuated 700 people from Iran, has reported 11 cases and Oman four cases. Several Arab countries have suspended flights to Iran and other destinations and imposed shipping restrictions. Kuwait has barred foreign ships, except those carrying oil, from departing to or arriving from several countries, according to a Feb. 25 notice seen by Reuters.

A passenger shows an illustration of the coronavirus on his mobile phone at Guangzhou airport in Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China, 23 January 2020. (EPA-EFE / ALEX PLAVEVSKI / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN) The diagnosis comes during Brazil’s carnival holiday, a peak time for domestic travel when millions of revelers throng major cities for boisterous street celebrations. Brazil’s Health Ministry declined to comment on the result of the test ahead of a news conference at 11 a.m. local time (1400 GMT). The person familiar with the matter spoke on condition of anonymity because the results were not yet public. The ministry said in a statement on Tuesday evening it was looking into the case of a Sao Paulo resident who had traveled to Lombardy, in northern Italy, from Feb. 9 to Feb. 21 and had symptoms compatible with the disease. Italy has been most heavily affected by the outbreak in Europe, with more than 350 cases reported and 11 deaths. The Albert Einstein Hospital said in a statement that the man tested positive to a PCR real time test on Monday and it notified Sao Paulo state’s epidemiological agency on Tuesday. The new coronavirus is believed to have originated in a market selling wildlife in the Chinese city of Wuhan late last year and has infected about 80,000 people and killed more than 2,700, the vast majority in China. Concerns over the economic impact of the disease have wiped out more than $3 trillion of value on tumbling stock markets over the past four trading sessions. Brazil’s stock market, which has been closed since last week due to the carnival holiday, is set to open at 1 p.m. local time on Wednesday. Brazilian shares in exchange-traded funds in New York have dropped nearly 6% this week. READ MORE: COVID-19 cases multiply outside China Tags: ncov"

A passenger wears a protective mask near the booking office of Russia’s flagship airline Aeroflot at Sheremetyevo International Airport outside Moscow, Russia, February 4, 2020. (REUTERS/Maxim Shemetov/File Photo/MANILA BULLETIN) The complaint, detailed in an embassy letter to the city’s authorities and published by Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta late on Tuesday, deplored what it called “ubiquitous monitoring” of Chinese nationals, including on public transport in Moscow. Russia, which enjoys strong political and military ties with Beijing, does not currently have any confirmed cases of coronavirus, but has temporarily barred many categories of Chinese nationals from entering the country. Authorities in Moscow have also been carrying out raids on potential carriers of the virus – individuals at their homes or hotels – and using facial recognition technology to enforce quarantine measures. The Chinese embassy letter followed unconfirmed local media reports that Mosgortrans, which runs Moscow’s vast bus, trolleybus and tram networks, had told drivers to try to identify Chinese passengers and inform police of their presence. “The special monitoring of Chinese nationals on Moscow’s public transportation does not exist in any country, even in the United States and in Western states,” the Chinese Embassy letter, dated Feb. 24, read. “Given an improvement in the epidemiological situation in China, Moscow residents and Chinese people living in Moscow will be worried and won’t understand, and it will harm the good atmosphere for developing Chinese-Russian relations.” The embassy said it was asking Moscow authorities to refrain from taking what it called excessive measures and to embrace “proportionate and non-discriminatory measures” instead. The Kremlin said it was unaware of the embassy letter, but that Moscow valued its relations with Beijing and there should be no discriminatory measures against Chinese nationals. Russia’s Foreign Ministry, the Moscow city government and a representative of the Chinese Embassy did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Taiwan’s Foreign Ministry said this week that four Taiwanese visiting Moscow were picked up by police and health officials for wearing masks and being mistaken for Chinese, and were forcibly quarantined. Russia has had two confirmed cases of coronavirus so far. Both were Chinese nationals who have since recovered and been released from hospital. Asia reported hundreds of new cases on Wednesday, including the first US soldier to be infected, as the United States warned of an inevitable pandemic, and outbreaks in Italy and Iran spread to more countries.

Passersby wearing protective masks walk on a snow-covered street in Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan, February 26, 2020. (REUTERS / Issei Kato / MANILA BULLETIN) Japan had nearly 170 cases of infection from the virus as of mid-day on Wednesday, separate from 691 from a cruise liner quarantined at Yokohama port near Tokyo early this month. The northern island of Hokkaido, the most affected area with 38 cases, reported another death, bringing Japan’s total fatalities to six including four from the cruise liner. “We know that this virus will only spread even more and yet we can’t even get tested,” said one mother in Hokkaido’s Sapporo city, adding she hoped testing capacity would be expanded. Government guidelines say people should get tested if they have cold-like symptoms, a fever of 37.5 Celsius or extreme tiredness or breathing problems for four days or more. In the meantime, they should stay at home. The elderly, pregnant women or those with certain medical conditions that put them at risk should seek testing if they have such symptoms for two or more days, the guidelines say. “The most important goal of testing is to test those with symptoms, especially the elderly or those with pre-existing conditions who are at risk of becoming seriously ill,” a health ministry official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. “I think there are people who are worried and want to be tested but … that would overwhelm the capacity of medical facilities and we couldn’t treat those who need treatment.” South Korea, besides testing members of the church at the center of a surge in cases, advises people to get tested if they have a fever or respiratory problems. Japan since the start of the outbreak, has tested 5,740 people – 3,894 from the cruise ship, 829 people who returned on chartered flights from Wuhan, China, where the virus emerged late last year, and 1,017 domestic cases. The ministry official said more than 3,000 tests could be done every day under central government auspices. Masahiro Kami, a doctor and head of the non-profit Medical Governance Research Institute, said the government should test more people sooner. “They should test early and treat early but instead they are testing after people have pneumonia to confirm the virus,” Kami said. “Earlier is better.” But other independent experts agreed with the government approach. “It isn’t good to do tests just to ease public anxiety,” said Kentaro Iwata, an infectious disease specialist at Kobe University who this month criticized Japan’s handling of the virus-hit cruise liner. “If they test everyone with light symptoms, the medical system will puncture,” he said, adding authorities needed to do more to explain the guidelines and gain public understanding.

Britain has so far had 13 cases of coronavirus. An outbreak in northern Italy worsened on Wednesday, and the illness has spread to Spain, Austria, Switzerland, Croatia and France via visitors who were recently in northern Italy. The disease is believed to have originated in a market selling wildlife in the Chinese city of Wuhan late last year and has infected about 80,000 people and killed more than 2,700, the vast majority in China. In Britain, the random tests for the virus will be carried out at 11 hospitals and 100 general medical offices on people who have flu symptoms including a cough, plus shortness of breath and a fever. “This testing will tell us whether there’s evidence of infection more widespread than we think there is. We don’t think there is at the moment,” Cosford said. “The other thing it will do is, if we do get to the position of more widespread infection across the country, then it will give us early warning that that’s happening,” he said.

Commuters wearing masks in precaution of the coronavirus outbreak are pictured in a train during their morning commute in Singapore February 18, 2020. (REUTERS / Edgar Su / File Photo / MANILA BULLETIN) Singapore has won international praise for its fastidious approach in tackling the virus – which has included using police investigators and security cameras to help track suspect carriers. The wealthy island state, an important regional financial center and transport hub, has confirmed 91 cases so far. The health ministry on Wednesday said it had charged a 38-year-old man from Wuhan, the Chinese city where the virus first surfaced late last year, and his wife who resides in Singapore for allegedly providing false information to authorities about their movements for contact tracing. The husband had been confirmed to be infected with the virus in late January, and has since recovered, while his wife had been quarantined due to her close contact with him. The health ministry said “detailed investigations” had established their true movements and they were charged “in view of the potentially serious repercussions of the false information…and the risk they could have posed to public health”. Charges under the Infectious Diseases Act are rare and this is the first case during the coronavirus outbreak in Singapore. First time offenders under the Act can be fined up to S$10,000 ($7,147) or imprisoned for six months, or both. Also on Wednesday, Singapore said a 45-year-old man lost his residency status after failing to comply with an order to stay at home for 14 days when he returned from China. The city-state – known for its tough laws – has also canceled work passes and cut employers’ rights to hire foreigners for breaches of other virus prevention measures.

Ping An Good Doctor app, an online healthcare platform operated by Ping An Healthcare and Technology Co Ltd, is seen on a mobile phone in this illustration picture take May 3, 2018. (REUTERS / Florence Lo / Illustration / File Photo / MANILA BULLETIN) Due to the epidemic, hundreds of millions of Chinese are stuck at home due to quarantine restrictions imposed by authorities or companies. Even if not under quarantine, many are too worried to venture for long outside or to visit a hospital for other ailments as they fear they might catch the highly contagious virus. The surge of inquiries has also been driven by healthcare platforms offering some services for free amid the epidemic. JD Health, an arm of JD.com Inc (JD.O), has seen its daily volume of respiratory-related online consultations jump by nine times while mental-health consultations have grown five to seven times, according to Xiao Jianbo, the company’s general manager of online healthcare. “Most of the requests I’ve had between the end of January and mid-February were about the coronavirus,” said Liu Yafeng, a doctor who works fulltime for JD Health. “People are so worried even just by a sneeze.” Such is the state of fretfulness that “Always thinking I’ve been infected by the virus” has become a trending topic with more than 570 million views on Weibo, China’s Twitter-like microblogging platform. Liu said he worked around 12 hours per day from end January to mid-February, but in a positive sign that panic about the epidemic is receding, he is now working eight hours a day. Baidu Inc (BIDU.O) said its online doctor consultation platform Wenyisheng, which translates to “Ask Doctor”, has been handling around 850,000 free inquiries daily. Of those 400,000 were respiratory-related, around 50 times the level seen a year earlier. Alibaba Health Information Technology Ltd (0241.HK) said it exceeded 100,000 consultations a day on Jan. 29 and that some of its respiratory doctors were providing more than 200 consultations daily. It did not provide comparisons with pre-outbreak levels. Online healthcare has long been seen as a promising sector in China, where there is a dearth of doctors and patients often have to travel hundreds of miles to see a specialist. But the industry had struggled to win over customers and big listed firms like Alibaba Health and Ping An Good Doctor (1833.HK) have yet to turn a profit. Compared to other internet services, online healthcare is not used as frequently and does not benefit as much from word of mouth, industry executives say. “Health consultations are very private, so you don’t see a lot of people sharing their healthcare experience with friends or followers on social media,” said JD Health’s Xiao. The coronavirus has, however, reset expectations with shares in Alibaba Health surging 58% for the year to date while Ping An Good Doctor’s stock has climbed 33%. While analysts say more venture capital funding could soon flow into the sector, some industry veterans warn that the sector has a long way to go. “The outbreak has in fact educated the market, but I don’t think China’s online healthcare has really taken off because of this,” said Simon He, founding partner at Shanghai-based Eminence Ventures. That’s only going to happen with innovation in providing more services such as blood tests, he added. Tags: ncov"

In neighboring Veneto, the number of people confirmed to have caught the flu-like virus was 58, an increase of 13 on the previous tally given on Tuesday. The death toll from the contagion, which came to light on Friday, remained unchanged at 11. All those who have died so far have been elderly and most had underlying health problems. After first emerging in Italy in Lombardy and Veneto, the country’s economic powerhouse, the illness has now spread to seven other regions, including Sicily in the far south, with the total number of cases nationwide climbing above 350. Italians or people who had recently visited the north of the country have tested positive in Spain, Austria, Switzerland, Croatia and France since the weekend, showing how far and fast the illness – which was first identified in China last month – could spread. In bid to halt the outbreak, authorities have shut schools, universities, museums, cinemas and theaters across much of the north. Many countries have advised their nationals not to visit the north of Italy and hoteliers have reported a wave of cancellations, putting the local tourism industry at threat. “We should stay calm, there is no reason to be particularly afraid,” said Elisabetta Jacona, a Milan resident and doctor. “The only advice I can give, as a doctor, is telling people who are more at risk, elderly people or people with previous pathologies … to avoid going out.” Analysts have warned that the outbreak could shunt Italy’s fragile economy into its fourth recession in 12 years.

(JANSEN ROMERO / MANILA BULLETIN) These are Quiapo Church, the Manila Cathedral, and San Agustin Church. Many churchgoers welcomed the move. Melissa Calderon of Quezon City was one of them. “I would rather that ashes be imposed on my forehead rather than it be sprinkled on the crown of my head. I guess because I’m used to that. I’m glad that the mass I attended here at San Agustin did just that,” she said. Ricky Saplang of Sampaloc also felt the same way. “I still prefer the traditional way. But if ever it was sprinkled on my head, I’m also okay with it,” he said. Earlier, Manila Auxiliary Bishop Broderick Pabillo said in order to reduce the risk of transmission of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID 19) during the liturgical celebration on Ash Wednesday, ashes can be distributed by sprinkling a small portion of blessed ash on the crown of the head of the faithful. But the Apostolic Administrator of the Archdiocese of Manila said the marking of ashes on the forehead remains an option for parishes and communities at the discretion of their pastors. The Catholic Bishops’ Conference of the Philippines earlier also recommended the same thing. The Dioceses of Dipolog and Kidapawan also retained the practice of placing ashes on the foreheads. Ash Wednesday signifies the start of the Lenten season which is usually observed with fasting, prayer, and almsgiving. Tags: ncov"

Broadcaster ORF said the nine people from the hotel were hotel staff who worked with the woman rather than guests. A spokesman for the provincial government said the lockdown at the 108-room hotel opposite the city’s main rail station had ended overnight. The infected man and woman, both 24, last week visited their home town near Bergamo in Lombardy, one of the two Italian regions at the center of Europe’s worst outbreak. They drove to Innsbruck on Friday, a hospital doctor treating them told a news conference on Tuesday. While the woman works at the hotel in Innsbruck, a hub for Alpine tourism less than an hour’s drive from the Italian border, her boyfriend was visiting, officials said. Neighboring Italy has become a frontline in the global outbreak of the virus, with 280 cases and 10 deaths, most in Lombardy and nearby Veneto. On Sunday night Austria shut down rail travel between Germany and Italy by denying entry to a train from Venice because of two suspected coronavirus cases among the passengers. The train was only let through when those two passengers’ tests came back negative. Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said the procedure would be repeated if others suspected of carrying the virus arrived at Austria’s borders. Tyrol is a vital transport corridor between Italy and Germany, and includes the very busy Brenner Pass. More than half the freight crossing the Alps passes through Austria. The new coronavirus has killed more than 2,600 people, most in China, and spread to 29 other countries, according to a Reuters tally. The number of confirmed cases globally has risen above 80,000.

Pyongyang insists that it remains the only one of China’s neighbours not to have had a single case of the new coronavirus (AFP Photo/STR) The authoritarian state, led by the ruling Kim family since its foundation in 1948, maintains extensive control over the lives of its citizens and is pulling out all the stops to try to protect itself from the virus that first emerged in neighbouring China, long its key diplomatic ally and trade partner. After the virus emerged it quickly closed its borders, cutting itself off from the outside world in a move diplomats and analysts say is its best method of self-protection given the weakness of its health infrastructure. Arrivals are subject to 30 days’ isolation and it has stepped up its efforts internally, with the official KCNA describing an intensifying “anti-virus campaign”, including door-to-door health check-ups and loudspeaker vans instructing citizens on hygiene practices around the country. Foreigners are facing tough restrictions: all of those resident in the country have been subjected to quarantine at their premises since the beginning of February. Diplomats in Pyongyang have unable even to walk around the city in what the Russian ambassador described as a “morally crushing” situation. The embassy had been “left without diplomatic mail… we did not manage to get medicines and supplies for our first-aid post”, Alexander Matsegora told Russia’s TASS news agency. Staff could only leave the premises — which have a prime location in Pyongyang close to the Workers’ Party leadership compound — to take rubbish to a landfill, when “Korean specialists immediately disinfect our truck at the gates of the embassy”. The city’s Orthodox church, taekwondo gym, skating rink and swimming pool were all off-limits, as were Korean and painting classes. “They may seem trifles, but everyday life is made of them.” Diplomatic work had been virtually suspended, he added, with no meetings, conversations or negotiations with North Korean officials or other embassies, while contact with the authorities was limited to phone calls or official notes dropped into a special mailbox. Only a country as “unique” as the North could take such a decision to address “a problem of national importance” and implement it, he said, describing the situation as “extraordinary”. “In material terms, self-isolation is of course very expensive for the Korean state,” he added. But it would always be willing to pay that price, he went on: “It is very important to understand that the issues of state security, the ideology and dignity of the country — in its North Korean understanding, of course — always and definitely prevail over economic considerations.” Those who expect sanctions to force the North to make concessions over its nuclear arsenal — negotiations between Pyongyang and Washington are currently deadlocked — should recognise that reality, he added. – ‘Irreversible catastrophic consequences’ –
The novel coronavirus now known as COVID-19 originated in the central Chinese city of Wuhan and has since spread around the world, killing more than 2,700 people. South Korea has seen a rapid surge of cases in recent days, to well over 1,100, giving it the largest national tally outside China. But Pyongyang insists that it remains the only one of China’s neighbours not to have had a single case. Observers doubt that, but the Rodong Sinmun, the official mouthpiece of the Workers’ Party, urged citizens to show “absolute obedience” to instructions from health authorities and the state. “We should bear in mind that any moment of complacency could result in irreversible catastrophic consequences and should maintain a high state of alert,” it said. Earlier this week it warned of “devastating consequences” if the country suffers even one case of coronavirus, recommending people avoid gathering in public places — even restaurants. “Sitting down and dining together and talking with each other can itself become the main spreading ground of the infectious disease,” it said. But state duties do not appear to be subject to such restrictions: on Wednesday it carried pictures of scores of Supreme People’s Assembly officials lining up to visit the supposed birthplace of Kim Jong Il, the father and predecessor of the current leader Kim Jong Un, at Mount Paektu.

Based at Camp Carroll 30 kilometres (19 miles) north of Daegu, the serviceman has been put in self-quarantine at his home, US Forces Korea said, adding it was conducting “contact tracing” to determine whether other soldiers had been exposed. Meanwhile, South Korean authorities reported 169 new infections, taking the overall national tally to 1,146, by far the largest outside China. An 11th person has died of the disease, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) said — a Mongolian man in his 30s who became the first foreign national to fall victim to the outbreak. Yonhap news agency reported that he had been in hospital in South Korea awaiting a liver transplant. The vast majority — 90 percent — of the new infections were in Daegu, the country’s fourth-largest city and the epicentre of the outbreak, and the neighbouring province of North Gyeongsang. Between them they account for the vast bulk of the national total. The streets of Daegu — which has a population of 2.5 million — have been largely deserted for days, apart from long queues at the few shops with masks for sale. Authorities urged the public to exercise extra caution, advising citizens to stay home if they have a fever or respiratory symptoms. But they say they are not considering putting the city in lockdown the way China did for Wuhan, where the virus first emerged. In Daegu, Prime Minster Chung Sye-kyun told a meeting the government would “mobilise all resources and means” to try to control the outbreak. Chung is leading the government response in Daegu and said it was seeking to return the city to normality within four weeks, adding this week was the “pivotal time to determine victory or defeat” in the fight against coronavirus. South Korea has an advanced medical system, a free press and a strong culture of public accountability, and observers say that its health statistics can be treated with confidence. Most of the country’s infections are linked to the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, an entity often accused of being a cult that commands around 200,000 followers. A 61-year-old female member developed a fever on February 10, but attended at least four church services in Daegu before being diagnosed. KCDC director Jung Eun-kyeong advised Shincheonji followers to refrain from going outside “as much as possible”. With public criticism growing, Shincheonji’s founder Lee Man-hee, aged 88, said the group would provide the government a list of all its members to enable them to be tested for the virus. Tags: ncov"

The government has contacted 813 former passengers of the Diamond Princess. Around 970 were allowed off the boat last week after testing negative for the virus, but several have subsequently been found to be carrying the disease. The ministry found “45 people had certain symptoms,” health minister Katsunobu Kato told parliament. “We asked all of them (who have symptoms) to see a doctor and to take tests,” Kato said. Japan has come under increasing pressure over its handling of the crisis on the vessel, particularly after it emerged that some passengers allowed to disembark after testing negative were subsequently diagnosed with the virus. Those allowed off the ship after a 14-day quarantine were asked to stay inside, but no formal measures restricting their movement were imposed. As of Wednesday, at least two former passengers in Japan were confirmed infected despite previously testing positive. Foreign passengers who said they had initially tested negative have also been diagnosed with the virus after being repatriated to Australia and Hong Kong. Opposition lawmakers have blamed the government for failing to implement a fresh 14-day quarantine after the passengers left the cruise ship. Countries that repatriated their citizens have required them to undergo another isolation period, suggesting they believe the on-ship quarantine was flawed.

Treñas and Governor Arthur Defensor Jr. of Iloilo province held an emergency meeting after learning that organizers were still preparing the stage for the Run for Jesus event on Thursday despite an earlier advisory that major events with large number of participants have to be postponed. “The city government had to cancel all permits issued,” Treñas pointed out.

The three were immediately sent by ambulance to a hospital for isolation and testing, while 94 people who had sat near them on the plane were sent to a hotel to be quarantined, CCTV said. None of the three people with fevers had any history of travel to Wuhan, the city where the outbreak originated.

Seoul reported the country’s 11th death from the virus and 169 new infections Wednesday, taking its overall tally to 1,146 cases — by far the largest tally outside China. Most of China has been placed under travel restrictions since late January, with hard-hit Hubei province under virtual quarantine, and local governments have required travellers from other parts of the country to submit to health checks and quarantines.

Presidential Spokesman Salvador Panelo(OPS / MANILA BULLETIN) It is also banning travelers from South Korea’s North Gyeongsang province amid the rise of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases in the area. Presidential spokesman Salvador Panelo announced this after South Korea confirmed 169 more cases of the disease, raising the total number of infections to 1,146. “The Inter-Agency [Task Force] has authorized Filipinos to travel to South Korea, provided they are permanent residents thereof, or leaving for study, or are OFWs. They are to execute and sign a declaration signifying their knowledge and understanding of the risk involved prior to their travel,” he said. “Yes [Filipino tourists are not allowed]. For their own safety,” he added. According to Panelo, the Inter-agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID) shall conduct a risk assessment of the situation within 48 hours to analyze whether it is necessary to expand the travel ban. In the meantime, he said, strict protocols on travelers entering the country from North Gyeongsang province will be observed. “The safety of Filipinos here and abroad remains our primary concern. Our countrymen’s welfare is foremost in the mind of the President and as well as concerned officials,” Panelo said. “They will be discussing this matter and make recommendations with respect to the management of the coronavirus.” While COVID-19 infections continue to rise in South Korea, Labor Secretary Silvestre Bello III said they have not received any request for repatriation from overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) there. Fortunately, no Filipino has been infected so far, Bello said, adding that there are about 60,000 Filipino workers in South Korea. “Most of them are factory workers. Some work in wellness. We have many skilled workers there and very few household service workers,” said Bello. READ MORE: No repatriation request yet from OFWs in South Korea – Bello Quarantine begins Meanwhile, a total of  445 Filipino crew members and passengers of the mammoth cruise ship finally made it home Tuesday night and are now under the care of Philippine health authorities after spending a tormenting 20-day restriction inside coronavirus disease (COVID-19)-hit MV Diamond Princess in  the port of Yokohama, Japan. The 445 Filipino cruise ship crew members and passengers, along with the 13 members of the government repatriation team and the crew of the Philippine Airlines (PAL) flight, were taken to the Athletes’ Village in New Clark City in Tarlac for the 14-day quarantine program of the Department of Health (DOH) at past midnight Wednesday. The Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA), one of the key agencies tasked to execute the elaborate repatriation plan, declared the entire operation a “success” shortly after the repatriates were taken to the quarantine area. The DFA said all arrangements upon arrival were handled as agreed upon in the Inter-Agency Task Force Resolution 07 issued on Feb. 21, 2020. The trek back of 445 Filipino crew members and passengers to the Philippines started on Tuesday morning after the release of negative laboratory results of tests conducted by the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (MHLW). Based on the DFA account, the repatriates were allowed to disembark from the ship and transfer by bus to Haneda airport, an operation strictly overseen by and coordinated with the Japan Self Defense Forces. The first flight, which carried 309 passengers, as well as a two-member repatriation team from the DFA and a four-member health response team from the DOH arrived at Clark Airbase at 10:10 p.m. of February 25. The second flight, with 136 passengers in addition to a two-member DFA team and a five-member team from the DOH, arrived at 12:12 a.m. of February 26. Both flights were received at the Haribon Hangar in Clark Airbase, Pampanga. The MV Diamond Princess carried a combined total of 538 Filipino crew and passengers of which 80 persons tested positive for COVID-19 and have been admitted to Japanese hospitals. The cruise ship was put under quarantine in Yokohama port since February 5, after one of its passengers tested positive for COVID-19. Meanwhile, Senator Juan Edgardo “Sonny” Angara said the Duterte government should urgently craft a “resilience plan” that will allow the economy “to deftly evade” the brunt of the COVID-19 and the shutdown of plants and back offices of Honda, Wells Fargo, and other multinationals in the country. He made the call as he initiated a series of hearings that will draw a roadmap to create Philippine world-class products and services that will proudly bear the country’s brand. “Yes, there is no vaccine yet against the virus. But, in terms of protecting our economy, in increasing its defenses, I believe that government must have a contingency plan,” said Angara, who chairs the Senate finance committee.

Iranian couple wearing protective masks to prevent contracting a coronavirus walk at Grand Bazaar in Tehran, Iran February 20, 2020. (Reuters / MANILA BULLETIN FILE PHOTO) Iran’s coronavirus death toll rose to 16 on Tuesday, the most outside China, while Italy reported its 11th death. The virus has jumped to about 30 countries and territories, with some three dozen deaths outside China, according to a Reuters tally. Worsening infections in Iran, Italy, and South Korea are of particular concern, world health officials said. South Korea and Italy stepped up emergency measures to help curb the virus’ global spread. Believed to have originated from wildlife in Wuhan city late last year, the flu-like disease has infected 80,000 people and killed close to 2,700 in China. But the World Health Organization (WHO) said the outbreak there has been declining since Feb. 2. Dr. Nancy Messonnier, an official at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), told reporters that data on the virus’ spread over the past week had heightened the agency’s expectations of transmission within the United States. “Disruption to everyday life might be severe,” she cautioned. While saying the immediate risk from the coronavirus in the United States remained low, another top CDC official, Dr. Anne Schuchat, said it was no longer a question of if the virus would become a global pandemic. “It’s a question of when and how many people will be infected.” The Dow and S&P 500 tumbled 3% on Tuesday in their fourth straight day of losses as investors struggled to gauge the virus’ economic impact. Iran’s outbreak, amid mounting US sanctions pressure, threatens to leave it further cut off. Several countries suspended flights and some of its neighbors closed their borders, while Oman’s Khasab port halted imports and exports with Iran. “It is an uninvited and inauspicious visitor. God willing we will get through … this virus,” Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said in a televised speech. Iran’s deputy health minister and a member of parliament were among those infected. Afghanistan, Iraq, Kuwait Bahrain and Oman this week reported their first cases, all in people who had been to Iran. Bahrain said it now has 24 confirmed cases. Iran canceled concerts and soccer matches nationwide, and schools and universities closed in many provinces. Many Iranians took to social media to accuse authorities of concealing facts. Tehran says US sanctions are hampering its response to the coronavirus by preventing imports of masks and medicines. A top WHO expert urged countries to step up preparations. “Think the virus is going to show up tomorrow,” Bruce Aylward, head of the joint WHO-Chinese mission on the outbreak, told reporters on his return to Geneva. “If you don’t think that way, you’re not going to be ready.” US Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar on Tuesday asked a Senate subcommittee to approve $2.5 billion in funding to expand surveillance systems for the virus, help development of vaccines and boost stockpiles of protective equipment. In South Korea, which has the most coronavirus cases outside China with 977 infections and 10 deaths, authorities were testing all the estimated 215,000 members of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus. The country’s outbreak is believed to have begun in the city of Daegu with a 61-year-old woman who is a member of its congregation. There was misery too for 34 South Korean newlyweds whose honeymoons on the Indian Ocean island of Mauritius became a holiday from hell after they were put in isolation. In Europe, Italy is the front line with more than 280 cases, as the outbreak is spreading from its origins in the northern regions of Lombardy and Veneto. Italy’s tourist industry, which accounts for about 13% of its economy, fears a plunge amid travel warnings and restrictions on soccer matches, cinemas, and theaters. Italy’s health minister, Roberto Speranza, said neighboring countries had agreed not to close their borders, calling such a step “disproportionate … at this time.” But airlines began restricting flights to Italy, prices of protective gear skyrocketed, a planned shoot in the country for Tom Cruise’s seventh “Mission: Impossible” movie was postponed, Milan cathedral was closed and the Venice carnival canceled. Switzerland, Austria, and Romania reported their first cases, all in people who had been to Italy. Algeria and Croatia also recorded their first infections. Spain reported its first case on the mainland, a woman from Barcelona who had also visited northern Italy, while a four-star hotel on Tenerife was in lockdown after a couple tested positive there. China reported a rise in new cases in Hubei province, the outbreak’s epicenter. But excluding those, it had just nine new infections on Monday, its fewest since Jan. 20. Beijing said restrictions on travel and movement that have paralyzed activity in the world’s second-largest economy should begin to be lifted. In an example of the outbreak’s global ripple effects, experts said travel restrictions introduced uncertainty in the timeline for Apple’s introduction of new iPhone models later this year since engineers would normally be in Asia now ironing out assembly processes.

(REUTERS/Amanda Voisard./File Photo / MANILA BULLETIN) The announcement signaled a change in tone for the Atlanta-based US health agency, which had largely been focused on efforts to stop the virus from entering the country and quarantining individuals traveling from China. “The data over the past week about the spread in other countries has raised our level of concern and expectation that we are going to have community spread here,” Dr. Nancy Messonnier, the CDC’s head of respiratory diseases, told reporters on a conference call. What is not known, she said, is when it will arrive and how severe a US outbreak might be. “Disruption to everyday life might be severe” and businesses, schools and families should begin having discussions about the possible impact from the spread of the virus, Messonnier cautioned. In a teleconference later on Tuesday, Dr. Anne Schuchat, the CDC’s principal deputy director, said that while the immediate risk in the United States was low, the current global situation suggested a pandemic was likely. “It’s not a question of if. It’s a question of when and how many people will be infected,” Schuchat said. Separately, US Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Alex Azar told a Senate subcommittee there will likely be more cases in the United States, and he asked lawmakers to approve $2.5 billion in funding to fight the outbreak after proposing cuts to the department’s budget. “While the immediate risk to individual members of the American public remains low, there is now community transmission in a number of countries, including outside of Asia, which is deeply concerning,” Azar said, adding that recent outbreaks in Iran and Italy were particularly worrying. Believed to have originated from illegal wildlife sold in the Chinese city of Wuhan late last year, the new coronavirus has infected some 80,000 people and killed close to 2,700 in China. Although the World Health Organization says the epidemic has peaked in China, coronavirus cases have surfaced in about 30 other countries, with some three dozen deaths reported, according to a Reuters tally. Growing outbreaks in Iran, Italy and South Korea have raised concerns that coronavirus will surface in other nations and worsen in those that have already reported infections, further denting a global economy that had already been hit by a dependence on China. Global and US stock markets fell sharply again on Tuesday, as investors feared the epidemic would further damage an already slowing world economy.[nL1N2AP0YR][nL1N2AP11A] The White House’s top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, said the US economy would be able to ride out any disruption from the global spread of coronavirus, adding that he did not expect the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates to blunt the disease’s economic impact. US Senator Chuck Schumer, however, said Republican President Donald Trump and his administration had been caught “flat-footed” and lacked a comprehensive plan to deal with the coronavirus. He called for at least $3.1 billion in additional funding to fight it. “The Trump administration has shown towering and dangerous incompetence when it comes to the coronavirus,” said Schumer, the Senate’s top Democrat. “Mr. President, you need to get your act together now. This is a crisis.” Dr. Anthony Fauci, the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said it would be at least a year before a coronavirus vaccine could be made available to the public. But Fauci said testing Gilead Sciences’ (GILD.O) antiviral drug remdesivir for potential treatment of coronavirus could be done in a “reasonable amount of time.” US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told reporters that Iran may have covered up information about the spread of coronavirus there, and he accused China of mishandling the epidemic through its “censorship” of media and medical professionals. “The United States is deeply concerned by information indicating the Iranian regime may have suppressed vital details about the outbreak in that country,” Pompeo told reporters as Iran’s coronavirus death toll rose to 16. “All nations, including Iran, should tell the truth about the coronavirus and cooperate with international aid organizations,” Pompeo said. His remarks, coming less than two months after a short-lived US-Iranian military clash and the signing of a US-China trade deal, could inflame tensions with Tehran and Beijing. Beijing last week revoked the credentials of three Wall Street Journal correspondents over a column China said was racist. The United States has said it was considering a range of responses to their expulsion. “Expelling our journalists exposes once again the government’s issue that led to SARS and now the coronavirus: namely censorship. It can have deadly consequences,” Pompeo said, referring to the 2002-2003 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, which also emerged from China. “If China permitted its own and foreign journalists and medical personnel to speak and investigate freely, Chinese officials and other nations would have been far better prepared to address the challenge” of coronavirus, he added. Despite the coronavirus epidemic, Pompeo said the United States still planned to host a special meeting with the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in Las Vegas in March.

US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo addresses reporters at the State Department (AFP Photo/Brendan Smialowski) “The United States is deeply concerned by information indicating the Iranian regime may have suppressed vital details about the outbreak in that country,” Pompeo told reporters in Washington. “All nations including Iran should tell the truth about the coronavirus and cooperate with international aid organizations,” he said. Iran has reported 15 deaths from the epidemic, more than in any country other than China. Both countries are considered top adversaries by President Donald Trump’s administration. The Iranian government has pledged greater transparency after a lawmaker alleged that the clerical regime was playing down the outbreak and that the toll could be as high as 50. Pompeo said that both China and Iran could have better contained coronavirus if they allowed free expression and he saluted foreign journalists who have reported on the epidemic. “If China permitted its own important journals and medical personnel to speak and investigate freely, Chinese officials and other nations would have been far better prepared to address the challenge,” Pompeo said. Pompeo said that the United States had quarantined all people known to have contracted the virus and that Washington would take further “appropriate action” if needed. Tags: ncov"

The ‘Noah’s Ark’ of food crops is set up to preserve plants that can feed a growing population facing climate change (AFP Photo/Lise Åserud/MANILA BULLETIN) Mounting concern over climate change and species loss is driving groups worldwide to add their seeds to the collection inside a mountain near Longyearbyen on Spitsbergen Island in Norway’s Svalbard archipelago, about 1,300 kilometers (about 800 miles) from the North Pole. The “Noah’s Ark” of food crops is set up to preserve plants that can feed a growing population facing climate change. “As the pace of climate change and biodiversity loss increases, there is new urgency surrounding efforts to save food crops at risk of extinction,” said Stefan Schmitz, who manages the reserve as head of the Crop Trust. “The large scope of today’s seed deposit reflects worldwide concern about the impacts of climate change and biodiversity loss on food production.” The head of the genetic bank of the Nordic nations, Lise Lykke Steffensen, said every single seed in the vault “holds potential solutions for sustainable agriculture.” “Solutions that are vital for feeding a growing population and achieving a green transition,” she added. ‘Before it’s too late’ A total of 36 regional and international institutions have contributed to the 60,000 samples that were deposited on Tuesday. The new arrivals include staple crops such as wheat and rice, as well as wild varietes of European apple trees. Also among the seeds are beans, squash and corn from the Cherokee Nation — the first Native American group to send crops to the vault — including their sacred White Eagle corn. Britain’s Prince Charles, who is known for his environmental advocacy, sent the seeds of 27 wild plants, including cowslips and orchids collected from the meadows of Highgrove, his country home. “It has proved to be an exhausting and often demoralizing task to persuade people of the utterly essential role played by all this diversity in maintaining vibrant, healthy ecosystems that sustain both people and our planet,” the Prince of Wales said in a statement. “It’s more urgent than ever that we act now to protect this diversity before it really is too late,” he added. The latest shipment will bring the number of seed varieties, stored in three underground alcoves at an optimum minus 18 degrees Celsius (-0.4 degrees Fahrenheit), to 1.05 million. The seed bank has the capacity to hold up to 4.5 million samples. Around two or three million samples “would be a good idea to make the future of the food of mankind even more secure,” Schmitz told AFP in the freezing cold of Longyearbyen. Conflict and climate change Little betrays the huge size of this granary for humanity on the icy mountainside except for its distinctive entrance: two towering grey walls emerging from the bowels of earth, topped with mirrors and pieces of iron creating a reflection that glimmers in the darkness of the polar winter. The seed store was launched in 2008 with financing from Norway with the aim of safeguarding biodiversity in the face of climate change, wars and other natural and man-made disasters, earning it the nickname “doomsday vault”. Its usefulness was spotlighted during Syria’s civil war when researchers were able in 2015 to retrieve from the vault duplicates of grains lost in the destruction of Aleppo. The countries and institutions that deposit seeds in the vault retain ownership over them and can retrieve them when necessary. More than 5,000 species of plants are now stored in the Arctic Archipelago, a frozen landscape where almost nothing grows. The vault has itself been hit by climate change. In 2016, water seeped into its tunnel entrance when the permafrost that encases it began to melt as Arctic temperatures climbed unusually high. Norway has since financed work to insulate the vault from further effects of a warming and wetter climate, which scientists say is happening twice as fast in the Arctic than the global average.

,"February 26, 2020, 9:18 AM",nCov,Countries must shift mindset to virus preparedness: WHO expert,By Reuters,"By Reuters GENEVA (Reuters) – Countries need to prepare immediately for an outbreak of the novel coronavirus so they can respond rapidly when it arrives, a top World Health Organization (WHO) expert said on Tuesday.  A resident wears a makeshift protective face shield at a residential compound in Wuhan, the epicentre of the novel coronavirus outbreak, Hubei province, China February 21, 2020. (REUTERS/Stringer / MANILA BULLETIN/ FILE) “Think the virus is going to show up tomorrow,” Dr. Bruce Aylward, head of the joint WHO-Chinese mission on the outbreak, told reporters on return to Geneva. “If you don’t think that way, you’re not going to be ready,” he said, saying it was an “incredibly interconnected world”. Aylward said the public needed to be educated about the issue to ensure their support in the battle to contain the virus. He said 10% of people who come in contact with an infected person contracts the virus. “Get organized, use the time you are trying to buy well because it is going to save lives,” he said. Iran’s coronavirus death toll rose to 16, the highest outside China, increasing its international isolation as nations from South Korea to Italy accelerated emergency measures to curb the epidemic’s global spread. Aylward said China’s “extraordinary mobilization” to handle the outbreak showed how an aggressive public health policy, including large quarantines, could curb the spread. Authorities should prepare hospital beds, isolation zones, respirators and oxygen for severe cases, he said. Plans should be in place to transport and test suspected victims of the disease that has sickened tens of thousands of people. “China knows how to keep people alive,” Aylward said. Referring to his two-week visit to Beijing and three other provinces, including Hubei and the epidemic’s center, the city of Wuhan, he said: “It is staggering. Every person you talk to there has a sense of responsibility, they are mobilized like in a war against this virus.” Asked whether known cases might be the tip of the iceberg, he said: “Probably we are not missing a huge amount (of cases).” Regarding the infection of more than 3,000 Chinese health workers, Aylward said: “Most health care workers got infected in the community, not in the health care work.” “Are they taking it seriously? Absolutely. Are they good at it? Absolutely. Are the numbers coming down? Absolutely, in terms of health care worker infections. And that’s a good news story,” he added. Tags: ncov"
,"February 26, 2020, 9:18 AM",nCov,Health authorities expect coronavirus spread on US soil,By Agence France-Presee,"By Agence France-Presee American health authorities said Tuesday they ultimately expect the novel coronavirus to spread in the United States and are urging local governments, businesses, and schools to develop plans like canceling mass gatherings or switching to teleworking. Officials are also worried the outbreak poses a threat to the the security of the US drug supply chain because a high proportion of ingredients used to make medicine is made in China, where the virus was first identified. “Ultimately, we expect we will see community spread in this country,” Nancy Messonnier, a senior official with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said during a briefing. “It’s not so much a question of if this will happen anymore, but rather more a question of exactly when this will happen, and how many people in this country will have severe illness.” The comments mark a significant escalation in the level of threat being conveyed to the US public and come amid fears of a pandemic, as the disease has taken root in several countries outside China, including Iran, Italy, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan and Thailand. COVID-19 has killed more than 2,600 people and infected almost 80,000 others, mainly in China. There are so far 57 recorded cases in the United States. In the absence of a vaccine or any form of treatment for COVID-19, authorities are relying on non-pharmaceutical interventions. “For schools, options include dividing students into smaller groups, or in a severe pandemic closing schools and using internet-based teleschooling. “For adults, businesses can replace in-person meetings with video and telephone conferences and increase teleworking options,” she continued, adding that on a larger scale, cities may need to cancel mass gatherings. In the case of hospitals, it may mean delaying elective procedures and increasing telephone consultations. “You should ask your children’s school about their plans for school dismissal or school closures. Ask about teleschooling. I contacted my local school superintendent this morning with exactly those questions.” – Drug supply chain –
At a separate briefing, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Commissioner Stephen Hahn admitted his agency is “keenly aware that the outbreak will likely affect the medical product supply chain, including potential disruptions to supply or shortages of critical medical products in the US.” He said the agency was reaching out to hundreds of drug makers to gather information about their supply chain, but “it’s important to note that FDA is not aware of any medical product shortages at this time.” He added personal protective equipment, such as face masks, respirators and gowns were among products at risk. Hahn’s comments came amid reports that the prolonged shutdown of drug makers in China’s Hubei province had boosted India’s IOL Chemicals and Pharmaceuticals Ltd, the world’s biggest producer of ibuprofen, as some Indian drug makers expect to benefit from China’s losses. On Monday, the White House sent a request to Congress to make at least $2.5 billion in funding available for preparedness and response, including developing treatments and vaccines and buying equipment for a strategic national stockpile. – Vaccine effective in mice –
On the vaccine front, Tony Fauci of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) said that a candidate being made by Moderna had proved effective in mice and would begin human trials “within a month and a half.” If all goes to plan, it could be available on the market in about a year and a half, ready in case the coronavirus outbreak continues until the next flu season. The NIH has also begun its first randomized clinical trial to investigate the safety and efficacy of the antiviral remdesivir in treating COVID-19. The first trial participant is an American who was repatriated after being quarantined on the Diamond Princess cruise ship that docked in Yokohama, Japan and who is being treated at the University of Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha. The trial’s organizers said it will be adapted to enroll participants at other sites in the US and worldwide, eventually including nearly 400 people, and would also investigate other treatments.

Chinese workers wear masks at a transportation hub in Paranaque, Metro Manila, Philippines, January 30, 2020. (REUTERS/Eloisa Lopez / MANILA BULLETIN) The virus has rapidly spread in parts of Asia, Europe and the Middle East, even as the number of deaths and fresh cases decline at the disease epicenter in China. The disease has now reached dozens of countries, with Austria, Croatia and Switzerland the latest to declare cases. The epidemic’s disruption has also grown, with stock markets tumbling around the world, restrictions imposed on travelers and sporting events cancelled. Towns and cities have been sealed off in an attempt to stop the contagion, while hotels in the Canary Islands and Austria were locked down on Tuesday because of suspected cases. Iran has reported 15 deaths out of nearly 100 infections, including its deputy health minister Iraj Harirchi. At the World Health Organization headquarters in Geneva, Bruce Aylward, who headed an international expert mission to China, hailed the drastic quarantine and containment measures taken by the country. But he told reporters that other nations were “simply not ready” to contain the outbreak. “You have to be ready to manage this at a larger scale… and it has to be done fast,” Aylward said. “How many countries are planning hospital bed, planning ventilators… and the lab capacity to be able to manage this?” he asked “There has to be a shift in mindset,” he insisted. “You have to plan.” He also cautioned that China’s quick response and quality treatment of COVID-19 cases may have given other countries “a false sense of security.” “China knows how to keep people alive from COVID… That is not going to be the case everywhere in the world,” he said. “It is a serious disease.” He voiced particular concern that poorer countries with weak health care systems were the most at risk. The virus has killed 2,715 persons and infected over 78,000 in China. There were 52 more deaths reported on Wednesday — the lowest in three weeks — with no fatalities outside the epicenter in central Hubei province. The National Health Commission also reported a drop in new infections to 406, with only five outside Hubei — a figure that will boost confidence that the rest of the country is containing the epidemic. In the rest of the world, there have been more than 40 deaths and 2,700 cases. The UN health agency has called for countries to “prepare for a potential pandemic” — a term used to describe an epidemic that spreads throughout the world. South Korea surge  South Korea reported 169 new infections on Wednesday, raising its total tally to 1,146 — by far the largest outside China – while an 11th person died. The vast majority – 90 percent – of the new infections were in Daegu, the country’s fourth-largest city and the epicenter of the outbreak, and the neighboring province of North Gyeongsang. The streets of Daegu – which has a population of 2.5 million – have been largely deserted for days, apart from long queues at the few shops with masks for sale. Authorities urged the public to exercise extra caution, advising citizens to stay home if they have a fever or respiratory symptoms. China quarantined 94 air passengers arriving in Nanjing from Seoul after three people, all Chinese, on the flight were discovered to have fevers on Tuesday. Thailand confirmed three more COVID-19 cases, taking the country’s total to 40, and vowed to  step up efforts to contain the disease. Two of the new cases had returned from Hokkaido in Japan and are thought to have contracted the illness there, but one of them didn’t report symptoms until three days after they developed, Permanent Health Secretary Sukhum Karnchanapimai said in a briefing Wednesday. The two then spread the infection to a family member, an elementary school student, but Sukhum said there’s no widespread community transmission of the virus in Thailand yet. Officials are checking on 50 to 100 people, including those from the school, who may have been in contact with the three new cases. The student’s classmates have been told to self-quarantine for 14 days.

Italy has become a frontline in the global outbreak of the virus, with 280 cases and 10 deaths, most in Lombardy and nearby Veneto. The receptionist and her partner, who also tested positive, visited their home in Lombardy last week. A similar story was unfolding at the four-star H10 Costa Adeje Palace hotel in Tenerife on the Canary Islands, which was locked down Tuesday after an Italian doctor and his wife were found to be infected. Spain also reported its first three cases of the disease on the mainland. The United States told Americans on Tuesday to begin preparing for coronavirus to spread within the country as outbreaks in Iran, South Korea and Italy escalated and fears that the epidemic would hurt global growth rattled markets. Dr. Anne Schuchat, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) principal deputy director, said that while the immediate risk in the United States was low, the current global situation suggested a pandemic was likely. “It’s not a question of if. It’s a question of when and how many people will be infected,” Schuchat said. Italians or people who had recently visited the country tested positive in Algeria, Austria, Croatia, Romania, Spain and Switzerland on Tuesday. Several European Union countries advised their citizens not to visit northern Italy, although the outbreak was already spreading to other regions in the south. Airlines began restricting flights to Italy, a planned shoot in the country for Tom Cruise’s seventh “Mission: Impossible” movie was postponed, Milan cathedral was closed and the Venice carnival cancelled.

(Photo by GREG BAKER / AFP / MANILA BULLETIN) Three reporters were ordered out of the country last week over what Beijing deemed a racist headline that the journalists were not involved in writing — marking one of the harshest moves against foreign media in years. But analysts noted that the decision to revoke their press credentials came a day after Washington tightened rules on Chinese state media operating in the United States — raising suspicion that Beijing had retaliated. The Journal opinion piece — headlined “China is the Real Sick Man of Asia” — was written by a US professor who criticised the Chinese government’s initial response to the coronavirus outbreak. China’s foreign ministry said it was “racially discriminatory”, and as the newspaper would not apologize, the three China-based reporters had their press cards revoked. Deputy bureau chief Josh Chin and reporter Chao Deng, both US nationals, as well as reporter Philip Wen, an Australian, were given five days to leave the country, according to the Journal. The three journalists work for The Wall Street Journal’s news section, which is not linked to the editorial and opinion pages. A letter from 53 Journal reporters and editors called for the newspaper’s leadership to apologize, according to reports in the Washington Post and the New York Times, saying the headline was “derogatory.” An AFP reporter saw Chin and Wen, wearing face masks, check-in for their flight at Beijing’s main international airport and then pass through security. Deng, the third journalist affected, had been reporting from Wuhan — the epicenter of the virus outbreak which has killed more than 2,500 people. The Journal confirmed to AFP that she was still in the quarantined city. The newspaper’s publisher said the outlet was “deeply disappointed” with China’s decision and that none of the journalists being expelled had “any involvement” with the opinion piece in question. When asked about the decision to expel the reporters on Monday, foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said there was “only one Wall StreetJournal in the world.” “Since the Journal stubbornly clings to its course, it should bear the corresponding consequences,” Zhao said at a regular press briefing. “We are not interested in the division of labor within the Wall StreetJournal.” The phrase “sick man of Asia” originally referred to China in the late 19th and early 20th century, when it was exploited by foreign powers during a period sometimes called the country’s “century of humiliation”. China’s move to force out the three journalists marks a drastic escalation in pressure on the international media. Multiple foreign reporters have been effectively made to leave the country over the past five years. But the Foreign Correspondents’ Club of China said Beijing had not outright expelled a foreign correspondent since 1998.

More than 80 percent of the infections have been in South Korea’s fourth-largest city Daegu and neighboring North Gyeongsang province. “The situation is very grave,” President Moon Jae-in said on a visit to Daegu, wearing the uniform of a government emergency official and vowing full government support. “We will achieve a victory in the fight against this virus,” he added. The streets of Daegu — which has a population of 2.5 million — have been largely deserted for days, apart from long queues at the few shops with masks for sale. Authorities urged the public to exercise extra caution, advising citizens to stay home if they have a fever or respiratory symptoms. South Korea’s parliament canceled sessions Tuesday as it closed for cleaning after confirmation a person with the coronavirus had attended a meeting last week. The country’s flag carrier Korean Air also reported a cabin crew member had tested positive, without giving details. And the US hinted at scaling back joint military exercises, with Defense Secretary Mark Esper telling reporters in Washington the two allies’ militaries were “looking at scaling back the command post training due to concerns about the coronavirus”. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advised travellers to “avoid all nonessential travel” to South Korea. Hong Kong has said it will not allow arrivals from South Korea other than returning residents, while a Mongolian ban on flights to and from the South came into force Tuesday. Two more people had died, the KCDC said, taking the toll to nine. South Korea has an advanced medical system, a free press and a strong culture of public accountability, and observers say that its health statistics can be treated with confidence. Scores of events have been canceled or postponed, from K-pop concerts to the start of the K-league football season. The World Team Table Tennis Championship in Busan in March fell victim on Tuesday, with organisers saying new dates in June had been “provisionally reserved”. The Korean Basketball League said it would hold matches behind closed doors “until the situation improves”. Most of the country’s infections are linked to the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, an entity often accused of being a cult. A 61-year-old female member developed a fever on February 10, but attended at least four church services in Daegu before being diagnosed. KCDC director Jung Eun-kyeong advised Shincheonji followers to refrain from going outside “as much as possible”.

(REUTERS/Stringer / MANILA BULLETIN) Countries around the world are stepping up efforts to prevent a pandemic of the flu-like virus that originated from China late last year and has now infected more than 80,000 people, 10 times more cases than the SARS coronavirus. Japan’s government urged people to telecommute or work staggered hours to stop the spread of the coronavirus, and Hong Kong media reported that schools in the Asian financial hub would remain closed for another month. The White House said more than $1 billion would go toward developing a vaccine, with other funds earmarked for therapeutics and the stockpiling of personal protective equipment such as masks. The U.S. and South Korean militaries said on Monday they may cut back joint training due to mounting concerns about the spreading coronavirus, in one of the first concrete signs of the virus’s fallout on global U.S. military activities. The disclosure came during a visit to the Pentagon by South Korean Defence Minister Jeong Kyeong-doo, who acknowledged following talks with U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper that 13 South Korean troops had tested positive for the virus. The U.S. military said a 61-year-old woman in South Korea who tested positive for the virus had recently visited a U.S. military base in the southeastern city of Daegu. It was the first infection connected to U.S. Forces Korea, which counts about 28,500 American troops on the peninsula. U.S. Forces Korea urged U.S. troops to limit travel and “use extreme caution when traveling off-installation.” South Korea – which remains technically at war with the nuclear-armed North – has the most virus cases in Asia outside China and reported its ninth death and 60 new cases on Tuesday, for a total of 893 cases. Of the new cases, 16 were in the southeastern city of Daegu, where a church at the center of the outbreak is located, and 33 were from North Gyeongsang Province, health officials said. About 60 percent of South Korea’s cases have been linked to the Shincheonji Church of Jesus. The leader of the Shincheonji Church said it had agreed to provide authorities with the names of all its members in South Korea, estimated by media at about 215,000 people. The government would conduct coronavirus tests on all members “as soon as possible” once it got the information, the prime minister’s office said in a statement. “It is essential to test all of the church members in order to contain the spread of the virus and relieve public anxiety,” the office said. Vice Health Minister Kim Kang-lip said the priority was to test about 1,300 of the 9,200 members of the Daegu church who are showing symptoms, which he said would be completed by Wednesday. Authorities hoped to stabilize the situation in Daegu within four weeks, he added. Americans should avoid all nonessential travel to South Korea due to the coronavirus outbreak, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Monday. In Japan, which has reported four deaths and 850 cases mostly on a cruise ship docked near Tokyo, Health Minister Katsunobu Kato said it was too early to talk about cancelling the Tokyo Summer Olympics due to start on July 24. Australia’s top Olympic doctor has warned the next fortnight will be the “real test” for the Tokyo Games, as teams draw up contingency plans for pre-Games training in “safe” areas, reported Australian media. China reported a rise in new coronavirus cases in Hubei province, the epicenter of the outbreak. Excluding the latest cases in Hubei, the rest of China had just nine new infections on Feb. 24, the lowest number of cases since Jan. 20. The overall death toll in mainland China had reached 2,663 as of the end of Monday, up by 71 from the previous day. The epidemic in China peaked between Jan. 23 and Feb. 2 and has been declining since, the World Health Organization (WHO) said. As the pace of new infections slowed, Beijing signaled it would begin to ease some of the restrictions on travel and movement which have paralyzed production in the world’s second-biggest economy. Flights in China excluding Hubei province would resume gradually as factories and businesses reopened, the country’s aviation regulator said. Nomura investment house estimates only a third of people have returned to work and only 40% of businesses have started back up since the end of the extended Lunar New Year holidays. “We are concerned there might be a second wave (of cases) in coming weeks as hundreds of millions of workers return to work in urban areas and the COVID-19 epidemic is rapidly developing into a global pandemic,” it said in a report. Asian share markets showed some resilience on Tuesday after the surge of cases outside mainland China and fears of a pandemic sent global markets into a tailspin. Italy on Monday became the new frontline in the fight against the coronavirus with 220 cases reported from just three on Friday. The death toll in Italy stands at seven. Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, Afghanistan and Iraq reported their first new coronavirus cases, all in people who had been to Iran where the toll was 12 dead and 61 infected. Most of the Iran infections were in the Shi’ite Muslim holy city of Qom. Outside mainland China, the outbreak has spread to about 29 countries and territories, with a death toll of about two dozen, according to a Reuters tally.

Students had previously been due to return to lessons on March 16. “As the coronavirus has not shown any sign of dying down, the Education Bureau has decided that all schools in Hong Kong will further extend the suspension,” Yeung said, adding that the exact date of resumption would be evaluated later. The news comes as the disease has now killed almost 2,700 people in China and spread to more countries around the globe including Italy, Iran and South Korea. Many schools in Hong Kong have already switched to online learning and lessons by conference call, with assignments given out on a daily or weekly basis. Secondary students will continue to take most of their exams as per schedule from March 27, Yeung said, with some subjects including music and physical education postponed until May. The Chinese territory has 81 confirmed cases of the virus and reported 2 deaths so far. Tags: ncov"

They are ready to go and they are taking their time waiting for further development,” he added. “Maybe because they still have money, they are waiting, observing,” said Bello. He said some employers in Hong Kong also gave their workers extended leave. “Their employers understand the situation,” Bello said. The labor department earlier directed OWWA to provide P10,000 cash assistance, accommodation, and transportation to OFWs who were stranded due to the travel ban in China, Hongkong, Macau, and Taiwan. The travel ban was imposed as a precautionary measure to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The government already lifted the travel ban for new hires and returning workers to Hong Kong and Macau. It also lifted the travel ban to Taiwan. Meanwhile, Bello said they are not recommending a travel ban to South Korea amid the spread of COVID-19 there. “If we will be asked, we will not recommend a travel ban to South Korea,” he said. Bello added: The labor office there is also not recommending a travel ban. “There remains one unverified case of a Filipino (infected) in Korea and the cases are just contained in one area,” he said.

 The new coronavirus has peaked in China but could still grow into a pandemic, the World Health Organization has warned, as infections mushroom in other countries.  A logo is pictured on the headquarters of the World Health Orgnaization (WHO) ahead of a meeting of the Emergency Committee on the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in Geneva, Switzerland, January 30, 2020. (REUTERS/Denis Balibouse/MANILA BULLETIN FILE PHOTO) Financial markets have gone into a tailspin after grim news of deaths and outbreaks in the Middle East, Europe and Asia, even as the Chinese epicentre appeared to be calming, with the death toll at its lowest for three weeks. But the situation is worsening in other countries, with more than 2,000 cases and 30 deaths reported abroad, prompting a raft of restrictions on travellers from infected nations. South Korea, Italy and Iran have logged particularly sharp increases in infections and deaths, while several countries in the Middle East reported their first cases of the novel coronavirus. But WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyes insisted the virus could still be contained, praising China’s drastic quarantine measures in several cities for helping to prevent an even bigger spread. “For the moment we are not witnessing the uncontained global spread of this virus and we are not witnessing large-scale deaths,” Tedros told reporters in Geneva. He added, however, that countries should be “doing everything we can to prepare for a potential pandemic.” The term “pandemic” is used to describe an illness that spreads across numerous communities. South Korea, which has the largest number of cases outside China, reported 60 more infections and one more fatality on Tuesday, raising its death toll to eight and total patients to nearly 900. South Korea’s outbreak has centred around a religious sect in Daegu, the country’s fourth largest city. The country is on its highest “red” alert. As part of the containment efforts, school holidays were extended nationally while the 2.5 million people of Daegu were told to remain indoors. The US Centers for Disease Control raised its caution level to warn Americans against “all nonessential travel to South Korea”. Italy, which has reported seven deaths and over 200 cases, has locked down 11 towns, while upcoming football matches in its Serie A and the Europa League will be played behind closed doors. With police manning checkpoints to enforce a blockade, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte has said that residents could face weeks of lockdown. The disease — officially known as COVID-19 — spread to new countries including Afghanistan, Bahrain, Iraq, Kuwait and Oman. At least 12 people have died in Iran, the highest toll outside China. But there were concerns the situation might be worse than officially acknowledged. The semi-official ILNA news agency quoted one local lawmaker in hard-hit Qom — a religious centre — who said 50 people had died there. The Iranian government denied the report, and pledged transparency. Even so, authorities have only reported 64 infections in Iran, an unusually small number that would mean an extremely high mortality rate. Michael Ryan, head of WHO’s health emergencies programme, said a team from the UN agency would be arriving in Iran on Tuesday. But he cautioned against drawing any conclusions about the mortality rate. Iran “may only be detecting severe cases” because the epidemic was still at an early stage, he said. Several countries have taken measures to prevent arrivals from Iran. In China, 508 new cases were reported, with all but nine at the epicentre in central Hubei province. Although that was up from 409 on Monday it was much lower than new infections being reported just a week ago. China’s death toll reached 2,663 on Tuesday, after 71 more people died. WHO’s Tedros said the epidemic peaked in China between January 23 and February 2. China has placed some 56 million in Hubei and its capital under quarantine since late last month, while other regions have enacted some forms of travel curbs and measures to keep millions more people indoors. Bruce Aylward, leader of a WHO mission of international experts, said late Monday it was time for China to start lifting some of the restrictions. “Obviously they want to get society back to a more normal semblance of what probably is the new normal, because this virus may be around… for months,” Aylward said. Reflecting the disquiet, global markets plunged on Monday, with Wall Street off 3.6 percent. Bargain buying helped some Asian markets into the green on Tuesday, but disquiet remained, with Tokyo dropping 3.0 percent by lunchtime.

,"February 25, 2020, 11:43 AM",nCov,Ailing Iranians suffer as sanctions hit medical supplies,By Agence Frane-Presse ,"By Agence Frane-Presse  Aged 49, Iranian diabetic Parviz Sadeghi appears closer to 70 with deep wrinkles surrounding his clear blue eyes and sunken cheeks testifying to shortages at a time of intensifying medical crisis.  Iranians had been hit by low medicine supplies even before the new coronavirus broke out in the central city of Qom and spread, claiming several lives and fostering panic amid a lack of face masks (AFP Photo/ATTA KENARE / MANILA BULLETIN) After a six-hour wait, he is relieved but exhausted as he emerges from a pharmacy in the capital Tehran with insulin — an increasingly scarce necessity, as US sanctions bite. “I’ve been a diabetic for nearly 10 years,” the out-of-work laborer said, adding that he lives in Karaj, about an hour west of the capital. “Before… you’d go to any pharmacy and they’d give it to you, but now you have to go to 1,000 places,” he lamented, after spending a week trudging from one dispensary to another. Iranians had been hit by low medicine supplies even before the new coronavirus broke out in the central city of Qom and spread, claiming several lives and fostering panic amid a lack of face masks. The medical shortages kicked in after the US pulled out of a landmark nuclear deal and reimposed crippling sanctions on Iran in 2018. Washington had exempted humanitarian goods, especially medicines and medical equipment from its punitive measures. But international purchases of such supplies are forestalled by banks being wary of conducting any business with Iran, for fear of falling foul of sanctions themselves. This in turn has worsened the acute shortage of medicines and led to skyrocketing prices, against the backdrop of an increasingly devalued rial. “I used to get insulin about three years ago for 17,000 tomans ($1.10, one euro), now it’s 50,500 tomans,” said Sadeghi. “And it’s getting even more expensive. “Insurance does cover this. That’s why I’ve been to 1,000 places since last Saturday to get them to approve this. They did accept eventually, but it took a long time, and you have to go to a lot of places,” he said. Sadeghi “borrows” life-saving insulin from other patients during lean periods just to survive. He struggles to find pharmacies that provide needles with the syringes. “Recently, they’ve started forcing us to pay for the needle.” Health ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour told AFP that Iran was “today capable of producing more than 97 percent of its needed medicine. “We only import about three percent of the drugs we use, which is obviously just about new and hi-tech drugs — medicine which is used in limited amounts and would not be feasible to produce inside the country,” he said. But he admitted that the country had been struggling to import “medicines for rare and special diseases” for around a year now. Located right in the heart of Tehran, the “13 Aban” state-run pharmacy is a hive of activity, drawing hordes of patients daily who queue patiently for hours as it stocks and subsidizes medicines for rare diseases. It and a handful of other pharmacies in Tehran work with the government-run insurer. Mohammad Aminian, 73, who needs insulin for his diabetic wife, blamed the sanctions for his woes in procuring a supply. “The government tries to make things work, even though it creates some problems of its own… We would have preferred if they did negotiate” with the United States, he said. Diabetic Sadeghi meanwhile squarely blames the government. “It’s definitely the government. They don’t have the ability to manage things. Some people who don’t have insurance, they have to buy” at the inflated prices. “They have to either die or… pay.” Mohammad Rezaei, the deputy director of pharmacies attached to the Tehran University of Medical Sciences, said: “Insulin is one of the main medicines affected… and our stocks of it along with other medicines are reducing with time.” Alongside diabetics, cancer patients and people suffering from thalassemia, a genetic blood disease common in the country, have been hit hard. A young woman with a serious disease called epidermolysis bullosa — a group of rare genetic conditions that result in easy blistering of the skin and mucous membranes — died recently due to a lack of specialized bandages. Shahrzad Shahbani, the owner of a private pharmacy in the capital, points to another grave problem — medicines for people with psychiatric problems. “A patient with a prescription for say, 200 pills, can only come and get 100, or even 20 … and this is getting even more frequent,” she said. Another medicine in short supply is Depakine, a drug manufactured by French company Sanofi and used by epilepsy patients. Mohammed, an Iran-Iraq war veteran in his 50s, is one of them. He also has post-traumatic stress disorder. He uses a locally made medicine for PTSD, saying “it sometimes causes stomach problems, burning. And it doesn’t even calm you down enough. If I get nervous, it might work half as (well as) the other one.” Pharmacy owner Shahbani backed him. “The quality is really a problem, unfortunately. It’s not something you can talk about officially,” she said. “There’s even a difference (of quality) from company to company, because the formulations are different.” Shahbani said people with Parkinson’s disease sometimes even smuggled in foreign medication through Turkey, in order to get a better quality supply. A new financial channel set up by Switzerland to facilitate humanitarian trade with Iran appears to have made little difference. Meanwhile, some pharmacies continue to charge exorbitant black market rates to Iranians already reeling under recession and the plunging currency.

Two staff members crossing an empty road as they deliver vegetables to a hospital in Wuhan in China’s central Hubei province. – The death toll in China from the COVID-19 coronavirus epidemic rose to 2,236 on February 21 after 118 more people died, most of them in the hard-hit epicentre province of Hubei, the government said. (Photo by STR / AFP) / China OUT / MANILA BULLETIN) Taking population into account, Bangladesh emerged as the country with the worst so-called PM2.5 pollution, followed by Pakistan, Mongolia, Afghanistan and India, according to the 2019 World Air Quality Report, jointly released by IQAir Group and Greenpeace. China ranks 11th. Particulate matter of 2.5 microns or less in diameter — roughly 1/30 the width of a human hair — is the most dangerous type of airborne pollution. Microscopic flecks are small enough to enter the bloodstream via the respiratory system, leading to asthma, lung cancer and heart disease. Among the world’s megacities of 10 million or more people, the most PM2.5-toxic in 2019 was the Indian capital New Delhi, followed by Lahore in Pakistan, Dhaka in Bangladesh, Kolkata in India, Linyi and Tianjin in China, and Jakarta, Indonesia. Next on the list were Wuhan — the epicentre of the new coronavirus outbreak — along with Chengdu and Beijing. The IQAir report is based on data from nearly 5,000 cities worldwide. Most of the seven million premature deaths attributed by the World Health Organization (WHO) to air pollution are caused by PM2.5 particles, which originate in sandstorms, agriculture, industry, wildfires and especially the burning of fossil fuels. “Air pollution is the world’s leading environmental health threat,” said IQAir CEO Frank Hammes. “Ninety percent of the global population is breathing unsafe air.” China’s average urban PM2.5 concentration dropped 20 percent in 2018 and 2019, but last year it still counted 117 of the 200 most polluted cities in the world. All but two percent of China’s cities exceeded WHO guidelines for PM2.5 levels, while 53 percent exceeded less stringent national safety limits. The UN says PM2.5 density should not top 25 microgrammes per cubic metre (25 mcg/m3) of air in any 24-hour period. China has set the bar at 35 mcg/m3. More than a million premature deaths in China each year are caused by air pollution, according to the WHO. Recent calculations put the toll at up to twice that figure. Across a large swathe of northern India and north-central China, meeting WHO standards year-round for PM2.5 pollution would increase life expectancy up to six or seven years, according to the Air Quality Life Index, developed by researchers at the Energy Policy Institute of Chicago. In India, small particle pollution exceeds WHO limits by 500 percent, even if air pollution in general declined significantly last year, with 98 percent of cities monitored showing improvements. Among the club of 36 rich OECD nations, South Korea was the most polluted for PM2.5, counting 105 of the worst 1,000 cities on the index. In Europe, Poland and Italy count 39 and 31 cities, respectively, in this tranche. Other parts of the world such as Africa and the Middle East lacked data. “What cannot be measured cannot be managed,” Hammes said. “Africa, a continent of 1.3 billion people, currently has less than 100 monitoring stations that make PM2.5 data available to the public in realtime.” As of 2018, China alone had more than 1,000 such stations in 200 cities. Climate change has begun to amplify the health risk of PM2.5 pollution, especially through more intense forest fires and sandstorms made worse by spreading desertification, the report found. Global warming and PM2.5 also have the same primary driver: the burning of coal, oil and gas. While the link with lung cancer was well established, a recent study showed that most excess deaths from air pollution are caused by heart attacks, strokes and other types of cardiovascular disease. Small and larger particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulphur dioxide (SO2) and ozone (O3) have likewise been linked to drops in cognitive performance, labour productivity and educational outcomes. Of cities with more than one million people, the least affected by PM2.5 are Adelaide, Helsinki, Stockholm, and San Jose in central California, followed by Perth and Melbourne in Australia, and Calgary in Canada, and New York Tags: ncov"

Caloocan Bishop Pablo Virgilio David (CBCP / MANILA BULLETIN) Caloocan Bishop Pablo David said penitents are allowed to confess their sins by writing them down on a sheet of paper and handing them personally to the priest after praying “Bless me, Father for I have sinned…” After “reading” their confession, he said the minister may ask the penitents some questions, give some admonition, recommend acts of penance, and give absolution verbally. David said the priest gives them back their notes for proper disposal afterward. During confessions, whether inside the confessional box or outside, priests and penitents are advised to wear protective masks. “Ideally, the penitent brings his or her own mask. Parishes should be ready to provide for those unable to bring their own,” said David. As to the manner of receiving communion, it will remain optional: by the hand or straight to the tongue. The prelate released the additional instructions as Catholics observe the start of the Lenten season on February 26, Ash Wednesday, when the faithful have their foreheads marked with ashes as a sign of penance. But as a preventive measure against COVID-19, David said priests can sprinkle a pinch of dry ashes on the crown or the top of the head of parishioners instead of imposing wet ashes on their foreheads. The Catholic Bishops’ Conference of the Philippines also made similar recommendations. Tags: ncov"

US Defense Secretary Mark Esper and South Korea’s National Defense Minister Jeong Kyeong-doo participate in a news conference at the Pentagon in Washington, US, February 24, 2020. (REUTERS/Erin Scott / MANILA BULLETIN)   The disclosure came during a visit to the Pentagon by South Korean Defense Minister Jeong Kyeong-doo, who acknowledged following talks with US Defense Secretary Mark Esper that 13 South Korean troops had tested positive for the virus. South Korean health authorities have reported 833 infections nationwide while eight people have died. “As of yesterday, we had 13 cases in the (South Korean) armed forces. We do regard this situation as a serious one,” Jeong told a news conference at the Pentagon, adding he had suspended military vacations and off-base leave. “We have also limited their movement across the nation.” Earlier on Monday, the US military said a 61-year-old woman in South Korea who tested positive for the virus had recently visited a US military base in the southeastern city of Daegu. The woman, who was the widow of a former US service member, visited a store at Camp Walker on Feb. 12 and 15, the military said. It was the first infection connected to US Forces Korea, which counts some 28,500 American troops on the peninsula. US Forces Korea said it was raising the risk level to “high” across the country. It urged US troops to limit travel and “use extreme caution when traveling off-installation.” Esper said the top US and South Korean generals on the peninsula were weighing scaling back joint training but insisted both militaries would remain alert, amid persistent concerns about North Korea’s nuclear weapons program. “I’m sure that we will remain fully ready to deal with any threats that we will face together,” Esper said, standing alongside his South Korean counterpart. The growing concern about the coronavirus’ impact on US and South Korean military activities comes against the backdrop of strains in bilateral ties over US calls for South Korea to offset more US defense costs. Both sides appear at an impasse. Esper told reporters after the talks on Monday that “shouldering the cost of our common defense cannot fall disproportionately to the American taxpayer.” Jeong acknowledged that talks were at a “standstill.” The last “special measures agreement” (SMA) lapsed at the end of December after multiple rounds of talks yielded no progress, and now the US military says funding will soon run out for thousands of South Korean civilians who work to support the bases.

Here is what we know about the disease it causes and how it spreads:  A man wearing a face mask crosses a road in Wuhan, the epicentre of the novel coronavirus outbreak, Hubei province, China February 24, 2020. REUTERS/Stringer * Like other coronaviruses, the new virus – which causes a disease now called COVID-19 – is transmitted from person to person via droplets when an infected person breathes out, coughs or sneezes. It can also spread via contaminated surfaces such as door handles or railings. * Scientists in China who studied swabs from infected patients say the new coronavirus behaves quite like flu viruses, suggesting it may spread more easily than previously thought. * COVID-19 infection has an incubation period of between one and 14 days, and a study in the Journal of the American Medical Association has found new evidence that the virus can be spread asymptomatically. * A World Health Organization-led team of investigating scientists in China has said that the epidemic there peaked between Jan. 23 and Feb. 2 and has been declining steadily since then. * They also found that the case-fatality rate is between 2% and 4% in Wuhan and 0.7% outside Wuhan. * Infectious disease and virus specialists estimate that each infected person in the epidemic is infecting, on average, two to three other people. * The WHO said on Monday that the COVID-19 outbreak was not out of control globally and does not have a large-scale death toll, so it was “too early” to speak of a pandemic. * Coronavirus infections have a wide range of symptoms, including fever, coughing, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. Mild cases can cause cold-like symptoms, while severe cases can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory illness, kidney failure and death. * Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that get their name from what they look like under a microscope – they are spherical and their surfaces are covered with “crown”-like spikes. * Animal viruses can mutate or combine with other viruses to create new strains capable of being passed to people. Scientists say the new coronavirus originated in bats and then passed to humans, possibly via an intermediary animal species. * Genetic data suggests the new coronavirus is the result of viral recombination – a process where more than one virus infects the same cell at the same time and creates a “recombinant” virus strain.

REUTERS/ MANILA BULLETIN “The key message that should give all countries hope, courage and confidence is that this virus can be contained, indeed there are many countries that have done exactly that,” WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a news conference in Geneva. “Using the word ‘pandemic’ now does not fit the facts but may certainly cause fear,” he added as the number of cases continued to mount internationally and financial markets spun lower. “We must focus on containment while doing everything we can to prepare for a potential pandemic.” Tedros said a sudden increase of cases in Italy, Iran and South Korea were “deeply concerning” but for now authorities were not seeing an uncontained global spread of the virus or witnessing widespread serious cases or deaths. The WHO already declared a public health emergency of international concern, its “highest level of alarm”, last month when there were fewer than 100 cases outside China and 8 cases of human-to-human transmission of the COVID-19 virus that started in China. “Does this virus have pandemic potential? Absolutely, it has,” Tedros said. “Are we there yet? From our assessment, not yet.” Fears of a pandemic grew after the sharp rises in new cases reported in Iran, Italy and South Korea, although China relaxed restrictions on movement in several places including Beijing as its rates of new infections eased. WHO emergencies program head Dr Mike Ryan said: “With regard to Iran, again, a little like was originally the case in China, we need to be very careful in the first wave of infections in any newly affected country, because we may only be detecting severe cases and the deaths would be over-represented.” The Geneva-based WHO declared the 2009 H1N1 swine flu outbreak a pandemic, which turned out to be mild, leading to some criticism after pharmaceutical companies rushed development of vaccines and drugs. WHO declared the novel coronavirus that emerged in Wuhan, China, in December a public health emergency of international concern, known as a PHEIC, on Jan. 30. The designation, which remains in place, was aimed at helping countries with weaker health systems shore up their defense, especially in Africa. China has reported a total of 77,362 cases of COVID-19 and 2,618 deaths. Outside China there are now 2,074 cases in 28 countries and 23 deaths, according to WHO figures. Tags: ncov"

Passengers have their temperature checked on arrival at Hong Kong International Airport (AFP Photo/VIVEK PRAKASH) “Considering the development of the epidemic in South Korea, the Security Bureau will issue a red travel alert,” John Lee told reporters Monday. The notice means anyone who has been in South Korea in the last fortnight will be denied entry to the international finance hub. Hong Kong residents will be allowed to return, but will have to undergo a fortnight of medical surveillance. South Korea has so far confirmed more than 800 cases of the novel coronavirus, by far the largest national total outside China, the origin of the disease. Hong Kong has 79 confirmed cases, two of whom have died. The city has implemented compulsory quarantine for any arrivals from mainland China, where the epidemic is most heavily concentrated. The South Korea ban is the first time it has placed restrictions on a country beyond China. On Monday, Hong Kong’s government also said it would charter flights to evacuate residents from Wuhan, the central Chinese city where the epidemic began in late December. Hundreds of Hong Kongers are still trapped in the city and have been begging for rescue. Officials said they would prioritise the most vulnerable, such as pregnant women and people needing urgent medical attention. Last week, Hong Kong evacuated some 200 residents from the Diamond Princess cruise ship off the coast of Japan which had a major outbreak of the virus. Two of the returnees have since tested positive for the virus. Tags: ncov"

A passenger shows an illustration of the coronavirus on his mobile phone at Guangzhou airport in Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China, 23 January 2020. (EPA-EFE / ALEX PLAVEVSKI / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN) The quarantine announcement came hours after Pakistan sealed off its land border with Iran while neighbouring Afghanistan said it had detected its first infection. It also came as Iranian authorities denied allegations of an official coverup following reports that dozens of deaths had gone unreported in the country. In Pakistan’s southwestern Balochistan province authorities moved fast to quarantine at least 200 people after Shiite Muslim piligrims returning from Iran entered the country and briefly interacted with other residents. “We have decided not to take a chance and keep all of them under observation for the next 15 days,” Najeebullah Qambrani, assistant commissioner at the Taftan border crossing, told AFP, saying 250 people were being quarantined. Balochistan’s secretary of health Mudassir Malik confirmed the quarantine but estimated that between 200 and 250 were being held. He added that around 7,000 pilgrims had returned to Pakistan from Iran this month alone. Afghanistan and Pakistan share long, porous borders with Iran that are often used by smugglers and human traffickers, while millions of Afghan refugees currently live in the Islamic Republic — raising fears that the virus could easily spread over the border. Pakistan — bordered by China to the north and Iran to the south — also suffers the additional burden of having a lacklustre healthcare system following decades of under-investment by the state, leaving impoverished, rural communities especially vulnerable. Balochistan in particular is woefully unprepared to handle a public health emergency after being beset for decades by a separatist insurgency, jihadist violence, and neglect from the central government. The novel coronavirus has spread to more than 25 countries, with more than 2,500 dead in China, and is causing mounting alarm due to new pockets of outbreaks in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia.

(REUTERS / Tyrone Siu / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN) The World Dream ship had been denied entry in Taiwan before docking in Hong Kong earlier this month. Its 1,800 passengers disembarked there but a similar number of crew stayed on board. Three Chinese nationals, who had been aboard the ship between Jan. 19 and 24, were found to have contracted the virus Achmad Yurianto, a health ministry official, told Reuters the ship was now in international waters near Singapore and 188 Indonesian crew members were set to be brought back. He said crew members could be quarantined for “up to 28 days.” Muhadjir Effendy, Indonesia’s chief human development minister, said the navy ship, equipped with medical facilities, would pick up Indonesian crew members. They would be taken to an uninhabited island with “good facilities” in the Java Sea north of Jakarta for observation, he said. “We will observe them according to procedures set by the WHO (World Health Organization),” he said. Passengers had disembarked from World Dream on Feb. 9, leaving the 1,814 crew members on board, according to World Dream’s operator, Dream Cruises. In a statement, Dream Cruises said after it had suspended its operations, Hong Kong health authorities had confirmed that all passengers and crew on the final sailing had passed extensive health screenings and temperature checks. “Dream Cruises has been working closely with the regional authorities in facilitating the transfer and disembarkation of its crew members in different phases from World Dream due to the various nationalities,” the statement said. Indonesia announced plans last week to bring back 74 of its nationals from the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan that has been affected by a coronavirus outbreak. Indonesia’s health minister, Terawan Agus Putranto, told reporters on Monday that the government was still negotiating with the Japanese government on the best way to evacuate the Indonesians. Separately, Indonesian authorities were investigating a report that a Japanese citizen had tested positive for the coronavirus after traveling to the Southeast Asian country earlier this month. Teuku Faizasyah, a spokesman at Indonesia’s foreign ministry, said that information had been received from Japanese authorities and the man’s movements were being traced.

South Korea, Japan and Italy are experiencing large outbreaks. “There is no official category (for a pandemic),” WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic said. “For the sake of clarification, WHO does not use the old system of 6 phases — that ranged from phase 1 (no reports of animal influenza causing human infections) to phase 6 (a pandemic) — that some people may be familiar with from H1N1 in 2009,” he said. Colloquially, pandemic is used to denote the outbreak of a new pathogen that spreads easily person-to-person across the globe, Jasarevic said. “What we are seeing at the moment are outbreaks and clusters of cases in multiple countries. Some countries have since stopped transmission. They must remain alert for the possibility of reintroduction. There will likely be more cases in more places,” he said. “Definitions and terminology aside, our advice remains the same, and we continue working with countries to limit the spread of the virus while also preparing for the possibility of wider spread,” he said. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO director-general, said on Friday: “I would like to assure you we are following this virus 24/7 round the clock … As we speak our situation is that we are still in a phase where containment is possible with a narrowing window of opportunity.” Tags: ncov"
,"February 24, 2020, 6:12 PM",nCov,Japan plays down criticism of coronavirus cruise ship handling,By Reuters,"By Reuters TOKYO – A panel of Japanese medical experts on Monday sought to play down deepening criticism of the government’s handling of a coronavirus outbreak on a cruise ship while acknowledging mistakes were made.  A passenger looks on from the coronavirus-hit cruise ship Diamond Princess at Daikoku Pier Cruise Terminal in Yokohama, south of Tokyo, Japan February 21, 2020. (REUTERS / Kim Kyung-Hoon / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN) Confirmed cases on the British-registered Diamond Princess have reached 691 with three deaths since the ship docked at Yokohama port on Feb. 3. The United States, Canada, Australia, and other countries evacuated their citizens from the ship before the end of a two-week quarantine period and are now imposing new quarantine or travel restrictions on those passengers. Since the ship’s quarantine ended on Feb. 19, passengers who have disembarked, most of them Japanese but including some foreigners, have been asked to stay at home and avoid public transport. One Japanese passenger has a confirmed infection, while new cases have sprung up among returned Australians, Britons, and Americans. “We could have done better, but that’s common sense,” Shigeru Omi, president of the Japan Community Healthcare Organization, and a government adviser on the crisis, said at a press briefing. “No operation is perfect.” But that relatively forgiving assessment is in contrast to growing criticism of how Japan handled the quarantine, just months ahead of the Tokyo 2020 Olympics. The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said the quarantine had not been sufficient to halt contagion. Some critics have said that by attempting a quarantine on the ship, Japanese officials essentially turned the boat into a floating incubator for the coronavirus. Health Minister Katsunobu Kato will announce on Tuesday new measures to help contain small outbreaks across Japan, domestic broadcaster NHK reported. On Saturday, he apologized for allowing an infected woman to leave the Diamond Princess. The experts assembled on Monday, at a news conference for foreign media, did not accept assertions that the ship quarantine had been a failure. They pointed to preliminary data showing that cases among Diamond Princess passengers appeared to peak on Feb. 7 before tailing off, evidence they contend was proof that the isolation strategy worked. Cases among the crew continued to grow, however. Evaluation of what authorities could have done better would have to wait until the crisis has subsided, Omi said. “We are in the middle of a fight now,” he said.

Workers disinfect parts of Wuhan (AFP Photo / Hector RETAMAL / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN) The city government said in a statement that the previous announcement had been made by a traffic prevention and control group “without the consent” of the local leadership. “The announcement is declared invalid. In this regard, we have seriously dealt with the relevant personnel,” the city said on its official account on Twitter-like Weibo. “Wuhan resolutely implements the spirit of General Secretary Xi Jinping’s important instructions on ‘preventing leaks (of the virus)’ … strictly manages the passages leaving from Wuhan, strictly controls personnel, and strictly prevents the epidemic from going out,” it said. Wuhan’s government deleted the previous post that had announced the easing of restrictions barely three hours earlier. Officials in Wuhan were already under fire for their handling of the epidemic — accused of initially covering up the first outbreaks, botching the response and causing confusion by changing criteria to count the number of cases. The top Communist Party officials in Hubei province and its capital Wuhan were sacked earlier this month, along with the region’s top health officials. The city of 11 million has been under lockdown since January 23 after authorities shut down transport links into and out of the city in an effort to contain the new coronavirus outbreak. The now-scrapped decision would have allowed non-residents to leave if they show no symptoms of the new coronavirus and have never had contact with patients, the deleted statement said. People with special reasons to leave the city, including those who needed treatment for other medical conditions and those doing epidemic prevention work, would also have been allowed to exit. The statement had said that departures would be staggered and people would have had to apply for permission from local authorities before leaving. Once travelers reached their destinations outside of Wuhan, they would have to report themselves to local authorities and monitor their health for 14 days. The announcement would have also allowed people to enter the city for epidemic prevention or other production-related reasons or if they were Wuhan residents who had previously been unable to return home. Hundreds of foreign nationals have been airlifted from Wuhan back to their countries by several governments including the United States, France and Britain. The COVID-19 disease has killed nearly 2,600 persons and infected some 77,000 in China. The epidemic’s spread has slowed down in China outside of Hubei province, while multiple other provinces have reported zero new infections for several days in a row. All but 11 of China’s 409 new cases Monday were reported in Hubei. Wuhan, where the virus is believed to have originated late last year, continues to account for the majority of new cases and deaths in the country. Wuhan on Monday reported 348 new virus cases, while five cities and the Shennongjia Forestry District in Hubei reported no new cases. Experts from the World Health Organization visited Wuhan over the weekend. They also met with Ma Xiaowei, the director of China’s national health commission, and top officials at the centre for disease control for Hubei.

DOH Assistant Secretary Maria Rosario Vergeire made the statement as the government works on the details to repatriate some 400 Filipinos abroad the ship.  Diamond Princess cruise ship (Photo by Behrouz MEHRI / AFP / MANILA BULLETIN FILE PHOTO) In a press briefing in Malacañang, Vergeire said the Filipinos who will be brought to the country would have to undergo another two weeks of quarantine because they are not sure for how long or how often they were exposed to patients on the ship who were positive for coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). “They have said that some of these crew members were allowed to do the functions like serving food, bringing these different provisions for the other passengers. The assumption now is all of them were exposed,” she said Monday. “That’s why we’re treating this as a very, very critical matter. That’s why when they get here, even though they [have finished] already their 14-day quarantine aboard the ship in Japan, we are going to have also the 14-day quarantine here in the Philippines,” she added. It was confirmed early Monday that the number of Filipinos who tested positive for the COVID-19 aboard the cruise ship has risen to 59. Of its 3,700 passengers and crew, 600 of them were reported to have been infected by the disease. According to Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles, the Japanese government has ensured that any affected Filipino is provided proper medical treatment and care in their hospitals and health facilities. “Our government is working closely with Japanese health and foreign ministry officials to complete the quarantine protocols and repatriate our Filipino crew members and passengers as soon as possible,” he said. In the same press briefing, Foreign Affairs Undersecretary Ed Meñez said the Filipinos from the cruise ship will be repatriated Tuesday (Feb. 25). He said the test results of all Filipino crew members aboard the ship will also be released the same day. Repatriation Nograles said the government has tightened its repatriation protocols to ensure that the repatriates will undergo constant health screening and infection prevention at every juncture of the trip, from pre-boarding, onboard journey, and disembarkation, up to their 14-day quarantine in Athlete’s Village in New Clark City, Capas, Tarlac. Leading up to the end of the 14-day quarantine period on Feb. 19, the DFA, through the Philippine Embassy, has been in close coordination with the Japanese government and the management of Diamond Princess Cruises on the details, logistics, and schedule of the repatriation of its Filipino crew and passengers. Meñez explained that the Filipinos who will be repatriated will be going from Yokohama Port to Haneda Airport where they will be taking off going to Clark, Pampanga. Two DFA officials and nine medical officials from DOH will be assisting the repatriates. He added that Embassy officials who will be assisting the repatriates will be provided with their own protective equipment.
Meanwhile, Meñez explained that the government was not able to repatriate the Filipinos sooner because the COVID-19 results of all Filipinos aboard the ship will only be released on Tuesday. Some will stay Meñez said that some 100 Filipino crew members have expressed their willingness to stay on the Diamond Princess ship should it be required by their employer. However, he said that as the situation developed, the Princess Cruises will now be determining who are essential members. Those who are not will be relieved from their duties and will have to join the repatriation to the Philippines. Still at Athlete’s Village Meanwhile, Vergeire said the repatriates will undergo quarantine at the Athlete’s Village despite requests from the local government to find another facility. “With that request coming from our local government official, we deemed it wise not to accede to that request because it is not really rational at this point,” she said. “We are going to bring home persons or our kababayans coming from a ship which is highly infected. So distributing our kababayans into different sites or facilities would increase the risk of possible transmission of the disease,” she added. Tags: ncov"

Study on travel ban Nograles said the Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID) will discuss the situation in South Korea and study whether or not travel restrictions should be imposed. He said authorities are expected to look into the “exposure risk” to Filipinos working in South Korea as well as travelers arriving in the country. They will also look into the heath protocols put in place by South Korea to prevent potential virus carriers from entering or departing their territory, Nograles said. “Basically, it’s really an assurance from the South Korean government based on our health protocols and their health protocols. If makita naman natin na maganda naman ‘yung sistema at malaki ‘yung assurance na hindi magkahawaan (If we see the system is good and there is a big assurance there will be no contagion), then we will still have that comfort level,” he said. “But if the comfort level is broken or we feel that there is a potential danger to public health dito sa ating bansa (in our country), then we will have to make a decision.” The Philippines recently implemented travel restrictions on China, Macau, and Hong Kong as a precaution against the spread of the coronavirus in the country.

As of Feb. 17, DepEd said this person has already “received a medical clearance.” Education Secretary Leonor Briones, in DepEd Memo (DM) No. 23 s. 2020 noted that travel measures and restrictions as stipulated in Enclosure No. 2 to DM 15, s. 2020 shall “remain in effect.” Thus, all personnel and learners who decide to proceed with their scheduled personal travels for the month of February to countries identified to have confirmed cases of COVID-19 “shall be subject to mandatory self-quarantine for 14 days from the date of arrival in the Philippines.” DepEd noted that all learners on quarantine, as well as learners excused from attending school-based activities that involve a congregation of learners, “shall not be marked absent” provided that they are being given Alternative Delivery Modes (ADMs) of education. In line with ongoing efforts to respond to COVID-19, DepEd schools and divisions have been conducting various Information, Education and Communication (IEC) campaigns on the disease and how can schools help prevent its possible spread among learners and personnel. As per Department of Health (DOH) data, 609 individuals have been checked for possible COVID-19 and of this number, 132 remain admitted in various hospitals while 474 have been already been discharged. This number includes the three Chinese nationals that tested positive for COVID-19, where one died on Feb. 1, one was discharged after recovery, and one already went back to China. DOH said that to date, there are no “admitted confirmed cases” of COVID-19 in the country. Based on the World Health Organization (WHO) COVID-19 tracker data, there are 79,336 total cases with 2,615 deaths in 29 countries. Tags: ncov"

FILE PHOTO: A cargo ship carrying containers approaches a port in Ningbo, Zhejiang province, China February 21, 2020. China Daily via REUTERS Figures released by the national health authority on Monday showed 24 out of China’s 31 provinces and regions – including Beijing, Shanghai and populous provinces such as Henan and Anhui – reported zero cases of new infections on Feb. 23, the best showing since it began publishing nationwide figures on Jan. 20. There were just 11 new cases in six other provincial-level jurisdictions, while in Hubei province, the epicenter of the epidemic, the number of new cases fell to 398 from 630 a day earlier. On Sunday, President Xi hailed the positive trend, and urged businesses to resume work and safeguard jobs. He also told low-risk provinces to restore economic activity and output, while high-risk regions focused on controlling the epidemic. Yunnan, Guangdong, Shanxi and Guizhou on Monday lowered their coronavirus emergency response measures from the most serious level, joining the provinces of Gansu and Liaoning in relaxing restrictions on traffic and movement of people. The coronavirus has infected nearly 77,000 people and killed more than 2,500 in China in one of the most serious public health crises in decades. The pathogen has also spread to other countries such as South Korea, Italy and Iran. Whether or not China can defeat the epidemic is “a major test of (Communist) Party organizations, party members and cadres of all levels,” Xi said, warning officials to avoid complacency. Hubei remains virtually cut off from the outside world, although the provincial capital of Wuhan, ground zero of the outbreak, said on Monday it will allow people in good health to leave the city for essential reasons. In the rest of China, factories, businesses and construction sites have already gradually restarted. Large state-owned enterprises have been told to spearhead a recovery in industry while policymakers roll out measures to support struggling small and medium-sized companies. China’s gross domestic product may slow in the first quarter, possibly easing to 3% growth or even lower, from 6% in the previous quarter – which was already the weakest pace in nearly 30 years, economists estimated. “The risk is that, with the emphasis on the economy and a differentiation of regions based on the number of new infection cases, the quality of new infection data reported by local governments could be compromised again,” Nomura wrote in a research note. “Cover-ups could lead to slack preventions…” it said. Beijing, which has reported two straight days of zero new infections, is not letting down its guard. People not wearing masks in public places will be warned, and office buildings must set upper limits on daily human traffic, municipal authorities said on Monday. U.S. hypermarket chain Costco received a verbal warning from authorities in Shanghai after a large crowd flocked to its newly opened store in the city. At a coffee shop on Friday in the central Futian financial district in Shenzhen, most tables were full, though staff were seen telling patrons to pull their masks back up between sips, and telling them not to dwell over their drinks too long. “You should stay here for only 10 to 15 minutes, sorry,” a customer was told.

Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles (Photo from Karlo Nograles / Facebook page / MANILA BULLETIN) Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles made the statement after it was reported early this month that around 100 Filipinos had sought help from the Philippine consulate in Macau. In a press briefing in Malacañang, Nograles said the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) and the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) were already ironing out the details of the repatriation plan for Filipinos in Macau. Nograles urged Filipinos abroad to immediately contact the nearest embassy if they feel they are under threat of the disease. “Kaya nga nalaman natin ‘yung tungkol sa mga Filipino sa Macau na gusto magpa-repatriate kasi nag-reach out nga sila sa ating mga foreign department officials (That’s how we found out about the Filipinos in Macau who want to go home because they reached out to our DFA officials),” he said. “If there is anybody from any country who wishes to be assisted by the Philippine government, ang sinasabi lang namin (what we’re saying is) we’re ready and willing to assist them.” Nograles assured Filipinos abroad that the government has funds to bring them home. However, he explained that there were occasions that the government only shouldered a portion of the expenses for the repatriation. “Depende. Like dito sa (for instance) Diamond Princess, may shared cost ‘yun. Most will be shouldered by Magsaysay [Maritime Corporation], and then the other cost na hindi maso-shoulder ng Magsaysay, gobyerno ang bahala (which they cannot provide for, the government will take care of it). So it really depends on the situation,” he said. “What we’re saying is we have the funds. We’re ready to deploy the funds if necessary. If we need to repatriate whether by batch or individually, the government is ready to respond,” he added. The government is set to repatriate at least 400 Filipinos from the COVID-19-hit cruise ship in Yokohama, Japan on Tuesday. The first batch of repatriates from Wuhan, China was already given a clean bill of health after undergoing a two-week quarantine this month. Tags: ncov"

A woman wearing a mask to prevent the coronavirus uses her mobile phone at a shopping district in Seoul, South Korea, February 24, 2020. REUTERS/Kim Hong-Ji The government, stung by criticism of how it handled past outbreaks, initially released very detailed information on confirmed cases, including the age, gender and daily routes infected people took before being quarantined. Identities were not published but the information that was enabled web developers to build detailed maps tracking the movements of patients. “We experienced a public backlash after a mass infection took place during the MERS outbreak five years ago, because we didn’t make public where those patients had gone,” a health official, who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter, told Reuters. A button on one of the sites, Coronamap.live, is labeled “See whether I am safe”. A click shows users if there are any known coronavirus cases in their vicinity. Many South Koreans have been logging on to the sites, with some saying the thought of becoming infected and appearing on an online map is so mortifying it keeps them from going out. Seo Su-sung, a 21-year-old student who finds Coronamap.live the most useful, said the more information, the better for everyone. “It keeps society at ease to avoid the contaminated areas when you can,” Seo said. “Otherwise I could not only harm myself, but also others around me.” Ryan Jun-seo Hong, 19, a computer science major who set up the Coronamap.live site while waiting for his mandatory military service to begin, said more than 300,000 people have been viewing the site every day. But the increase in cases over recent days with confirmed infections surging from 31 to more than 763, including seven deaths, in less than a week, has made it nearly impossible to keep up. “Currently adding 600+ places,” said a message on Monday on Coronamap.live, which offers an interactive map in Korean, Chinese and English. ‘TAKING A TOLL’
Health authorities also just can’t keep up with the new cases and in recent days have been forced to publish more general summaries and regional information on cases. Still, the government regularly releases updates and discusses cases in briefings, and Hong said he uses a wide range of other open-source resources like news reports to supplement official data. “I gather all kinds of information for updates, and I include personal feedback from users,” Hong said. Another developer, Kwon Young-jae, runs a similar site with his wife, Ju Yeun-jin, who is also a software developer, but they’ve been overwhelmed by the surge in cases. Their Wuhanvirus.kr shows a real-time tally of the infections, deaths and discharged patients from both South Korea and the world. But Kwon said the soaring numbers meant he and his wife were hardly getting any sleep. “It was easy to update the page up until the beginning of last week,” he said. “But with tens of new patients every few hours, it’s starting to take a toll on us.” Tags: ncov"

The new coronavirus is thought to have spread from Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan, which was shut on January 1 (AFP/ MANILA BULLETIN) The official Xinhua news agency said the proposal was submitted to the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress (NPC). “It aims to completely ban the eating of wild animals and crack down on illegal wildlife trade,” it said. The report added that the measure was aimed at “safeguarding public health and ecological security”. The Standing Committee is responsible for convening the 3,000-member NPC, but is widely expected to postpone the annual session due to the health crisis. The session was due to start early next month. Chinese health officials have said the virus likely emerged from a market in the central city of Wuhan that sold wild animals as food. Late last month after the epidemic began exploding across the country, China ordered a temporary ban “until the national epidemic situation is over”. The new coronavirus has killed 2,592 people in China, infected some 77,000 so far and paralysed its economy. It has spread to at least two dozen countries, infecting 1,500 people and killing nearly 30. It was not clear when a decision would be made on the proposed ban, which is likely to face scepticism. Conservationists accuse China of tolerating a shadowy trade in exotic animals for food or use in traditional medicines whose efficacy is not confirmed by science. China instituted a similar temporary ban after the SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) virus killed hundreds of people in China and Hong Kong in 2002-03 and was also traced to wild-animal consumption. But the wildlife trade soon resumed. Health experts say it poses a significant and growing public health risk by exposing humans to dangerous animal-borne pathogens. The exact source of the coronavirus remains unconfirmed, with scientists variously speculating it originated in bats, pangolins, or some other mammal. Scientists say SARS likely originated in bats, later reaching humans via civets. Civets, a cat-like creature, were among dozens of species listed as for sale by one of the merchants at the Wuhan market according to a price list that circulated on China’s internet. Other items included rats, snakes, giant salamanders and live wolf pups. Tags: ncov"

Kuwait reported three infections and Bahrain one. “Tests conducted on those coming from the Iranian city of Mashhad showed there were three confirmed cases of the coronavirus (COVID-19),” the Kuwaiti health ministry said in a statement posted on Twitter. It said the cases were of a 53-year-old Kuwaiti man, a 61-year-old Saudi citizen and a 21-year-old stateless Arab. “All three cases are under constant observation by the health authority,” the ministry added. Bahrain’s healthy ministry also reported the country’s first COVID-19 case on Monday after a “citizen arriving from Iran was suspected of having contracted the virus based on emerging symptoms”. The patient was transferred to a medical centre for “immediate testing”, which proved positive for the infection, the ministry added. Iran’s confirmed death toll rose to 12 on Monday, with the outbreak prompting travel bans from nearby countries. Last week, Kuwait announced a ban on entry of all ships from the Islamic republic and enforced a ban on flights to and from the country. Thousands of Bahraini and Kuwaiti Shiite Muslims travel to Iran frequently to visit holy sites. China’s death toll from the new coronavirus rose to 2,592 on Monday, after the National Health Commission reported 150 more fatalities, all but one in the epicentre of Hubei province.

,"February 24, 2020, 2:41 PM",nCov,Gov’t expects slower but ‘minimal’ reduction in OFW cash remittances due to COVID-19,By Genalyn Kabiling ,"By Genalyn Kabiling  The government is expecting slightly lower cash remittances from overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) this year due to the novel coronavirus threat, a Palace official said Monday.  Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles (Photo from Karlo Nograles / Facebook page / MANILA BULLETIN) Amid the global outbreak of the coronavirus, Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles said the government has decided to adjust the 2020 growth target in OFW remittances to US$ 34.2 billion from $34.5 billion. Nograles, however, made clear that the coronavirus impact on OFW remittances would be “minimal,” saying the 2020 growth target will still be higher compared to $33.5 billion remittances recorded in 2019. “We expect that the COVID-19 outbreak could dampen our total cash remittance growth in 2020 by 0.8 percentage points, from 3 percent to 2.2 percent,” he said in a Palace press briefing Monday. “In other words, while remittances from OFWs reached a record high of US$33.5 billion last 2019, we were expecting this to increase to US$34.5 billion in remittances this year with a projected growth rate of 3 percent. But because of this COVID-19 epidemic, we have adjusted our growth projections to 2.2 percent, and now expect US$34.2 billion in remittances for 2020.” He noted that the revised growth rate this year would still “breach another record high” in OFW remittances. Citing information from the Department of Labor and Employment, he said remittances from other source countries such as the United States, United Arab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia might help compensate for the possible slowdown in remittances coming from China, Macau, and Hong Kong. In terms of remittances, China accounts for 0.1 percent of total OFW remittances, while Macau and Hong Kong account for 0.4 percent and 2.7 percent, respectively. “We are encouraged by historical data that shows that PH remittances have been resilient even in the face of global downtrends,” he said. Impact on agricultural sector The coronavirus outbreak, meanwhile, will also have a “minimal” impact on the agriculture sector, particularly on exports, according to Nograles. Such assessment was made by the government’s economic managers, he added. “Our banana exports to China, for example, are not slowing down,” he said. “While there were previous logistical issues during the Chinese Lunar New Year break, this was only a temporary setback, and our banana exports to China have returned to normal.” The government earlier remained optimistic that the country’s 2020 growth target of 6.5 percent can be achieved despite the coronavirus threat. Nograles, in his remarks last week, said the local economy is resilient due to robust domestic demand and production. “It is likely that the Philippine economy will exhibit a strong recovery from the temporary effects of COVID-19,” Nograles said.

The central Chinese city of Wuhan has been under effective quarantine for weeks because of the coronavirus outbreak (AFP Photo/STR) Unable to go out, the 29-year-old is now sealed inside her compound where she has to depend on online group-buying services to get food. “Living for at least another month isn’t an issue,” Guo told AFP, explaining that she had her own stash of pickled vegetables and salted eggs. But what scares her most is the lack of control — first, the entire city was sealed off, and then residents were limited to exiting their compound once every three days. Now even that has been taken away. Guo is among some 11 million residents in Wuhan, a city in central Hubei province that has been under effective quarantine since January 23 as Chinese authorities race to contain the epidemic. Since then, its people have faced a number of tightening controls over daily life as the death toll from the virus swelled to over 2,500 in China alone. But the new rules this month barring residents from leaving their neighbourhoods are the most restrictive yet — and for some, threaten their livelihoods. “I still don’t know where to buy things once we’ve finished eating what we have at home,” said Pan Hongsheng, who lives with his wife and two children. Some neighbourhoods have organised group-buying services, where supermarkets deliver orders in bulk. But in Pan’s community, “no one cares”. “The three-year-old doesn’t even have any milk powder left,” Pan told AFP, adding that he has been unable to send medicine to his in-laws — both in their eighties — as they live in a different area. “I feel like a refugee.” The “closed management of neighbourhoods is bound to bring some inconvenience to the lives of the people”, Qian Yuankun, vice secretary of Hubei’s Communist Party committee, said at a press briefing last week. Authorities on Monday allowed healthy non-residents of the city to leave if they never had contact with patients, but restrictions remained on those who live in Wuhan. – Grocery groups – Demand for group-buying food delivery services has rocketed with the new restrictions, with supermarkets and neighbourhood committees scrambling to fill orders. Most group-buying services operate through Chinese messaging app WeChat, which has ad-hoc chat groups for meat, vegetables, milk — even “hot dry noodles”, a famous Wuhan dish. More sophisticated shops and compounds have their own mini-app inside WeChat, where residents can choose packages priced by weight before orders are sent in bulk to grocery stores. In Guo’s neighbourhood, for instance, a 6.5-kilogramme (14.3-pound) set of five vegetables, including potatoes and baby cabbage, costs 50 yuan ($7.11). “You have no way to choose what you like to eat,” Guo said. “You cannot have personal preferences anymore.” The group-buying model is also more difficult for smaller communities to adopt, as supermarkets have minimum order requirements for delivery. “To be honest, there’s nothing we can do,” said Yang Nan, manager of Lao Cun Zhang supermarket, which requires a minimum of 30 orders. “We only have four cars,” she said, explaining that the store did not have the staff to handle smaller orders. Another supermarket told AFP it capped its daily delivery load to 1,000 orders per day. “Hiring staff is difficult,” said Wang Xiuwen, who works at the store’s logistics division, adding that they are wary about hiring too many outsiders for fear of infection. – ‘Already rotten’ – Closing off communities has split the city into silos, with different neighbourhoods rolling out controls of varying intensity. In some compounds, residents have easier access to food — albeit a smaller selection than normal — and one woman said her family pays delivery drivers to run grocery errands. Her compound has not been sealed off either, the 24-year-old told AFP under condition of anonymity, though they are limited to one person leaving at a time. Some districts have implemented their own rules, such as prohibiting supermarkets from selling to individuals, forcing neighbourhoods to buy in bulk or not at all. “In the neighbourhood where I live, the reality is really terrible,” said David Dai, who is based on the outskirts of Wuhan. Though his apartment complex has organised group-buying, Dai said residents were unhappy with price and quality. “A lot of tomatoes, a lot of onions — they were already rotten,” he told AFP, estimating over a third of the food had to be thrown away. His family must “totally depend” on themselves, added the 49-year-old, who has resorted to saving and drying turnip skins to add nutrients to future meals. The uncertainty of not knowing when the controls will be lifted is also frustrating, said Ma Chen, a man in his 30s who lives alone. “I have no way of knowing how much (food) I should buy.” Tags: ncov"

(MANILA BULLETIN) In a statement over the weekend, the CSC said Memorandum Circular No.5, series of 2020 provides the guidelines for the availment of leave for public sector employees. It also seeks to ensure that precautionary measures are employed in government offices to avoid the spread of the virus in the workplace. Public sector officials and employees whether permanent, temporary, provisional, substitute, coterminous, casual, contractual or fixed term who feel sick with COVID-19 like symptoms or have been exposed to persons infected with the virus are directed to immediately inform their supervisor; voluntarily seek immediate medical attention and/or go on self-quarantine, upon the advice and certification of a licensed physician, the Commission said. Moreover, government workers who have history of travel from China and its Special Administrative Regions (Macau and Hongkong) as well as from other countries declared or identified by competent Philippine authorities prior to and after the issuance of CSC M.C. No. 5, s. 2020 must ensure that they have submitted themselves to “self-quarantine” in their homes or any appropriate health facility for 14 calendar days upon arrival in the Philippines. “They shall not report back to work unless the self-quarantine period has elapsed or they are issued with a clearance as being fit to go back to work by proper health authorities,” the CSC said of such workers. It said that absences relative to the prescribed 14-day self-quarantine of government officials and employees with history of travel to COVID-19 restricted countries as well as for frontline service providers such as but not limited to public health workers, immigration officers, consular officers, who are directed to go on self-quarantine, will not be deducted from the earned leave credits. However, after the self-quarantine period has elapsed or the official/employee is diagnosed with COVID-19 during the 14-day period, the absences shall be charged from their sick leave credits. “For public officials and employees who have to take care of family members positive with COVID-19, absence from work shall be charged against their sick leave credits,” the CSC said. Meanwhile, government workers whose period of self-quarantine after recent travel whether official or personal was deducted against their leave credits prior to the issuance of the guidelines can request to have their leave credits restored. To report back to work, a medical certificate should be submitted to the agency’s Human Resource (HR) unit, issued by either a government or private physician that the employee has undertaken the prescribed 14-day quarantine or if suspected/diagnosed with COVID-19, is issued with a clearance as being fit to go back to work. If the government worker has exhausted the sick leave credits, Section 56 of the Omnibus Rules on Leave will apply to allow the use of vacation leave credits. In case that both vacation and sick leave credits have been consumed, the employee may apply for sick leave of absence without pay. “Agency heads are directed to ensure that the guidelines set under CSC M.C. No. 5, s. 2020 are enforced in the agency and all precautionary measures are observed to avert the occurrence of COVID-19 in public sector workplaces,” the CSC said. The guidelines issued by the CSC on COVID-19 related absences is applicable for the duration of the Public Health Emergency of International Concern until such medical condition has been lifted by the proper health authorities.

Kim said the government has taken self-quarantine measures and is conducting tests on about 9,500 people who took part in services at a Daegu branch of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, also known as the Temple of the Tabernacle of the Testimony, attended by Patient 31. South Korea imposed its highest infectious disease alert on Sunday, vowing limiting public activities and extra resources to Daegu and Cheongdo, which were designated “special care zones” last week. In Daegu and elsewhere, citizens flocked to large supermarkets and pharmacies to buy surgical masks and supplies. Local media photos showed hundreds of people lining up in front of E-Mart stores in Daegu starting as early as 8 a.m. A series of political and cultural events for this week has been canceled, while the culture ministry said on Monday a total of 24 national museums and libraries will temporarily close. The National Assembly called off a government questioning session slated for Thursday afternoon as at least three lawmakers underwent a check after coming in contact with an education official who tested positive.

,"February 24, 2020, 12:05 PM",nCov,Global spread of coronavirus raises pandemic fears,By Reuters ,"By Reuters  Fears mounted on Monday that the coronavirus outbreak in China will grow into a pandemic with disruptive and deadly consequences for countries around the world, after sharp rises in infections in South Korea, Italy, and Iran.  Medical workers get ready as ambulances are parked to transport a confirmed coronavirus patient in Daegu, South Korea, on February 23, 2020. (Yonhap via REUTERS / MANILA BULLETIN) A surge of infections outside mainland China triggered steep falls in Asian share markets and Wall Street stock futures as investors fled to safe havens such as gold. Oil prices tumbled and the Korean won fell to its lowest since August. “The news flow from the weekend has changed the game somewhat, where the focus is much more on the threat of an outbreak outside of China,” said Chris Weston, head of research at broker Pepperstone. South Korea’s fourth-largest city Daegu grew increasingly isolated as the number of infections there increased rapidly, with Asiana Airlines and Korean Air suspending flights to the city until March 9 and March 28 respectively. In Europe, French Health Minister Olivier Veran said he would talk with his European counterparts soon to discuss how best to cope with a possible epidemic in Europe, after Italy reported a third death from the flu-like virus and 150 infections, from just three before Friday. “Tonight there is no epidemic in France. But there is a problematic situation at the door, in Italy, that we are watching with great attention,” Veran told a news conference. Italy sealed off the worst-affected towns and banned public gatherings in much of the north, including halting the carnival in Venice, where there were two cases, to try to contain the biggest outbreak in Europe. Austria suspended train services over the Alps from Italy for about four hours after two travelers showed symptoms of fever. The train carrying about 300 passengers from Venice, Italy, to Munich in Germany was allowed to continue its journey after the two tested negative for the new coronavirus. Austrian Interior Minister Karl Nehammer said a coronavirus task force would meet on Monday to discuss whether to introduce border controls with Italy. South Korean authorities reported a seventh death and another 161 new cases on Monday, taking the total to 763. Of the new cases, 115 were linked to a church in Daegu. Seoul raised its infectious disease alert to its highest level on Sunday after the southeastern city and nearby Cheongdo county – where infections surged last week – were designated “special care zones”. The escalation in the alert level allows the government to send extra resources to Daegu and Cheongdo, forcibly prevent public activities and order the temporary closure of schools. “The government will be all-out to minimize economic impact and make sure the recovery momentum would not be interrupted as we prepare for the worst-case scenario,” South Korean Vice Finance Minister Kim Yong-beom said on Monday. Iran, which announced its first two cases on Wednesday, said it had confirmed 43 cases and eight deaths. Most of the infections were in the Shi’ite Muslim holy city of Qom. Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iraq, Turkey and Afghanistan imposed travel and immigration restrictions on the Islamic Republic. Outside mainland China where it originated late last year, the outbreak has spread to some 28 other countries and territories, with a death toll of around two dozen, according to a Reuters tally. China reported 409 new cases on the mainland, from 648 a day earlier, taking the total number of infections to 77,150 cases as of Feb. 23. The death toll rose by 150 to 2,592. The vast majority of infections were again in Hubei province, further evidence that efforts to contain the outbreak in China are working and enabling four other provinces to lower their coronavirus response measures. Hubei and its capital, Wuhan, remain virtually cut off from the outside world but factories, businesses and construction sites are slowly reopening in the rest of China after an extended Lunar New Year holiday. “At present, the epidemic situation is still severe and complex, and prevention and control work is in the most difficult and critical stage,” President Xi Jinping said on Sunday. Xi highlighted the importance of fighting the epidemic in the capital Beijing, which requires people arriving from elsewhere in China to be quarantined at home for 14 days. He said it would have a relatively big, but short-term impact on the economy and Beijing would step up policy adjustments to help cushion the blow. The G20 grouping of the world’s top economies called on Saturday for a coordinated response to the coronavirus outbreak. The IMF predicted the virus would lower China’s growth this year to 5.6% and shave 0.1 percentage points from global growth. In Japan, where the government is facing growing questions about whether it is doing enough to counter the virus, authorities had confirmed 773 cases by early Sunday evening. Most of them were from a cruise ship quarantined near Tokyo, the Diamond Princess. A third passenger, a Japanese man in his 80s, died on Sunday. British authorities said four people evacuated from the ship had tested positive for the virus after being flown to Britain. READ MORE: China reports 150 more virus deaths, S.

(Photo by STR / AFP) / China OUT / File photo / MANILA BULLETIN) The trip over the weekend is the first reported visit to Wuhan by the WHO since the virus emerged from the city of 11 million people late last year. The virus, which is suspected to have crossed from animals to humans at a market in Wuhan, has killed more than 2,500 people across China and spread around the world. The international group of experts led by the WHO inspected two hospitals during their visit, including a makeshift one at a sports centre, the National Health Commission said on Monday. They also met with top officials at the centre for disease control for Hubei province, of which Wuhan is the capital. China has quarantined Wuhan and other cities in Hubei, blocking tens of millions of residents from travelling, since late January, to try and contain the virus. Most of the deaths have been in Wuhan. The WHO team arrived in China more than a week ago to observe research and testing efforts, so they could then help with recommendations for fighting the epidemic, the National Health Council said previously. The WHO has praised Beijing for its handling of the epidemic. But China has been criticised at home for silencing early warnings from a whistleblower doctor who later died from the virus. The United States has also called for more transparency. China’s numbers of daily new infections have been on a downward trend, but health authorities have sowed confusion about the data by repeatedly changing counting methods. There have been more than 77,000 confirmed infections in China. READ MORE: China reports 150 more virus deaths Tags: ncov"

Top Communist Party leaders including President Xi Jinping attend each year’s gathering of the National People’s Congress (AFP Photo/GREG BAKER) Top Communist Party leaders including President Xi Jinping attend each year’s gathering of the National People’s Congress, which rubber-stamps bills, budgets and personnel moves already decided by the party. But much of China has ground to a halt in the battle against an outbreak that has infected nearly 80,000 people and claimed more than 2,500 lives. Many top officials who would normally attend the meeting are consumed with tackling the virus in their home regions. And Beijing has imposed quarantine measures on those arriving from other parts of China, a practical challenge for a gathering of nearly 3,000 delegates. Then there are the bad optics of China’s leaders arriving in face masks for a meeting that is highly stage-managed to present the image of a Communist Party in perfect control of the country. The NPC’s Standing Committee meets on Monday to discuss whether to delay the session, which was due to start on March 5. Ling Li, a lecturer on Chinese politics at the University of Vienna, said postponement was “very likely”. “If the situation is not significantly improved by Monday, then a decision not to postpone the NPC conference would be unreasonable and signal a desperate effort of the authorities to keep up the appearance of political normality, which is not there,” she said. – Rubber stamp –
The gathering is used to portray the government as answerable to the people’s representatives, but its deliberations are pre-determined well in advance and the whole event is tightly choreographed by the Communist Party. Nevertheless, it generates global interest as a glimpse into China’s political and economic policy priorities for the coming year. Despite its highly choreographed nature, the NPC meeting can still herald important changes. The 2018 session approved the removal of presidential term limits — handing Xi a potentially lifelong tenure. With Mao Zedong as the meeting’s chair, the NPC first convened in September 1954 in Beijing, where delegates passed the new constitution of the People’s Republic of China, five years after its founding. The legislature met almost every year after that for the next decade, but paused during the decade of political turmoil ushered in by Mao’s Cultural Revolution. It re-convened in 1978, two years after Mao’s death. Since 1985, it has been held each March — and on March 5 specifically for the last two decades. But everyday life has been paralysed by the virus and unprecedented measures to contain it, including the lockdown of tens of millions of people at the epicentre in central Hubei province. Zang Tiewei, a spokesman for the legislative affairs commission of the NPC Standing Committee, told state-controlled news agency Xinhua that delaying the yearly political event was “necessary” to ensure “attention is focused on the prevention and control of the epidemic.” Dorothy Solinger, an expert on Chinese politics at the University of California at Irvine, said it would be a “smart move to postpone.” “Look at the message that sends,” she said. “We (the government) are putting all our effort into combatting the virus. We don’t have the time to hold these meetings now.” The virus also deeply impacts some of the session’s most hallowed rituals, she said. “How could they present the mandatory NPC upbeat accounts of the progress and positive prognosis of the economy and other achievements in the midst of such uncertainty as they’re facing now?” Tags: ncov"

Italian police at the entrance to the northern town of Codogno as the authorities lockdown the area in the hope of halting the spread of COVID-19. (AFP / Miguel MEDINA / MANILA BULLETIN) An elderly cancer patient became the third person who has tested positive for the virus to die since Friday in the country, with 149 confirmed cases nationwide. The mounting number of infections has sparked fears of further contagion and prompted the government to effectively quarantine 11 villages. “Virus — Northern Italy under Siege,” read Sunday’s headline in the Il Fatto Quotidiano daily, as television stations delivered a steady stream of images of masked locals and hospital workers in protective suits. “Virus Paralysis,” read La Repubblica. Health officials in the Lombardy region, the center of Italy’s coronavirus outbreak, said an elderly woman being treated in hospital for cancer who had tested positive for the virus had died. If coronavirus is determined to be the cause of death, the woman will be the third person in Italy to have died from COVID-19, the official name of the disease that was detected in China late last year and has since spread across the world. More than 50,000 people in 11 Italian towns have been ordered not to leave their areas, most of them around the town of Codogno, about 70 kilometers (43 miles) southeast of Milan. Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said Saturday that the lockdown could last weeks, enough time for potential infections to incubate. A policewoman in charge of a checkpoint outside Codogno said the area under quarantine would be limited to “a fairly small perimeter to begin with, the towns affected by the epidemic, but it might be widened later.” In Casalpusterlengo, police checkpoints stopped vehicles in both directions on the road that leads to Codogno, 10 minutes away. “We’re going to quickly enforce a total blockade,” said one police officer. “We’re letting people know that if they come in, they won’t be able to leave. I have to admit they’re taking it pretty well, you can see they were expecting it, that they were prepared in some way.” Earlier in the day, queues formed at supermarkets as anxious people, many wearing surgical masks, stocked up on provisions, fearing a long period of isolation. “Don’t push! We want to serve everyone but not all at once,” a store manager told about 50 people waiting with shopping trolleys outside. “We might not have the same quantities of products as usual, but we have enough for everyone.” In Venice, the exuberant annual carnival that attracts tourists from all over the world was canceled from Sunday night, according to the region’s president Luca Zaia. It had been scheduled to continue through Tuesday. Milan fashion shows were also affected, and schools throughout the Lombardy region are to be closed for a week. In Casalpusterlengo, the Lidl grocery store allowed shoppers to enter in groups of 40. “It’s inhuman, fighting for four sandwiches is simply disgusting,” complained a man named Sante, who sat in his car outside and said that if he could, “I would go to Rome and kick them in the butt.” A nurse named Emanuela said: “I’m really scared, we’re going through a really tough situation.” The policewoman told AFP that teams had been sent in from Bologna, Turin, and Genoa to help local law enforcement. The government said those who violated the quarantine could face fines and even three months in jail. It has also said the army was prepared to step in if needed to enforce the perimeter. On Sunday, the head of the civil protection department, Angelo Borrelli, told a news conference that thousands of beds were ready in military barracks or hotels to house quarantined or sick individuals, if needed. To date, the virus has killed more than 2,400 people worldwide, with roughly 80,000 infected, for the most part in China. Tags: ncov"

The first case was announced on Friday. The two were among 11 Israelis allowed off the ship in Yokohama, Japan and flown home after initially testing negative. All were placed in isolation for a 14 day period at the Sheba Medical Center near Tel Aviv. Earlier Sunday Israeli authorities ordered nearly 200 pupils into home quarantine after they were in proximity to South Korean tourists carrying the coronavirus. The move came after the South Korean visitors,  members of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, toured Israeli sites between February 8-15 and upon their return home 18 of them were discovered to be infected with the virus. Israel’s health ministry urged people who might have encountered these tourists to self-quarantine, including 180 pupils and 19 staff from three separate schools who it said had close contact. The pupils and staff, including 18 teachers and a guard, were instructed “to remain home” for 14 days, the education ministry said. The health ministry also published a detailed list of the sites visited by the South Korean tourists, ordering “anyone who has been in touch with the pilgrims” to “home-quarantine until 14 days from the encounter with the group have passed”. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu chaired a high-level special meeting on the COVID-19 virus and announced a taskforce to manage the threat. “Today, I will appoint a ministerial team to convene on a daily basis in order to deal with this major challenge,” he said in remarks after the meeting, which included senior security officials. On Saturday Israel refused to allow some 200 non-Israelis to disembark from a plane which arrived from South Korea, as part of measures against the new coronavirus. The health ministry has also ordered its citizens to observe an obligatory 14-day home-quarantine if they have recently visited Japan, South Korea, mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, Singapore or Thailand. “In addition, anyone who has been in Taiwan, Italy or Australia in the past 14 days and is developing the disease’s symptoms should be examined,” the ministry said in a statement. Internal Security Minister Gilad Erdan, who attended Sunday’s situation assessment, warned that law enforcement would act against those found to be disobeying the self-quarantine order. “The Israeli police have prepared all the necessary enforcement teams in the event that there may be citizens who do not obey the instructions,” he told journalists, without elaborating. He also warned those who might consider exploiting the scare to disrupt a hotly-contested March 2 general election. He said that concerns included the spreading of fake news in order to affect voter turnout. “This is a criminal offense,” he said. “There is special readiness by the police to prevent abuse. Meanwhile, Palestinian health minister Mai al-Kaila said there were no confirmed cases in the West Bank, but that to manage the threat her office was coordinating with Egypt, Jordan and Israel.

,"February 24, 2020, 11:10 PM",nCov,Xi vows relentless fight vs COVID-19,By Xinhua and Bloomberg,"By Xinhua and Bloomberg President Xi Jinping on Sunday vowed China’s unremitting efforts in the prevention and control of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic.  China’s President Xi Jinping (Noel Celis/Pool via REUTERS/MANILA BULLETIN) “This is both a crisis and a big test for us,” Xi said during an unprecedented mass meeting of top Chinese leaders in Beijing on Sunday. “The COVID-19 outbreak is a major public health emergency that has spread in the fastest speed, caused the most extensive infection, and is the most difficult to contain in the country since the founding of the People’s Republic of China,” he said. Global pandemic feared As China takes relentless efforts to battle COVID-19, the emergence of new centers of coronavirus infection outside of China is fueling concern the outbreak could become a global pandemic, rattling financial markets and stoking anxiety over the potential hit to economies. While the outbreak in China appears to be becoming more predictable, with the lockdown of Wuhan – the city where the pathogen first emerged – being eased, the virus is taking hold in other parts of the world, with increasing infection and death tolls in South Korea, Italy and parts of the Middle East sparking the most alarm. South Korea confirmed 70 more novel coronavirus cases Monday afternoon, bringing its tally to 833, by far the largest national total outside China. The country has seen a rapid surge in the number of coronavirus cases – adding more than 700 cases in less than a week – since a cluster of infections emerged from a religious sect in the southern city of Daegu. Most of the country’s cases are connected to the Shincheonji Church of Jesus in Daegu, including 129 of Monday’s confirmations, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a statement. Two more people had died, it added – both of them connected to a second cluster around a hospital – taking the toll to seven. More than 100 cases have been confirmed at the Daenam Hospital in Cheongdo, near Daegu, most of them inpatients being treated for mental illnesses. South Korean President Moon Jae-in on Sunday raised the country’s virus alert to the highest “red” level, in a bid to strengthen the government response to the spiralling outbreak. READ MORE: Global spread of coronavirus raises pandemic fears Coronavirus meeting Sunday’s meeting in Beijing was presided over by Li Keqiang and attended by Li Zhanshu, Wang Yang, Wang Huning, Zhao Leji and Han Zheng. Officials from the political Bureau of CPC Central Committee to county-level Party officials and military officials of corresponding level attended the meeting via videophone. Some 170,000 officials took part in the meeting. President Xi Jinping arranged and coordinated epidemic prevention and social and economic development during the meeting. Xi, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, called for firm, solid, and meticulous efforts in the epidemic prevention and control, urging Party committees and governments at all levels to remain vigilant and make unremitting efforts in the epidemic prevention and control work. “No victory should be lightly announced until there is a complete win,” Xi said. Course of action vs COVID-19 Xi enumerated the courses of action the government will take: “The Chinese nation has experienced many ordeals in its history, but it has never been overwhelmed. Instead, it has become more and more courageous, growing up and rising up from the hardships,” Xi said. “The epidemic situation remains grim and complex and it is now a most crucial moment to curb the spread,” he added. Xi asked Party committees and government officials at all levels to continue with their unremitting efforts in various prevention and control work. He said efforts should be made to fully unleash the huge potential and powerful driving force of China’s development, and strive to achieve the goals and tasks for economic and social development this year. In order to win the people’s war against the epidemic, the Party’s leadership should be strengthened, Xi said. Li Keqiang called on all officials to rally behind the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at the core and urged them to strictly enforce the decisions and policies made by the CPC Central Committee. Second peak possible The bursts of infections outside China could drive a second peak in an epidemic that’s already killed more than 2,400 in China and severely disrupted global business and travel activity. In Italy and Iran, the mortality rate from the pneumonia-causing virus appears to be much higher than that in China, hinting at hundreds or thousands of still-undiscovered cases of infection. In South Korea, which has the most in-country cases outside of China, the government raised its public health alert to the highest level, allowing it to quarantine cities, delay the start of school and restrict people’s movements. Stocks and higher-yielding assets retreated across Asia Monday, as investors grappled with the implications of the widening outbreak. Impact manageable But Xi downplayed the impact of the epidemic on China’s economic and social development as “temporary and generally manageable.” He said the COVID-19 epidemic will inevitably deal a relatively big blow to China’s economic and social development. However, at such a time it is even more important to view China’s development in a comprehensive, dialectical and long-term perspective, and to strengthen and firm up confidence. In general, the fundamentals of China’s long-term sound economic growth remain unchanged, Xi added. Risk to economy South Korea, however, warned the epidemic poses a risk to its fragile economic recovery as airlines halted flights and travel agencies canceled group tours to the country. Samsung Electronics Co. and LG Electronics Inc. are among major companies taking precautions as the outbreak rapidly gathers pace. “I don’t think it can be contained and there is a long way to go before reaching the turning point,” said Ben Cowling, a professor of epidemiology at Hong Kong University. “The roles will soon be reversed — countries that had banned travel from China may soon see China ban travel from them.” Restaurants closed Italy is becoming a virus hotspot, raising alarm levels given the European Union’s policy of free movement of people and goods within the 27-nation bloc. The Italian government canceled the remaining days of the Venice Carnival at the weekend and universities and restaurants have been closed with three deaths and at least 140 infections recorded. Austria halted train traffic from Italy on Sunday as an area of 50,000 people near Milan was locked down amid the surge in cases. In Iran, reports there of eight deaths out of 43 infections — which equates to a mortality rate of 18.6% — sparked widespread concern that the extent of the virus’ spread within the closed-off country is being covered up. The mortality rate in China, where there is more than 76,000 cases, is 3.2%. Kuwait and Bahrain reported their first cases of the virus on Monday, linked to people who traveled back from Iran.

A rally in support of Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed came under attack in the town of Ambo, located roughly 100 kilometres (60 miles) west of the capital, Addis Ababa (AFP Photo/Simon MALFATTO) The incident occurred in the town of Ambo, located roughly 100 kilometres (60 miles) west of the capital, Addis Ababa. “The bomb attack on a rally for Dr. Abiy has injured 29 people, of whom 28 have been treated and sent home,” Arasa Merdasa, the top police official in Ethiopia’s Oromia region, where Ambo is located, told the state-run Ethiopian News Agency. “Police have arrested six people who are suspected in the attack,” Arasa said. Ethiopia’s electoral board has scheduled landmark national polls for August 29. Opposition parties and civil society organisations have questioned whether the elections will be peaceful and credible, citing persistent ethnic violence since Abiy was appointed in 2018 following several years of anti-government protests. The formal campaign period begins in May. Abiy did not attend Sunday’s rally, which was organised by officials in Ambo. Abiy, the winner of last year’s Nobel Peace Prize, hopes the elections will secure him a mandate to continue with an ambitious agenda of political and economic reforms. Arasa said Sunday’s attack was believed to be the work of the Oromo Liberation Army (OLA), the breakaway armed wing of the Oromo Liberation Front, an opposition party. Officials have also blamed the OLA for the assassination on Friday of the top security official in Burayu, another Oromia town located on the outskirts of Addis Ababa. That attack left three other people injured, and police “vowed to hunt down” those responsible, state-affiliated Fana Broadcasting Corporate reported. Arasa declined to answer questions about the latest violence in Oromia when contacted Sunday, referring an AFP reporter to the Ethiopian News Agency report. Tags: ncov"

The G20 held a two-day meeting in the capital of Saudi Arabia, the first Arab nation to hold the grouping’s presidency (AFP Photo/FAYEZ NURELDINE) Global growth was poised for a modest rebound to 3.3 percent this year, up from 2.9 percent last year, IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva said at the meeting in the Saudi capital. “The projected recovery… is fragile,” Georgieva said. “The COVID-19 virus — a global health emergency — has disrupted economic activity in China and could put the recovery at risk,” she said in a statement. “I reported to the G20 that even in the case of rapid containment of the virus, growth in China and the rest of the world would be impacted.” Alarm has been growing over the new virus as Chinese authorities lock down millions of people to prevent its spread, with major knock-on effects economically. The virus has now claimed 2,345 lives in China, cutting off transportation, disrupting trade and fanning investor alarm as businesses are forced to close their doors. Georgieva told the two-day Riyadh gathering that the outbreak would shave about 0.1 percentage points from global growth and constrain China’s growth to 5.6 percent this year. The IMF chief urged G20 nations to cooperate to contain the spread of the virus. “COVID-19 is a stark reminder of our interconnections and the need to work together,” Georgieva said. “In this regard, the G20 is an important forum to help put the global economy on a more sound footing.” Tags: ncov"
,"February 24, 2020, 7:36 AM",nCov,"Spread of coronavirus confirms WHO fears, say experts",By Agence France-Presse,"By Agence France-Presse The sharp rise in cases and the geographical spread of the coronavirus outside China confirm WHO fears over dealing with the crisis, experts warned Sunday as they appealed for ever greater vigilance.  With fatalities mounting outside China, medical experts are warning of a need for extreme vigilance (AFP/ MANILA BULLETIN) “There has been a profound shift in the direction that COVID-19 (new coronavirus) is taking over the past 48 hours,” said Professor Devi Sridhar, Director of the Global Health Governance Programme at the University of Edinburgh Medical School. “The WHO and its member state governments now need to be thinking about transitioning from containment to mitigation, ie. reducing the negative impacts of continued transmission,” Sridhar warned. On Friday, World Health Organization (WHO) chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus had already sounded the alarm, saying the window to stem the virus was shrinking. “We are still in a phase where containment is possible… our window of opportunity is narrowing,” he warned, adding if countries did not quickly mobilise to counter the virus spread, matters could get “messy.” He also warned that Africa’s poor health infrastructure left it vulnerable to the COVID-19 disease, which has spilled out of China to more than 25 countries. Those fears have been compounded by three fatalities in recent days in Italy — where some 50,000 people are in lockdown — eight in Iran and six in South Korea. The WHO has expressed concern at the apparent emergence of cases without a clear epidemiological link to China, where it emerged. – ‘Anywhere in the world’ –
“It’s what we call the passage to community transmission,” said Professor Arnaud Fontanet, specialist in epidemiology of emerging diseases at France’s Pasteur Institute. “That renders controlling it much more difficult and presages the risk of its introduction beyond China.” Cases in both Lebanon and Canada appear to have emanated from Iran, for example, while, in Italy, scientists are puzzled that they cannot trace a link between several cases of sufferers with no apparent links to infected persons. “What is happening in Italy and South Korea and Iran could happen anywhere in the world,” said Sridhar. Nathalie MacDermott, lecturer at King’s College London, said “the evolving situation in South Korea, Iran and Italy is very concerning. “There has been the expectation that some countries might develop person to person transmission of SARS-COV2 following an imported case of infection from an affected country. “What is concerning is the lack of clear contact with such an individual in initiating clusters in these three countries, and particularly in Iran and Italy.” MacDermott urged all countries to take prompt action “to try and contain these clusters before there is dissemination to large proportions of the population.” “I think this is a new phase” in the propagation of the virus as new chains of transmission emerge from previously undetected cases, says Eric D’Ortenzio, epidemiologist at France’s Inserm medical research institute. He likewise urged increased surveillance for any potential emergence of home-grown cases as well as areas known to be already affected by the outbreak. Tags: ncov"

The latest death was a Japanese man in his 80s, the health ministry said on its website, days after a couple also in their 80s died.  (REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon/File Photo / MANILA BULLETIN) The government is facing growing questions about whether it is doing enough to stop the spread of the virus, which originated in China and has killed more than 2,400 there. Tokyo is preparing to host the 2020 Summer Olympics in July. Health Minister Katsunobu Kato said he would hold a meeting of experts on Monday and formulate a basic policy for addressing the disease on Tuesday. Kato apologized on Saturday for allowing an infected woman to leave the Diamond Princess, which has been quarantined in Yokohama since Feb. 3. The woman came ashore on Wednesday but then tested positive for the disease on Saturday in Tochigi Prefecture, north of Tokyo. Kato said on Saturday that officials had failed to properly test 23 people who disembarked the ship, and his ministry was trying to contact them to be retested. The ship is owned by Carnival Corp and was originally carrying some 3,700 passengers and crew representing more than a dozen nationalities. Some nations have flown their citizens home to undergo additional quarantines. Japanese authorities have allowed some other passengers to leave, prompting concerns they could be spreading the virus in Japan. There have been 634 infections on the ship, according to national broadcaster NHK. Those cases represent the largest concentration of the illness outside China. Four new cases had been discovered in Japan as of early Sunday evening, bringing the total to 773, including the cruise ship, NHK reported.

Restaurants are taking a huge hit as many people across the country of 1.4 billion have been either under some form of quarantine or are reluctant to venture outside since late January over fears of contagion.  China’s restaurants have taken a major hit because of the coronavirus outbreak (AFP Photo/Greg Baker/MANILA BULLETIN) At Cindy’s Cafe in Beijing’s Roosevelt Plaza, dine-in revenue has fallen to zero, and relying on deliveries hardly makes up the shortfall, said manager Cai Yaoyang. “On a good day in the past, we could earn over 1,000 yuan ($143) a day from deliveries,” Cai told AFP. “Now, it’s just around 200 to 300 yuan a day. The impact is especially big.” He estimates losses to the company, which has more than 10 outlets in China, could be “at least a few million (yuan)” given rent and unused stock from the unexpected Lunar New Year closures. “If there is no business, staff may be asked to take more days off,” said Cai. Many restaurants have suspended dine-ins to help curb the spread of the virus, but eateries that have resumed operations remain largely empty, with people still encouraged to stay home to avoid infections. The new coronavirus has killed more than 2,400 in China and infected nearly 77,000. At an outlet of Bellagio Cafe, another restaurant chain, employee Zhu Xiangying told AFP it had only made 30,000 yuan in around 10 days, compared with over 200,000 yuan in normal times. – Selling fresh produce – The China Cuisine Association said in a report this month that the country’s restaurant industry saw 4.67 trillion yuan ($665 billion) in catering revenue last year, with earnings over the Lunar New Year break making up over 15 percent. With millions of people staying indoors during the festival this year, those holiday earnings have evaporated. Some, including hotpot chain Haidilao — which has temporarily closed its mainland China outlets — have turned to selling fresh and frozen products directly to communities. In Yunhaiyao, a chain specialising in Yunnan cuisine, restaurant tables are piled with fresh vegetables instead of cooked dishes — ready to be packed and delivered to housing compounds. Yunhaiyao, which has more than 100 outlets in China, now bulk-buys groceries for residents near its stores as a new income stream. It has also rolled out a fresh line of prepared ingredients so customers can quickly whip up Yunnan specialities while cooped up at home. Zhao Yebule, store manager at Yunhaiyao’s Tongzhou branch in Beijing, said deliveries can rake in up to 6,000 yuan daily. But the company is still in a pinch. Li Jianying, a regional manager overseeing 10 outlets, said only around half of his staff were ready to resume work. Others cannot leave their residential compounds freely or face a 14-day quarantine when they return to Beijing. “Our sales are just about 10 percent that of regular times before the epidemic,” with delivery sales falling by half, he added. Yunhaiyao remains worried about expenses such as rent, and has taken a 10 million yuan loan to ease cashflow pressures. Li, however, stressed there were no plans to cut staff for now. – ‘Sharing’ employees – One way out is to “share” employees with other businesses that are enjoying an increase in demand: e-commerce platforms. JD.com saw a 215 percent spike in fresh food sales over the Lunar New Year, while Meituan Grocery’s daily sales in Beijing tripled at its peak during the holiday. Li estimates “a few hundred” Yunhaiyao staff have taken on short-term work with third-party firms like supermarkets or online platforms. Cai added Cindy Cafe was in talks to help workers find temporary employment. JD.com and JD-backed Dada Group have offered more than 35,000 jobs, with over half being frontline roles such as couriers and drivers, while around 40 workers from restaurant chain Putien now staff Meituan Grocery as well. Yet, the current situation remains a looming threat to jobs. A survey by Peking and Tsinghua universities, covering around 1,000 small- and medium-sized enterprises, said about 85 percent of these firms could only survive up to three months on their cash reserves. Even as policymakers extend preferential loans and introduce tax breaks — among a slew of other measures — authorities “won’t be able to extend life support to all”, said Capital Economics in a report on Wednesday. “The longer the disruptions drag on, the harder it will be to avert significant damage to employment,” it added. As it is, the big players are hurting. Lao Xiang Ji, which has some 800 outlets, estimates it suffered at least 500 million yuan in losses, said chairman Shu Cong Xuan in a video on the company’s WeChat account. Another major chain, Xibei Noodle Village, said on social media that it “cannot last for long” with tight cash flow. Tags: ncov"

An epidemic? We are getting ready for it,” Veran added. Veran said the number of laboratories in France equipped with diagnostic tests would be increased to reach a capacity of “several thousands” of tests a day, against 400 now.

More than half the additional cases were found to be linked to a Shincheonji Church of Jesus congregation in the southeastern city of Daegu after a 61-year-old woman known as “Patient 31” who attended services at the church tested positive for the virus last week. The woman had no recent record of overseas travel. A majority of 309 or 55.6% of the total 556 confirmed cases were linked to the Shincheonji Church, Korea Centers for Disease and Control and Prevention (KCDC) said. “We are studying and carrying on preventive measures (against the virus) in Daegu, and keeping the possibility of a community spread in mind,” KCDC Director Jeong Eun-kyeong told a news conference. South Korea’s earlier cases were linked to China but the new infections center on Daegu, a city of about 2.5 million, and a hospital in Cheongdo, a county with about 43,000 people. In response to the recent sharp rise in cases, KCDC designated both the city of Daegu and Cheongdo county as “special care zones” on Friday. Since the first outbreak on Jan. 20, four have died from the virus in South Korea. The fourth patient who died on Sunday was a 57-year-old man who was at the Cheongdo hospital, KCDC said. The U.S. State Department on Saturday raised its travel advisory level one notch for South Korea to Level 2 on a scale of 1 to 4, asking travelers to avoid contact with sick people amid the contagious virus spread in the country. A total of 17 South Korean Catholics in North Gyeongsang Province and their tour guide in Seoul who had gone on a pilgrimage to Israel earlier this month were confirmed to have been infected with the virus, KCDC said Israeli and Palestinian authorities sought to allay fears of a potential local outbreak of the coronavirus after learning that South Korean pilgrims who had toured some of the holy land’s most popular sites were later found to be carrying the virus. South Koreans on board a Korean Air flight were refused entry at Tel Aviv’s Ben Gurion International airport on Saturday evening due to concerns over the virus spread, South Korea’s foreign ministry said in a statement on Sunday. “As the measure was taken without notice in advance by Israel, we have lodged a complaint for causing inconveniences to our travelers and asked to prevent a recurrence,” said the ministry adding its Israeli counterpart promised to cooperate with South Korea. Meanwhile, Catholic churches in the cities of Daegu, Gwangju and elsewhere have suspended mass and other gatherings. “Devotees shouldn’t go to any risky places, or get full check-ups before going anywhere else if they did go to those places,” said Heo Young-moo, 88, who visited Myeongdong Catholic Church in the capital Seoul.

Coronavirus (AFP / MANILA BULLETIN) Europe saw its first deaths from the COVID-19 strain, whose trans­mission, authorities say, has been untraceable in some instances. In­fection has now reached more than 25 countries worldwide and caused more than a dozen fatalities outside China. In northern Italy, a 77-year-old woman died Saturday near the small town of Codogno in Lombardy, one day after a 78-year-old retired brick­layer succumbed to the virus in the neighboring region of Veneto. “The contagiousness of this virus is very strong and pretty virulent,” Lombardy’s health chief Giulio Gallera told reporters. But he cautioned: “Today, it’s not a pandemic.” The cases triggered a lockdown in approximately a dozen Italian towns – a move reminiscent of China’s sealing off of entire cities in central Hubei province, the epicenter of the virus where millions remain under quarantine. A second person also died in South Korea, where the number of cases spiked, authorities said, while the death toll in Iran reached five and a number of new cases were reported across the Middle East. World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has cautioned that if countries do not quickly mobilize to fight the reach of the virus, “this outbreak could go in any direction. It could even be messy.” A study from the Imperial College London, meanwhile, esti­mated that “about two thirdsof COVID-19 cases exported from mainland China have remained undetected worldwide, potentially leaving sources of human-to-human transmission unchecked.” The outbreak has now claimed 2,345 lives in China and infected more than 76,000 people. The number of new cases in China outside Hubei has been generally declining, although new outbreaks have emerged in several prisons and hospitals. On Saturday Chinese authorities reported nearly 400 fresh cases nationwide, less than half the previ­ous day and just 31 outside Hubei. International spread Cases of the deadly virus were reported in a range of countries in the Middle East, including the first cases in Israel and Lebanon. Iraq and Kuwait, which share borders with Iran, were on high alert for a potential outbreak after banning travel to and from the Islamic Republic, although they have not confirmed any cases do­mestically. Iran’s latest cases take to 28 its total number of confirmed infections. Based on official figures, nearly 18 percent of those infected with the new coronavirus in the coun­try have died, compared with little more than three percent in China. Already one of the worst-hit nations outside of China, South Korea reported 123 new cases Sunday, taking its fast-rising total to 556. Its death toll also rose to four with two additional fatalities. South Korea is raising its alert level on the new coronavirus to the “highest,” President Moon Jae-in said Sunday, in the face of a sudden spike in the number of infections. “The COVID-19 incident faces a grave turning point. The next few days will be crucial,” Moon said following a government meeting on the virus.“The government will raise the alert level to the highest level accord­ing to experts’ recommendations,” he added. The higher toll came a day after Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun said the nation of around 51 million people faced a “grave” situation. The Shincheonji Church of Jesus in the southern city of Daegu – consid­ered by many a cult – has emerged as a hotbed of contagion, with hundreds of members infected. Prime Minister Chung called on Koreans to refrain from attending large gatherings, including religious services. Other South Korean cases involved many under hospital treatment for mental health issues, an employee with electronics giant Samsung, and eight people who just returned from a trip to Israel. South Korea’s earlier cases were linked to China but the new infections center on two places, Daegu, a city of about 2.5 million, and a hospital in Cheongdo, a county with about 43,000 people. Both have been designated “special care zones.” The latest group of passengers disembarked from the coronavirus-stricken Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan on Saturday. Several Australians, 18 Americans, and an Israeli evacuated earlier this week tested positive for coronavirus back in their home countries – fuel­ling questions about Tokyo’s policy of allowing former passengers to return home. Two former Japanese passengers in their 80s have died. Meanwhile, a Japa­nese woman who was part of the latest group of passengers to disembark has tested positive in Tochigi Prefecture, local media reported. The British government said an evacuation flight left Japan Saturday, with 32 British and European passen­gers on board. As fears spread of the virus in Ja­pan, Tokyo 2020 Olympic organisers postponed training for their army of volunteers – but said that there was “no consideration” of cancelling the Games. In total, China has reported 76,936 cases, and 2,442 deaths. The WHO says the virus remains mild in 80% of pa­tients, and severe or critical in 20%. In Italy, schools and universities were closed and three Serie A soccer matches slated for Sunday postponed in Lombardy and Veneto, the two regions where the outbreak is con­centrated. The announcement by Iranian au­thorities of multiple cases and deaths over a short period of time has led to criticism and accusations from Iranians online of a cover-up by officials. Au­thorities had no immediate response. The United Arab Emirates an­nounced two new cases on Saturday, an Iranian tourist and his wife, raising the total in that country to 13. Lebanon confirmed its first case on Friday, a 45-year-old woman returning from Qom, Iran. Iraq announced on Thursday that it had banned border crossings by Iranian nationals, Iraq’s state news agency said. Tags: ncov"

An infectious diseases expert had described the situation on the ship as ‘completely chaotic’ (AFP/File Photo/ MANILA BULLETIN) Health Minister Katsunobu Kato has also apologized after 23 passengers were allowed to leave without being properly tested. The woman in her 60s returned to her home in Tochigi prefecture north of Tokyo by train after she disembarked on Wednesday, but she had a fever on Friday and tested positive on Saturday, a local official told AFP. She was the first passenger from the ship to have tested positive in Japan after having been cleared to disembark. The news comes as infectious disease experts and local officials have questioned the effectiveness of the quarantine period on the vessel. “There has been a judgement that those who disembarked after testing negative had no problem, but it has now become clear that those people can turn positive,” Tochigi governor Tomokazu Fukuda told a press conference late Saturday. “We call on the government to take additional measures,” he said. Japanese authorities have said they made a decision to disembark passengers who tested negative during the quarantine period as they took measures to prevent spread of the virus — passengers were confined to their cabins, except for brief outings on open deck when they were required to wear gloves and masks and keep their distance from fellow passengers. However, infectious diseases specialist Kentaro Iwata has said the situation on the ship was “completely chaotic” and violated quarantine procedures, in blunt criticism rarely seen in Japanese officialdom. The Kobe University professor later said he had heard from a colleague on board that quarantine procedures had improved, but still recommended that all those disembarking the ship should be monitored for at least 14 days and should avoid contact with others. Since Wednesday, about 970 passengers — who tested negative after the government put the ship under quarantine on February 5 — have disembarked, according to local media. On Saturday, around 100 more passengers who had reportedly been in close contact with infected people on board were allowed to get off. They included the last group of Japanese passengers while some foreign passengers were still waiting on board for their governments to send chartered aircraft. With the latest disembarkation, a 14-day quarantine is expected to start for more than 1,000 crew still on board. Many of them were not placed in isolation as they were needed to keep the ship running —  preparing food and delivering meals to cabins.

With the latest disembarkation, a 14-day quarantine is expected to start for more than 1,000 crew still on board.

Cases with no clear link include those with no travel history to China or contact with a confirmed case, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a briefing.  (REUTERS/Josiane Kouagheu/MANILA BULLETIN FILE PHOTO) China has reported 75,569 cases to the WHO, including 2,239 deaths, he said. According to available data, the disease remains mild in 80% of coronavirus patients, and is severe or critical in 20% of patients, he said. The virus has been fatal in 2% of reported cases. The risk of death increases for older patients, Tedros said, adding there were relatively few cases among children. Outside China, there have been 1,200 cases in 26 countries, with eight deaths, Tedros said. That includes one confirmed case on the African continent, in Egypt, he said. He called the reported decline in new cases in China welcome news but said it had to be interpreted very cautiously, adding, “It is far too early to make predictions about this outbreak”. A WHO-led international team of experts, which has been on the ground in China for the past week, will travel to Wuhan, the epicenter of the virus outbreak, on Saturday. “Our biggest concern continues to be the potential for COVID-19 to spread in countries with weaker health systems,” Tedros said. The WHO is calling for $675 million to support countries, especially those which are most vulnerable, he said, adding it has identified 13 countries in Africa that are seen as a priority because of their links to China. It has shipped more than 30,000 sets of personal protective equipment to several African countries, and is ready to ship almost 60,000 more sets to 19 countries in coming weeks, Tedros said. The WHO has also appointed two specialists as special envoys to help African countries prepare for the potential arrival of the virus: the director of the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, John Nkengasong, and the director general of the Center for Vaccine Development in Mali, Samba Sow.

On Saturday, Italian news agency ANSA reported a second death from the virus in the Lombardy region, where Codogno is located. It came one day after the death of a 78-year-old retired bricklayer from the Padua area in the nearby Veneto region, who was the first local person in Europe to die from the coronavirus. ANSA reported that the new victim was a woman. No further information was immediately available. Italy’s health minister said that the man who died on Friday, Adriano Trevisan, had been admitted to hospital 10 days earlier for an unrelated health issue. He was one of two people in the Veneto region with the virus, where another confirmed case overnight in a 53-year old man brought that number to three, president of the Veneto region, Luca Zaia told Rai24 news. In Lombardy, 16 other people were discovered to have caught the virus and the region took immediate measures to isolate affected areas. It was not immediately clear whether the victim on Saturday was part of that group, or a new case. In Rome, three people are being treated in isolation for the virus. – Closed for business – At Codogno’s center, only a bakery and a pharmacy were open, while other shops posted signs saying they were closed due to a local ordinance. At the civic hospital, there was very little movement early Saturday other than nurses and other workers finishing their night shifts. Those who have tested positive for the virus in Codogno include the 38-year-old man’s wife, who is eight months pregnant, and another man. Three others in the town have tested positive to a first novel coronavirus test and are awaiting their definitive results. Since December, COVID-19 has killed more than 2,200 people in China, the epidemic’s epicenter. Elsewhere in the world, it has killed over a dozen people and spread across some 27 countries and territories. Last Sunday, an 80-year-old Chinese tourist died from the new coronavirus in France. In the areas in northern Italy, over 50,000 people have been asked to stay at home while all public activities such as carnival celebrations, church masses and sporting events have been banned for up to a week.

,"February 22, 2020, 6:14 PM",nCov,Wuhan woman with no symptoms infects five relatives with coronavirus – study,By Reuters,"By Reuters A 20-year-old Chinese woman from Wuhan, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak, traveled 400 miles (675 km) north to Anyang where she infected five relatives, without ever showing signs of infection, Chinese scientists reported on Friday, offering new evidence that the virus can be spread asymptomatically. The case study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, offered clues about how the coronavirus is spreading, and suggested why it may be difficult to stop. “Scientists have been asking if you can have this infection and not be ill? The answer is apparently, yes,” said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, who was not involved in the study. China has reported a total of 75,567 cases of the virus known as COVID-19 to the World Health Organization (WHO) including 2,345 deaths, and the virus has already spread to 26 countries and territories outside of mainland China. Researchers have reported sporadic accounts of individuals without any symptoms spreading the virus. What’s different in this study is that it offers a natural lab experiment of sorts, Schaffner said. “You had this patient from Wuhan where the virus is, traveling to where the virus wasn’t. She remained asymptomatic and infected a bunch of family members and you had a group of physicians who immediately seized on the moment and tested everyone.” According to the report by Dr. Meiyun Wang of the People’s Hospital of Zhengzhou University and colleagues, the woman traveled from Wuhan to Anyang on Jan. 10 and visited several relatives. When they started getting sick, doctors isolated the woman and tested her for coronavirus. Initially, the young woman tested negative for the virus, but a follow-up test was positive. All five of her relatives developed COVID-19 pneumonia, but as of Feb. 11, the young woman still had not developed any symptoms, her chest CT remained normal and she had no fever, stomach or respiratory symptoms, such as cough or sore throat. Scientists in the study said if the findings are replicated, “the prevention of COVID-19 infection could prove challenging.” Key questions now, Schaffner said, are how often does this kind of transmission occur and when during the asymptomatic period does a person test positive for the virus.

The COVID-19 outbreak first emerged in Iran on Wednesday, when officials said it killed two elderly people in Qom, a Shiite holy city south of the capital. They were the first confirmed deaths from the disease in the Middle East. Since then, Iran has carried out tests on 785 suspected cases, Jahanpour said. “Most of the cases are either Qom residents or have a history of coming and going from Qom to other cities,” the health ministry spokesman said. Qom is a center for Islamic studies and pilgrims, attracting scholars from Iran and beyond. An official said the first two victims, who were Qom residents, had not left Iran.

KCDC designated both the city of Daegu, which has a population of 2.5 million people, and Cheongdo county, home to around 43,000 people, as “special care zones” on Friday. Officials were sending in military medical staff and other health workers, and extra resources, including hospital beds. At least half of the national cases are linked to a 61-year-old woman known as “Patient 31” who attended religious services at a branch of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus in Daegu, the Temple of the Tabernacle of the Testimony. The woman had no recent record of overseas travel, authorities said. KCDC said on Saturday they had obtained a list of 9,300 people who had attended church services, around 1,200 of whom had complained of flu-like symptoms. “We are conducting investigation based on the database … we have obtained,” KCDC Director Jeong Eun-kyeong told reporters. The church and Cheongdo hospital outbreaks may also be linked as several church members attended a funeral at the hospital for the brother of the founder of the church earlier this month. President Moon Jae-in has called for officials to investigate potential links. Cases from the hospital surged from 18 to 111 overnight, with all but two of the new infections from the hospital’s psychiatric unit. “We think the patients had repeated exposure given the isolated facility of the psychiatric wards where many patients share the same room,” KCDC Director Jeong Eun-kyeong told reporters. The hospital, which has around 600 patients and staff, has been closed and patients are still being transferred to other facilities. Two people have died in South Korea in the current outbreak; a woman in her fifties who was moved from to Busan for treatment and a 63-year-old man. Both were patients at the Cheongdo hospital. Among the new cases confirmed on Saturday, two were in Busan, while one was on Jeju, a soldier stationed on the island who had come into contact with residents in the Daegu area. The government had previously banned all military personnel at a Daegu base from leaving the barracks. In the capital of Seoul, thousands of people took to the streets on Saturday for regular weekend political rallies, despite the city’s mayor on Friday saying the gatherings would be banned as part of containment measures.

Li and her family are among the millions of people across China’s Hubei province, epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak, who are subject to official orders to stay at home amid attempts to contain the spread of the disease. Officials and volunteers have sealed-off buildings, erected barricades and stepped up surveillance to ensure compliance with the ban on movement, measures that are taking a toll on many in the community.

(China Daily via REUTERS/File Photo/MANILA BULLETIN) “Every day there’s fighting. Every day we sigh. Every day I’m scolded,” Li, 19, told Reuters by WeChat from the apartment in Ezhou, a city near the provincial capital of Wuhan. Li said the family had eaten the same combination of white rice, cabbage and peanuts for three weeks, since gathering to celebrate the Lunar New Year last month, stinting on portions due to limits on the numbers of people from each household allowed out to shop. Cities and villages across China have taken measures to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, which has infected more than 76,000 people in the country, killing 2,345, but the protocols in Hubei are the most extreme. The province, which is home to 60 million people, announced a “sealed management” policy a week ago that effectively prevents residents from leaving their homes, further isolating a population that has been living under a transport lockdown since late January. “We bought vegetables today, but I don’t know when we will go out again,” Li said by WeChat on Friday, adding the family could now only buy food at the gate of their compound. Officials have promised to ensure sufficient food and medicine for residents and have also warned against hoarding or price-gouging. “Sealed management will continue so that no one will go outside, but they must still be able to buy their daily necessities,” Wuhan’s newly appointed Communist Party chief, Wang Zhonglin, said last Sunday. Hubei’s sealed management policy depends heavily on residential committees, a network of volunteers who carry out government and Communist Party orders at the grassroots level in coordination with private employees of residential compounds. One day last week, before her compound in Jingzhou city was completely sealed, 31-year old Vicky Yi said she was stopped at the gate by a volunteer when she tried to go out for groceries. Minutes later, an elderly woman walked past and out of the compound. Yi argued with the volunteer to let her out. He eventually yielded. “These people in the compound, when they get even a little bit of power, they will use all their energy to try to get in your way,” she said. “It’s like the Stanford prison experiment,” she added, referring to the 1971 psychology experiment to investigate perceptions of power that assigned a group of the university’s students to be either prisoners or guards. The Jingzhou government could not be reached by Reuters for comment. Online videos have shown police and volunteers using force to penalize residents for even gathering in groups. In one that went viral, and which caught the attention of the official People’s Daily, volunteers flipped over a table where a family was playing mah-jong, and hit one of the players. “There are some things, no matter how pressing the epidemic is, that should not be done,” the People’s Daily noted on social media of the incident, and the Xiaogang city government issued an apology. Non-residents are also caught in the Hubei net, with many who were in the province to visit relatives over Lunar New Year now stuck far from their homes and livelihoods. “The rent, the water bill, the electricity bill, I still have to pay them,” said 28-year old Cao Dezhao, who owns a small IT business in Jinan, in eastern Shandong province, but is stuck in Wuhan after he came to visit his in-laws. “I could be bankrupt at the end of this epidemic.” Experts say that essential needs, including monitoring of mental health, should be ensured for people under quarantine or containment measures. “You have to address the basic rights and well-being of people: can they get their food and water? What is their mental health status?” said Rebecca Katz, director of the Center for Global Health Science and Security at Georgetown University. Hundreds of official 24-hour telephone hotlines for psychological support have been launched since the beginning of the outbreak, but many are overwhelmed. Wuhan, the Hubei city hardest hit in the epidemic, says it will ensure food and other necessities through group orders as supermarkets stopped selling to individuals. Some communities have arranged for vendors to come to the their compounds gates. Hubei has said drugs and other necessities must be delivered to residents. But Song Chunlin, whose daughter has psoriasis, a painful chronic skin condition, said she has been unable to receive delivery of the medication her daughter needs in the village where her parents live in Yichang, in western Hubei, while she herself has not been able to receive her allergy medication. The Yichang government did not respond to an emailed request for comment. “I’m really in a difficult situation,” Song told Reuters. Tags: ncov"

(DALE DE LA REY / AFP / MANILA BULLETIN) Australian officials said the targeted easing of the ban would allow about 760 Chinese high school students – none from Hubei province, which is the epicenter of the outbreak – to apply to return. The students would be considered on a case-by-case basis and those who were successful would be subjected to a 14-day self-imposed quarantine on arrival in Australia, officials said. “It is incredibly important that we bring some normality back to the international student market,” Education Minister Dan Tehan told reporters. “It is a small step we are taking, it is a precautionary step.” Tehan said the government would next week consider whether to allow the return of tertiary education students. Chinese students made up almost 40% of the international higher education population in Australia in 2018, according to the most recent official data. That broader population has grown by more than 10% over each of the past three years, contributing more than A$30 billion ($21 billion) to the domestic economy.

The 83-year-old woman was the first passenger from the MS Westerdam, run by Carnival Corp unit Holland America Inc, to test positive. The result came in the Malaysian capital, where she arrived on Friday from the Cambodian port of Sihanoukville. The woman has shown “very positive” developments to her health after receiving anti-viral medication and oxygen to alleviate her symptoms, but continues to be monitored in hospital for a mild cough, according to Malaysia’s health ministry. “After over 72 hours of treatment, the case has shown positive health developments. Following that, COVID-19 detection tests were carried out twice and spaced out over 24 hours. Both tests returned negative,” ministry Director-General Noor Hisham Abdullah said in a statement. A total of 145 passengers from the cruise ship arrived in Malaysia last Friday. The woman and her 85-year-old husband were the only ones to have shown symptoms after screening. All but the two Americans have already left for their destinations. The discovery of one confirmed case from the cruise ship prompted Malaysia to bar Westerdam from entering the country, and to turn away any cruise ships that had departed or transited any port in China. The Westerdam arrived in Cambodia last Thursday, carrying 1,455 passengers and 802 crew. It had spent two weeks at sea after being turned away by Japan, Taiwan, Guam, the Philippines and Thailand.

Official guidelines say patients must test negative for the virus twice, with at least a day between tests, before being discharged. Hospitals had used nose and throat swabs for such tests before discharging patients, but are now required to use samples from lungs, where the virus is most likely to be detected as it develops, Lei Xuezhong, a doctor working on a treatment for coronavirus-caused pneumonia in Sichuan province told People’s Daily. China’s National Health Commission recommends recovered patients monitor their health for 14 days, wear masks and reduce outdoor activities after leaving hospitals due to risks of contracting other pathogens.   Tags: ncov"

That’s being put on hold,” said NBI Deputy Director Ferdinand Lavin. Lavin previously announced the opening this February of Chinese desks at the NBI which will be manned by both the Bureau’s agents and their Chinese counterparts who will be handling cases involving Chinese nationals. “In view of the spread of the coronavirus then it may not be safe for them to travel, our foreign counterparts, from China to the Philippines,” explained the NBI spokesman. Aside from this, Lavin added the NBI has yet to arrange an office for the Chinese desk at the building in Quezon City where the Bureau will be temporarily relocating this year while a new building will be erected at its headquarters in Manila. The creation of the Chinese desk at the NBI was reached during bilateral talks between the NBI and the Chinese government last December. The Chinese government sought the creation of a Chinese desk in view of the increasing number of crimes involving Chinese nationals in the Philippines. Once the Chinese desk becomes operational, Lavin previously explained the NBI will have easy access to information from China’s data base including criminal modus operandi and the groups and persons involved in these crimes. “As it is now it is little harder for us to get those information,” the spokesman had lamented. “This is the way forward for us to address all of these crimes relating to the increasing presence of Chinese individuals,” Lavin previously said regarding the creation of the Chinese desk.

This photo taken on February 20, 2020, shows community staff members delivering foods to residents in Wuhan in China’s central Hubei province.(Photo by STR / AFP) / China OUT / MANILA BULLETIN) Another 397 new cases were reported nationwide, down from nearly 900 officially reported Friday, bringing the total number of cases to over 76,000. The drop in new cases of the novel coronavirus came as officials in Hubei province — whose capital city Wuhan is the epicentre the outbreak — were ordered to revise figures to clear “doubt” around the data. The number of new cases nationwide for February 19 was revised up to 820 up from 394 previously reported, the National Health Commission said Saturday. It also adjusted upwards the total confirmed cases for February 20 by over 400 cases to 75,891. The decision to amend Hubei’s past data, which was announced on Friday by local authorities, is the latest in a string of changes made to Hubei’s counting method — further complicating efforts to track the spread of the illness. Last week, Chinese health officials added patients from Hubei who had been diagnosed via clinical methods including lung imaging on top of those confirmed by lab tests. But on Thursday, Hubei officials backtracked the decision and deducted 279 cases — which they were ordered to re-add to the count on Friday. Tags: ncov"

(REUTERS/Kamil Krzaczynski/File Photo/MANILA BULLETIN) The United States has yet to see community spread of the virus that emerged in central China in late December. But health authorities are preparing medical personnel for the risk, Nancy Messonnier, an official with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) told reporters on a conference call. In coming weeks, if the virus begins to spread through US communities, health authorities want to be ready to adopt school and business closures like those undertaken in Asian countries to contain the disease, Messonnier said. “We’re not seeing community spread here in the United States yet, but it’s very possible, even likely, that it may eventually happen,” Messonnier said. “Our goal continues to be to slow the introduction of the virus into the US This buys us more time to prepare communities for more cases and possibly sustained spread.” The CDC is taking steps to ensure frontline US healthcare workers have supplies they need, she added, by working with businesses, hospitals, pharmacies and provisions manufacturers and distributors on what they can do to get ready. The World Health Organization has warned that the window of opportunity to contain the international spread of the epidemic that has killed more than 2,200 people was closing, as the virus has spread to some 26 countries with a large cluster in South Korea and recent outbreaks in Iran, Lebanon and Italy “If we do well, we can avert any serious crisis, but if we squander the opportunity then we will have a serious problem on our hands,” WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in Geneva. The United States currently has 13 cases of people diagnosed with the virus within the country and 21 cases among Americans repatriated on evacuation flights from Wuhan, China, and from the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan, CDC said. ​Of 329 Americans evacuated from the cruise ship, 18 tested positive for the virus. Eleven of them are at University of Nebraska Medical Center, five are in medical facilities near Travis Air Force Base in California and two are near Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas. The CDC is still handling the bulk of testing for the coronavirus as it works out issues with test kits sent to states, Messonnier said.

(REUTERS/Denis Balibouse/MANILA BULLETIN) Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO director-general, asked whether the outbreak is at a “tipping point” after new cases and deaths in Iran from COVID-19, and cases in Lebanon and Canada, said that he still believed the virus spread could be stopped. “Although the window of opportunity is narrowing to contain the outbreak, we still have a chance to contain it,” he said. “If we don’t, if we squander the opportunity, then there will be a serious problem on our hands,” he said. China has reported more than 75,500 cases and 2,239 deaths, Tedros said. He voiced concern about an increase in infections in the northern province of Shandong – where more than 200 cases were announced earlier in prisons – and said it was seeking more information. Twenty-six other countries have reported 1,151 cases and eight deaths. “Although the total number of cases outside China remains relatively small, we are concerned about the number of cases with no clear epidemiological link, such as travel history to China or contact with a confirmed case,” he said. He said it was “very concerning” that Iran had reported 18 cases and four deaths in just the past two days, adding that the WHO was supplying testing kits to Tehran. Tedros, asked whether sanctions imposed on Iran for its nuclear program might hamper delivery of medical aid, said: “Emergency situations are excluded.” Lebanon confirmed its first coronavirus case on Friday and said it was monitoring two other potential cases after a 45-year-old woman arriving from the holy city of Qom in Iran on Thursday tested positive, Health Minister Hamad Hassan said. Dr. Sylvie Briand, director of WHO global infectious hazard preparedness, referring to Iran, said: “The concern is more about the fact that we seen an increase in cases, a very rapid increase in a matter of a few days…What is the extent of this outbreak and the transmission in Iran? “Also because we have seen other cases picked up in Lebanon and Canada, so we are just wondering also about the potential of more exported cases in the coming days.” There are different patterns of transmission in different places, Briand said, adding: “We have lots of diversity, different outbreaks showing different phases.” Tedros said that a WHO-led team of international experts and their Chinese counterparts would visit Wuhan, the epicenter of the epidemic, on Saturday.

Cumulative and daily tolls of coronavirus cases, with numbers of cases per countries/territories outside mainland China, as of Feb 21, 0300 GMT. (AFP Photo/John SAEKI) The warning came as the first European died from the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) strain, which first emerged in December in central China but has now spread to over 25 countries and caused more than a dozen deaths outside the country. A 78-year-old Italian man died after testing positive for the virus, with the death toll reaching four in Iran, and a number of cases reported across the Middle East, including the first infections in Israel and Lebanon. A second person died in South Korea, authorities reported Saturday, as the number of cases in the country spiked. Italy has locked down 10 towns and asked over 50,000 people to stay home – a move with echoes of China’s lockdown of entire cities in Hubei province at the center of the outbreak. In China, the number of cases outside Hubei, where millions remain under quarantine, has been generally declining, although new hotspots were found in several prisons and hospitals Friday. But just 31 new cases were reported outside the central province Saturday, as the national number of cases rose past 76,000. The outbreak has now claimed 2,345 lives in China. 27-day incubation period? While the number of virus cases in China is declining, concern was raised on the incubation period after 70-year-old man in Hubei Province was infected with coronavirus but did not show symptoms until 27 days later.This case could mean the COVID-19  incubation period could be much longer than the presumed 14 days. A longer incubation period could complicate efforts to contain spread of the epidemic that has so far killed more than 2,000 people and spread outside China. According to the local government, the man, only identified by his family name, Jiang, drove on Jan. 24 his car back to Shennongjia, in northwestern Hubei, from eastern Ezhou, where he had close contact with his sister, who had been infected, according to the government website of Hubei. He had a fever on Feb. 20 and tested positive for coronavirus a day later, according to the government statement. Concerns have also risen about the reliability of the official virus data, however, after Hubei officials changed methods of counting cases and amended their figures again. A WHO-led team of experts are set to visit Wuhan, the capital of the province, on Saturday. Meanwhile WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned that the “window of opportunity” to contain the international spread of the outbreak was “narrowing,” as cases surged across the Middle East and in South Korea. He warned that if countries did not quickly mobilize to fight the spread of the virus, “this outbreak could go in any direction. It could even be messy.” International spread Cases of the deadly virus were reported in a range of countries in the Middle East on Friday, with the first cases in Israel and Lebanon. Iran said four people there had died and 18 been infected from the outbreak. Iraq and Kuwait, which share borders with Iran, were on high alert for a potential outbreak after banning travel to and from the Islamic republic, although they have not confirmed any cases domestically. Nearly 350 people have been infected in South Korea, including two deaths, making it the hardest-hit country outside China. The US advised citizens to avoid travelling by cruise liner in Asia because it said the vessels acted as amplifiers of the virus. Several Australians and an Israeli evacuated earlier this week from the stricken Diamond Princess cruise ship tested positive for coronavirus on returning to their home countries. They were previously cleared in Japan. The cases will fuel questions about Tokyo’s policy of allowing former passengers to return home after testing negative. Two former passengers, both Japanese and in their 80s, died in Japan on Thursday. The British government confirmed on Twitter that an evacuation flight left Japan Saturday, with 32 British and European passengers on board. Tokyo 2020 Olympic organizers on Saturday postponed training for their army of volunteers due to the coronavirus outbreak, but said that there was “no consideration” of cancelling the Games. ‘Critical moment’ Nearly 400 new cases were reported nationwide in China on Saturday, less than half the number of new cases the previous day. The drop in new cases of the novel coronavirus came as officials in Hubei province were ordered to revise figures to clear “doubt” around the data. Officials retroactively revised upwards previously reported data for two days in the last week – the latest in a string of amendments to the figures officially reported at the epicenter. Several changes in Hubei’s counting method has further complicated efforts to track the spread of the illness. China has said the slowing cases are evidence that its drastic containment measures are working – but fresh infections emerged at two Beijing hospitals, and more than 500 others were reported in prisons across the country. In a letter to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation thanking the organisation for its financial support, Chinese President Xi Jinping said China was at a “critical moment” in the fight against the outbreak. Xi said the “unprecedented measures” were “delivering substantial results”. Many nations have banned travellers from China and airlines have suspended flights to and from the country. Repatriation moved Meanwhile, the repatriation of Filipinos aboard the M/V Diamond Princess cruise ship was moved to next week to allow health authorities in Japan to complete the  laboratory testing of the Filipino crew and passengers for COVID-19, the Philippine Department of Health (DOH) announced on Saturday. “The Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Disease (IATF-EID) has unanimously resolved to tentatively schedule the repatriation of Overseas Filipinos (OFs) aboard the M/V Diamond Princess Cruise ship early next week,” the DOH said in a statement. “This is to allow the Japanese health authorities to complete the laboratory testing [of] the 400-plus Filipino crew members aboard the ship and comply with the established Japanese quarantine protocols,” it added. The repatriation was originally scheduled February 23. The DOH said the Philippine embassy in Tokyo is closely coordinating with the Japanese health and foreign ministry to complete the quarantine protocols to repatriate the Filipino crew members and passengers as soon as possible. “[The] IATF-EID is adjusting the schedule out of an abundance of caution with a view to safeguarding the health and safety of our OFs onboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship,” the DOH said. “The Japanese government has ensured that appropriate health services are being provided to affected OFWs aboard the ship,” it added.  (With report from Reuters and Analou de Vera) READ MORE: Repatriation for Filipinos on cruise ship moved to next week – DOH   Tags: ncov"

A total of 15 Israelis were among the passengers quarantined on board the Diamond Princess, of whom 11 have flown home. The others all tested negative for the virus. The returning Israelis had all been placed in quarantine for 14 days at the Sheba Medical Center near Tel Aviv. “They are in full isolation,” said Dr Gili Regev-Yochay, director of the hospitals’ infectious diseases unit. “It’s in many ways like a jail. We try to make it as best as we could to have them in a very nice and comfortable place, but very isolated.” The woman who tested positive for the virus “is not sick”, Regev-Yochay added. “She is totally healthy. She feels she is asymptomatic but she is a carrier of the virus.” The other four Israelis who were on board the Diamond Princess are still in Japan. At the start of the month, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said it was “inevitable” that the COVID-19 outbreak, which first emerged in China, would reach Israel. He urged health authorities to focus on developing a vaccine. In late January, the government banned all flights from China from landing in Israel. This month it also began refusing entry to foreign nationals who had visited Hong Kong, Macau, Singapore or Thailand over the past two weeks.

AFP/ MANILA BULLETIN The World Health Organization warned nations could face a serious problem if they fail to “hit hard now” against the virus, which has infected more than 75,000 in China and over 1,100 abroad. China has pointed to official figures showing new cases slowing this week as evidence that its drastic containment measures are working, but fresh infections emerged at two Beijing hospitals, and more than 500 others were reported in prisons across the country. Chinese authorities have placed tens of millions of people under quarantine in hard-hit central Hubei province, restricted movements in other cities far from the epicentre, and closed schools nationwide. At a Politburo meeting chaired by Chinese President Xi Jinping Friday, the leadership said that the epidemic’s peak “has not yet arrived”, and the situation in Hubei and Wuhan remains “grim and complex,” according to state media. Many nations have banned travellers from China and airlines have suspended flights to and from the country. But clusters and outbreaks continue to emerge, and 13 people have now died outside mainland China. Iran’s health ministry reported two more deaths among 13 new cases of coronavirus in the Islamic republic, bringing the total number of fatalities to four and infections to 18. – South Korean sect –
Earlier cases had already prompted Iraq to ban travel to and from its neighbour and Kuwait’s national air carrier to suspend flights. Seven of the new cases were in the Shiite holy city of Qom, four in Tehran and two in Gilan, health ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour said on Twitter. He did not say anything about the suspected source of the outbreak in Iran. In South Korea, the number of cases nearly doubled to 204, making it the hardest-hit country outside China. More than 120 members of Shincheonji Church of Jesus, a religious sect in the southern city of Daegu, have now been infected. It started with a 61-year-old woman who developed a fever on February 10 but attended at least four church services before being diagnosed. The mayor of Daegu — South Korea’s fourth-biggest city, with a population of over 2.5 million — has advised residents to stay indoors. Most people on the streets were wearing masks Friday, but many businesses were closed and workers sprayed disinfectant outside the church. “With so many confirmed cases here I’m worried that Daegu will become the second Wuhan,” said Seo Dong-min, 24, referring to Hubei’s capital, where the virus first emerged. Two Australians evacuated from the Diamond Princess cruise ship, meanwhile, tested positive for coronavirus on their return home despite being cleared in Japan. An Israeli also tested positive upon returning home — becoming his country’s first COVID-19 case. The cases will fuel questions about Tokyo’s policy of allowing former Diamond Princess passengers to return home after testing negative. Two former passengers, both Japanese and in their 80s, died in Japan on Thursday. “If we don’t hit hard now using the window of opportunity we might be faced with a serious problem,” WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Thursday. – Prisons and hospitals –
China reported 118 more deaths on Friday, raising the toll to 2,236, most of them in Hubei. The National Health Commission also said in its daily update that China tallied 889 new cases, up from the previous day when it reported the lowest number of new infections in nearly a month, fuelling hopes that the epidemic is nearing its peak. Among those, 258 were outside Hubei, ending a 16-day streak of new infections falling in the rest of the country. Hubei’s figures have raised questions, however, as officials have changed methods of counting cases twice and amended their figures. Tu Yuanchao, deputy director of Hubei’s health commission, said previously removed cases would be reinserted in the tally, acknowledging that the modifications had “created a certain amount of doubt” in society. A 29-year-old Wuhan doctor died on Thursday, making him one of the youngest known fatalities of the epidemic and the eighth among medical workers. New hotspots were found in prisons and hospitals. Seven guards and 200 inmates tested positive for the virus at Rencheng prison in eastern Shandong province. Eight officials were fired over the issue. In Hubei, 230 cases were reported at the Wuhan Women’s Prison, whose warden was also dismissed, and 41 others were reported at a penitentiary in Shayan county. One suspected infection was found at a juvenile detention centre. Another 34 cases have been found at a prison in eastern Zhejiang province, leading to the ouster of its director and another official. In Beijing, health officials said 36 people, including medical staff, patients and their families, have tested positive for the virus at Fuxing hospital. At Peking University People’s Hospital, a patient became infected after a visit from two relatives who tested positive for the virus. Tags: ncov"

Over 50,000 people have been asked to stay at home in the areas concerned, while all public activities such as carnival celebrations, church masses and sporting events have been banned for up to a week. Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said “everything is under control”, and stressed the government was maintaining “an extremely high level of precaution”. Streets in the towns were deserted, with only a few people seen abroad, and signs showing public spaces closed. In Casalpusterlengo, a large electronic message board outside the town hall read “Coronavirus: the population is invited to remain indoors as a precaution”. The first town to be shuttered was Codogno, with a population of 15,000, where three people tested positive for the virus, including a 38-year old man and his wife, who is eight months pregnant. Three others there have tested positive to a first novel coronavirus test and are awaiting their definitive results. Codogno mayor Francesco Passerini said the news of the cases “has sparked alarm” throughout the town south of Milan. The 38-year old, who works for Unilever in Lodi, was in a serious condition in intensive care. – ‘Extremely worried’ –
He had dined earlier this month with a man who had visited China in January, and had later shown flu-like symptoms, but has since tested negative for the virus, Italian media said. A football friend of his, the son of a bar owner in Codogno, has also tested positive, along with three regulars at the bar. The three, all of whom are retired, live in the small town of Castiglione d’Adda. The mayor there said the locals were “extremely worried” about the spread of the deadly disease. Some 250 people were being placed in isolation after coming into contact with the new cases, according to the Lombardy region, and 60 worker at Unilever have been tested for the virus. Trenord regional railway said its trains would no longer be stopping in three stations in the affected area. The head of the Veneto region, Luca Zaia, said a 78 and 67-year old, from the village of Vo’ Euganeo, at the foot of the Euganean Hills near Padua, had tested positive.

More than 300 Americans have been flown back from the Diamond Princess cruise ship off the Japanese coast, and there have also been several flights bringing home citizens from the Chinese city of Wuhan where the virus originated in December 2019 (AFP Photo/Philip FONG) The warning came as the number of confirmed cases of people on US soil who have been infected with the pathogen rose to 34, 21 of them repatriated from abroad. More than 300 Americans were flown back from the Diamond Princess cruise ship off the Japanese coast earlier this week, and there have also been several flights bringing home citizens from the Chinese city of Wuhan, where the virus first emerged in December. Ian Brownlee, a senior State Department official, said in a briefing that the government had “advised all US citizens to reconsider travel by cruise ship to, or within Asia.” “While the US government has successfully evacuated hundreds of hundreds of our citizens in recent weeks, such repatriation flights do not reflect our standard practice and should not be relied upon as an option for US citizens under potential risk of quarantine by local authorities,” he added. Eighteen of the passengers from the Diamond Princess ship have so far tested positive for the virus and were being treated, either at a medical center in Nebraska or at hospitals near air bases in California and Texas. Three people repatriated from Wuhan have also tested positive. Nancy Messonnier, a senior official with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said she expected the number of cases to rise among those who had returned from the Diamond Princess, because of their close proximity to one another while on board the ship. There are also many Americans with the COVID-19 illness who are hospitalized in Japan, several of whom are seriously ill, she added. “We’re not seeing community spread here in the United States yet, but it’s very possible, even likely that it may eventually happen,” she warned. The World Health Organization said Friday that the window to stem the epidemic was shrinking, amid concern over a surge in cases with no clear link to China. The outbreak has already killed more than 2,200 people and infected more than 75,500 in China. Tags: ncov"
,"February 21, 2020, 6:07 PM",nCov,North Korea cancels marathon over virus: travel firms,By Agence France-Presse,"By Agence France-Presse North Korea has canceled the Pyongyang Marathon — its biggest tourist money-spinner of the year — because of the novel coronavirus outbreak, tour companies said Friday.  The Pyongyang marathon is held as part of annual celebrations (AFP Photo/Ed JONES / MANILA BULLETIN) Beijing-based Koryo Tours, the official partner of the marathon, said on its website it had “received official confirmation today that the Pyongyang Marathon 2020 is canceled.” “This is due to the ongoing closure of the North Korean border and COVID-19 virus situation in China and the greater region,” it added. Young Pioneer Tours, which specializes in budget trips to the isolated country, issued a similar statement. The annual marathon is held in April as part of the anniversary commemorations for founder Kim Il Sung’s birth in 1912, and attracts curious foreigners eager to run through the streets of the tightly controlled city. Almost 1,000 Westerners took part last year, according to organizers, paying entry fees of up to $150 to do so. North Korea has put itself into self-imposed isolation to protect itself from the outbreak raging in neighboring China, which has infected more than 75,000 people and killed over 2,200. Pyongyang has suspended flights and train services, banned tourists, and imposed 30 days of quarantine on resident foreigners. North Korea is subject to multiple international sanctions over its nuclear and ballistic missile programs and its medical infrastructure is weak, with chronic shortages of medicines and equipment. As a result an outbreak would wreak havoc, analysts say. It has taken similar measures before: it banned tourists for more than four months from October 2014 to keep out the Ebola virus, even though no cases had been reported in Asia. North Korea clamped down for six months during the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak of 2002-03, which killed nearly 650 people across mainland China and Hong Kong. Tags: ncov"

(MANILA BULLETIN) Health Assistant Secretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said the 32 repatriates, as well as the 17 members of the repatriation team, did not show any signs or symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) during their quarantine period. “All the quarantined individuals have not shown signs and symptoms of fever, cough, or sore throat during their 14-day stay. They will now be allowed to go back to their respective homes and places,” Vergeire said in a press briefing Friday. “We are glad that our repatriates are all well and safe from COVID-19. Our repatriation mission is not possible without the dedication and cooperation of the entire Inter-Agency Task Force for Emerging Infectious Diseases with all its member agencies. We are extremely grateful for the collective effort of the government,” she added. M/V Diamond Princess cruise ship repatriation Vergeire also said around 460 to 480 Filipinos aboard the M/V Diamond Princess cruise ship have already requested assistance to return to the Philippines. Individuals who will be repatriated from the cruise ship will undergo the same protocols as those repatriated from Wuhan, China, Vergeire said. “Kailangan po lahat ng ating repatriates ay negative for COVID-19 (before they board the plane). They are now conducting this test for all of these crew members and the additional passengers that would be included,” the health official said. “This will be two carriers, three hours apart. Meron tayong medical teams sa loob ng eroplano (We have medical teams inside the plane) and our crew and medical teams are going to wear hazmats [for their own protection]. “We would like to assure Filipinos abroad that our government is working tirelessly to ensure that no Filipino gets left behind in our fight against COVID-19. DOH and the Philippine government are prepared to undertake all measures to care for our kababayans, no matter where they are,” Vergeire added. Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said last Thursday that the repatriation of Filipinos on board the M/V Diamond Princess cruise ship will take place on Sunday (Feb. 23). They will also be quarantined at the Athletes’ Village of New Clark City. “The Japanese government has already decided that they will close down the ship. We are getting this information from [DFA] Usec. [Brigido] Dulay. But we really have to bring them out as soon as possible,” he said at the time.

,"February 21, 2020, 5:33 PM",nCov,"Amid virus crackdown, Uighurs hope Chinese ‘waking up’ to their plight",By Agence France-Presse,"By Agence France-Presse Chinese suffering under harsh measures used to fight the deadly new coronavirus should recognize that similar methods have been deployed against China’s minorities for years, an exiled Uighur rights activist said this week. Jewher Ilham, the daughter of jailed Uighur intellectual Ilham Tohti, criticized some of the measures imposed by Beijing, including placing tens of millions of people under lockdown with little freedom of movement.  The daughter of jailed Uighur intellectual Ilham Tohti, Jewher Ilham, poses during an interview with AFP on the sideline of The Geneva Summit for Human Rights and Democracy, in Geneva on February 18, 2020. (Photo by Fabrice COFFRINI / AFP / MANILA BULLETIN) But she said she hoped the crackdown might raise awareness and more sympathy among the general Chinese public for the Uighur minority in the northwestern Xinjiang region, who she said had long faced similar oppressive methods. “This is a time when the Chinese citizens will have to realize that the Uighurs are not the only ones who are targeted,” Ilham told AFP this week in Geneva, where she was attending a conference for human rights activists. Ilham, whose award-winning father was sentenced to life imprisonment in 2014 for “separatism” in an internationally criticized trial, said it was time regular Chinese citizens realized that “terrorists” are not the only ones seeing their rights trampled on. “It is not about religion. It is not about our identity,” she said. “This is about human rights.” China has faced international condemnation for rounding up an estimated one million Uighurs and other mostly Muslim ethnic Turkic minorities in internment camps in Xinjiang, where rights groups say inmates endure political indoctrination and forced assimilation into the majority Han society. Beijing says the facilities are “vocational training centers” necessary to combat terrorism through job training and teaching Mandarin. Chinese authorities have taken drastic means to try to halt the spread of COVID-19, which has killed more than 2,200 people since emerging in December, with more than 75,000 people infected in China and hundreds more in over 25 other countries. Some 56 million people in central Hubei province and its capital Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, have been placed under unprecedented lockdown. Authorities, who have begun going door-to-door to compel anyone with symptoms into quarantine, have been met with praise from the World Health Organization, which credits Beijing for so far having averted an explosive international spread of the virus. But rights advocates have raised alarm over the crackdown both on freedom of movement and of expression, and have also raised questions about access to food and medicine for those under lockdown. ‘Not new’  “The treatment for those Wuhan patients or non-patients is not new. We found it very similar to what the Uighurs have been experiencing for the past decade, like locking them up at home, not giving food,” Ilham said. She said she regretted that “Chinese citizens are waking up in such a way” to Beijing’s oppressive practices. “But I do hope that they can grow to have sympathy and know that… we are all facing the same situation.” Ilham pointed to the case of her father, who ran the UighurOnline website and gained prominence as a moderate voice drawing attention to ethnic tensions in Xinjiang. She said the allegations against him were “nonsense”, and that he had been arrested to silence his criticism of the treatment of Uighurs and other minorities. Ilham said she has not received any word about her father since 2017. “I don’t know if he has been relocated if he is still held in the same prison if he has been transferred to a camp,” she said. “I don’t know if he is even alive.” The idea that he might be in the camps is frightening at a time when the new coronavirus is raging. So far, China has reported 76 cases of the virus in Xinjiang, and one death, but Uighur exiles and other observers have raised concerns that the numbers may not be accurate in the closely-controlled region. They have also voiced fear of the impact if the outbreak truly hits the overcrowded camps. “This is actually one of my main concerns,” Ilham said, calling on the World Health Organization to send a delegation to Xinjiang to “evaluate the real situation, the real numbers.” Tags: ncov"

The virus has so far killed more than 2,200 people and infected over 75,000, mostly in China, and spread to dozens of countries and territories including Malaysia, which has 22 confirmed cases.  In this picture taken on February 14, 2020, security officers (L) wearing protective face masks check travelers and airport staff at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport in Kuala Lumpur. (Photo by NICOLAS ASFOURI / AFP / MANILA BULLETIN) It has triggered an explosion of false information online, from vastly inflated death tolls to vaccine conspiracies and misleading bat soup videos. Several Asian countries have made arrests over the spread of falsehoods, and Singapore this week ordered Facebook to block an anti-government page in the city-state that it says was peddling misinformation about the pathogen. Of the 27 people under investigation in Malaysia, four have already been charged in court and another four were expected to be charged Friday, officials from the communications ministry and prime minister’s department told AFP. No details were provided about the misinformation they are accused of spreading. Officials warned a broader crackdown was planned. “If you are found to be involved in any act (of) spreading lies… we will go after you and we don’t care who you are,” Mohamed Hanipa Maidin, deputy minister in the prime minister’s department, told reporters. Earlier this month, a Malaysian journalist was charged for making statements that could cause public alarm over social media posts related to the virus, including one in which she raised concerns about the arrival of Chinese tourists on a cruise ship. Officials have warned that false information about the virus could be “inflammatory” in Muslim-majority, multi-ethnic Malaysia, where race and religion are considered sensitive topics. Some observers have raised concerns that overzealous crackdowns could curb civil liberties. “There is a thin line between the government taking proactive steps against (misinformation) and the government infringing on rights to free speech,” Asrul Hadi Abdullah Sani, a political analyst from BowerGroupAsia consultancy, told AFP.   Tags: ncov"

The World Health Organization warned nations they could face a serious problem if they fail to “hit hard now” against the new coronavirus, which has infected more than 75,000 in China and over 1,100 abroad.  Restaurant workers wear protective clothing as they prepare food to sell on the street outside their restaurant in Beijing (AFP / Greg Baker / MANILA BULLETIN) China has pointed to official numbers showing a drop in new cases this week as evidence that its drastic containment measures are working, but fresh cases emerged at two Beijing hospitals and more than 500 others were reported in prisons across the country. Chinese authorities have placed tens of millions of people under quarantine in hard-hit central Hubei province and restricted movements in other cities far from the epicentre. Countries have banned travelers from China and airlines have suspended flights to and from the country. But clusters and outbreaks continue to emerge, and 11 people have now died outside mainland China. Chinese officials said a potential vaccine could be submitted for clinical trials around late April. South Korean sect  South Korea on Friday confirmed 52 more cases, taking the country’s overall figure to 156, as the number of infections linked to a religious sect spiked, making it the worst-infected country outside China. More than 80 members of Shincheonji Church of Jesus in the southern city of Daegu have now been infected, starting with a 61-year-old woman who developed a fever on February 10 but attended at least four church services before being diagnosed. The mayor of Daegu — South Korea’s fourth-biggest city, with a population of over 2.5 million — has advised residents to stay indoors, while access to a major US base in the area has been restricted. Read more: South Korea moves to contain coronavirus outbreak amid spike in new cases The streets remained open Friday with most people wearing masks, but many businesses were closed due to the outbreak and workers on motorcycles sprayed disinfectant outside the church. Outside the church, Seo Dong-min, 24, told AFP: “With so many confirmed cases here I’m worried that Daegu will become the second Wuhan,” referring to Hubei’s capital, where the virus first emerged. Iran confirmed three new cases after two elderly men died from the virus in the city of Qom, prompting Iraq to ban travel to and from its neighbor. Health ministry spokesman Kianush Jahanpour said two of the new cases were also in Qom and the other was in Arak, south of the holy city. In Australia, two people who had been evacuated from a virus-wracked cruise ship off Japan tested positive for mild cases of the COVID-19 illness. Hundreds of people have been allowed to leave the ship after testing negative for the disease and many have returned to their home countries to face further quarantine. The two cases in Australia will fuel questions about Tokyo’s policy of allowing former Diamond Princess passengers to return home after testing negative. Two former passengers, both Japanese and in their 80s, died in Japan on Thursday. WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Thursday that now “is the time to attack the virus” while the number of cases abroad remains low. “If we don’t hit hard now using the window of opportunity we might be faced with a serious problem,” he said. “This virus is very dangerous and it’s public enemy number one and it’s not being treated as such.” Prisons and hospitals  China reported 118 more deaths on Friday, raising the toll to 2,236, most of them in Hubei. The National Health Commission also said in its daily update that China tallied 889 new cases. The number is up from the previous day when it reported the lowest number of new infections in nearly a month, fuelling hopes that the epidemic is nearing its peak. Among those, 258 were outside Hubei, ending a 16-day streak of new infections falling in the rest of the country. New hotspots were found in prisons and hospitals. Seven guards and 200 inmates tested positive for the virus at Rencheng prison in eastern Shandong province. Eight officials were fired over the issue. An official newspaper in Hubei reported 230 cases at the Wuhan Women’s Prison, whose warden was dismissed, and 41 others at another penitentiary in Shayang county. Another 34 cases have been found at Shilifeng prison in eastern Zhejiang province, leading to the ouster of its director and another official. In Beijing, health officials said 36 people, including medical staff, patients and their families, have now tested positive for the virus at Fuxing hospital, which has been under partial lockdown since January 31. At Peking University People’s Hospital, a patient became infected after a visit from two relatives who tested positive for the virus. Most of China remains paralysed over fears of contagion, with people slowly trickling back to work, schools remaining closed, and Beijing ordering returnees to self-quarantine for 14 days.   Tags: ncov"

The minister added that she was shaken by the panic and aggression. “These people are our compatriots,” she wrote on Facebook. “We live in one country and have to take care of their health and safety.” Ukrainian officials including President Volodymyr Zelensky have sought to ease tensions but local residents said they feared the virus could spread. Interior Minister Arsen Avakov arrived at the scene and Prime Minister Oleksiy Goncharuk said late Thursday he was also heading to the town. Zelensky urged compatriots to show solidarity and remember that “we are all human”. Authorities beefed up security in the town of some 10,000 inhabitants, deploying an armored personnel carrier and hundreds of armed police. Residents put up roadblocks and clashed with riot police who had to disperse the protesters to open a road leading to a medical center. The demonstrators broke at least three bus windows, while some of the evacuees waved Ukrainian flags and others hid their faces behind curtains.

China’s vaccine development and research is currently “basically in step with other countries”, he added. The World Health Organization said Tuesday it could take a year or longer for a vaccine to become available. “The vaccine could be the long-term because it could take up to 12 to 18 months and this is like preparing for the worst situation,” said WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. China is currently using five different approaches to develop the vaccine to curb the spread of the virus, said Zeng Yixin, deputy director of China’s National Health Commission These include using inactivated coronavirus to produce a vaccine, using genetic engineering to mass-produce proteins that could act as antigens for the novel coronavirus or modifying existing vaccines for influenza, Zeng said. “At present, some projects have entered the stage of animal testing,” he said. Scientists in the US announced Wednesday they had created the first 3D atomic-scale map of the part of the novel coronavirus that attaches to and infects human cells, a critical step toward developing vaccines and treatments.

The crew of the coronavirus-stricken Diamond Princess cruise ship are expected to start another period of quarantine (AFP / Philip FONG/MANILA BULLETIN) While passengers on board were confined to their cabins around the clock apart from an hour of fresh air on deck, most crew did not undergo quarantine as they were needed to keep the ship running. They were preparing food and delivering meals to cabins, leading some critics to charge they were inadvertently spreading the virus throughout the ship, which has seen more than 600 cases of the potentially deadly COVID-19 disease. As they have been in close contact with possibly infected passengers, the crew is expected to undergo a 14-day quarantine starting when the last passenger leaves the ship. Crew have generally been reticent to speak to media, apparently concerned for their jobs, but some have broken their silence to describe difficult conditions and fear on board. Sonali Thakkar, a 24-year-old security officer on board, told AFP in an interview crews were sleeping two to a cabin, sharing washrooms and eating together, “so the disease can spread very easily.” “We do have a lot of fear, me and my colleagues, more than 1000 crew. We’ve been working since the quarantine started. As the days pass and the number of patients increase, the crew is feeling more afraid,” she said. “They are scared that it can spread really fast and all we want is tests to be done and to be separated from those who are positive. We don’t want to stay on board.” Her father Dinesh said: “Sonali is stuck in a small windowless room on the cruise and is very scared… We speak to her every day trying to calm her.” “Why did the government wait for so long as more and more people got infected? She should have been rescued with other Indians from the cruise long ago. This is very wrong,” he told AFP. ‘Keep shining’  Princess Cruises President Jan Swartz wrote a letter to the crew in which she said the firm was “deeply grateful and incredibly proud of all of you.” “You deserve, and will need, a break. So, we offer you two months of paid time off. This will include your salary and any average gratuities you may normally receive.” And passengers who were completely reliant on the crew’s food deliveries have posted messages of thanks on social media. “My family and I want to express our deep appreciation for your work, sacrifice and care over the last few weeks. We can’t imagine the difficulties you have and will continue to endure,” one note said with drawings of hearts and diamonds. “We wish you the best for your health, for your families and especially for those in hospital. Keep shining.” Some crewmembers have been trying to keep their spirits up with dance and music. Kitchen staff posted a video of themselves jiving around and one employee, Binay Kumar Sarkar, published a video on Facebook of him singing a doleful Bollywood song. “We should try and remain happy in such situations,” he said. “I want to say to the people that whatever problems you face in life, you should try to solve them and move ahead. That’s what life is all about.” But as the days have dragged on and new cases emerge, other crewmembers have sent desperate pleas for help. Jayson Abalos, a Filipino chef on board, posted a letter on social media “on behalf of the Filipino crew of the Galley Team of Diamond Princess Cruise Ship.” “We are counting (the) days and it seems like it’s getting longer and longer. We are no longer functioning well, both body and mind. And we are stressed and frightened.” “Money is nothing if you die and leave your family without a great memory.” Tags: ncov"

Those two people have mild illness,” said Dianne Stephens, acting chief health officer for the Northern Territories. Hundreds of people have been allowed to leave the ship after testing negative for the disease and many have returned to their home countries to face further quarantine. Some 164 Australians aboard the Diamond Princess were cleared for transfer from the ship to quarantine in Australia’s remote north earlier this week. But hundreds of Japanese passengers were cleared and warned only to “stay at home unless absolutely necessary,” and to “never use public” transport and use a mask if they do venture out. A total of six Australian evacuees have now been retested and the two — described as “an older person” and “a younger person” — tested positive. Australia’s Chief Medical Officer Professor Brendan Murphy said the public should not be concerned. “I just want to reassure the community that whilst this is another two cases in Australia, it’s a first for some time now. These were expected and we’re well-placed to manage them,” he said. Fifteen previous cases of coronavirus had been linked to the outbreak of the disease in China. Murphy also expressed confidence that Japan and South Korea — where the number of infections nearly doubled Thursday to 104 — would be able to contain the disease. “Both Japan and South Korea have well-developed health systems. And I would certainly be confident that they will be onto identifying those cases and tracing contacts,” he said. “But it is obviously a concern that any country where there is significant further transmission.”   Tags: ncov"

The demonstrators lit several bonfires and broke at least three bus windows, while some of the evacuees waved Ukrainian flags and some hid their faces behind the curtains. Prime Minister Oleksiy Goncharuk said on Twitter he was “urgently” heading to the site of the protests in the town of Novi Sanzhary in the central Poltava region in a bid to calm tensions. Earlier on Thursday, Kiev repatriated dozens of nationals and foreigners from China as President Volodymyr Zelensky urged his compatriots to show solidarity and remember that “we are all human”. But many in Novi Sanzhary — the town of some 10,000 inhabitants, where officials plan to keep the evacuees in isolation for 14 days — said they feared the virus could spread across town. Dozens of protesters blocked a road near a local hospital even before officials confirmed the site would hold evacuees. Authorities ramped up security, deploying hundreds of armed police and an armored personnel carrier, local resident Maksym Mykhailyk told AFP. As they sought to clear the way for buses carrying the evacuees, some protesters put up resistance and a brief scuffle broke out, regional police said. Interior Minister Arsen Avakov arrived at the scene in a bid to calm tension but more scuffles broke out in the evening. “We will stand against it,” a woman shouted in a video published by Ukrainian media. “We are not talking about infected people, we are talking about healthy people,” Avakov told the protesters. “So far,” a protester replied. Ukraine has no confirmed cases of the new coronavirus, which has killed more than 2,000 people and infected over 74,000 in China and hundreds more in over 25 countries. ‘We are all Ukrainians’  A plane carrying 45 Ukrainians and 27 foreign nationals from the Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicenter of the deadly coronavirus outbreak, arrived earlier Thursday in the eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv. Ukraine’s interior ministry said all evacuees would be kept for two weeks at the Novi Sanzhary medical facility in the neighboring Poltava region. The returnees were expected to arrive at the medical centre later Thursday. Ukraine’s health ministry has said none of the passengers was sick. Avakov said the evacuees had been checked by Chinese and Ukrainian doctors and showed no symptoms. “Let’s be a little more noble and generous people,” he implored. Three Ukrainians and a resident of Kazakhstan were left behind in China because they had fever, Ukraine’s diplomatic mission said. Zelensky sought to allay fears, saying “unprecedented” measures have been taken to prevent the spread of the virus across Ukraine. He also urged Ukrainians to refrain from staging protests. “Most of the passengers are people under 30. They are almost like children to many of us,” Zelensky said, adding there was no imminent danger from the novel virus. “But there is another danger that I would like to mention. The danger of forgetting that we are all human and we are all Ukrainians,” he said. “Each of us. Including those who ended up in Wuhan during the epidemic.” Many Ukrainians took to social media to say that they were ashamed of their compatriots’ behavior. On Wednesday, several dozen demonstrators also blocked roads near a hospital in the western town of Vynnyky after rumours spread the site could hold some of the evacuees.   Tags: ncov"

The number of deaths outside mainland China climbed to 11. Japan’s toll rose to three as a man and a woman in their 80s who had been aboard a quarantined cruise ship died, while fears there mounted over other passengers who disembarked the Diamond Princess after testing negative. South Korea reported its first death, and the number of infections in the country nearly doubled Thursday to 104. Iran reported two deaths on Wednesday and three new cases Thursday. Deaths have previously been confirmed in France, the Philippines, Taiwan, and Hong Kong. Chinese officials say their drastic containment efforts, including quarantining tens of millions of people in Hubei and restricting movements in cities nationwide, have started to pay off. Chinese President Xi Jinping spoke by phone about the virus with leaders in South Korea and Pakistan, state news agency Xinhua said. South Korean President Moon Jae-in “chose to call to express sympathies and support” regarding the outbreak, Xinhua said. Xi told him the epidemic’s impact on bilateral ties will only be temporary. Xi told Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan that their two countries “are true friends and good brothers,” and that combating the virus is his government’s top priority. At a special meeting on the virus with Southeast Asian countries in Laos, China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi said results “show that our control efforts are working.” Although more than 600 new infections were reported Thursday in Hubei’s capital Wuhan, it was the lowest daily tally since late January and well down from the 1,749 new cases the day before. The national figure has fallen for three straight days. Chinese authorities placed the city of 11 million under quarantine on January 23 and quickly locked down the rest of the province in the days that followed. Wuhan authorities this week carried out door-to-door checks on residents, with the local Communist Party chief warning that officials would be “held accountable” if any infections were missed. Cities far from the epicenter have limited the number of people who can leave their homes for groceries, while rural villages have sealed off access to outsiders. ‘Chaotic’ cruise quarantine  In Japan, critics slammed the government’s quarantine measures imposed on the Diamond Princess. The huge vessel moored in Yokohama is the biggest coronavirus cluster outside the Chinese epicenter, with 634 cases confirmed among passengers and crew. Another 13 people on board the ship were diagnosed with the virus Thursday, Japan’s health ministry said. Still, passengers were disembarking after negative tests and having completed a 14-day quarantine period — packing into yellow buses and leaving for stations and airports. An infectious diseases specialist at Kobe University slammed the quarantine procedures on board as “completely chaotic” in rare criticism from a Japanese academic. “The cruise ship was completely inadequate in terms of infection control,” said Kentaro Iwata in videos he has since deleted. South Korea, meanwhile, announced 51 new cases, with more than 40 in a cluster centered on the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, an entity often seen as a cult. The infections apparently came from a 61-year-old woman who first developed a fever on February 10 and attended at least four services before being diagnosed. Authorities were investigating whether she visited a hospital where a long-term patient contracted the virus and later died. Growing concern abroad  Beyond Asia, citizen backlash was growing over fears of contagion. Iraq on Thursday clamped down on travel to and from neighboring Iran, with Iraq’s health ministry announcing people in Iran were barred from entering the country “until further notice.” The move came after Iran confirmed three new coronavirus cases following the deaths of two elderly men. And in Ukraine, a crowd clashed with police outside a hospital over government plans to quarantine evacuees from coronavirus-hit China at the site. Six buses with the evacuees arrived at the medical center in Novi Sanzhary, in the central Poltava region, escorted by police. Angry demonstrators lit fires and pelted the buses with rocks, breaking at least three windows. Because of the virus outbreak, airlines operating in the Asia-Pacific region stand to lose a combined $27.8 billion of revenue, the International Air Transport Association said. This is the first time since 2003 that demand for air travel has declined, IATA CEO Alexandre de Juniac said.   Tags: ncov"

People wear masks to protect against the novel coronavirus as they arrive at a market in Beijing, China. (AFP/GREG BAKER/MANILA BULLETIN) Toronto resident Ruepang Cao, 36, had come to Canada in 2004 seeking asylum. In an affidavit he said he was “scared and concerned for my life” after his asylum claim was rejected and he was ordered out of the country “straight into an epidemic of a deadly virus which still rages.” Under Canadian law, a deportation can be blocked if a court finds there is a significant risk of harm for a person sent to a particular destination. Canada already halted deportations to the Chinese city of Wuhan and surrounding Hubei province — the epicenter of the epidemic — but not to other parts of China. In court last week, government lawyers argued — and the judge agreed — that the risk of infection in Guangdong province, where Cao was headed, was low. “The evidence, such as it is, shows that infection and mortality rates in many parts of China are low,” Justice Robert Barnes said in his decision. “For the vast majority of people who have come down with the virus the outlook is positive. The risk, therefore, does not appear to be much, if any, greater than the risk of coming down with some other viral illness, many of which also carry a mortality risk.” The Canada Border Services Agency would not say if Cao had been deported as scheduled, citing privacy laws, but his lawyer told AFP he believed Cao had been put on a flight to China.   Tags: ncov"

Japan has been criticized for its handling of the quarantine, as more than 620 people on board have been infected with the virus and two elderly passengers have died.  (Kyodo/via REUTERS / MANILA BULLETIN) The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has said the quarantine may not have been sufficient. But a report released on Wednesday by the National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID) showed that the onset of symptoms from confirmed cases of COVID-19 peaked on Feb. 7 before tailing off to zero by Feb. 15. Cases among crew were observed to steadily increase, peaking on Feb. 13. “The decline in the number of confirmed cases, based on reported onset dates, implies that the quarantine intervention was effective in reducing transmission among passengers,” according to the report. Later transmission “appears to have occurred mostly among crew or within passenger cabins.” The NIID is Japan’s top research institute of infectious diseases. More than 620 passengers have been infected on the ship, which has been quarantined since Feb. 3, initially with about 3,700 people on board. The health ministry announced on Thursday that two passengers in their 80s had died, the first fatalities from the ship. The NIID report was “very reassuring,” said Kentaro Iwata, an infectious disease specialist from Kobe University Hospital who had been one of the harshest critics of the quarantine. After visiting the ship, Iwata had posted YouTube videos decrying the infection controls he saw. The videos got over a million views before Iwata took them down, saying at a press briefing on Thursday that the new data and reports of improved controls on the ship convinced him that the government had responded to his criticism. The United States, Canada and other nations evacuated their citizens ahead of the Feb. 19 end of the quarantine. Remaining passengers have been released in batches and advised by health authorities to stay at home and monitor their condition. The health ministry will provide assistance to those returning passengers, as there is still a risk they could develop symptoms, said Koji Wada, a professor at the International University of Health and Welfare in Tokyo. “We can say the quarantine has been done as we planned,” said Wada, who has worked as an advisor on site at the Diamond Princess. “I’m not sure if I can say it’s a success.” Tags: ncov"

(REUTERS/Valentyn Ogirenko/MANILA BULLETIN) Hundreds of police were dispatched to keep order, and some were seen dragging some protesters away from the crowd at the demonstration, which the authorities said had started overnight. The protest prompted President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to issue a statement reassuring Ukrainians that there was no danger, that the authorities had done everything possible to make sure the virus would not spread to Ukraine. “But there is another danger that I would like to mention. The danger of forgetting that we are all human and we are all Ukrainian,” he said. “Attempts to block routes, block hospitals, not allow Ukrainian citizens into Ukraine – this does not show the best side of our character. Especially when you consider that most passengers are people under 30 years of age. For many of us, they are almost like children.” In addition to 45 Ukrainians, there were 27 citizens of Argentina on the plane that landed in Ukraine on Thursday, as well as citizens from the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Kazakhstan, Costa Rica and other countries. The Ukrainian authorities say all passengers on board had been screened twice for the virus before being allowed to fly, but that was not enough to quell the protesters. “I ask people not to sow panic – everything is fine. All who are on board they are healthy,” Kharkiv regional Oleksiy Kucher told a televised briefing. Ukraine has no confirmed cases of the virus. China reported a drop in new cases in the province at the heart of the coronavirus outbreak on Thursday, though the death toll so far at over 2,000 has made it one of the biggest global health emergencies in recent decades.

,"February 20, 2020, 4:25 PM",nCov,Upbeat Chinese FM says virus control efforts ‘are working’,By Agence France-Presse,"By Agence France-Presse China’s efforts to control the deadly outbreak of a new coronavirus “are working”, Beijing’s top diplomat said Thursday, attributing an easing in new cases to his country’s “forceful action” against the illness. Speaking in Laos after talks with peers from the 10 Southeast Asian (ASEAN) countries, Wang Yi said the outbreak was “controllable and curable” despite the global panic it has seeded. “China is not only protecting its own people but also the rest of the world,” he told the summit in Vientiane, referencing a recent sharp drop in new cases of the virus inside China, where it has killed more than 2,100 people. The hastily-convened summit with ASEAN neighbors comes as a region dependent on the flow of Chinese goods and tourists faces a steep bill following restrictions on movement from China. A similar meeting was held in 2003 following the outbreak of SARS. Originating in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, the new coronavirus — known as COVID-19 — has infected more than 74,000 people inside China. The government has locked down tens of millions of people in several virus-hit cities, extended Lunar New Year holidays and pulled flights in a scramble to contain the virus. Still the health scare has cascaded across Southeast Asia, with cases recorded in the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. The Philippines, Singapore, and Vietnam have restricted flights from mainland China and suspended visa-free arrivals as health screening ramps up at entry points. Thailand, which has imposed no such restrictions, reported a 90 percent slump in arrivals from the mainland this month, a gut punch to an already beleaguered tourist sector which makes up nearly a fifth of the economy. Thailand anticipates a loss of more than $8 billion by year’s end from the tourist tail-off. In Laos, Beijing will be eager to “project regional solidarity with its anti-pandemic efforts” a Southeast Asian diplomat told AFP, declining to be named. China sees ASEAN as its backyard and has ramped up economic, diplomatic and cultural influence over recent years with billions of dollars of investment, tourist outflows and a bigger presence at regional summits. There are fears prolonged disruption by the virus could slow work on the massive China-backed “Belt and Road” infrastructure schemes which criss-cross ASEAN. Philippine Foreign Minister Teodoro Locsin Jr thanked China for its “unprecedented domestic measures and quick action” — apparently referring to the lockdowns of several large cities as the virus billowed out. But he recognized the “massively detrimental” economic impact of the disease, which has constricted global trade and tourism vital to many Southeast Asian economies.

Raab urged “other British nationals still seeking to leave to contact us”. He said: “We will continue to support British nationals who wish to stay in Japan.” The repatriated will be quarantined at accommodation at Arrowe Park Hospital, near Liverpool, in northern England on their return, according to the health ministry.

(REUTERS/Phoonsab Thevongsa NO RESALES NO ARCHIVES/MANILA BULLETIN) China’s foreign minister urged Singapore to ease its travel ban on Chinese visitors, while other nations are likely to face similar pressure at the meeting with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). “China is promoting a message of friendships in ASEAN to counter the attack from the West that it has been handling the outbreak poorly,” said Alfred M. Wu, Associate Professor in Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at National University of Singapore. Beijing has been criticized for its handling of the outbreak of the new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, which emerged from the city of Wuhan in Hubei province in recent months and killed at least 2,000. Travel restrictions to prevent the spread of the disease, have idled much of the world’s second-largest economy and choked key elements of President Xi Jinping’s signature Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) of railways, ports and highways. Officials attending bilateral meetings on Wednesday night were asked not to wear masks, but hand sanitizer and disinfecting wipes were available. On Thursday, ASEAN foreign ministers joined hands with Chinese State Councillor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi and shouted “Stay strong, Wuhan!” Stay strong, China! Stay strong, ASEAN!” Countries’ responses to the coronavirus have become “a litmus test for friendship,” said Tom Baxter, an independent researcher and co-editor of Panda Paw Dragon Claw website, which writes about China’s influence overseas. From Singapore’s outright ban to the open-door practices of Beijing’s close ally Cambodia, policies on travel from China have varied among the 10 ASEAN nations. Even as the meeting kicked off, Thailand on Thursday issued a travel advisory urging citizens to avoid non-essential travel to China and advised those already there to leave, hinting that flights to China could be further restricted. In a Wednesday night meeting with Singapore’s foreign minister, Vivian Balakrishnan, Wang said Beijing was worried about Singapore’s “restrictive measures”. “Now that the epidemic has eased and the situation is under control, we hope that normal exchanges between the two countries can be resumed as soon as possible,” Wang told Balakrishnan. In remarks made during a welcome dinner on Wednesday evening, Wang thanked countries individually for their shows of support during the outbreak, according to a statement from China’s foreign ministry. He was quoted by the Chinese foreign ministry as saying support from ASEAN countries and other international friend “made us feel that this winter is not that cold and spring is coming”. Tags: ncov"
,"February 20, 2020, 3:59 PM",nCov,China lab says conspiracy theories hurting efforts to curb virus,By Reuters,"By Reuters An outbreak of disinformation in China and elsewhere has hurt global efforts to combat the new coronavirus, said a specialist infectious disease lab located at the epicenter of the epidemic — and at the heart of a number of conspiracy theories. In a statement issued on Wednesday, the state-backed Wuhan Institute of Virology said “internet rumors” had “received close attention from all walks of life” and “caused great harm to our research staff on the front line of scientific research”.  A woman wearing a face mask walks at the Beijing Daxing International Airport, as the country is hit by an outbreak of the novel coronavirus, in Beijing, China February 20, 2020. (REUTERS/Tingshu Wang/MANILA BULLETIN) It said its staff had been working around the clock since the end of 2019 to trace the source of the coronavirus and improve detection rates, but the conspiracies had “seriously interfered” with their efforts. The institute has been accused of “artificially synthesizing” the coronavirus in one of its laboratories, it said. It also referred to other claims circulating online that the “patient zero” in the current outbreak was a graduate student from the institute, and that one of its researchers had also died after the virus “leaked”. Conspiracy theories often prosper during epidemics, and have sprung up during recent outbreaks of Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), avian flu and Ebola, said Adam Kamradt-Scott, an infectious diseases expert at the University of Sydney. “If there is an infectious disease lab in a city where an outbreak starts, it usually gets the blame.” Many of the rumors circulated domestically and overseas claim the coronavirus was engineered by local scientists and leaked, deliberately or by accident, in Wuhan where the virus was first detected and is the epicenter of the epidemic. But another theory, debunked on Wednesday by the well-known rumor-busting website Snopes.com, connected the outbreak to the arrest last month of Harvard University professor Charles Lieber, who was accused of concealing ties with the Wuhan Institute of Technology. The conspiracy theories have not stayed online. Republican Senator of Arkansas, Tom Cotton, told the Fox News channel this week that “we at least have to ask the question” whether the coronavirus originated in the Wuhan lab. A team of 27 scientists published a statement in the Lancet medical journal on Tuesday condemning the conspiracy theories, which “do nothing but create fear, rumors and prejudice that jeopardize our global collaboration in the fight against this virus.” They said scientists from around the world “overwhelmingly conclude that this coronavirus originated in wildlife”. The current consensus is that it emerged from a seafood market in Wuhan that also sold exotic wild animal products. China usually cracks down heavily on “rumors”, and it even arrested Li Wenliang, a doctor who first disclosed the existence of a SARS-like disease in Wuhan at the end of last year and subsequently became its most prominent casualty. But it has been unable to silence the vast number of outlandish claims circulating on social media channels. Shanghai government newspaper Liberation Daily has published a regular round-up of misinformation, including allegations that large numbers of infected patients are coming to the city for treatment, and a claim the virus can be cured by strong curry. Misinformation also prospered during the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2002-2003. As well as conspiracy theories about the origins of the virus, rumors also spread across the country that frogs and newborn babies were suddenly speaking and giving advice about how to repel the disease, usually through firecrackers and incense sticks. “Unfortunately it just seems to be that in addition to the epidemiological challenge we now also confront a simultaneous misinformation epidemic,” said Kamradt-Scott.

Diamond Princess cruise ship, with people quarantined onboard due to fears of the new COVID-19 coronavirus, is docked at the Daikaku Pier Cruise Terminal in Yokohama port on February 16, 2020. (Photo by Behrouz MEHRI / AFP / MANILA BULLETIN) “Born in the beautiful peninsula of Sorrento, Italy, Captain Arma has always been passionate about the sea,” according to the company. But he could scarcely have imagined a greater leadership challenge than he faces as captain of the Diamond Princess where more than 600 people have tested positive for coronavirus during a grueling 14-day quarantine on his watch. His frequent messages to 2,600 passengers cooped up round-the-clock in sometimes tiny, windowless cabins have sought to keep them informed and raise their spirits, even as fresh positive tests emerge daily. “A diamond is a chunk of coal that did really well under pressure,” he told passengers, referring to the ship’s name and urging them to read messages of support trending on social media under the hashtag #hangintherediamondprincess. “I am confident that remaining united as a family, we will successfully complete this journey together. The world is watching us. This is an additional reason for all of us to show our strength.” On Valentine’s Day, he sent chocolates and hearts to passengers with notes of encouragement and recited a passage about love from the Bible. “Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.” ‘New grey hairs’  As the torrid days of quarantine ticked by and nerves frayed, passengers came to rely on his soothing tone. “One reason why a panic has not occurred among passengers is the captain’s leadership,” tweeted one person on board. “Regular announcements of information, answering passengers’ requests by consulting quarantine officers, walking on the deck, apologising for delayed medicine distribution… I want this kind of man to be our country’s leader.” Another said he reminded him of Captain Chesley Burnett “Sully” Sullenberger, who calmly piloted a stricken airliner onto the Hudson River in New York. Arma frequently expressed appreciation for the many messages of support passengers had sent him — one reportedly addressed to the “fearless commander” — and assured them he was holding up under the strain. “For all of you who are concerned about me, I’m extremely moved by your kindness and I’d like to reassure you all that I’m absolutely fine. I’m very much the same captain that I was 12 days ago, just with the addition of a few new grey hairs,” he said. Liberally sprinkling his messages with Italian phrases such as “arrivederci” (goodbye) to departing passengers or “buon appetito” (enjoy your meal), he bashfully apologised for his thick Italian accent when speaking English. “One of my friends at home sent me a video of one of my announcements. I would like to apologize to all of you that I had to put you through this time and time again,” he said. Trust me, when I heard the sound of my voice, I was shocked by how terrible I sound. However, I’m blaming the mask and I’m sticking to that story.” ‘Anti-Schettino’  At home, he has been hailed as “il capitano coraggioso” (Captain Courageous”) and even the “anti-Schettino”, a reference to another Italian cruise ship captain with a less stellar reputation. Francesco Schettino was dubbed “Captain Coward” after he spent a night on a rock as terrified passengers threw themselves off his Costa Concordia ship when it hit a rocky outcrop off the island of Giglio. Arma told La Repubblica daily that “there is so much to do onboard. My only concern is looking after the passengers and the crew. Let’s just hope it ends soon.” His wife Marianna said Arma was “calm, with a deep sense of his responsibilities”. “We are in contact but we try to do it quickly so as not to take up time for his duties which have to come first,” she said. Pietro Sagristani, the mayor of Arma’s hometown of Sant’Agnello, said the whole community was following the news from Japan with concern. “But we have confidence in him. He comes from a long line of seafarers and we know his courage.” “He’ll be fine.”   Tags: ncov"

The death toll in China hit 2,118 as 114 more people died, but health officials reported the lowest number of new cases there in nearly a month, including in the hardest-hit province, Hubei. More than 74,000 people have been infected in China and hundreds more in some 25 countries, with Iran reporting two deaths, the first fatalities in the Middle East. In Japan, a man and a woman in their 80s who had been aboard the Diamond Princess have died, local media reported, citing a government source. A World Health Organization (WHO) official noted the progress in China but warned it had not reached a turning point just yet. Chinese officials said this week that their drastic containment efforts, including quarantining tens of millions of people in Hubei and restricting movements in other cities nationwide, have started to pay off. “After arduous efforts, the situation is changing for the better,” Foreign Minister Wang Yi said at a meeting with Southeast Asian counterparts in Laos late Wednesday, according to the official Xinhua news agency. Hubei and its capital Wuhan – where the virus is believed to have emerged in December – are still “’severely affected” by the epidemic, Wang said. “’But the situation is under effective control, while other regions are embracing comforting news,” he said. ‘Not turning point’ More than 600 new infections were reported in Wuhan – the lowest daily tally since late January, and well down from the 1,749 new cases the day before. The national figure has now fallen for three days in a row. Chinese authorities placed Wuhan, a city of 11 million people, under quarantine on January 23 and quickly locked down the rest of Hubei in the days that followed. Cities far from the epicenter have limited the number of people who can leave their houses for groceries, while villages have sealed themselves off from outsiders. Speaking at the dinner party of the Special ASEAN-China Foreign Ministers’ Meeting on Coronavirus Disease and the fifth Lancang-Mekong Cooperation Foreign Ministers’ Meeting, Wang said that under President Xi Jinping, Chinese people are rallying together to counter the COVID-19 epidemic. After arduous efforts, the situation is changing for the better, Wang said, noting that currently, the city of Wuhan and Hubei Province remain the areas severely affected by the epidemic, but the situation is under effective control, while other regions remain COVID-19 free. The number of COVID-19 cases has been declining for 15 consecutive days, and the number of those who have recovered from the disease is rising. By Tuesday, more than 14,000 coronavirus patients have been cured and discharged from hospitals, the first time that the cured cases have surpassed the confirmed cases of the day. This shows that the epidemic is controllable and curable, Wang said. “Viruses are common enemies of mankind, and the international community needs to join hands to tackle them,” Wang said. In stopping the COVID-19 epidemic, Wang said China is not fighting alone. It has been receiving support and understanding from different countries. Heads of more than 160 countries and over 30 international organizations have expressed firm support to China, he added. International support cited According to the Chinese Foreign Ministry, leaders of more than 160 countries and international organizations have sent letters or messages to express their solidarity. Many countries offered moral and material support to China. Russia, Belarus, and the Republic of Korea delivered badly-needed medical supplies to Wuhan through chartered flights. Pakistan sent virtually all the face masks in its stock. Japan’s ruling Liberal Democratic Party decided to deduct 5,000 yen (around 45.43 U.S. dollars) from the March salary of every parliamentarian of the party and donate the money to support China’s fight against the epidemic, a sum totaling 2 million yen (around 18,170 US dollars). The US State Department has coordinated with relevant organizations and donated 16 tons of epidemic prevention goods of all sorts, including masks, protective suits and oxygenerators. Noting that China and ASEAN, linked by mountains, rivers and waters, are not only one family but also a community with a shared future, Wang said ASEAN friends have been standing firmly with China from the very beginning of the virus outbreak. Cambodian Prime Minister Samdech Techo Hun Sen changed schedule to pay a special visit to China, demonstrating true friendship that stands out in difficult times, said Wang. He also praised other ASEAN countries for offering support to China in various means. Wang said the empathy from the international community including the ASEAN has been boosting China’s confidence in overcoming the epidemic. “We hardly feel the winter chill and the spring is approaching,” he said. Wang also expressed confidence that Thursday’s Special ASEAN-China Foreign Ministers’ Meeting on Coronavirus Disease and fifth Lancang-Mekong Cooperation Foreign Ministers’ Meeting will both be successful. The meetings will boost the Lancang-Mekong cooperation and deliver a signal to the world that China and ASEAN will join hands to fight the disease, safeguard people’s health of all countries and promote regional health security. “I believe that the China-ASEAN relations and China’s ties with each of the ASEAN members will be further deepened after the test of the epidemic,” said Wang. ‘Tremendous progress’ Richard Brennan, regional emergency director at the World Health Organization, said China was making ”tremendous progress in a short period of time”’ but cautioned that it was not over just yet. ”Trends are very encouraging but we are not at a turning point yet,” Brennan told a press conference in Cairo. ‘Chaotic’ cruise quarantine’ While China touts progress in its fight against the COVID-19 epidemic, Japan’s government faces criticism over quarantine measures on the Diamond Prince cruise ship. The huge vessel moored in Yokohama is easily the biggest coronavirus cluster outside the Chinese epicenter, with 621 positive cases confirmed among the passengers and crew – one sixth of the total. On Wednesday, 443 passengers disembarked from the ship after testing negative for the COVID-19 virus and not showing symptoms during a 14-day quarantine period. The complete removal of the passengers was expected to last at least three days. More passengers left the ship on Thursday, packing into yellow buses and leaving for stations and airports. But questions are increasingly being asked as to the wisdom of allowing former Diamond Princess passengers to roam freely around Japan’s crowded cities, even if they have tested negative. The death of the two elderly passengers is likely to add to the criticism. Tags: ncov"
,"February 20, 2020, 12:09 PM",nCov,China FM to meet ASEAN peers at virus summit,By Agence France-Presse,"By Agence France-Presse China’s foreign minister is set to meet his Southeast Asian peers in Laos on Thursday for crisis talks over the coronavirus which has seeded panic and constricted economies dependent on the flow of goods and tourists.  Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi(Photo by John MACDOUGALL / AFP / MANILA BULLETIN) Wang Yi will hold talks with counterparts from the 10 Southeast Asian (ASEAN) countries in Vientiane in a hastily-convened meeting over the health scare. China’s foreign ministry has described the summit as part of a “tradition of supporting each other through thick and thin”. A similar meeting was held in 2003 following the outbreak of SARS. Originating in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, the new coronavirus — known as COVID-19 — has killed more than 2,000 people, the majority within China. The government has locked down tens of millions of people in several virus-hit cities, extended Lunar New Year holidays and pulled flights in a scramble to contain the virus. Still the health scare has cascaded across Southeast Asia, with cases recorded in the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. The Philippines, Singapore and Vietnam have restricted flights from the mainland and suspended visa-free arrivals as health screening ramps up at entry points. Thailand, which has imposed no such restrictions, reported a 90 percent slump in arrivals from the mainland this month, a gut punch to an already beleaguered tourist sector which makes up nearly a fifth of the economy. Thailand anticipates a loss of over $8 billion by year’s end from the tourist tail-off. In Laos, Beijing will be eager to “project regional solidarity with its anti-pandemic efforts” a Southeast Asian diplomat told AFP, declining to be named. China sees ASEAN as its backyard and has ramped up economic, diplomatic and cultural influence over recent years with billions of dollars of investment, tourist outflows and a bigger presence at regional summits. There are fears prolonged disruption by the virus could slow work on the massive China-backed ‘Belt and Road’ schemes which criss-cross ASEAN. Tags: ncov"

Almost half of South Korea’s patients are linked to a 61-year-old woman who is a member of the Daegu branch of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus (AFP Photo/MANILA BULLETIN) Almost half the country’s patients are linked to a 61-year-old woman who is a member of the Daegu branch of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, an entity often accused of being a cult. She first developed a fever on February 10 but reportedly twice refused to be tested for the coronavirus on the grounds that she had not recently traveled abroad, and attended at least four services before being diagnosed. So far 37 other members of the church have been confirmed as infected. Shincheonji claims that its founder Lee Man-hee has donned the mantle of Jesus Christ and will take 144,000 people with him to Heaven, body and soul, on the Day of Judgement. Daegu’s municipal government said there were 1,001 Shincheonji members in the city, all of whom had been asked to self-quarantine, with 90 of them currently showing symptoms. Those who have symptoms “will be tested as soon as possible”, said Daegu mayor Kwon Young-jin, urging stronger action from the government in Seoul and calling the national response “inadequate”. Shincheonji closed down all its facilities nationwide. “We are deeply sorry that because of one of our members, who thought of her condition as a cold because she had not traveled abroad, led to many in our church being infected and thereby caused concern to the local community,” it said in a statement. The Korea Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) said in a statement that 31 new coronavirus cases had been confirmed nationwide, 23 of them in the cult cluster. Until Tuesday, South Korea had only confirmed 31 infections, but it now has a total of 82.   Tags: ncov"

A man and a woman in their 80s who had been infected have died, public broadcaster NHK and others reported, which would be the first fatal cases among the more than 600 on board the cruise ship.  Passengers look out from the balconies of the Diamond Princess cruise ship – in quarantine due to fears of the new COVID-19 coronavirus – as a the first group of passengers (not pictured) disembark from the ship at the Daikoku Pier Cruise Terminal in Yokohama on February 19, 2020. (Photo by CHARLY TRIBALLEAU / AFP / MANILA BULLETIN) Both had underlying conditions and had been taken off the ship on February 11 and 12 before being treated in hospital, NHK said. The huge vessel moored in Yokohama near Tokyo is easily the biggest coronavirus cluster outside the Chinese epicenter, with 621 positive cases confirmed among the passengers and crew. On Wednesday, 443 passengers disembarked from the ship after testing negative for the COVID-19 virus and not showing symptoms during a 14-day quarantine period. The complete removal of the passengers was expected to take at least three days. More passengers left the ship on Thursday, packing into yellow buses and leaving for stations and airports for home. But questions are increasingly being asked as to the wisdom of allowing former Diamond Princess passengers to roam freely around Japan’s famously crowded cities, even if they have tested negative. “Is it really safe to get off?” screamed a headline in the Nikkan Sports tabloid. The paper quoted a passenger who said he was tested on February 15 and left four days later. “I thought I could be infected during the four days. I thought ‘Is it really ok’?” The Diamond Princess was placed into quarantine on February 5 when a passenger who left in Hong Kong was found infected with the virus. Passengers were confined to cabins except for brief trips on deck wearing masks and gloves when they were told to keep their distance from others. But a specialist in infectious diseases at Kobe University rocked the boat with a video slamming “completely chaotic” quarantine procedures onboard, in rare criticism from a Japanese official. “The cruise ship was completely inadequate in terms of infection control,” said Kentaro Iwata in videos he has since deleted, saying “there is no need to discuss this further”. The videos had been viewed more than a million times in Japanese and hundreds of thousands of times in English. ‘I was so scared’  Japan’s health ministry lashed out in defense, saying it had conducted “consultations on appropriate infection control in the ship” with experts and taken a range of measures. It also released a video showing passengers how to wash and disinfect their hands properly and had “proper hygiene management” for medical workers entering and coming off the ship. In addition, risky and safe areas were strictly divided and there was a station installed for safely removing contaminated gear, the ministry said. “We’ve been doing our best in the circumstances,” Health Minister Katsunobu Kato told MPs on Thursday morning. “I want you to understand that not only our officials at the health ministry but also Self-Defense Forces officials and medical officials are working desperately hard,” he added. Iwata, who spent several hours on the ship, had alleged: “There was no distinction between the green zone, which is free of infection, and the red zone, which is potentially contaminated by the virus.” He said he was so concerned at what he saw on the ship during a brief visit on Tuesday that he has placed himself in a 14-day quarantine to avoid infecting his family. “I was in Africa dealing with the Ebola outbreak. I was in other countries dealing with the cholera outbreak. I was in China in 2003 to deal with SARS… I never had a fear of getting infection myself,” he said in the video in English and Japanese. “But inside Diamond Princess, I was so scared… because there was no way to tell where the virus is.” Several countries have evacuated their citizens from the ship and insisted they endure a further 14-day quarantine when they arrive on home soil. Outside the Diamond Princess, Japan has seen 84 cases.   Tags: ncov"
,"February 20, 2020, 10:42 AM",nCov,Coronavirus outbreak slashes China carbon emissions: study,By Agence France-Presse,"By Agence France-Presse The coronavirus epidemic that has paralyzed the Chinese economy may have a silver lining for the environment.  The coronavirus outbreak has hit the Chinese economy hard, but also lowered the country’s carbon emissions as a result, researchers say (AFP/File / GREG BAKER / MANILA BULLETIN) China’s carbon emissions have dropped by least 100 million metric tonnes over the past two weeks, according to a study published on Wednesday by the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA) in Finland. That is nearly six percent of global emissions during the same period last year. The rapid spread of the novel coronavirus — which has killed over 2,000 and infected more than 74,000 people across China — has led to a drop in demand for coal and oil, resulting in the emissions slump, the study published on the British-based Carbon Brief website said. Over the past two weeks, daily power generation at coal power plants was at a four-year low compared with the same period last year, while steel production has sunk to a five-year low, researchers found. China is the world’s biggest importer and consumer of oil, but production at refineries in Shandong province — the country’s petroleum hub — fell to the lowest level since autumn 2015, the report said. Economic activity in China usually picks up after the Lunar New Year holiday, which began on January 25. But authorities extended the holidays this year — by a week in many parts of the country including Shanghai — in an effort to contain the epidemic by keeping people at home. “Measures to contain coronavirus have resulted in reductions of 15 percent to 40 percent in output across key industrial sectors,” the report said. “This is likely to have wiped out a quarter or more of the country’s CO2 (carbon dioxide) emissions over the past two weeks, the period when activity would normally have resumed after the Chinese New Year holiday.” But environmentalists have warned that the reduction is temporary and that a government stimulus — if directed at ramping up production among heavy polluters — could reverse the environmental gains. “After the coronavirus calms down, it is quite likely we will observe a round of so-called ‘retaliatory pollutions’ – factories maximizing production to compensate for their losses during the shutdown period,” said Li Shuo, a policy adviser for Greenpeace China. “This is a tested and proven pattern.” Meanwhile, China’s nitrogen dioxide emissions — a byproduct of fossil fuel combustion in vehicles and power plants — fell 36 percent in the week following the Lunar New Year holidays, compared with the same period a year earlier, according to another study by CREA that used satellite data.   Tags: ncov"

Kahit na na quarantine na, hindi mo masasabi mula nung ni release sa hospital kasi di naman natin alam itong virus na ito kung pwedeng bumalik, kung may immunity ba,” Duque told DZMM Thursday. (We still need to quarantine them…just to make sure. Even if they were already quarantine, we’ll never know whether they’ll be or can still be infected once they are released from the hospital. We still don’t know much about the disease. We don’t know if it can be reacquired or if the person who acquired the disease becomes immune once they recover.) Duque said he would rather have the Filipino crew quarantined in the country than inside the ship. “I qu-quarantine ulit sila ng dalawang linggo, alam ko sa loob pa rin ng barko. Kaya sabi kong ganon, eh mahirap yan pag sa loob ulit ng barko kasi may exposure,” he said. (From what I know, the crew will be quartined again for two weeks insisde the ship. But that will only make the situation worse, and will give the crew more exposure to the virus.) The health secretary also said he was opposed to Japan’s move to quarantine the crew and passengers inside the ship. “Di kami sang-ayon don,” he said. (I don’t think it was the best move) On Tuesday, Japan annoucned that it has finished testing all passengers and crew for the disease.

(Photo by JU PENG / XINHUA / AFP / MANILA BULLETIN) At least seven medical workers have died from the virus, while 1,716 have been confirmed as infected, most at the epicenter of the epidemic in central Hubei province where hospitals have dealt with a huge influx of patients. Staff have faced shortages of masks and protective bodysuits, with some even wearing makeshift suits and continuing to work despite showing respiratory symptoms, health workers have told AFP. Xi said China must “strengthen efforts to relieve the stress of medical workers, provide them with daily necessities, arrange time for their rest and give them encouragement”, the official Xinhua news agency reported. Liu Zhiming, the director of Wuchang Hospital in Hubei’s capital Wuhan, died Tuesday, more than a week after the death of whistleblowing ophthalmologist Li Wenliang in the same city prompted nationwide mourning and calls for political reforms. ‘Majestic spirit’  A paper published by China’s Center for Disease Control and Prevention said an additional 1,300 health workers may have been infected but have yet to receive a diagnosis. Xi said China must ensure medical teams in Hubei and Wuhan “carry out work in a safe, orderly, coordinated, effective and swift manner”, Xinhua reported. The deaths of frontline medical workers “reflected doctors’ humane and majestic spirit”, Xi said. The death toll from the virus jumped past 2,000 on Wednesday, while 74,185 cases of infection have been confirmed in mainland China.   Tags: ncov"

Japan’s health ministry said it had discovered 79 additional cases of the flu-like disease that originated in Wuhan, China. Of the new cases, 68 showed no symptoms, it said.

(REUTERS/Athit Perawongmetha/MANILA BULLETIN) About 500 people were expected to disembark the Diamond Princess on Wednesday, a ministry official said earlier, with the process completed by Friday. The ship, operated by Carnival Corp, was quarantined after arriving in the port of Yokohama on Feb. 3, after a man who disembarked in Hong Kong before it traveled to Japan was diagnosed with the virus. It originally carried some 3,700 passengers and crew. Many of the infected people have been taken to hospital. About half the passengers are Japanese. “Day:15: Everyone here, thanks for your support over the last two weeks,” a departing passenger from Hong Kong said on Twitter, using the tag #quarantinedondiamondprincess. Japan ranks second in the world after China for the number of confirmed virus cases because of the outbreak on the ship, which is the biggest cluster of infections outside China. Japan has come under fire for its handling of the ship’s quarantine, although top government officials have defended it. “Unfortunately, cases of infection have emerged, but we have to the extent possible taken appropriate steps to prevent serious cases, including sending infected people to hospital,” NHK quoted Health Minister Katsunobu Kato as telling a parliamentary panel. The United States evacuated more than 300 nationals on Monday on two chartered flights and six South Koreans and one Japanese spouse flew to South Korea early on Wednesday on a chartered flight. The Americans flown home will have to complete another 14 days of quarantine. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said there were 220 Australians on board and a total of 169 would be evacuated. They will be flown to Darwin, where they will be quarantined for 14 days. Hong Kong has also said its residents coming home will have to spend 14 days in quarantine. Japanese people getting off the ship can go directly home. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said the quarantine “may not have been sufficient to prevent transmission among individuals on the ship”. The rate of new infections on board, especially among those without symptoms, was a risk, it said. More than 100 Americans remain on the ship or in hospital in Japan, the CDC said. The CDC said anyone getting off the ship and hoping to travel to the United States would have to wait 14 days without symptoms or a positive coronavirus test. Japan’s chief cabinet secretary, Yoshihide Suga, asked at a news conference why Japanese leaving the ship did not have to spend another two weeks in quarantine, referred to the advice of Japan’s National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID). The NIID said there should be no problem if people had shown no symptoms for 14 days and had tested negative for the virus during the period their health was under surveillance. NHK said that those who had shared rooms with passengers who tested positive would have to stay on the ship another 14 days from the time the infected roommate left. Crew members, who have been sharing rooms, would move to separate rooms and undergo health checks, it said. An Australian passenger said Australians had been told they would be pre-screened from Wednesday and taken to Tokyo’s Haneda airport for an expected departure early on Thursday. A captain’s announcement on the liner said that Hong Kong passengers would also be evacuated over the next 24 hours and a Canadian charter flight was expected on Friday. Italy, Israel, Britain and Taiwan were also preparing to evacuate their nationals, Suga said. Besides those on the cruise liner and returnees brought home from Wuhan city, about 60 cases of domestic infections have been confirmed in Japan, including 22 in Tokyo, NHK said.   Tags: ncov"

The death toll from the coronavirus in mainland China passed 2,000 but the number of new cases there fell for a second straight day, offering a sliver of hope and helping Asian shares and U.S. stock futures rise.  A member of the media approaches a passenger after he walked out from the cruise ship Diamond Princess at Daikoku Pier Cruise Terminal in Yokohama, south of Tokyo, Japan February 19, 2020. (REUTERS/Athit Perawongmetha/MANILA BULLETIN) China, the world’s second-largest economy, is struggling to get its manufacturing sector back on track after imposing severe travel restrictions to contain a virus that emerged in the central province of Hubei late last year. In Japan, hundreds of people disembarked from the British-flagged Diamond Princess cruise liner docked at Yokohama near Tokyo, ending an ordeal that began when the ship was quarantined on Feb. 3 after a former passenger was diagnosed with the virus in Hong Kong. “I am very keen to get off this ship,” Australian passenger Vicki Presland told Reuters over a social-media link. She was among a group of Australians getting off to catch an evacuation flight back to 14 days of quarantine in the city of Darwin. The outbreak on the liner, owned by Carnival Corp, resulted in the biggest concentration of new coronavirus infections outside China despite more than two weeks of quarantine for its approximately 3,700 passengers and crew on board. As questions swirled over how the virus spread so readily on the ship, Health Minister Katsunobu Kato defended Japan’s efforts. “Unfortunately, cases of infection have emerged, but we have to the extent possible taken appropriate steps to prevent serious cases, including sending infected people to hospital,” Kato said in a report by state broadcaster NHK. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said Japan’s efforts might have slowed down the virus but were not enough. “CDC’s assessment is that it may not have been sufficient to prevent transmission among individuals on the ship,” it said in a statement. Japan has repeatedly said its response to the outbreak on the ship has been appropriate. The United States has flown home more than 300 American evacuees from the ship and other countries are queuing up to collect their citizens, including Australians. Like Australia, the United States and other countries are making citizens spend 14 days in quarantine upon their return. With Japan just months away from hosting the 2020 Olympic Games, critics say the government’s response has seemed more concerned with managing public perception than the outbreak. From the start, experts raised questions about quarantine on the ship. Passengers weren’t confined to their rooms until Feb. 5. The day before, as officials screened them, onboard events continued, including dances, quiz games and an exercise class, one passenger said. Only passengers who test negative and do not show symptoms are being allowed to leave the ship. Those who have tested negative but were in cabins with infected people would remain on board for additional quarantine, Japanese officials said. The promising sign out of China came from the National Health Commission, which reported the lowest daily rise in new infections since Jan. 29, or 1,749 new confirmed cases. Hubei – the epicenter of the outbreak – reported the lowest number of new infections since Feb. 11. The latest figures bring the total number of cases in China to more than 74,000 and the death toll to 2,004, three-quarters of which have occurred in Wuhan, Hubei’s provincial capital. Six people have died outside mainland China, including a new fatality announced on Wednesday in Hong Kong. On top of tough steps taken to isolate Hubei, where the flu-like virus originated in a market illegally selling wildlife, state media reported the province would track down anyone who visited doctors with fever since Jan. 20 or bought over-the-counter cough and fever medication. Chinese officials have said the apparent slowdown in infection rates is evidence that the strict measures are working but global health officials say it is too early to predict how the epidemic will play out. The number of new cases in mainland China excluding Hubei has fallen for 15 days. The number of new infections outside Hubei totaled 56 on Feb. 18, down from a peak of 890 on Feb 3. The World Health Organization’s emergencies program chief, Mike Ryan, said China had success with “putting out the fire” first in Hubei and ensuring that people returning to Beijing from the Lunar New Year holiday were monitored. Chinese officials have been putting on a brave face saying the economic impact of the virus would be limited and short-term. President Xi Jinping said China could meet its 2020 economic targets, media reported. Big manufacturing hubs on the coast are starting to loosen curbs on the movement of people and traffic while authorities prod factories to get back to work. Tags: ncov"

An outbreak of the disease which has killed more than 2,000 people in neighbouring China could be devastating for the under-resourced health system in North Korea. Aid agencies have called for exceptions to be made to international trading sanctions to make it easier if needed to help Pyongyang fight the disease.  A logo is pictured on the headquarters of the World Health Orgnaization (WHO) ahead of a meeting of the Emergency Committee on the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in Geneva, Switzerland, January 30, 2020. (REUTERS/Denis Balibouse/MANILA BULLETIN) “At the moment there are no signals, there are no indications we are dealing with any COVID-19 there,” Dr Mike Ryan, head of WHO’s emergencies programme, told a news conference in Geneva on Tuesday. WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic said that North Korea had reported making checks on nearly 7,300 travellers entering the country over a six-week period to Feb. 9. Citing the North Korean health ministry, he said 141 travellers with fevers had been tested for the virus and all had tested negative. North Korean and WHO officials were due to meet in Geneva later to discuss preparedness. Jasarevic said the WHO will provide North Korea with supplies including laboratory reagents for tests and protective equipment such as goggles, gloves, masks and gowns for health workers. Some South Korean media outlets have reported cases and possible deaths from the virus in North Korea, which the North denies. On Tuesday, Rodong Sinmun, the official newspaper of North Korea’s ruling party, quoted a public health official reiterating “no confirmed case of the new coronavirus so far”. A former North Korean diplomat who defected to South Korea in 2016 said the ability of the WHO to evaluate the situation in North Korea was probably limited, as its staff and other foreigners would mostly be confined in the capital Pyongyang. “Recent measures taken by the North Korea regime are abnormal,” the former diplomat, Thae Yong-ho, told reporters in Seoul on Wednesday. Last week, the U.S. State Department said it was deeply concerned about the possible impact of a coronavirus outbreak in North Korea and was ready to facilitate U.S. and international organisations helping contain the virus there. Already one of the world’s most closed-off countries, North Korea has stopped flights and train services with its neighbours, established month-long mandatory quarantines, suspended international tourism and imposed a near-complete lockdown on cross-border travel. “The government is very anxious as you can imagine, as all governments are, to make preparations and are seeking our technical and operational assistance to help them get ready,” Ryan said.   Tags: ncov"

He has tried to find face masks near his apartment but has only succeeded once in the last month, queuing for six hours to get his hands on five free masks. “It exhausted me,” Yan told AFP. “I dared not move, fearing that I might lose my spot.” With just 40 masks at home to share among him, his wife and teenage son, Yan has started cutting back on going out in public, including to his regular medical check-ups. Public hospitals have stopped supplying masks to visiting patients to save vital equipment for staff in a city where more than 60 people have been diagnosed with the coronavirus. “I have to wear a mask in hospital but we can’t afford that now,” Yan said, lamenting that prices for face masks have soared in recent weeks as the government has resisted implementing price controls or rationing. Entrenched inequality  Despite being one of the richest cities in the world, Hong Kong has a profound wealth gap and a limited safety net for society’s most vulnerable. Of the nearly 600,000 people in the city with disabilities, a third live below the poverty line according to government data. Some 200,000 people also act as carers. Lam Chun, 64, looks after her 19-year-old nephew full time. He has Pradar-Willis syndrome — a genetic disorder that makes the person feel constantly hungry and often leads to diabetes and obesity. When she goes out to get groceries, she relies on a makeshift cloth mask to cover her face, even though it offers limited protection. “I always miss the information about masks because I don’t really know how to get online,” Lam said, noting how many Hong Kongers find out about restocked pharmacies through Facebook or family Whatsapp groups. Both Yan and Lam said they had received little help from local authorities in securing masks. “It turned out that the government did not do anything to protect people like us and I am deeply disappointed,” Lam said. The Social Welfare Department did not respond to requests for comment on what measures it was taking to ensure disabled and other vulnerable residents received masks. Responsibility has largely fallen to volunteers and the charity sector. Frayed nerves  Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam recently said 1.6 million masks would be given to local charities to hand out to vulnerable people. And Joshua Wong, a pro-democracy activist who was previously jailed for leading protests, said his party had secured 1.2 million masks from Honduras and would distribute them through their network of local councilors. There have been growing calls in some sectors for the government to implement price caps or to ration face masks in a bid to curb shortages and spiraling prices. After a brief bout of panic buying in nearby Taiwan, authorities introduced new rules limiting each person to buying just two masks a week through a system connected to their national health card. But in Hong Kong, which revels in its free-market status, authorities have so far resisted market intervention. Yan said he felt constantly anxious in recent weeks. “People like me are more vulnerable in face of diseases,” he said. “Maybe you are hearing my voice today and seeing my corpse tomorrow.”   Tags: ncov"
,"February 20, 2020, 12:32 PM",nCov,"Pounded by critics, Japan defends handling of virus outbreak",By Agence France-Presse,"By Agence France-Presse Japan faces mounting criticism for its handling of a coronavirus-afflicted cruise ship, with questions over a patchy quarantine, incremental testing and the decision to let people walk away after 14 days. The 3,711 people on the Diamond Princess went into quarantine off Japan on February 5, after it emerged that a former passenger had tested positive for the new coronavirus.  A passenger (C) leaves after disembarking the Diamond Princess cruise ship in quarantine due to fears of the new COVID-19 coronavirus, at the Daikoku Pier Cruise Terminal in Yokohama on February 19, 2020. (Photo by CHARLY TRIBALLEAU / AFP / MANILA BULLETIN) Passengers were confined to cabins except for brief outings on deck when they were required to wear masks and gloves and keep their distance from each other. But doubts soon emerged about whether the measures were working. Dozens of people on board were quickly diagnosed with the virus, and by Tuesday, 542 cases were reported. While passengers were confined to their cabins, those with balconies could sometimes be seen talking to neighbors without masks. And crew were not quarantined, sharing working spaces, living quarters and bathrooms, and simply donning masks and gloves when interacting with passengers. At least two government officials themselves contracted the virus while working on the ship. Kentaro Iwata, a professor at the infectious diseases division of Kobe University, told AFP the on-ship quarantine was a “major failure, a mistake”. “It is highly likely secondary infections occurred,” he said. In videos that racked up hundreds of thousands of views, Iwata later said he had been on board the ship Tuesday and observed “completely chaotic” conditions.  “The cruise ship was completely inadequate in terms of infection control,” he charged, saying he now was placing himself into a 14-day self-quarantine for fear of infecting his family. Japan ‘is not perfect’  But Japanese officials defended their approach, with Shigeru Omi, a former WHO regional head advising the government, saying the quarantine had “a very positive effect” on reducing infections. “(The) majority of the infections, we believe, occurred before the date when the quarantine measures started,” he told reporters. That does not appear to have convinced foreign governments, with Washington evacuating hundreds of Americans from the ship and Australia, Britain, Canada, and Hong Kong all planning to repatriate citizens. The US embassy warned that US health officials have “concluded that despite efforts of quarantine there is a high risk that passengers… have been exposed to COVID-19”. And in an indication that foreign governments do not believe the on-ship quarantine has worked, those being repatriated will undergo another quarantine of two weeks — the presumed virus incubation period. Japanese officials have pointed out there were no guidelines for dealing the unprecedented situation. Other countries have simply turned away cruise ships over the virus, and Cambodia is now scrambling after welcoming a ship that turned out to have at least one infected passenger on board. “There was no established international agreement as to how to respond to and who is responsible for and when to disembark,” Omi told reporters. “No organization is perfect, Japan is no exception.” Michael Ryan, head of the WHO’s health emergencies program, acknowledged there “has been much more transmission than expected on the ship”. But, he added, “it is very easy in retrospect to make judgments on public health decisions made at a certain point”. ‘A bit scared’  Pinpointing when infections began on the ship was made harder by the slow rollout of testing, with fewer than 300 people initially tested and the pool only gradually expanded to include at-risk groups. Japan said it was constrained by limited testing capacity, but it waited days to ask the private sector for help and only completed onboard testing of passengers a day before the quarantine ended. And as many of those who test positive do not have symptoms, officials concede it is hard to prove when they contracted the virus. Despite the doubts, Tokyo allowed around 500 people who meet conditions including testing negative in the quarantine’s final days to leave the ship on Wednesday. Officials say there is little evidence that tests produce false negatives. “As far as we know, once the test is negative, they remain negative,” Takaji Wakita, director-general of Japan’s National Institute of Infectious Diseases, told AFP. Domestically, the government’s handling of the crisis appears to have dented Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s popularity, already battered by a cronyism scandal. And a recent poll found 52 percent disapproved of the government’s response to the outbreak, but in Yokohama where the ship is docked, there was sympathy for those on board. “It must be really tough,” 17-year-old student Shoya Horiuchi told AFP. “I want them to hang in there.” But, he conceded, he has started to think of the virus as “a threat” “I am a bit scared.”   Tags: ncov"
,"February 19, 2020, 3:00 PM",nCov,"Passengers leave Japan virus ship as China toll tops 2,000",By Agence France-Presse,"By Agence France-Presse Hundreds of relieved passengers disembarked a coronavirus-stricken cruise ship in Japan Wednesday after testing negative for the disease that has now claimed more than 2,000 lives in China and spread panic worldwide. The Diamond Princess has proved a fertile breeding ground for the COVID-19 virus with at least 542 positive cases, and Japan has faced mounting criticism for its quarantine arrangements as the passengers disperse.  A passenger (L) disembarks from the Diamond Princess cruise ship – in quarantine due to fears of the new COVID-19 coronavirus – at the Daikoku Pier Cruise Terminal in Yokohama on February 19, 2020. (Photo by CHARLY TRIBALLEAU / AFP / MANILA BULLETIN) “I’m relieved… I want to take a good rest,” said a 77-year-old Japanese passenger, who declined to give his name. He said he would be boarding Japan’s famously crowded railway system to go home. Yellow-dotted city buses, plus a dozen or so taxis, were lined up to whisk away the passengers, many of them dragging their luggage behind them and waving to former ship-mates on balconies. The ship is the biggest cluster outside China, where new figures showed the death toll surging beyond 2,000 with more than 74,000 infected. Hundreds more cases have been reported in two dozen countries. South Korea reported 15 new confirmed cases — increasing its total by nearly 50 percent — including a cluster of at least 11 centered on the southern city of Daegu. Hong Kong reported a second death. For the 500 passengers disembarking after testing negative, a difficult 14-day quarantine period has come to an end after their dream cruise turned into a nightmare of fear and boredom confined in many cases to small windowless cabins. “Our last deep gratitude to the crews and captain for such an amazing care… during the epic crisis… we can’t wait to see you again soon on board again,” tweeted passenger Yardley Wong, who has been cooped up with her six-year-old son. ‘Taking its toll’  Those with no symptoms and a negative test received an official certificate saying they posed “no risk of infection”. But not everyone was so lucky. British passenger David Abel, who became a minor celebrity with his upbeat video messages in the early days of the quarantine — including a cheeky request to the captain for whisky — typified the mood shift aboard. “Mentally, it’s now taking its toll. Right now, it’s very hard to remain focused on anything,” he said. He later announced he and his wife Sally had tested positive. China announced Wednesday there were 1,749 new infections, the lowest number of new cases this month. All but 56 new cases were in the epicenter of Hubei province. Michael Ryan, head of WHO’s health emergencies program, said the outbreak was “very serious” and could grow, but stressed that outside Hubei, it was “affecting a very, very tiny, tiny proportion of people.” But in Japan, some have raised concerns about allowing people from the cruise ship to board flights home or spread out into the notoriously busy Japanese capital. Kentaro Iwata, a professor at the infectious diseases division of Kobe University, blasted the on-ship quarantine as a “major failure, a mistake”. “It is highly likely secondary infections occurred,” Iwata told AFP, saying skepticism from abroad of the quarantine was “only natural”. He later said in a video published online that he was self-quarantining after a brief visit to the ship where he raised major concerns about the procedures on board. “It was completely chaotic,” he said. ‘Cheer for them’  Several countries appear to have lost patience with the on-board quarantine and chartered planes to repatriate citizens. In the first such evacuation Monday, more than 300 Americans flew home even though 14 had tested positive. Britain, Hong Kong and Australia are among other countries that have vowed to repatriate people from the ship but will insist on a further 14-day quarantine on home soil. Nathalie MacDermott, a medical expert at King’s College London, recommended a further 14-day self-quarantine for those leaving. “Given the circumstances on board the Diamond Princess, those passengers leaving the boat should be managed in a similar manner to those individuals departing a highly affected city or region,” said MacDermott. South Korea vowed to block foreigners who have been on board the Diamond Princess from entering the country. Disembarkation is expected to take around three days as more test results become available. The crew will begin a new quarantine when the last passenger has left. People in Yokohama appeared supportive of the decision to allow the passengers out despite the virus fears. “I am sure those people on board must be really worried. I hope they can go back to their normal life soon,” said 51-year-old Isamu Habiro. “As a Yokohama resident, I don’t want them to be treated unfairly. I want to cheer for them,” Habiro told AFP.

,"February 19, 2020, 2:14 PM",nCov,Coronavirus concerns loom over cruise industry,By Reuters,"By Reuters The rapid spread of the coronavirus disease is taking a toll on the $46 billion global ocean cruise industry. Dominated by three U.S.-listed companies, Carnival Corp,Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd, and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings, the industry is under sharp scrutiny following the virus outbreak that has left one ship quarantined in Asia.  A cruise ship that spent two weeks at sea after being turned away by five countries over fears that someone aboard might have the coronavirus is seen in Sihanoukville, Cambodia February 14, 2020. (REUTERS/Soe Zeya Tun/FILE/MANILA BULLETIN) Many see Asia as a potential growth area for cruise tourism: 39 cruise brands were active in Asian waters last year, deploying a total of 79 ships, according to trade group Cruise Lines International Association. The long-term impact of the virus on the industry is unclear and some analysts have cautioned investors against dumping cruise stocks. “We remind investors not to hit the panic button, as in the year following SARS, H1N1, and Zika, Carnival and Royal both posted positive as-reported yield growth, conveying the resilience of demand across the industry,” Morningstar analysts said in a recent note. Royal Caribbean Cruises on Thursday canceled 18 cruises in Southeast Asia after calling off eight trips to China last week. It joined industry leader Carnival in warning that full-year earnings would be hit by the epidemic. The big three of the cruise industry – Carnival, Royal Caribbean and Norwegian Cruise Line – have nearly 200 ships in their global fleet. Norwegian declined to comment on the long-term impact of the virus on its business. Carnival and Royal Caribbean did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Each of these companies garner a major portion of its annual revenue from the region. China, in particular, has grown as a cruise market in recent years because of its large middle-class population and expanding international tourism. Carnival, which considers China its most significant long-term growth opportunity in Asia, has been in the eye of the coronavirus storm. Carnival’s Diamond Princess has remained docked in Yokohama, Japan, since Feb. 3 after a man who disembarked in Hong Kong was diagnosed with the virus. With 218 passengers and crew infected, the British-flagged ship has the biggest cluster of infected people outside China. Another Carnival ship, the MS Westerdam, found itself stuck at sea for about two weeks after several Asian countries barred it from docking at their ports. The ship finally docked in Cambodia. Carnival has already suspended cruise operations at ports in China. The company estimated its 2020 earnings would drop 55 cents to 65 cents per share if it was forced suspend operations in the rest of Asia. The virus scare has hit shares of all cruise liner companies in recent months. Cruise ships, which bring large numbers of people together in crowded, semi-enclosed environments, can sometimes facilitate the spread of contagious diseases such as norovirus and other gastrointestinal illnesses. The average age of a cruise ship customer as of 2018 was 46.7 years, according to Cruise Lines International Association. The average age of the people who have contracted the coronavirus is 55.5 years, according to a study of 99 patients at a single hospital in Wuhan, China, from Jan. 1-20, as reported in the Lancet medical journal.   Tags: ncov"

Officials said the man was taken to hospital on 12 February after a fall at home. He had a fever and tested positive for the virus, dying a week later. In mainland China, where the virus first emerged, more than 2,000 people have been killed and 74,000 infected. Hong Kong has confirmed the virus in 62 patients, two of whom have died. The first infections were largely found within people who had travelled to the epicentre in China’s central Hubei province. But in recent weeks local infections have increased among residents with no history of travel to China. Hong Kong is on edge over the virus partly because of its own tragic history of experiencing a deadly disease. In 2003, 299 Hong Kongers were killed by an outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) — 40 percent of the global total fatalities. The outbreak left deep psychological scars on the tightly packed city and a lasting legacy of distrust towards China’s communist leadership who initially covered up the outbreak. In the last fortnight, the international business hub has been hit by a wave of panic-buying, with supermarket shelves emptied of staple goods such as toilet paper, hand sanitiser and rice. Authorities say the supply of goods remains stable and says panic buying is itself causing shortages. Face masks, however, remain in short supply with queues cropping up across the city whenever a local pharmacy or store announces a new delivery. Tags: ncov"

The Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center is the designated facility for coronavirus cases in China’s biggest city, which was previously used to treat victims of the 2002-03 SARS epidemic (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) and was hastily expanded to handle the current outbreak.  Shanghai Public Clinical Center said it has so far admitted 320 confirmed coronavirus cases, 135 of whom have recovered and been discharged, while one has died (AFP Photo/Noel CELIS / MANILA BULLETIN) But doctors said the scale of the COVID-19 health crisis, which has killed more than 1,800 people, mostly in China, and infected nearly 72,500 worldwide, has pushed the medical centre to its limits. “Admitting so many severe cases all at once is a big test for us,” Lu Hongzhou, the centre’s co-director, told reporters through a face mask during a government-organised tour on Monday. The center so far has admitted 320 confirmed coronavirus cases, 135 of whom have recovered and been discharged, while one has died, Lu said. All told, Shanghai has reported 333 confirmed cases of the virus, with the sole death being an 88-year-old man. Doctors at the medical center are still treating 184 people, including 14 in critical condition. They are using a mix of methods including anti-viral medications, corticosteroids, blood plasma from recovered patients, and a healthy dose of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). “We have customized treatment plans for critically ill patients, as their conditions vary,” Lu said. “Some are 50 years old. Some are 80. Some have cardiovascular conditions. So, ‘one patient, one plan,'” he said. Some Western experts have questioned using TCM, saying its efficacy remains unproven by science, making it a potentially dangerous placebo. But Lu said two severe cases who did not respond to anti-viral drugs alone were also administered TCM, after which their conditions improved. “The combination of both Western and Chinese medicine has achieved a great effect in combating the virus,” Lu said, adding that 90 percent of all the hospital’s patients were given Chinese medicines. Yet his colleague Shen Yinzhong, the hospital’s director of medical services, cautioned that more study was needed. “We still need to do more clinical trials to prove (TCM’s) safety and efficacy,” Shen said. War footing  As drug-makers work towards a vaccine and treatment for the epidemic, Chinese health officials on Monday urged recovered patients to donate blood. Plasma from such patients contains antibodies that can help reduce the virus load in critically ill patients, the government said. It has the potential to infect patients with other illnesses carried in the blood, however, requiring rigorous screening of plasma. The Shanghai medical center began using plasma in recent days. “We are positive that this method can be very effective in our patients,” Lu said. The collection of light-yellow, low-rise buildings has gone on something of a war footing, with all staff leave canceled, and specialists drafted in from a range of other medical facilities. Those tending to virus patients wear full-body protective suits with a respirator. Reporters were not permitted to see patients undergoing treatment, with officials citing the health risks. To protect doctors and staff, dozens of wards have been set up featuring “negative pressure”, a ventilation arrangement allowing air to flow into a room but not out, to prevent contaminants escaping. “We have done a great amount of work to protect our medical staff. In the negative pressure wards, harmful droplets respired from the patients will be sucked away and filtered,” Lu said. Tags: ncov"
,"February 18, 2020, 5:04 PM",nCov,Chinatowns feel brunt of virus panic,By Agence France-Presse,"By Agence France-Presse MELBOURNE – Normally bustling century-old Chinatowns from Melbourne to San Francisco have fallen quiet and businesses are struggling to survive as fears over the deadly novel coronavirus outbreak ripple around the world.  A visitor wears a face mask as she walks through London’s Chinatown district (AFP Photo/DANIEL LEAL-OLIVAS / MANILA BULLETIN) “Scaremongering is rampant” complains Max Huang, owner of the Juicy Bao restaurant in Melbourne’s historic Chinese district. “Customers won’t come in if they can avoid it.” Huang’s eatery sits among dozens of restaurants making up Australia’s oldest Chinatown enclave, dating back to the influx of fortune-seekers during an 1850s gold rush. Although the epicenter of the COVID-19 epidemic is more than a ten-hour-flight way, and Australia has seen just a handful of cases, the stigma of a disease that has claimed more than 1,800 lives is pervasive. Streets are notably quieter, facemasks are a commonplace and even a Lunar New Year dragon dance failed to bring in the usual crowds. Businesses report their earnings have dropped by more than half and they have been forced to cut staff hours dramatically, a situation echoed in Chinatowns across the world. At the usually buzzing Empire Seafood Restaurant in Vancouver’s Richmond suburb, getting a table is now a breeze. “Usually we’d have a large line-up time of approximately five-ten tables, but today there is no line up at all,” assistant general manager Ivan Yeung said. “Some people have already cancelled their parties and banquets. Many restaurants are seeing the same thing. Hopefully, this gets back to normal really soon.” Disappearing tourists  A ban on travelers from China has hit many neighborhoods particularly hard. “Usually we have Chinese tourists coming at this time, but now it’s like zero,” said Tony Siu, manager of the popular Cantonese restaurant R&G Lounge in San Francisco. “They often get the sea bass or the salt and pepper crab, that are our famous dishes.” In Australia, the travel ban has been compounded by almost 100,000 Chinese students being unable to fly Down Under to start the academic year. “Our main customers are from China… (so) it’s very difficult,” said Su Yin, whose pancake store sits downstairs from a Melbourne college with a large Chinese student base. Hoping to reassure would-be customers, some businesses have tacked up notices saying they disinfect their interiors regularly to prevent disease. Others have gone a step further installing hand sanitizer for guests and giving staff face masks and rubber gloves. But such measures appear to have had limited success. Rebecca Lyu, a Chinese student living in London, has a hard time convincing friends to join her to eat or shop. “Some of my friends refused to go eat at restaurants in Chinatown because they are worried about the virus,” she said. Many believe xenophobia has worsened the situation further. Fred Lo’s souvenir store in San Francisco is usually frequented by tourists from Europe and South America. But “for the past two weeks, there’s been a lot less people, at least 50 percent less, even though nobody is sick or has even been to China,” he said, adding business is as bad as it has been since he began working there in 1975. “It’s unfair that a lot of people are scared of Chinese people,” said Eddie Lau, president of Melbourne’s Chinese Chamber of Commerce. “We tell people, ‘we are fine, don’t be scared.'” In London, David Tang said he had clearly noticed others avoiding him in recent weeks, but understood why people were afraid and had tried to take it in stride. “I travel by train every morning. One day last week, all the people were standing, and I’ve got an empty seat next to me,” he said. “I laughed about it.” Tags: ncov"

Liu Zhiming(Weibo) The COVID-19 virus, which is believed to have originated in Wuhan late last year, has infected more than 72,000 people and killed nearly 1,900. Liu Zhiming, the director of Wuchang Hospital in Wuhan, died Tuesday morning after “all-out rescue efforts failed,” state broadcaster CCTV reported. China said last week that six medical workers had died from the virus, while 1,716 have been infected. Liu’s death was initially reported by Chinese media and bloggers shortly after midnight on Tuesday — but the stories were later deleted and replaced with reports that doctors were still trying to save him. After initial reports of his death were denied, the hospital told AFP on Tuesday morning that doctors were giving him life-saving treatment. Liu’s death has echoes of that of Wuhan ophthalmologist Li Wenliang, who had been punished by authorities for sounding the alarm about the virus in late December. Li’s death prompted a national outpouring of grief as well as anger against the authorities, who were accused of mishandling the crisis. People took to social media to mourn Liu on Tuesday, with many users on the Twitter-like Weibo platform drawing critical comparisons between Liu’s death and Li’s. In both cases their deaths were initially reported in state media posts — later deleted — and their deaths denied, before being finally confirmed again. “Has everyone forgotten what happened to Li Wenliang? They forcefully attempted resuscitation after he died,” one Weibo commenter wrote. Another commenter said, Liu “already died last night, (but) some people are addicted to torturing corpses”. A hashtag about Liu’s death had 29 million views by Tuesday afternoon. Doctors in Wuhan face shortages of masks and protective bodysuits, with some even wearing makeshift hazmat suits and continuing to work despite showing respiratory symptoms, health workers have told AFP. Hubei province and its capital Wuhan have been the hardest hit by the virus, accounting for nearly 1,800 of the deaths from the virus so far.   Tags: ncov"

South Korea became the latest to announce it would remove its citizens from the Diamond Princess, where more than 400 people have tested positive for COVID-19.

(Photo by Behrouz MEHRI / AFP / MANILA BULLETIN) Japan has faced criticism for its handling of the situation, with dozens of new infections detected almost daily since the ship arrived in early February. But it has defended its approach and health minister Katsunobu Kato insisted again Tuesday that passengers who test negative will be allowed to leave the ship from Wednesday. “We have done tests for everyone (on the ship),” he told reporters. “Some results have already come out… and for those whose test results are already clear, we are working to prepare disembarkation from the 19th,” he said. Kato said the process would last two or three days. But those who had close contact with people who have tested positive will have their quarantine reset to the date of their last contact with an infected person. Crew are also expected to remain to observe another quarantine period after the last passengers leave the ship. So far, the United States, Canada, Australia, Hong Kong and now South Korea have said they will evacuate their citizens from the ship.

There are 14 South Koreans on board in total, but the other ten have declined to be evacuated from the ship because they live in Japan, the Yonhap news agency reported. Early Monday, more than 300 Americans were evacuated from the ship, among them over a dozen who have tested positive for the virus. The Americans, like citizens from other countries being evacuated from ship, will have to undergo another 14-day quarantine. Canada said Tuesday it had “secured a chartered flight to repatriate Canadians on board the Diamond Princess” but gave no details on when the process would take place. There were 256 Canadians on board the ship, with 32 so far testing positive for the virus. While foreign governments have couched their decision to remove citizens as an attempt to reduce the burden on Japanese authorities, many have interpreted the evacuations as criticism of Tokyo’s handling of the situation. The US and Australia have told citizens that if they decline repatriation and an additional 14-day quarantine, they will not be allowed home for at least two weeks, suggesting they do not believe the ship-based quarantine has worked. At least 454 people on the ship have so far tested positive for the virus and been removed to local hospitals for treatment. Japan has also confirmed at least 65 cases domestically, including many involving people with no history of recent travel to China. Authorities have said the virus is being transmitted locally now, and have asked citizens to avoid crowds and non-essential gatherings. On Monday, the amateur portion of the Tokyo Marathon, which had been expected to attract some 38,000 runners, was canceled. Only elite athletes will now be able to take part. The public celebration for Emperor Naruhito’s birthday has also been scrapped over virus fears. Read more: Japan cancels Emperor’s birthday public celebrations amid virus fears Tags: ncov"

China’s ruling Communist Party has severely curtailed civil liberties since Xi took power in 2012, rounding up rights lawyers, labor activists and even Marxist students (AFP / MANILA BULLETIN) Anti-corruption activist Xu Zhiyong was arrested on Saturday after being on the run since December, according to Amnesty International. China’s ruling Communist Party has severely curtailed civil liberties since Xi took power in 2012, rounding up rights lawyers, labor activists, and even Marxist students. The death this month of a whistleblowing doctor who was reprimanded by police for raising the alarm about the deadly new virus before dying of it himself triggered rare calls for political reform and freedom of speech. The “Chinese government’s battle against the coronavirus has in no way diverted it from its ongoing general campaign to crush all dissenting voices,” said Patrick Poon, China researcher at Amnesty International, in an emailed statement. Another source, who spoke to AFP on the condition of anonymity, said Xu had been arrested in the southern city of Guangzhou. Guangzhou police did not respond to requests for comment. Xu went into hiding after authorities broke up a December gathering of intellectuals discussing political reform in the eastern coastal city of Xiamen in Fujian province, prior to the coronavirus crisis. Over a dozen lawyers and activists were detained or disappeared after the Xiamen gathering, according to rights groups — and Xu’s detention appears linked to his presence at the meeting, explained Poon. But while on the run, Xu continued to post information on Twitter about rights issues. On February 4 Xu released an article calling on Xi to step down and criticised his leadership across a range of issues including the US-China trade war, Hong Kong’s pro-democracy protests and the coronavirus epidemic, which has now killed nearly 1,900 people. “Medical supplies are tight, hospitals are filled with patients, and a large number of infected people have no way to be diagnosed,” he wrote. “It’s a mess.” “The coronavirus outbreak shows just how important values like freedom of expression and transparency are — the exact values that Xu has long advocated,” Yaqiu Wang, China researcher at Human Rights Watch, told AFP. But the disappearance of Xu illustrates how the Chinese state “persists in its old ways” by “silencing its critics”, she said. Xu — who founded a movement calling for greater transparency among high-ranking officials — previously served a four-year prison sentence from 2013 to 2017 for organizing an “illegal gathering”. “That he was a fugitive for so many days while continuing to speak out, that in itself was… a kind of challenge to (Chinese authorities),” said Hua Ze, a long-time friend of Xu who told AFP she lost contact with the Chinese activist on Saturday morning.   Tags: ncov"

(REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon/File Photo / MANILA BULLETIN) In an interview with CNN Philippines, DFA Undersecretary Brigido Dulay said eight more Filipinos tested positive for COVID-19. “As of today, we can confirm that eight more Filipinos have been infected and have been taken by the Japanese health officials to the quarantine site,” Dulay said. “That brings the total as of today to 35,” he added. Dulay said most of the infected Filipinos are “asymptomatic” and “healthy.” The foreign affairs official also assured that the infected Filipinos are being well-taken care of by the Japanese health authorities and the vessel owners. Dulay said the earliest time the Filipino crew members can disembark the cruise ship, given that they test negative for the disease, will be March 5. Dulay explained that the crew has to undergo a “separate quarantine.” “That’s another 14 days for the crew. They will have to have three tests. The three tests will run through a 14-day period,” he said. The DFA said there are 531 Filipino crew members and 7 passengers aboard the virus-hit cruise ship. A total of 401 of them have expressed desire to be repatriated, according to Dulay. The Japanese government is scheduled to announce Wednesday the disembarkation procedures for the end of the ship’s quarantine period. In view of this development, the foreign affairs office said the Philippine Embassy in Tokyo is coordinating with all relevant Philippine and Japanese government agencies and is meeting with senior management representatives of Princess Cruises to ensure an “orderly and safe repatriation” of Filipinos once they clear the Japanese quarantine requirements.

The commission said the move was “to better meet the growing needs of Chinese consumers” and that it would accept applications from firms in China. The tariff exemptions will apply for a designated period, supporting firms that want to import from the US based on “business considerations,” said authorities. ‘Blanket measures’ not helping The World Health Organization (WHO) on Monday warned against “blanket measures” over the novel coronavirus outbreak, pointing out the epidemic outside of China was only affecting a “tiny” proportion of the population. WHO said that — with a mortality rate of around 2 percent — COVID-19 is “less deadly” than other coronaviruses such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) or Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). WHO officials likewise rejected the suggestion that all cruises should be halted to avoid risking a new nest of infection like the one on the coronavirus-hit Diamond Princess off Japan. “Measures should be taken proportional to the situation. Blanket measures may not help,” WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters in Geneva. The outbreak has battered manufacturing and tourism across the region and led to multiple travel restrictions including for flights and cruises. “If we are going to disrupt every cruise ship in the world on the off chance that there might be some potential contact with some potential pathogen then where do we stop?” said Michael Ryan, head of WHO’s health emergencies program. Ryan said that even at the epicenter of the crisis in the city of Wuhan in central Hubei Province, the “attack rate” — a measure of the speed of spread of the virus — was four per 100,000. “This is a very serious outbreak and it has the potential to grow, but we need to balance that in terms of the number of people infected. Outside Hubei this epidemic is affecting a very, very tiny, tiny proportion of people,” he said. Tedros also referred to an apparent decline in new cases of the disease in recent days but said that the trend “must be interpreted very cautiously.” “Trends can change as new populations are affected. It is too early to tell if this reported decline will continue. Every scenario is still on the table,” he said. Tedros said that more than 80 percent of patients infected with the virus have mild disease and recover, while 14 percent have severe diseases such as pneumonia. Around five percent of cases are considered critical with possible multi-organ failure, septic shock and respiratory failure and, in some cases, death,” he added. Tedros said there were “relatively few cases” among children and more research was needed to understand why. The WHO also warned against a global over-reaction to the new coronavirus epidemic following panic-buying, event cancellations and concerns about cruise ship travel.

The second flight arrived early Monday at Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland, Texas. “A select number of high risk patients were transported onward from both locations using those same aircraft to Omaha, Nebraska for care at the University of Nebraska,” Health and Human Services official Robert Kadlec told reporters. State Department official William Walters added these included six passengers from the base in California and seven from the base in Texas. Some of these included spouses and it was not clear how many had tested positive for the COVID-19 virus. Shortly before the flights left Japan, US officials were informed that 14 of the passengers, tested days earlier, had received positive results. Some patients were also being treated at hospitals near the California base. The medical staff in Nebraska are re-testing the cases for themselves after those patients were placed in isolated areas of the two planes for the journey home. “Until we’re done with testing they’ll be self-isolated to their room,” Shelly Schwedhelm, an official at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, said in a separate briefing. She added that 12 of the patients were in a quarantine unit while one was in a bio-containment facility — one of three selected in the country to care for US citizens evacuated from Africa with the Ebola virus. Forty other US citizens who had been on the ship and had previously tested positive were being treated in Japanese hospitals and were not allowed to fly. Beyond those brought out on the latest flights, Walters, the State Department official, added that the government was continuing to track the movements of 60 US nationals still in Japan. The government is also following 92 US citizens who remain on the Westerdam cruise ship off Cambodia as well as 260 more in hotels in Phnom Penh. “Roughly 300 American citizens have departed Cambodia but only after testing by the government of Cambodia’s ministry of health,” he added. Impoverished Cambodia is a staunch Chinese ally with a threadbare medical system.

(AFP PHOTO / Fresh News / MANILA BULLETIN) There are fears scores of cruise-goers have been scattered across the world without full health checks — as Cambodia on Monday afternoon treated a few dozen of the passengers to bus tours around the capital Phnom Penh. Passenger Christina Kerby, whose drole tweets as the Westerdam was bounced across ports drew widespread attention, admitted she “was surprised” to be allowed on a tour of the Cambodian capital before being given the complete all-clear from the virus. “I have young kids back home (in the US) and wouldn’t want to risk infecting them or anyone around me if I am carrying the virus,” she told AFP. The Westerdam was at sea for two weeks during which it was barred from Japan, Guam, the Philippines, Taiwan, and Thailand over fears it could be carrying the virus, which originated in China and has killed nearly 1,800 people. On Thursday Cambodia, a staunch ally of Beijing, allowed the ship to dock at Sihanoukville. It was met by the kingdom’s bombastic premier, who hugged disembarking passengers as he swiftly latched on to the Westerdam’s PR potential for a nation more often in the spotlight for human rights abuses. His stance won applause from US President Donald Trump. But three days later one Westerdam passenger, an 83-year-old American, was stopped on arrival in Malaysia and later diagnosed with the coronavirus.  On Monday Malaysia said over 130 other passengers who also took the flight with the sick American women left for the US, Europe, and Australia and Hong Kong. Thailand, a flight hub already used by scores of the Westerdam passengers, on Monday mulled a ban on transit by cruise-goers, as the region played catch up to the risks posed by the boat. “Passengers on ship are at risk and travel by airplane will cause risk to other passengers,” health minister Anutin Charnvirakul said Monday. Cruise operator Holland America is working with national health authorities “to investigate and follow up with individuals who may have come in contact with the guest”, chief medical officer Dr. Grant Tarling said late Sunday. ‘Harsh reality’  Yet health risks appeared secondary to authorities in Cambodia, a poor country with a threadbare medical system. On Monday afternoon, passengers waiting for onward flights were gifted the bus tour of Phnom Penh. Photos in government-aligned media showed them smiling, giving thumbs ups and none with a mask on. “There were tons of media lining the street,” Kerby said, adding she “was not expecting such a showing”. Another 233 passengers and 747 crew remain on the Westerdam, which is still docked at Sihanoukville. Authorities have been allowing them to leave the vessel in groups based on their flight bookings but those on board told AFP they are now not permitted to disembark. A Sihanoukville spokesman said Monday health samples are being collected from all onboard the Westerdam “in order to be clear”, adding that passengers will not go off-ship until the tests are completed.

With this, Malaya said this clarifies the DOH’s Advisory on Concerts and Other Public Events and Gatherings issued last Feb. 7. “While they may continue with public gatherings at their discretion, we wish to remind the general public to wash your hands regularly, and to seek medical attention if signs of cough, colds, sore throat, and fever appear,” Malaya said. He said LGUs should strictly implement all the guidelines in handling guests during this global emergency which includes monitoring all participants at public events with infrared thermometers, providing all their participants with hand sanitizers or 70 percent isopropyl alcohol, asking everyone to use surgical masks (not N95) if possible, and providing wastebaskets for the proper disposal of all types of wastes. “If the LGU decides to push through with their public events, they should discourage those with cough, colds, sore throat, and fever from attending, and they should have medical personnel on standby for any eventuality. Moreover, they should closely coordinate with their DOH counterparts so that they are properly guided,” he added. Malaya said the DOH and the DOT have assured all their stakeholders that they have already implemented all the precautionary measures, so it is now incumbent upon the LGUs to do the same. “We have to show to our constituents that we have their safety in mind so let’s issue the necessary advisories before we hold these public meetings and events,” he said.

Philippine National Police (MANILA BULLETIN) Brig. Gen. Dennis Agustin, director of the PNP-Anti-Cybercrime Group (ACG), said that the suspect, Josephil Brian Consuelo, posted on his Facebook account that a COVID-19 patient died at the University of Cebu Medical Center. “He is the author of that false report..His post caused panic in Cebu Citu,” said Agustin. ACG operatives immediately checked the veracity of the post when they came across a post from a certain CJ Brian Consuelo. But when the police went to the hospital, they were informed that the post was fake. Agustin said Consuelo was collared on February 13. He was charged with violation of Article 154 of the Revised Penal Code in relation to Section 6 and Section 4 (c) 4 (Online Libel) of the Republic Act 10175 or the Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012. Based on the Revised Penal Code, the case carries a penalty of arresto mayor and a fine ranging from P40, 000 to P200,000 or imprisonment for a minimum period of four years and one day to a maximum of eight years, per offense. PNP chief Gen. Archie Gamboa earlier ordered the ACG to run after those who would post false information about COVID-19 as those posts only triggers panic among the public. “Again, we urge the public to refrain posting unverified information that creates panic and confusion and we will file criminal charges to those proven spreading these false reports,” said Gamboa.

(MANILA BULLETIN) This, after reports from international news outfits came out, citing that at least three Asian businessmen contracted the virus while they were at a business conference in Singapore suspecting their buffet meals as the mode of virus transmission. It was also the same reason being eyed in the case of the quarantined cruise ship Diamond Princess in Japan’s port of Yokohama where thousands of passengers have been quarantined amid the coronavirus limbo. “Kami po ay nakikipag-ugnayan sa lahat ng sektor sa ngayon, financial sector, even the Food and Beverage Bureau (FMB). We just had our meeting with the hotel owners, together with the Department of Tourism. So, ang gusto lang naming iparating sa inyong lahat, kung ano man po ang binibigay namin sa inyong advisory, para sa pag iwas, these are general precautions, hindi po natin kailangang tukuyin na pag ikaw ay nagbuffet, pag ikaw ay nagshabu-shabu, ikaw ay makakakuha ng sakit,” DOH Assistant Secretary Dr. Maria Rosario Vegeire said in Monday’s press briefing. Vegeire stressed that the principal mode of transmission for the COVID-19 is still thought to be respiratory droplets as previously announced by the World Health Organization (WHO). “Pag sinabi nating mga droplet, ‘yan yung mga short distance lang ang tinatravel, halimbawa nagsalita ka o ikaw ay dumura 3 feet po yung virus maaari mong maipasa. ‘Yan po yung droplet infection pero ayoko pong mag zero in na kapag nag buffet ka or kapag ikaw ay nagshabu-shabu kasi tanggalin po natin ang impormasyon na ito sa utak natin because we are going to scare people away,” she added. The health official also suggested to handle the issue carefully as this could potential incur losses to the country’s food industry. In fact, the country’s economic managers said they are now preparing measures to counteract the economic impact of COVID-19 outbreak especially that the Philippines is among the most vulnerable countries hit by the ongoing global health emergency. Just in China where the virus originated, several fast-food giants already ordered temporary closures including McDonald’s, KFC, Starbucks, and Dairy Queen as the virus continues to spread.

We want elderly and those with pre-existing conditions to avoid crowded places,” he said. The birthday gathering on February 23 was canceled as local media reported that the amateur section of the Tokyo Marathon, scheduled for March 1, would be canceled. “We have no formal decision to announce yet. We are studying and once a decision is made we will announce it, by today,” a spokeswoman for the organizers told AFP. The birthday celebration for Emperor Naruhito was to be the first since he took the throne last year.

Presidential Spokesperson Salvador Panelo made the statement after Duterte said in a video message last week that he will travel around the country and urged Filipinos to join him, saying they should first explore the wonders of the Philippines before traveling abroad.  Presidential Spokesman Salvador Panelo(OPS / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN) In his Monday press briefing, Panelo said Duterte’s presence in different parts of the Philippines will encourage tourists to visit the different destinations in the archipelago. “He’s a magnet. He’s always a magnet. His presence attracts people [to attend] an event,” he said. In another press briefing in Malacañang, Tourism Undersecretary Art Boncato said the Department of Tourism (DOT) was still coordinating with the Office of the President about the itinerary for the President’s island-hopping venture which will start later this month or early March. “It has to be immediate so it’s going to be in the next couple of weeks. We’re lining up destinations like Boracay, Cebu, even Bohol as part of the initial list of destinations the President will most probably visit within the next couple of weeks,” he said. “Definitely [the major islands will be covered]. The intention is really to visit as many destinations as possible.” Boncato added the DOT would have wanted Duterte’s tourism activities to happen weekly, but said the President may not be able to do so because of his busy schedule. “Kung kami po ang tatanungin, mas maganda po sana, pero siyempre ang Pangulo ang schedule niya ay medyo puno (If you’re going to ask us, that would be good but of course, the President has a full schedule),” he said. “So handa po kami, kahit na ang mga local government units at tsaka private sector in the regions, handa na sa pagbisita ng Pangulo (But we are ready, including the local government units and the private sector in the regions, for the President’s visit).” Boncato agreed that Duterte’s plan to visit local destinations will help push domestic tourism as the country continues to experience low tourist arrivals amid the threat of COVID-19. He said the situation has resulted in foregone revenue of around P14.8 billion. However, he said it was still difficult to tell if a boost in local tourism will compensate for the losses incurred from the low foreign tourist arrivals, especially with the travel ban imposed on China, Hong Kong, and Macau.

Passengers had been cleared to travel by Cambodian authorities after health checks when the cruise ship docked on Thursday. It had spent two weeks at sea after being turned away by Japan, Taiwan, Guam, the Philippines and Thailand. But on Saturday, Malaysia said an American woman who arrived in Kuala Lumpur on Friday on a chartered flight had tested positive for the new coronavirus that has killed more than 1,700 people, the vast majority in China. The woman’s husband tested negative for the coronavirus. About 137 of the 145 passengers on the chartered flight had already left for other countries as of Sunday after showing no signs of illness, Malaysian authorities said. Dozens more of the Westerdam passengers had flown through Thailand and onward to other countries, Thai officials said. At least 236 passengers and 747 crew remain aboard the vessel off the Cambodian port city of Sihanoukville, Holland America said. Others were in hotels in Phnom Penh, the capital. Holland America said it is working with health officials in Malaysia and Cambodia and experts in the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO). “These experts are working with the appropriate national health authorities to investigate and follow-up with individuals who may have come in contact with the guest,” said Dr. Grant Tarling, Chief Medical Officer for Holland America Line.

US passengers queue to imbark in a plane at the Haneda Airport, in Tokyo on February 17, 2020 after disembarking in Yokohama from the Diamond Princess cruise ship, where people are quarantined onboard due to fears of the new COVID-19 coronavirus.(Photo by Kazuhiro NOGI / AFP / MANILA BULLETIN) “Forty of them have gotten infected,” Anthony Fauci, a senior official at the National Institutes for Health said on CBS’ Face the Nation show. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said Saturday that 400 Americans on the Diamond Princess cruise ship would be evacuated and flown back to the United States where they would face a 14-day quarantine period. But Fauci said that those confirmed with infections would not be allowed to fly. “They are not going to go anywhere,” he said. “They’re going to be in hospitals in Japan.” Asked about the severity of the infected Americans’ illness, Fauci said it varied. “You could be infected and have minimal symptoms, but you still have the possibility of transmitting it to someone else,” he said. “Or you could be infected and have some significant lung disease that would require hospitalization and perhaps even some serious intervention.” He added that anyone showing potential symptoms of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, would also not be able to get on evacuation planes. “If people on the plane start to develop symptoms, they’ll be segregated within the plane. So there’s a very firm plan with this 747 that is going to take these passengers now who have been there.” Some American passengers from the cruise ship have indicated they would decline to be evacuated because they were asymptomatic. But Fauci said everyone who had been on the ship would still be subject to quarantine on their return to the US. “And the reason for that is that the degree of transmissibility on that cruise ship is essentially akin to being in a hot spot. A lot of transmissibility on that cruise ship,” he explained. More than 1,600 people have died from the novel coronavirus in China since it was first detected in the central city of Wuhan, and five others have died outside China. The US has enacted a temporary travel ban on foreign nationals who have visited China and quarantine measures for its own citizens returning from the province at the epicenter of the outbreak.

Mi Feng, NHC spokesperson, said the decline proves that the China’s prevention and control measures were “effective”, the state-run Xinhua News Agency reported Sunday. In Wuhan, where the COVID-19 was believed to have originated, the proportion of severe cases among all the confirmed cases fell to 21.6 percent on February 15, from a peak of 32.4 percent on January 28. Severe cases from other parts of Hubei Province also dropped from a peak of 18.4 percent on January 27 to 11.1 percent on Saturday. The percentage of severe cases in other provinces of China likewise decreased from a peak of 15.9 percent on January 27, to 7.2 percent last weekend. The NHC spokesperson said the decline was due to the differentiated measures being implemented on patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19, close contacts of the confirmed cases, and fever patients. “The differentiated measures ensure that a large number of mild cases are treated in time, reducing the possibility of becoming severe cases,” Mi was quoted telling reporters. More than 68,500 people in China were infected with the COVID-19, with the death toll exceeding 1,660. The NHC, on the other hand, said the new cases are slowing down for 12 consecutive days. The Chinese government said it is able to contain more than 99 percent of the confirmed cases within its borders. China has implemented lock downs in Wuhan and several other cities in Hubei province, as well as the suspension of public transportation, since the outbreak started last month. Four more deaths due to the new coronavirus were reported outside of China: in the Philippines, Japan, France, and the latest, in Taiwan. Tags: ncov"

The Bangladesh crab industry — which involves some 500,000 mostly poor farmers — is facing its worst-ever crisis as some 90 percent of all crabs from the $30-million market are exported to China.  Workers removing crabs from a pond at a farm in Khulna (AFP Photo/STR/MANILA BULLETIN) Farmers told AFP not a single shipment of crabs was flown to China since exports were halted in the last week of January. That period is usually the busiest of the year because of the Lunar New Year, where Chinese families have lavish banquets. Many farmers had borrowed from banks and money lenders at high-interest rates to boost stocks ahead of the Lunar New Year. “My stock is 70 percent damaged and if I cannot move the rest in a day, those (the rest) will die too,” Bidyut Ghosh, a crab farmer from the southwestern town of Paikgacha, told AFP. The crabs are harvested live and can survive for up to 10 days in the right conditions, but once taken from their ponds they can’t be returned without losing quality and condition. Crab trader Ranjit Mondol — from in the coastal district of Bagerhat where some 12,000 tonnes or 72 million crabs were produced last year — said prices usually doubled or tripled at this time of the year. “I have lost over 12 tonnes of live crabs in the past week. That was worth at least $420,000,” Mondol he told AFP as he broke down in tears, adding that he had taken out a big loan. “Now I don’t know how would I even pay my debts. Perhaps I will end up in jail.” Mondol is among thousands who switched to crab farming as their paddy fields turned barren as climate change increased soil salinity. “The Chinese ban… will shatter many farmers and send them back into poverty,” Mondol said.

The local task force, however, assured that they will remain vigilant and continue implementing all precautionary measures against infectious diseases. “We urge the public to maintain proper hygiene,” Bayarong said in a statement, adding “no other offices or person is authorized to issue any information regarding COVID-19 besides the local task force.” The spokesman made this reminder to avoid the spread of fake news about the disease. “As we have done from the start, the local task force will continue to be transparent and relay all information to the people of Olongapo,” Bayarong said. On February 14, the Olongapo COVID-19 Task Force reported that a PUI for COVID-19 has been admitted to a hospital in the city on February 13. According to an earlier statement, Bayarong said the patient was placed in isolation and was “asymptomatic meaning has no symptoms of COVID-19 and has shown progress, the patient has no more fever and cough.” Tags: ncov"

For Las Piñas City lone district Rep. Camille Villar, a robust and dependable emergency medical services system (EMSS) must be established throughout the country via the LGUs to counter the as yet incurable COVID-19.  House of the Representatives (Facebook) Villar filed House Bill (HB) No. 5788, which seeks to establish, institutionalize, and strengthen emergency medical systems in the country. She said the system would constitute the comprehensive policy framework governing the provision of emergency medicine (EM) in each of the country’s LGUs. “Emergency medicine is a specialized discipline in the medical field focused on giving timely and coordinated health and safety services to victims of sudden illness or injury, prior to them reaching hospitals, health centers or other brick-and-mortar healthcare facilities,” explained the House Deputy Majority Leader. “There’s still so much we don’t know about COVID-19 (2019 coronavirus disease) as far as treatment is concerned. But having a strong EMSS in the background can help save lives and ease the public’s paranoia on this new virus. As with any viral infection, the first few hours is always important and this bill ensures that we have the infrastructure to respond to it,” said Villar. Under the proposed Act, LGUs shall create their own Dispatch Centers with adequate and qualified personnel. The Dispatch Centers shall follow the prescribed guidelines on dispatch protocol. “All LGUs shall establish their respective Command Centers with designated qualified EMS medical director. Command Centers shall govern the EMS systems based on the prescribed operational guidelines. The Command Center can be co-located with the Dispatch Center,” Villar said in her bill. The bill also mandates the creation of the National EMSS Advisory Committee, to be co-chaired by the Department of Health (DOH) and the Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG). Data cited during the 2013 Asian Conference on Emergency Medicine showed that the Philippines only has 3,300 recognized Emergency Medical Service (EMS) personnel. And out of a reported 1,795 hospitals in the country, only 200 (or 11 percent) can be considered “emergency hospitals” or facilities that are capable of providing quality EM care, Villar said. DILG update needed  Meanwhile, Deputy Speaker and Camarines Sur 2nd district Rep. LRay Villafuerte wants the DILG to confirm whether or not the country’s LGUs have already set up their respective task forces to help the national government in preventing the spread of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which causes COVID-19. The DILG should update the public on the status of its earlier directive for all LGUs to create their own anti-COVID-19 task forces, which would advise their constituents about the needed precautionary measures as well as serve as a coordinating body with DOH. “The public needs to know whether all LGUs [have complied] with the DILG’s directive last month…more so now that the number of [worldwide] COVID-19 infections and fatalities are growing by the day,” Villafuerte, a former Camarines Sur governor, said. Villafuerte said city and municipal mayors, as well as governors, should give top priority to the creation of COVID-19 task forces following last month’s declaration by the World Health Organization (WHO) of a global health emergency over this virus. The WHO has declared the virus he world’s “Public Enemy Number 1” after the worldwide death toll surpassed the 1,000-mark. This new strain, which was first detected last December 2019 in Wuhan City, Hubei province, China, has led to three COVID-19 cases in the Philippines, all of them Chinese nationals. One of them died and was the first fatality from the disease recorded outside of China. Tags: ncov"

Bureau of Internal Revenue (MANILA BULLETIN) Revenue Deputy Commissioner for Operations Arnel Guballa said the evaluation reports will be used as the basis in coming out with a more reasonable and realistic collection goal. The BIR is the single biggest source of funds of the government contributing roughly 61 percent of the national budget of P4.1 trillion for the year. Guballa said the impact to the economy of the pandemic could not be clearly ascertained at this time as the virus is still raging. Aside from the COVID-19 outbreak, the field evaluation reports will also include tax losses caused by other calamities like the Taal Volcano eruption, the African swine fever, strong earthquakes, and devastating typhoons. The Department of Tourism estimated this early that COVID-19 could result in P43 billion in revenue loss due
drastic cut in tourist arrivals. Shipments of electronics and auto parts, the country’s major exports to China, have virtually stopped due to the temporary closure of many factories there to contain the spread of the virus. The Department of Finance is optimistic, however, that the economic growth will rebound when the epidemic is finally restrained. Tags: ncov"

(FACEBOOK/MANILA BULLETIN) “It is normal to feel sad, stressed, confused, scared, or angry during a crisis. Talking to people you trust can help. Contact your friends and families,” the WHO said in its advisory on how to cope with stress during the COVID-19 outbreak. The WHO advised the public not to resort to smoking, alcoholic beverages, or drugs to deal with stress. “If you feel overwhelmed, talk to a health worker or counselor. Have a plan, where to go to and how to seek help for physical and mental health needs if required,” the organization said. The public was also reminded to always look for a credible news source about the COVID-19– like the WHO website or through the local or state public health agency. “Get the facts. Gather information that will help you accurately determine your risk so that you can take reasonable precautions,” it said. “Limit worry and agitation by lessening the time you and your family spend watching or listening to media coverage that you perceive as upsetting,” the WHO added. The WHO also encouraged individuals who feel anxious to draw on skills that they have used before which helped them manage their previous life adversities. “Use those skills to help you manage your emotions during the challenging time of this outbreak,” it said. “If you must stay at home, maintain a healthy lifestyle–including proper diet, sleep, exercise and social contacts with loved ones at home; and by email and phone with other family and friends,” the WHO added. Meanwhile, the Department of Health (DOH) said that a total of 498 persons under investigation for COVID-19 has already been recorded since early January. Based on the latest COVID-19 case tracker of the health department, 159 individuals remain admitted in medical facilities, while 336 people were already discharged after they tested negative for the disease.

From Luang Prabang in northern Laos to Pattaya in Thailand, Hoi An in Vietnam, and the Cambodian casino town of Sihanoukville, takings have plummeted as Chinese travelers find themselves subject to a host of restrictions at home and abroad.  Across Laos, Thailand, Vietnam, and Cambodia, tourist takings have plummeted as Chinese travelers find themselves subject to a host of travel restrictions (AFP/ MANILA BULLETIN) “We haven’t had any Chinese for 10 days since they closed the road from Yunnan,” says Ong Tau, 47, from behind her stall of fruit shakes in the temple-studded Laotian colonial town of Luang Prabang. “Business is down 20-30 percent. It will get worse.” Tour guides, mall workers, and restaurant staff are all feeling the burn as Chinese — the world’s biggest travelers — stay at home in the middle of a global health crisis. “My friend has lost four or five big tour groups… they would have paid for his low season,” said Tee, a guide in Luang Prabang, giving only one name in the tightly-controlled communist country, a mass of tuk-tuks standing idle behind him. But in one of Southeast Asia’s least well-resourced countries, there may be one bright side to the sudden economic pain. “We don’t know how to protect ourselves,” he added. “The government doesn’t tell people anything… so maybe less Chinese is a good thing for now.” Number of cases drops The number of new cases from China’s coronavirus epidemic dropped for a third consecutive day on Sunday, as the World Health Organisation chief warned it was “impossible” to predict how the outbreak would develop. Global concern remains high about the spread of the virus, which first emerged in China’s central Hubei province in December, with the first death outside Asia reported in France this weekend. The death toll jumped to 1,665 in mainland China on Sunday after 142 more people died from the virus. More than 68,000 people have now been infected — but the number of new cases of the COVID-19 strain continued to decline. In hardest-hit Hubei, the number of new cases slowed for a third consecutive day and at 139, the number of deaths was level with Saturday’s toll. The number of new cases in other parts of the country has dropped for twelve straight days. The WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned however that it was “impossible to predict which direction this epidemic will take”. “We ask all governments, companies, and news organisations to work with us to sound the appropriate level of alarm without fanning the flames of hysteria,” he said, speaking at the Munich Security Conference. “China has bought the world time. We don’t know how much time.” The UN health body has asked China for more details on how diagnoses are being made. An international team of WHO experts was scheduled to arrive in Beijing this weekend for a joint mission with Chinese counterparts. Loans and job losses The slump is being felt sharply in Thailand, where tourism authorities say arrivals from China — usually close to one million a month — have plunged by 90 percent so far this February. At the Chang Siam Elephant Park in Pattaya, a few hours south of Bangkok, owner Nantakorn Phatnamrob fears he will soon be pressed into debt to float a business which has lost nearly $65,000 since the outbreak. “People are afraid to visit,” he told AFP. “If it stays like this, I will have to get a loan from the bank.” Crocodile farms and tiger sanctuaries — controversial tourist beacons where visitors can pet the animals — are also deserted, leaving owners to feed expensive star attractions. The outbreak has also spooked western tourists at the height of peak season in what has already been a tough period for Thai tourism thanks to a strong baht. Thailand anticipates shedding five million tourists this year, taking with them “250 billion baht (over $8 billion) in revenue”, according to Don Nakornthab, director of economic policy at Bank of Thailand. “Our hopes that the economy will do better than last year are very low… it’s possible it could grow below 2 percent,” he added. For staunch Beijing ally Cambodia, where only one case of the virus has been confirmed so far despite a large Chinese presence, strongman leader Hun Sen has repeatedly played down the risk to his country. Still, Cambodian tourism is taking a hammering. Ticket sales at the famed Angkor temple complex in Siem Reap have fallen between 30 and 40 percent this year, while in Sihanoukville, a southern beach resort notorious for its casinos, the tourist take has shrivelled. “I used to make $100 a day,” said Chantha Reak, a ride-hailing driver. “Now it’s $10.” Businesses are praying for a bounce back if and when the virus is controlled. With 10 million Chinese visitors each year, Thailand hopes the pain will ease in a few months. Regular visitor Yen Ran, 25, from Chengdu, came to Pattaya despite the health warnings. “I am a little concerned how other countries perceive us,” she told AFP. “But when there’s a cure, things will get better.” Cases on Japan ship rise to 355 TOKYO (AFP) –The number of people who have tested positive for the new coronavirus on a quarantined ship off Japan’s coast has risen to 355, the country’s health minister said Sunday. The new figures came as the United States was preparing to evacuate some of its citizens from the Diamond Princess, which has been in quarantine since February 5 in the port of Yokohama, near Tokyo. Hong Kong also said it would offer its 330 citizens on board the chance to take a charter flight back. Canada, too, announced a similar decision to repatriate its nationals on the ship. “So far, we have conducted tests for 1,219 individuals. Of those, 355 people tested positive,” health minister Katsunobu Kato told a roundtable discussion on public broadcaster NHK — a rise of 70 from the last government toll. Japan’s efforts to control the viral infections on the vessel have prompted international concern. The cruise ship arrived off the Japanese coast in early February with more than 3,700 passengers and crew members from more than 50 countries and regions. It was placed under quarantine after authorities found that a passenger who got off the boat in Hong Kong during its voyage tested positive for the virus. Officials kept finding new infections among the passengers and crew members and transporting them to Japanese hospitals, while others have been told to stay inside their individual cabins during the 14-day quarantine period, which should end on Wednesday. Japan has not been able to test all those on board due to limited supplies of testing kits, facilities and manpower that are also needed by authorities tracking the spread of the virus among the general population. “Based on the high number of COVID-19 cases identified onboard the Diamond Princess, the Department of Health and Human Services made an assessment that passengers and crew members onboard are at high risk of exposure,” the US embassy said in a letter to its passengers. The US, Canada and Hong Kong said those repatriated will go through another two-week quarantine period at home. The captain of the Diamond Princess has told passengers that the Japanese government might start testing them for the virus from Tuesday, and those with negative results would be allowed to get off the ship from Friday. Outside mainland China, an 80-year-old Chinese tourist in France was the fourth person to die from the new coronavirus, with the other deaths in the Philippines, Hong Kong and Japan. A US State Department spokesperson said Americans stranded on the vessel would be evacuated, and would face a further quarantine of two weeks in the United States. Hong Kong authorities also announced it would charter a flight for city residents on the ship, who would stay at a quarantine centre for 14 days on their return. With the government facing criticism over its handling of the crisis, Chinese President Xi Jinping called for tighter policing to protect social stability. The government must “increase use of police force and strengthen the visible use of police”, to ensure stability during the crisis, Xi said in a February 3 speech published by state media on Saturday. China’s central bank said it will also disinfect banknotes with ultraviolet light or high temperatures and store them for up to 14 days before they are put back into circulation. Tags: ncov"

In Tagaytay City, the local government has called off its month-long “Pista ng Pag-ibig” or “Feast of Love” in adherence to the alert call of the Department of Health (DOH) on COVID-19 threat. Tagaytay has been undertaking the month-long celebration for the past two decades being the province’s no. 1 tourist destination imbued with the romantic ambiance fit for a Valentine’s Day-themed event. But this year, City Tourism and Cultural Development Officer Jelanne R. Mendoza said that the lone event for the Valentine celebration was the traditional mass civil marriage ceremonies. The event, dubbed Civil Mass Wedding 2020, had 20 couples who exchanged vows at a hall of the Tagaytay International Convention Center. It was the least number of couples who participated in the mass wedding in years. The couples usually number over a hundred at times. City Mayor Agnes Delgado-Tolentino, Vice Mayor Reymond A. Ambion and the city councilors led the simple and brief but “sweet and memorable” wedding ceremonies. “The number was understandable, there was the alert on COVID-19,” Tolentino said in an interview with this reporter after the ceremonies. The couples, their guests and others who attended the wedding were made to undergo a thermal scan before being allowed into the hall. Local officials in Dasmarinas and Rosario and Noveleta celebrated the “Love Day” with their similar simple “Kasalang Bayan (town weddings)”. Dasmarinas Mayor Jennifer A. Barzaga and her husband Cavite fourth district Representative Elpidio “Pidi” Barzaga led the wedding ceremonies for hundreds of couples at a hall of the city’s De La Salle University. In Rosario, Mayor Jose “Nonong” Ricafrente and other local officials led a free mass civil wedding at the Isla Bonita (Island of Beauty), a resort known for its sunrise-view area. In Imus, the capital, top Councilor Adrian Jay Adivincula and his staff led the distribution of red roses and chocolates on Valentine’s Day to all female employees at the city hall.

She noted that there had been many occasions that for very dangerous “pathogen’’ even with the highest level of PPE one can still get infected because of inattention and mistakes made when one is tired. Also such cases have been observed in the Ebola outbreak. “The discussion is more of how to make sure that health workers feel safe, and how to ensure that they properly use the PPE,” she said. “There are times when some very sophisticated PPE can give a full sense of security, then one forgets some of the basics such as washing the hands when finished using the PPE.” “Equipment should be used to its best and one should not rely only on the equipment,” she reminded.

Those comments came days before Beijing rolled out measures to soften the blow.  Chinese President Xi jinping speaks during a meeting with Tedros Adhanom, director general of the World Health Organization, at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, China, January 28, 2020. (Naohiko Hatta/Pool via REUTERS/FILE/MANILA BULLETIN) The epidemic has become a major test for Xi in how to balance stamping out the epidemic with protecting an economy already growing at its slowest in nearly three decades. His Feb. 3 speech to the Politburo’s Standing Committee was published in full by the leading Communist Party theoretical journal Qiushi on Saturday. It showed how Xi had urged officials to roll out policies to support the economy even as they worked to control the spread of the coronavirus. In the speech, he said that the epidemic, which has killed more than 1,500 people and infected over 66,000 so far, was impacting the economy, especially service industries. Actions needed to be taken to maintain China’s industrial chain and encourage enterprises to resume production, he said. China “still has to adhere to this year’s economic and social development goals”, Xi said in the speech. He also said it was necessary to increase financial support, such as preferential policies for loan interest rates and terms, and get migrant workers in major industries back to work. Big projects, especially those in manufacturing, should start construction on time, he said, adding that boosting consumption was an important hedge against the epidemic’s impact. Work should be done to promote the wider adoption of 5G technology, as well as the purchase of products associated with healthy living and cars, Xi added. The epidemic had revealed “shortcomings and deficiencies” in national governance, he said, such as how the wildlife animal industry had remained huge despite clear risks in their consumption, and how the country’s reserves of health and anti-epidemic materials were seriously inadequate. A tendency to insist on formalities and bureaucracy have also emerged, creating problems in fighting the epidemic, he said, adding that party members who did not adequately engage in the work must be held accountable and removed from their posts. He also said he gave instructions on preventing and containing the coronavirus on Jan. 7, when he chaired another Politburo Standing Committee meeting. China first confirmed that the virus had passed from person-to-person and infected some medical staff on Jan. 20. Tags: ncov"

Archbishop of Singapore William Goh in a statement said that as Catholics, “we need to be responsible in playing our part to contain the spread of the virus by avoiding large gatherings of people.”  (AFP / Roslan RAHMAN / MANILA BULLETIN) “Hence, given the current escalating situation which is proving to be difficult to contain, all public Masses, both on weekdays and weekends, will be suspended indefinitely with effect on Saturday, February 15, 12 p.m. until there is greater clarity on the way forward,”Goh said. He added that “all other public events with large numbers of people attending, such as formation sessions, retreats, and seminars should be suspended.” Catholics in Singapore may still follow the broadcast of the Mass on YouTube or CatholicSG Radio. “You can also gather as a family for the Liturgy of the Word by spending time in prayer, reading the word of God of the Sunday liturgy and interceding for the world that this COVID-19 virus will be contained and eradicated,”Goh said. If gathering together as a family to worship is not possible, “you should individually spend at least half an hour in quiet time to pray and especially read the word of God,” he added. Meanwhile, for weddings and funerals, which are considered private services, only invited guests can attend. For those who need the sacraments immediately, such as the anointing of the sick and the sacrament of reconciliation, parishioners were advised to make an appointment with the priests. Ministers of the sacraments were also advised to take proper precautions when ministering to parishioners. “Thank you for your patience and understanding. Let us continue to pray for each other, especially those who have succumbed to this illness; and that the Lord will free us from this COVID-19 so that we can continue to worship freely and build up the community in love and service,”Goh said. “Pray also for those in the frontlines – the doctors and the nurses – who are putting their own well-being in the service of the sick; that the Lord will protect them and their loved ones from harm,” he said.

A Los Angeles middle schooler is beaten and hospitalized after students say he is as an Asian-American with coronavirus. And over 14,000 people sign a petition urging schools in the Alhambra area to close over coronavirus risks, even though there is only one case of the virus in Los Angeles County, with its population of 10.1 million.  A passerby wearing mask walks through Chinatown in New York, U.S., February 13, 2020. (REUTERS/Yana Paskova/MANILA BULLETIN) These are some of the hoaxes, assaults and rumors Los Angeles authorities spoke out against on Thursday to stamp out anti-Asian bigotry bubbling to the surface in California, where over half of the 15 U.S. coronavirus cases are located. Bullying and assaults of Asian-Americans are being reported from New York to New Mexico, sparked by unfounded fears that they are somehow linked to a virus that originated in China. With by far the largest Asian-American population of any U.S. state, officials in California are aggressively trying to get ahead of such hate crimes before they spread. “We’re not going to stand for hate,” Los Angeles County Supervisor Hilda Solis told reporters, flanked by law enforcement officials. She urged residents to report crimes to a special 211 number. Existing prejudice against Asians has combined with media images from China to create fears that Asian-Americans are more likely to be virus carriers. The discrimination could get worse given chances the virus may spread in U.S. communities in the weeks and months ahead, said Robin Toma, head of the Los Angeles County Human Relations Commission. Face masks commonly worn by Asians to protect against germs or prevent their spread have become a flashpoint, with wearers insulted or attacked out of fears they have the virus, he said at the news conference. “We need you to step up and speak out when you see it happening to others,” he said. Anti-Asian sentiment emerged in 2003 during the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS, which also originated from China. That was before the emergence of social media platforms like Twitter, where racism, hoaxes and slurs get amplified. The issue is not isolated to California. New York City designer Yiheng Yu works in an office where many colleagues have recently returned from China and where she and others wear face masks as a precaution. On one occasion when she wore a mask outside her office she was accosted by a woman. “She started yelling, ‘Are you Crazy? Get the heck out of here,” said Yu, 34. “I realized it was because I was wearing a mask.” Even coughs can provoke fear, said Ron Kim, a New York state assembly member representing a Queens district with a large Asian and Asian-American population. “I had a staff member who was in the Albany train station and she was coughing a little bit and someone approached her asked if she had the virus,” said Kim, who on Feb. 7 established the Asian American Health Advisory Council to educate New Yorkers about the virus. “We live in a very fear-driven society as it is, so if we add an extra layer it’s bound to happen, people are going to be ugly,” he added. Manjusha Kulkarni, head of A3PCON, which represents Los Angeles County’s more than 1.5 million Asian-American and Pacific Islander residents, saw an urgent need for information to separate coronavirus fact from fiction. “Businesses and restaurateurs have seen a steep decline in their patronage,” Kulkarni said of Asian proprietors. “We only have one case of the coronavirus here in LA.” Tags: ncov"

Gather information that will help you accurately determine your risk so that you can take reasonable precautions,” read the latest post of WHO Philippines in its official Twitter account. “Find a credible source you can trust such as WHO website or, a local or state public health agency,” it added. WHO Philippines also advised the public to limit worry and agitation “by lessening time you and your family spend watching or listening to media coverage that you perceive as upsetting.” “It is normal to feel sad, stressed, confused, scared, or angry during a crisis,” WHO Philippines said. Under this situation, WHO advised affected individuals to talk to people you trust, including friends and family. “Don’t use smoking, alcohol, or other drugs to deal with your emotions,” WHO Philippines said. “If you are overwhelmed, talk to a health worker or counselor. Have a plan, where to go to and how to seek help for physical and mental health needs if required,” it added. If one must stay at home, WHO advises to “maintain a healthy lifestyle – including proper diet, sleep, exercise and social contacts with loved ones at home and by email and phone with other family and friends.” “Draw on skills you have used in the past that might have helped you to manage previous life’s adversities and use those skills to help you manage emotions during the challenging time of this outbreak,” it also advised.

Department of Health (MANILA BULLETIN) “It’s premature. We’ve seen some initial trending, but it’s not consistent. We have to wait for more data to come in and to establish a trend that is more consistent– whether its plateauing or going down. Still, the situation remains fluid,” Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said. The World Health Organization (WHO) recently said that COVID-19 cases in China appear to be stabilizing. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that the number of cases “must be interpreted with extreme caution” as this “could still go in any direction.” The WHO reported that there are now 47,505 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases in China, including 1,381 deaths.
Meanwhile, Duque said the DOH is open to adopting a new method that would help in testing for COVID- 19 cases through chest imaging, which is now being used in China. “We will look into that development from the China medical care system that raised this. It’s very interesting, but I do not have the details of such but the concept seems to be very good,” he said. WHO Executive Director Dr. Michael Ryan said that in China’s Hubei province, “a trained medical professional can now classify a suspected case of COVID-19 as a clinically-confirmed case on the basis of chest imaging, rather than having to have a laboratory confirmation.” “This allows clinicians to move and report cases more quickly, not having to wait for lab confirmation, ensuring that people get to clinical care more quickly, and also allows public health responses in terms of contact tracing and other important public health measures to be initiated,” Ryan said in a press briefing in Geneva, Switzerland last Thursday (Feb. 13), which was streamed live on the organization’s official Twitter page.

A fanatical runner jogs the equivalent of an ultra-marathon inside his small apartment as people in virus-hit China desperately try to keep fit while cooped up indoors. (AFP / MANILA BULLETIN) The country is at the centre of an outbreak of a new coronavirus, leaving more than 1,500 dead and sparking global alarm, but it is also in the grip of a health drive because the government is aggressively encouraging people to exercise to fight the disease. With much of the 1.4 billion population ordered indoors and gyms closed, people are competing to outdo each other in how many bottles of water they can lift, how many push-ups they can do with their children on their backs or how many flights of stairs they can scale in their tower blocks. But Pan Shancu has easily won the unofficial gold medal, saying he jogged 66 kilometres (41 miles) in a loop at home in six hours, 41 minutes. He has the data tracker that he says proves it, and the 44-year-old’s feat and a video of him repeatedly circling furniture in his apartment went viral in China. “I felt a little dizzy at first, but you get used to it after you circle many times,” Pan told AFP by telephone from Hangzhou, near Shanghai. “Running is like an addiction. If you don’t run for a long time, you get itchy feet.” On another occasion Pan ran 30 kilometres on the spot in his bathroom and live-streamed it to inspire others who have similarly been confined at home for the last two weeks. “I am in an online chat group in which people are asking what we want to do most after the epidemic,” said Pan, a massage therapist and dedicated long-distance runner. “Some people said they want to have a feast. I said that I want to run 100 kilometres outside.” – Running the stairwells – China’s ruling Communist Party has launched a campaign featuring Olympic athletes to demonstrate how people can stay fit while spending endless days stuck inside. Tables, chairs and even door frames can all be used in one form or another to help exercise, according to one online pamphlet. Schools are shut and children are not exempt. They have been ordered by education authorities not to simply lounge about playing computer games and fiddling with their phones. “In addition to letting children help parents do some chores within their ability, they must get creative at home,” government expert Zhao Wenhua told a press conference. “For example, walking and running on the spot, skipping, push-ups, sit-ups and so on.” Some people have turned to technology, using apps on their smartphones that show how to work out without equipment and sharing the results with their friends. Bilibili, a popular video-sharing platform, says views of fitness-related content jumped nearly 50 percent in the period January 23 to February 5 compared to the two weeks before. Peter Gardner, a 61-year-old Briton hunkered down in the snow-covered northeast city of Tianjin, prefers more traditional methods. Like hundreds of millions of others, his movements have been severely restricted by the Chinese authorities in an attempt to stop the deadly virus spreading. Gardner, an operations manager for an American firm, said he is allowed out of his block of flats for only 30 minutes in the daytime to stock up on essentials. To make up for the lack of exercise, he twice runs up and down the emergency stairwell of his 17-floor apartment tower three times a day. “It’s good in some ways,” said Gardner, whose family have temporarily left China, leaving him with their two guinea pigs for company. “I can’t go out for beers and I’ve lost about three-quarters of a kilo,” he said by telephone. “There are no places to eat, nowhere to go and I’m eating simply, because I can’t buy the stuff I want.”   Tags: ncov"

A subway passenger wearing a protective facemask sleeps on a train in Shanghai on February 14, 2020. – Youan Hospital is one of twenty hospitals in Beijing treating coronavirus patients. (Photo by NOEL CELIS / AFP / file photo) The case came to public attention at a Honolulu news conference by Governor David Ige and senior state health officials, who said the man in question is believed to have become infected in Japan before embarking on his trip, or while en route to Hawaii. That assumption is based on the 14-day incubation period of the virus, and the fact that the man became symptomatic after less than a week in Hawaii, the state health officials said. The patient and his wife visited the island of Maui from Jan. 28 to Feb. 3, then traveled to Oahu, where they stayed until flying on Feb. 7 back to their home in the Aichi Prefecture of central Japan, the officials said. The man had exhibited no sign of illness until reaching Oahu, where he first developed cold-like respiratory symptoms but no fever, the state’s health direct, Dr Bruce Anderson, told reporters. Once back in Japan, he became more seriously ill and was tested for the coronavirus after going to a hospital, Anderson said. Hawaii officials were notified through the U.S Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Friday, and state authorities in turn alerted local health providers to be on the lookout for coronavirus-like illnesses. “We do believe that this is a serious concern, and I want to assure you that this scenario is exactly what we’ve been preparing for and are prepared for,” the governor said. The greatest immediate focus is to identify and track down individuals who had “prolonged, face-to-face contacts” with the Japanese man after he began showing symptoms on Oahu, said Dr Sarah Park, the state’s chief epidemiologist. Based on what is known about transmission of the disease, the patient was unlikely to have been contagious while on Maui because he was asymptomatic then, and anyone who had fleeting, incidental contact with him after he became ill, such as passing him in a hallway, would be considered at low risk, Park said. The man’s apparent lack of fever while in Hawaii also bodes well because infected individuals are believed to be most contagious when feverish, she said. The man’s precise travel itinerary remained unclear, except that he stayed at a Hilton Grand Vacations time-share condo in the Waikiki section of Honolulu, Anderson said, adding that he only sought medical care upon returning to Japan. State health officials said they were consulting Japanese authorities to get more details of his Hawaii visit. Hawaii, the U.S. Pacific island state closest to the origin of the coronavirus outbreak, has seen no infections documented on its soil, while the number of U.S. cases confirmed nationwide stands at 15, none fatal. Eight cases are in California. The worldwide total now exceeds 66,000 cases, with more than 1,500 deaths, most of them in China’s Hubei province, the epicenter of the outbreak. Beyond China, nearly 450 cases have been tallied in some 24 countries and territories, and three deaths. Japan is among the nations hardest, with 251 confirmed cases, most of them on a cruise liner quarantined in a port. Japan confirmed its first coronavirus death on Thursday. Tags: ncov"

(Pasay City Public Information Office / MANILA BULLETIN) Based on the Facebook account of the Pasay City Public Information Office (PIO), Mayor Emi Calixto-Rubiano the said information drive is part of the city government’s campaign to prevent the spread of the virus that has so far infected 45,171 people and killed over a thousand as per report of the World Health Organization (WHO). “Being a travel city where an average of 10,000 people arriving or departing daily in Pasay, we have to be very vigilant against this disease. The billboards are our reminders to travelers and the Filipino people in general to be careful and watch for possible dangers or difficulties,” Calixto-Rubiano said. Among the messages in the billboards – which also have translations in Chinese – are reminders for people to wash their hands thoroughly using soap and water, clean and cook their food well, and avoid people who have coughs, colds, and fever as well as wear face masks properly, if needed. It also posts a hotline number where people can call during emergencies. “These are friendly reminders to prevent the spread of this disease,” Calixto-Rubiano said. The PIO said that the billboard announcements can be seen in SM MOA, which has the biggest LED billboard in the Philippines, SM SMX, SM MOA MAAX, SM MOA Arena Media Mesh, Resorts World Manila, Resort World Manila Runway, Newport City, Double Dragon, and the Philippine International Convention Center. The SM MOA Arena Media Mesh is considered the “largest LED billboard in the Philippines”, thus, almost 300,000 mall-goers see the Public Service Announcement (PSA) of Calixto-Rubiano on weekdays while almost 500,000 people see it on weekends. At the PICC, which houses the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Professional Regulatory Commission (PRC) and Data Privacy Commission (DPC) has an average of 1,000 people seeing Pasay City Government’s anti-COVID 19 info materials every day, and more than 10,000 people see it when attending religious activities during Sundays, in addition to participants of corporate events held at the convention center every month. Likewise, Cable Link and Holdings Corporation (Cablelink) Vice President Mae Samaniego said that Cablelink has broadcasted the Information, Education and Communication (IEC) material of Pasay City Government on COVID 19 thru its Community Channel reaching its subscribers in Greater Metro Manila.

We all know that we were facing a crisis here in Diamond Princess due to NCoV but hey we still managed to smile, laugh and dance. For our Family and Friends to know that we were Ok here and We Will Stand Together As One until we finish the Quarantine.#Galley#TeamDiamondPrincess pic.twitter.com/0nqsPsOfhP — Mae Fantillo (@maejuliene18) February 14, 2020  Mae Fantillo took to Twitter to express how they were trying to find a glimmer of hope amid the ordeal that they were experiencing inside the cruise ship. The kitchen crew were seen in a video dancing to Bieber’s song “Yummy”, which was posted by Fantillo on her Twitter account. “We all know that we [are] facing a crisis here in Diamond Princess due to NCoV [or COVID-19] but hey we still managed to smile, laugh, and dance,” Fantillo wrote on her post. Inside the luxury cruise ship are over 2,600 passengers and 1,000 crew-members forced to be quarantined in their cabins after 10 people were initially confirmed for the deadly coronavirus last week. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), a total of 46,997 cases of COVID-19 have already been recorded around the globe as of Thursday, February 13. Of these, 174 cases were noted in Diamond Princess within the same period. However, a report from The Guardian said that the number of infected passengers and crew-members have already reached 218 as of Friday, February 14. The cruise ship has since been unable to dock and was stuck in isolation at the Daikoku Pier in Yokohama, per multiple reports. But Fantillo said she filmed the crew dancing to an upbeat song to let their families know that “we [are] okay here and we will stand together as one until we finish the quarantine.” The 14-day quarantine period for the passengers and crew of the Diamond Princess — which started on the day of the discovery of the infection among its passengers last February 5 — is already on its last leg as they are set to finish it on February 19. “Five more days brothers and sisters,” Fantillo said in her post. The video of the Diamond Princess’ dancing crew earned the admiration and support not only of Japanese social media users but also of other nationalities. As of 4 a.m. Saturday, the video was already viewed at least 39,900 times, and garnered 1,773 likes with 602 retweets. Tags: ncov"

Colonel Dennis Estrella, Wing Commander of the TOW EastMin, said a troop information and education seminar was conducted to educate the personnel on the nature of the coronavirus, and its impact around the world. Tarpaulins and signages reminding the personnel of the symptoms and the do’s and don’ts to prevent the personnel from acquiring the virus were also placed in strategic areas inside their base camp at the Davao Air Station in Sasa, Davao City. The unit also attended a discussion which tackled safety measures and best practices for passengers during commercial flights that was spearheaded by visiting personnel from the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP). As such, the said practices were adopted by the Davao region’s Tactical Operations Group (TOG-11) in the security screening of all passengers boarding military aircrafts. “All visitors coming from outside the base [will be] subjected for body temperature screening as a standard operating procedure for the base security,” Estrella said. Military pilots arriving at the base will also be subjected to body temperature screening to ensure that they free from COVID-19, he added. An isolation area inside the base camp was established for people suspected to have acquired the COVID-19, especially those showing symptoms such as colds or flu. Estrella vowed that the TOW EastMin will “always support the government’s effort to ensure the safety and security of the citizenry.” (Martin A. Sadongdong) Tags: ncov"

Convocar told Manila Bulletin Friday that the results came back from DOH’s Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) in Metro Manila. Of the 29 PUIs, the most number were recorded in Aklan province with nine.  This was largely due to several Chinese tourists who were earlier quarantine after entering the country via Kalibo Airport as they were supposed to go on vacation in Boracay Island. Aklan is followed by Iloilo province with seven PUIs. Three PUIs were recorded each in Negros Occidental province, Bacolod City and Iloilo City. The provinces of Antique and Capiz had two PUIs each, but Convocar said that Capiz had three more PUIs who were admitted to hospitals. “Swab samples from the three new PUIs in Capiz were taken and sent to RITM,” Convocar added.

 After grueling shifts treating coronavirus patients, Hong Kong doctor Alfred Wong often finds himself alone in a hotel room eating takeaway, battling the pain of being separated from his pregnant wife.  Alfred Wong works on the isolation ward at a Hong Kong hospital treating possible coronavirus patients and is desperate to avoid infecting his pregnant wife. (AFP / MANILA BULLETIN) The 38-year-old volunteered to join staff on isolation wards — dubbed “the dirty team” — to avoid the risk of being called up later and missing his daughter’s birth in two months’ time. While he is on the team, he has decided to keep contact with loved ones down to a minimum. “All I can do now is to try my best to protect myself and stay away from everyone — my family and my friends,” he told AFP. Since joining the team in early February, Wong has stayed at a hotel within walking distance of his hospital and shaved his hair into crew-cut, a way to reduce gaps in protective clothing. Sometimes he picks up homemade box meals that his wife leaves on the doorstep of their home. “The best gift I can give is perhaps a living husband,” Wong joked wryly, rubbing hands that had become itchy from being washed so regularly. Wong and his wife are hoping to find a quiet restaurant and sit at different tables within the eyesight of one another as their Valentines’ meal. Hundreds of doctors and nurses like Wong are going through similar family separations as they battle a virus that has killed nearly 1,400 people in mainland China. In Hong Kong, 53 people have so far been diagnosed, one of whom died. While the numbers are low, the outbreak has still put a huge strain on the over-crowded hospitals in a densely packed city of seven million. Around 60 percent of isolation wards in public hospitals are occupied with confirmed or suspected cases. Wong and 14 fellow doctors currently have two confirmed cases on their ward but they are also monitoring 40 suspected cases. All must be treated as if they are carriers. “We have to visit each patient twice a day and have three clinical meetings among our team to discuss the patients’ progress because this is a new virus,” he said. A major source of mental pressure has been safety equipment like masks, face visors, gloves and gowns which are running low. City authorities have admitted mask stocks for medical staff are only good for another month and they are seeking new imports — despite a global shortage. But medical associations have warned those stocks could run out much sooner at the current rate of use. Hong Kong’s pro-Beijing leaders have come under fire from within the medical sector over their inability to stockpile enough masks — and accusations they were slow to limit arrivals from the Chinese mainland. Thousands of medics went on strike earlier this month calling for the border to be closed. Wong said he did not take part but supported the industrial action. He said the government should have been better prepared given the current outbreak was “just history repeating itself”. In 2003, 299 people were killed when a Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak swept through Hong Kong. Eight medical staff died, including a young doctor at Wong’s hospital. Wong, a medical student during SARS, said he didn’t yet know whether he would have any regrets about volunteering. “Someone has to do the job and we are the people who have been trained to do the job,” he said.

Health workers wearing protective gear take part in an exercise in handling a suspected patient at Sanglah hospital in Denpasar, Indonesia’s resort island of Bali, on February 12, 2020.  (Photo by SONNY TUMBELAKA / AFP / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN) The figure comes a week after public anger erupted over the death of a whistleblowing doctor who had been reprimanded and silenced by police after raising the alarm about the virus in December. Zeng Yixin, vice minister at the National Health Commission, said at a news conference that 1,716 health workers have been infected in the country as of Tuesday. The majority, 1,102, have been diagnosed with the COVID-19 illness in Wuhan, the central city at the epicenter of the crisis, Zeng said. Another 400 were infected in other places in Hubei province. Chinese authorities have scrambled to deploy protective equipment to Wuhan’s hospitals, where doctors and nurses have been overwhelmed by an ever-growing number of patients. Many doctors in Wuhan have had to see patients without proper masks or protective body suits, resorting to reusing the same equipment when they should be changed regularly. One doctor at a community clinic in Wuhan told AFP he and at least 16 other colleagues were showing symptoms similar to the new virus, including lung infections and coughing. The risks medical staff are facing was highlighted on February 7 when Li Wenliang, the whistleblowing doctor, succumbed to the disease in Wuhan. His death unleashed an outpouring of grief and anger on Chinese social media, with 10 academics in Wuhan circulating an open letter calling for political reform and freedom of speech. Tags: ncov"

Visayas,By Tara Yap,"By Tara Yap ILOILO CITY – There is a need for barangay officials to have stronger monitoring against the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) in the Western Visayas region. Assistant Secretary Gerard Gonzales of the Office of the Presidential Assistant for the Visayas (OPAV), and Regional Director Marlyn Convocar of the Department of Health (DOH-6) jointly made this appeal. This was after DOH officials found that only Antique, Guimaras and Iloilo province, as well as the regional capital of Iloilo City, have created Barangay Health Emergency Response Teams (BHERTS), which was mandated by the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) to stop the spread of COVID-19. Gonzales urged officials in Aklan, Capiz and Negros Occidental provinces to complete the establishment of BHERTs. He particularly mentioned the low-compliance of Bacolod City in Negros Occidental, which only has 17 BHERTs when there are 61 barangays. The BHERTS are supposed to track residents who have recently returned from abroad, especially from areas where there are positive COVID-19 cases. Meanwhile, DOH-6 reported there were 29 people who were classified as patients under investigation (PUIs). “Western Visayas region still does not have a positive case of COVID-19,” Convocar reiterated.

These patients were previously considered PUIs after they exhibited flu-like symptoms, following their travel to affected countries with confirmed cases of Covid. Dr. Grace Tan, spokesperson of the task force, said on Thursday that all PUIs were allowed to go home after they were tested negative for COVID-19, based on the results of the swab tests submitted to the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM). She, however, said that there were still five persons under monitoring (PUMs) here due to their travel history. Tan said the five PUMs, who are Bacolod residents, were not isolated in a hospital but were advised to go on home quarantine. Tan said the Barangay Health Emergency Rescue Team was tasked to monitor the medical condition of the PUMs. Mayor Evelio Leonardia, in a press briefing at the Bacolod City Government Center on that day, said that Bacolod remains COVID-19-free. “We’re happy about it but this is not a cause to celebrate yet because this is an ongoing phenomenon worldwide,” he said. The mayor said they cannot just put their guard down with the recent development, but should continue their measures with the same intensity. He urged the people to be vigilant and should not be complacent. Meanwhile, Vice Mayor El Cid Familiaran, chairman of the task force, said that they passed three resolutions as part of their preventive measures among travelers. Familiaran said that they requested all airlines to have passenger manifest of all travelers with connecting flights to COVID-19-affected countries and other countries. “This is not just for the foreigners, but all travelers,” he stressed. He said that they also requested from hotels, inns, and pension houses, as well as similar establishments, to give health declaration cards to their guests especially travelers with history travel in the past 14 days. He said they are implementing these measures to detect as early as possible persons who may have flu-like symptoms, or other infections and diseases. Tags: ncov"

Sen. Joel Villanueva(Senate of the Philippines / MANILA BULLETIN FILE PHOTO) Villanueva questioned the inclusion of Taiwan in the prohibition of flights coming from China and its special administrative regions Hong Kong and Macau, hitting the government’s adherence to the “One China” policy. “Why include Taiwan in the travel ban when it only has 18 confirmed cases? To include it because of One China Policy is wrong,” the senator said in a tweet Thursday night, February 13. “[The] Ban should apply to the source or to locations with high incidence of infection,” Villanueva added, further writing, “#PolicyThatMakesSensePls”. The sudden expansion of the travel restriction affected hundreds of travelers, including overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) who were scheduled to leave for Taiwan, as authorities said there shall be no exemptions. The Department of Health earlier announced that Taiwan was covered by the travel ban, saying it was in accordance to the World Health Organization’s (WHO) classification and the One China policy that the Philippines recognizes. Taiwan opposed this move and asserted its sovereignty and independence from China. It was reported to be considering retaliatory measures should the Philippines fail to “immediately correct” its latest directive. Dr. Tony Leachon, a preventive health education and health reform advocate, also objected to the inclusion of Taiwan in the travel ban. “Taiwan, with its 18 virus cases compared with some 60,000 in China, it is unfair for the WHO to lump them together with China and mislead other countries into believing Taiwan faces an equally dire epidemic. It doesn’t make sense,” Leachon said on Twitter, agreeing with Villanueva.

The Diamond Princess has been in quarantine since arriving off the Japanese coast early last week (AFP / MANILA BULLETIN) Currently moored in the Port of Yokohama, the Diamond Princess has more than 3,500 passengers and crewmembers onboard. Eleven of those who tested positive for COVID-19 are Filipino crewmembers that are now undergoing treatment in various hospitals in and around Tokyo. “Regarding the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which is currently quarantined in Yokohama, 218 passengers have tested positive for the virus, which does represent the largest cluster of COVID-19 cases outside China,” said Dr. Michael Ryan, Executive Director of WHO Health Emergencies Programme at a media briefing in Geneva. Outside the cases on the Diamond Princess, Dr. Ryan said they are not seeing a dramatic increase in transmission outside China as the number of countries reporting COVID-19 cases has still not changed as of yesterday, February 13. Also on Thursday, the Japanese health ministry reported that 44 more people on board the cruise ship have tested positive for the virus. The DFA said no Filipinos were among the new group of 44 individuals who tested positive for the virus. Over the next few days, the Diamond Princess, in coordination with the Japanese health authorities, is planning to implement voluntary disembarkation of guests to complete their quarantine period at a shoreside facility. According to the Diamond Princess’ website, the disembarkation plan will be a “phased approach” with the most medically vulnerable guests, including elder adults with pre-existing health conditions, will be prioritized.

Hubei province in central China has been struggling to contain a virus outbreak (AFP/ MANILA BULLETIN FILE PHOTO) “We are a little disappointed that we haven’t been invited in and we’re a little disappointed in the lack of transparency coming from the Chinese,” Larry Kudlow, the director of the National Economic Council, told reporters. Trump on Thursday again praised his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping for his government’s response to the outbreak, which has officially killed 1,367 people and infected nearly 60,000 since December. But Kudlow said that unanswered questions were mounting and there was no sign of the promised cooperation. “President Xi assured President Trump that China was on it and there would be openness, they would accept our help,” he added. “We’re more than willing to work with the UN (and) WHO on this and they won’t let us. I don’t know what their motives are. I do know that apparently more and more people are suffering over there.” “Is the Politburo really being honest with us?” he asked, referring to communist China’s top leadership body. An international mission led by the World Health Organization is expected to arrive in China over the weekend. China had been praised by the WHO for its handling of the outbreak, in contrast to the way it concealed the extent of the deadly SARS virusepidemic in 2002-2003. But the government has faced continued skepticism among the global public. Criticism intensified after the death of a doctor who had tried to raise the alarm about the outbreak in December but was silenced by authorities. Trump told the Geraldo Rivera “Roadkill” radio program that he has confidence in Beijing and understood officials’ reluctance to provide information. “I think they want to put the best face on it,” he said. “You wouldn’t want to run out to the world, and go crazy and start saying whatever it is, because you don’t want to create a panic.” “I think they’ve handled it professionally and I think they’re extremely capable and I think President Xi is extremely capable,” he said. Contrary to Kudlow’s description of Beijing’s not allowing access, Trump said: “We’re working with them. We’re sending a lot of people.” Trump also repeated his belief that seasonally warmer weather in April could spell the end of the virus, a prognosis at odds with top US health officials who caution against commenting on the epidemic’s trajectory. “The April date is very, very important because if that’s the case, if the heat does in fact kill, that’s when it starts getting hot and this virus reacts very poorly to heat and dies,” Trump said. Kudlow predicted that the economic impact would be “quite minimal” for the United States, but said that fears over the coronavirus were creating “uncertainty.” “If we don’t get good information out of China, it’s very hard for us to make a decent assessment,” he said. Beijing’s United Nations Ambassador Zhang Jun told the UN Commission for Social Development on Wednesday that China has “always adopted an open, transparent and highly responsible attitude” towards the epidemic. “We have reported the epidemic information to the WHO, the relevant countries, and Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan regions as soon as it is available, shared the genetic sequences of the virus, actively communicated with other countries in order to come up with responses,” he said.   Tags: ncov"

WHO Representative to the Philippines Dr. Rabindra Abeyasinghe (WHO) “There are many theories being put forward and views of experts being shared but from WHO’s perspective, none of these has been established in an evidence-based fashion,” said WHO Country Representative Dr. Rabindra Abeyasinghe. Abeyasinghe added that there is also no scientific proof on reports that the incubation period for Covid-19 could range up to 24 days. Health experts previously said that the incubation period for the said disease is from 10 to 14 days. “It is clear that the vast majority of patients still gets infected or has an incubation period of 12 and half days. That’s the WHO estimate. That’s why we advocate a quarantine period of 14 days,” said the WHO official. Previously, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that there are still questions that need to be answered regarding the Covid-19. “There is still a lot we don’t know. We don’t know the source of the outbreak, we don’t know what its natural reservoir is, and we don’t properly understand its transmissibility or severity. To defeat this outbreak, we need answers to all those questions,” said Ghebreyesus. Read more: Pangolin identified as potential link for coronavirus spread Tags: ncov"

File picture of the facade of the Grand Hyatt hotel in Singapore February 5, 2020. (REUTERS/Tim Chong/FILE PHOTO/MANILA BULLETIN) But the January sales meeting in a luxury Singapore hotel was far from auspicious. Someone seated in the room, or in the vicinity of the hotel that is renowned for its central location and a racy nightclub in the basement, was about to take coronavirus global. Three weeks later, global health authorities are still scrambling to work out who carried the disease into the mundane meeting of a firm selling gas meters, which then spread to five countries from South Korea to Spain, infecting over a dozen people. Experts say finding this so-called “patient zero” is critical for tracing all those potentially exposed to infection and containing the outbreak, but as time passes, the harder it becomes. “We do feel uncomfortable obviously when we diagnose a patient with the illness and we can’t work out where it came from…the containment activities are less effective,” said Dale Fisher, chair of the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network coordinated by the World Health Organisation. Authorities initially hinted at Chinese delegates, which included someone from Wuhan – the Chinese city at the epicentre of the virus that has killed over 1,350 people. But a Servomex spokesperson told Reuters its Chinese delegates had not tested positive. Fisher and other experts have compared the Singapore meeting to another so-called “super-spreading” incident at a Hong Kong hotel in 2003 where a sick Chinese doctor spread Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome around the world. The WHO has opened an investigation into the Singapore incident, but said its “way too early” to tell if it is a super-spreading event. SCARY AND SOBERING It was more than a week after the meeting – which according to a company e-mail included Servomex’s leadership team and global sales staff – that the first case surfaced in Malaysia. The incubation period for the disease is up to 14 days and people may be able to infect others before symptoms appear. The firm said it immediately adopted “extensive measures” to contain the virus and protect employees and the wider community. Those included self-isolation for all 109 attendees, of whom 94 were from overseas and had left Singapore. But the virus kept spreading. Two South Korean delegates fell sick after sharing a buffet meal with the Malaysian, who also passed the infection to his sister and mother-in-law. Three of the firm’s Singapore attendees also tested positive. Then cases started appearing in Europe. An infected British delegate had headed from the conference to a French ski resort, where another five people fell ill. Another linked case then emerged in Spain, and when the Briton returned to his home town in the south of England the virus spread further. “It feels really scary that one minute it’s a story in China… and then the next minute it is literally on our doorstep,” said Natalie Brown, whose children went to the same school as the British carrier. The school said in a letter that two people at the school had been isolated. “It’s scary and sobering how quickly it seems to have spread,” said Brown. TIME RUNNING OUT Back in Singapore, authorities were battling to keep track of new cases of local transmissions, many unlinked to previous cases. Management at the hotel – the Grand Hyatt Singapore – said they had cleaned extensively and were monitoring staff and guests for infection but did not know “how, where or when” conference attendees were infected. The lion dancers, who posted photos of the event on Facebook, said they were virus free. “Everyone assumes it was a delegate but it could have been a cleaner, it could have been a waiter,” said Paul Tambyah, an infectious diseases expert at National University Singapore. He added it was “very important” to find “patient zero” to establish other possible “chains of transmission”. But time may be running out. Singapore health ministry’s Kenneth Mak said the government will continue to try and identify the initial carrier until the outbreak ends, but as days pass it will get harder. “We might never be able to tell who that first patient is,” Mak said. Meanwhile, the fallout from the conference continues to sow trepidation weeks after the event and thousands of miles away. Reuters visited Servomex’s offices in the suburbs of South Korea’s capital, Seoul. It was closed and dark inside, and a building guard told Reuters employees were working from home. A notice posted by building management stated a coronavirus patient had entered the complex, while several young women could be overheard in a nearby elevator discussing whether it had been used by the infected person. “Do you think the patient would have gotten on this elevator or the other one?” one said.

Anung Sugihantono, at Indonesia’s health ministry, told Reuters authorities were checking hotels and other destinations where the tourist might have gone, but nobody in Bali had yet been found with symptoms of the coronavirus. Another ministry official, Achmad Yurianto, told reporters the tourist was probably infected on public transport in China upon return. In a statement on microblogging site Weibo, official media in China’s Anhui province said the tourist, identified only as Jin, traveled from Wuhan city – where the epidemic originated – to Bali on Jan. 22 and returned to China on Jan. 28. Bali is Indonesia’s main tourism gateway and has already seen 20,000 cancellations, according to Indonesia’s hotels and restaurants association. The Anhui media said the tourist flew on a plane operated by Indonesia’s Lion Air from Wuhan and returned via a Garuda Indonesia (GIAA.JK) flight to Shanghai. Lion Air spokesman Danang Mandala Prihantoro said in a statement the airline had concluded that passengers and crew on board the plane taken by the tourist were free of the virus. Garuda Indonesia spokesman Ikhsan Rosan said in a statement the carrier had grounded and disinfected its plane. The virus has killed 1,350 people, all but two in China.

PPEs include disposable face masks, gowns, and gloves, among other items. “As of now, we still have enough supply of personal protective equipment (PPE) for our health workers. It’s good for another one to two months,” the health official said. “We can still do with it, but we really need to purchase more already.” Recently, World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the demand and prices of PPEs globally have already soared due to COVID-19. “The world is facing severe disruption in the market for personal protective equipment. The demand is 200 times [more] than normal and prices are up to 20 times higher,” Ghebreyesus said. “This situation has been exacerbated by widespread, inappropriate use of PPEs outside patient care. As a result, there are now depleted stockpiles and backlogs of four to six months. Global stocks of masks and respirators are now insufficient to meet the needs of WHO and our partners,” he added. Health Secretary Francisco Duque III previously released an advisory stating that people who are in good health condition do not need to use face masks. Moreover, the N95 mask must be reserved for healthcare and other frontline workers who are attending to patients with respiratory infections or patients under investigation (PUIs) for COVID-19. “The public is enjoined to judiciously use masks to prevent the shortage of surgical masks and N95 masks,” Duque said.

(RITM / MANILA BULLETIN) The infectious disease expert served as a resource speaker during Wednesday’s joint hearing by the House Committees on Economic Affairs and on Tourism discussing the economic impact of the virus outbreak. “We have enough kits, in fact we are expecting another 1,500 kits coming from WHO (World Health Organization),” Ditangco told Iloilo 4th district Rep. Braeden John Biron, who asked about the availability of the test kits. “We have 1,500 [test kits] in our institution (RITM). That’s more than enough with the current PUIs (persons under investigation),” she said. The fresh shipment of kits from the WHO will arrive in the coming days, she added. This will bring to 3,000 the total of test kits on standby. Biron wondered why the test kits haven’t been distributed to the different airports of the country despite its supposed abundance. According to him, this would facilitate more tourist visits to the country amid the persisting COVID-19 scare. “The kits require a special laboratory. That’s why we have to develop or reinforce the sub-national laboratories. These sub-national laboratories in fact are capable of doing this,” Ditangco said. “We just need to strengthen them again because it’s been a while since they performed these tests for an outbreak,” she noted. Ditangco clarified before the solons that as a rule, persons undergoing the 14-day quarantine period aren’t tested. “We only test people who are symptomatic and these are the PUIs. So we have to determine whether they have the disease or not by doing the test.” Likewise, people under monitoring or PUMs are not tested. “They are observed for appearance of signs and symptoms.” “It should be within 14 days. If it’s past 14 days, you did not develop symptoms, it means you did not acquire the illness,” the DOH expert explained. For his part, Muntinlupa lone district Rep.

For nearly two weeks, the business consultant from the US state of Georgia has been at sea on board the MS Westerdam, a ship of healthy passengers which has been turned away by Japan, Taiwan, Guam, and the Philippines over fears that someone on the cruise may have the coronavirus.  Passengers relax on board the Holland America-operated Westerdam cruise ship, which has been denied permission to dock in Thailand over coronavirus fears, February 12, 2020. (Maria Angus/Handout via REUTERS/MANILA BULLETIN) The latest country to shun the ship, which has 1,455 passengers and 802 crew on board, is Thailand, where the health minister has publicly refused to grant the Westerdam permission to dock. “We try to stay hopeful, because that’s all we’ve got: to be hopeful. But each day, that becomes a little bit more difficult when country after country rejects us,” Jones told Reuters in a video recording. Like many on board, Jones had embarked in Hong Kong for a much-anticipated cruise through the region in early February. It was scheduled to be a two-week cruise, but with that period running out this week, there are worries about fuel and food supplies. Many on board are elderly and could be running out of medicines. “We are hoping that just any country will see us as … many human beings from many countries around the world that literally are at your mercy to let us go home,” said Jones. To kill time on board and break up the monotony of endless ocean scrolling past cabin windows, the ship’s crew have organized dozens of activities to keep people occupied, tourists on board the vessel told Reuters. People could be seen playing chess and doing puzzles on Wednesday, in some of the first pictures published by media of life aboard the ship as passengers pass the time awaiting news of how and when they might get home. Other activities on offer include colouring-in for adults; teeth whitening; poker tournaments; whisky tasting; even a lecture on modern China which delved into the economics of collective farming, according to passengers on board and a copy of the ship’s activity program seen by Reuters. “The staff has tried to bolster spirits but you can only play so many games of trivia,” said Jones. “I’ve asked others who say they are napping a lot”. BANGKOK DOCK BLOCK Passengers on board the ship have been subjected to regular health checks, according to ship operator Holland America, a unit of Miami-based Carnival Corp (CCL.N). There have been no reported cases of the coronavirus on board. Stoking fears is the ongoing quarantine in Japan of the Diamond Princess cruise ship, also managed by a unit of Carnival Corp. A total of 175 out of the 3,700 people on board the Diamond Princess have tested positive for the coronavirus. “We are isolated, we have been isolated for two weeks and so we would probably be the best bet as far as no (infections),” Jones said. Still, that does not appear to have been enough to convince Thai officials to allow the ship to dock in Bangkok, although the World Health Organization and the Southeast Asian country’s deputy transport minister has indicated that Thai health authorities could board the ship to conduct health checks and replenish the vessel with supplies. By noon on Wednesday, the Westerdam was 280 kilometers (175 miles) from the Thai coast and on a heading for Bangkok, according to data published by the Marine Traffic ship tracking website. It was still not clear if the ship would be allowed to dock there. Later on Wednesday, the Thai Navy “Bhumibol Adulyadej” warship could be seen escorting the Westerdam in waters just off the Thai coast, according to passengers and Marine Traffic. 20-year-old Maria Angus, a fashion student from New Zealand traveling on the cruise with her parents, said the ship’s captain notified passengers on Wednesday morning that they were seeking help from other countries. “The highest level of several governments including the United States, Canada, Britain and the Netherlands are closely following the Westerdam’s situation and these governments are interacting with Thai authorities and the World Health Organization to ensure all of our needs are met,” said Angus, citing the ship’s captain, Vincent Smit. The US Embassy in Bangkok said they were closely monitoring the situation. “The State Department is working with the ship’s operator and governments in the region who might be able to assist,” spokeswoman Jillian Bonnardeaux told Reuters. Despite Bangkok’s reluctance to grant docking permission, crew members staged a farewell ceremony for passengers on Wednesday morning, singing to the tune of the 1979 hit “We Are Family” by Sister Sledge. Elsewhere on board, the patience of some passengers was beginning to be tested, Jones said, as some people pushed and shoved for access to one of the ship’s only available computers and printers, to re-book flights home. “Hard to imagine these senior cruisers coming to blows but guess that happened,” said Jones. “It’s funny and sad at the same time”.

Overseas Workers Welfare Administration (MANILA BULLETIN) OWWA Administrator Hans Leo Cacdac said the labor department was coordinating to clear the process in distributing the P10,000 grant of financial assistance to the stranded workers. “Kung maisaayos po ang prosesong ito ay malamang po, this week ay makakapagdistribute na rin tayo ng financial assistance.” Cacdac said in radio channel DZMM. (If we can fix the process this week, we can probably distribute financial assistance.) Cacdac said the authorities will talk to the employers of the stranded OFWs who fear of losing their jobs to explain the situation. “Ang ating Philippine Overseas Labor Office ay makikipag-usap din muna sa mga employers para maipaliwanag ang sitwasyon. Ang payo ko ‘wag muna mag-isip ng extreme scenarios dahil meron pa namang pag-uusap na mangyayari,” he said. (POEA is talking to the employers to explain the situation. My advice is to avoid thinking extreme scenarios because there will still be talks.) POEA confirmed on Tuesday that OFWs going to Taiwan will not be allowed to leave the country as they are covered by the temporary travel ban imposed due to the threat of the COVID-19. POEA Administrator Bernard Olalia said that POEA will also temporarily suspend the processing of Overseas Employment Certificate (OECs) of OFWs to Taiwan. The POEA has already directed agencies to inform employers of OFWs who are scheduled to leave that there will be a delay in their travel because of the travel ban. Those scheduled to leave for Taiwan were allowed to do so prior to DOH’s formal announcement.

,"February 12, 2020, 4:34 PM",nCov,How coronavirus spreads outside China,By Agence France-Presse ,"By Agence France-Presse  For WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the key question in the battle against the novel coronavirus is how quickly it is spreading beyond China.  Pedestrians wear face masks, as a preventative measure against the COVID-19 coronavirus, as they walk on a footbridge in Hong Kong on February 12, 2020. – The virus, officially named COVID-19, has spooked markets around the world, having killed more than 1,100 people and infected tens of thousands since it emerged in central China at the end of last year. (Photo by Anthony WALLACE / AFP / MANILA BULLETIN) “The detection of a small number of cases may indicate more widespread transmission in other countries; in short, we may only be seeing the tip of the iceberg,” he warned in a recent tweet. Here are some of the key issues: How the virus transmits  It is a respiratory virus, spreading through contact with an infected person: their coughs, sneezes or droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose. Scientists think a person needs to be within a meter of an infected person to risk catching it. Health officials stress basic precautionary measures: washing hands frequently, covering up coughing or sneezing. And if you are infected, wear a mask to protect others. Diarrhea may be a secondary mode of transmission, according to one team of researchers. And Chinese scientists writing in the New England Journal of Medicine suggested every person infected would, on average, infect another 2.2 individuals. That is a higher rate than winter flu (1.3), lower than an infectious disease such as measles (more than 12) and comparable to SARS (3) — the last major virus that broke out in China, in 2002-03. When it becomes contagious  Scientists initially thought the virus became contagious several days after symptoms started to appear, as happened with SARS, Arnaud Fontanet of the Institut Pasteur told AFP. They now think it could be infectious earlier than that. “Today, everybody agrees that the contagious period starts as soon as symptoms appear,” said Fontanet, a specialist in tracking emerging diseases. There had even been a few cases of transmission from people who showed no symptoms, he added. One reason these cases are rare is that coughing is a major means of transmission — and a symptomless carrier does not cough. Even so, transmission by symptomless carriers makes it harder to contain the virus because they are harder to spot. Spread outside China  The concern expressed by Ghebreyesus about the spread of the virus beyond China came as news broke of a British national infected in Singapore. He went on to infect several other Britons during a stay at a French Alpine ski resort, before finally being diagnosed back home in England. By then, he had infected at least 11 people, including a nine-year-old child. “What is concerning is the source of these infections, which appears to have been a conference in Singapore attended by some participants from China,” said Nathalie MacDermott of Imperial College London. Some of the 90 other people there might also have taken the virus back to their home countries, said MacDermott, a specialist in pediatric infectious diseases. Every time health officials identify an infected person, they have to track down those they might have infected to ensure they, in turn, are not passing it on, she said. She and other experts are already worried about “the potential for this epidemic to develop into a pandemic.” Catching it in hospital  On Friday, Chinese researchers published a study of 138 coronavirus patients at a hospital in Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak. In their paper, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, they noted that more than 40 percent of these patients — 57 — caught it in hospital. Seventeen were already in hospital for other reasons and the other 40 were health professionals. This was already a problem during the outbreak of SARS and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS), two other deadly outbreaks featuring different types of coronavirus. That makes treating patients not infected all the more difficult, said Fontanet. Ridding a hospital of coronavirus when it has this kind of transmission is “extremely difficult,” he added. Overworked, unprotected Doctors on the frontline of China’s new coronavirus epidemic are facing a daunting task: treat an ever-growing number of infected patients and risk getting infected themselves due to a drastic shortage of masks and other protective equipment. Tired and understaffed, medical workers have had to deal with thousands of new cases per week in Wuhan. Many doctors have had to see patients without proper masks or protective body suits, resorting to reusing the same equipment when they should be changed regularly. Some have even worn diapers to avoid having to take off the equipment and make it last longer, according to a health official. One doctor at a community clinic in Wuhan said he and at least 16 other colleagues were showing symptoms similar to the new virus, including lung infections and coughing. “As doctors, we do not want to work while being a source of infection,” he told AFP, requesting anonymity for fear of reprisals. But “right now, there is no one to replace you,” the doctor explained, adding that all medical staff without a fever are expected to work. “What would happen if there was no one working on the frontline?” Some 44 percent of the 42,600 cases nationwide — and the majority of more than 1,100 deaths — have been in Wuhan, home to a wild animal market where the virus is suspected of having originated before spreading between humans. The risks medical staff are facing was highlighted on Friday after Li Wenliang, a whistleblowing doctor in Wuhan, succumbed to the disease more than a month after he first raised alarm about a new SARS-like virus in the city. His death unleashed an outpouring of grief and anger on Chinese social media, with 10 academics in Wuhan circulating an open letter calling for political reform and freedom of speech. Mask deficit The deputy mayor of Wuhan said the city is facing a daily shortage of 56,000 N95 masks and 41,000 protective suits. Medical staff in protective suits will “wear diapers, reduce how much water they drink, and reduce how many times they use the bathroom,” said Jiao Yahui, a top official at China’s National Health Commission. Some of them will wear the same protective suit for six or even nine hours, when they should not be worn for more than four hours in a quarantined ward, she said last week. “Of course, we don’t advocate this method, but medical staff really have no alternative,” she admitted. The Chinese government has responded by mobilizing the entire country to increase the production of masks and suits.  China has also imported more than 300 million masks and about 3.9 million articles of protective clothing since January 24, an official said last week. The Red Cross Society of China too has received over 900 million yuan ($129 million) in donations for epidemic relief — though it has drawn scrutiny for its lack of transparency and efficiency. “Even if we receive more masks, the number of patients increases even faster,” said a doctor at a major Wuhan hospital, who requested anonymity because she was not authorized to speak with media. “The consumption of masks in the hospital is enormous,” she emphasized. “They have a permanent lack of masks.” Calls for help  Handling the daily deluge of new cases takes another kind of toll too, said the doctor at the large hospital in Wuhan, whose colleagues are handling confirmed cases of virus patients. “They are exhausted,” she told AFP. One of her colleagues, for instance, works at a clinic that receives 400 patients within eight hours. Many are dealing with patients “who die very quickly, whom they have not managed to save,” she said. “They have a lot of pressure,” the doctor said, adding that her hospital had set up psychological monitoring. Many Wuhan residents are worried, too, said the doctor at the community clinic. He and his colleagues receive calls from distressed community members, he said — some of whom are too afraid to leave their homes. “You can hear their calls for help, but your hands are tied,” the doctor said, describing families where patients are stuck at home without medical treatment. “There’s nothing we can do.” READ MORE: Coronavirus cases fall, experts disagree over whether peak is near   Tags: ncov"

Department of Education (MANILA BULLETIN) DepEd Undersecretary for Administration Alain Pascua visited Don Alejandro Roces Sr. Science-Technology High School in Quezon City and delivered a message about DepEd’s response to COVID-19. In particular, Pascua noted that school events which involve learners, such as the Junior and Senior Promenade or “JS Prom” are allowed as long as they take place inside school premises. “Kapag sa loob ng school gaganapin ang JS prom, tuloy siya, [pero] kapag sa hotel o ibang lugar na pinupuntahan ng iba pang maraming tao, highly discouraged ‘yan, baka masuspindi ‘yan depende kay principal at sa mga magulang,” he said. (If the JS prom will be held inside the school, it may proceed, but if it will be held in a hotel or other place where many people gather, it is highly discouraged, and the event may be suspended depending on the decision of the principal and the parents). Pascua noted that if the school decides to push through with scheduled events and activities such as the JS Prom, its officials have to ensure that protocols on COVID-19 are in place and health measures are observed. “Kung tuloy ‘yan, ‘yung mga may lagnat, ubo, sipon, etc. ay ‘wag munang sumali (If it pushes through, those [students] with fever, cough, colds and other illnesses should not participate),” he said. DepEd earlier ordered the suspension of activities involving all learners and teachers, particularly the national and regional activities scheduled this month. Among these suspended national activities were the National Science and Technology Fair (NSTF), the National Festival of Talents (NFOT), and the National Schools Press Conference (NSPC). Off-campus activities such as educational tours and field trips were also suspended until further notice. DepEd also directed its officials and personnel to refrain from traveling to countries with confirmed cases of COVID-19. Meanwhile, Pascua also consoled the participants of the canceled events such as the NFOT, NSPC, and NSTF, who might be disappointed. He told future journalists, theatre actors, artists, singers, dancers, scientists, inventors, and innovators that when DepEd decided to suspend such national activities, it was to prioritize the safety of its learners. “Asahan ninyo na prayoridad ng DepEd hindi lamang ang inyong kaligtasan, kundi ang inyong patuloy na pag-unlad at pag-aaral (Bear in mind that the priority of DepEd is not only your safety, but your overall growth and studies),” Pascua said. To help increase learners’ awareness on how to fight COVID-19, Pascua conducted a lecture on proper hygiene and sanitation practices such as regular handwashing, among others. Pascua also informed the learners of the recent policies and actions taken by DepEd not just in combating possible spread of COVID-19, but also on dealing with other health concerns, emergencies, and disasters that confront students and teachers.   Tags: ncov"

DepEd Undersecretary for Administration Alain Pascua, in a statement, gave the assurance that the department remains steadfast in its efforts to reduce the exposure to risks associated with COVID-19, formerly called 2019-nCoV (novel coronavirus) acute respiratory disease.  Education Undersecretary Alain Del Pascua(Alain Del Pascua official Facebook page / MANILA BULLETIN) Pascua noted that with the help of Department of Health (DOH), DepEd has already “issued preemptive safety precautions and protocols” and “prepared information collaterals” to “keep our schools, personnel, and learners nCoV-free.” “We firmly adhere to our primary mandate of protecting our teachers and personnel and our 27.2 million learners,” Pascua said. He also encouraged concerned groups and other stakeholders “to help us on this mission, so that more Filipino will be informed on the proper ways of dealing” with COVID-19. Refer those with symptoms, follow safety protocols Meanwhile, DepEd enjoined all schools and its offices to refer students and personnel who exhibit medical symptoms in an effort to combat the spread of COVID-19. Education Secretary Leonor Briones, in DepEd’s latest policy directives to the task force on the new coronavirus, said “all offices and schools shall utilize existing referral systems as indicated in the School Health and Nutrition Service Manual for personnel and learners who are exhibiting symptoms of respiratory infection and others.” DepEd also issued a set of guidelines for school administrators on how to help reduce the spread of COVID-19 as well as seasonal influenza in schools. Both public and private schools were enjoined to follow and adopt the recommendations of DOH and the World Health Organization. DepEd has adopted the recommendations of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on proper hygiene and practices such as regular handwashing and cough etiquette. In addition, schools should encourage daily preventive actions to stop the spread of germs and let learners and staff stay home when sick. DepEd also enjoined schools to provide adequate supplies, including clean and functional handwashing stations, soap, paper towels, and alcohol-based hand sanitizer, and encourage routine surface cleaning through education, policy, and the provision of supplies. Schools also need to separate sick learners and staff from others until they can be picked up to go home by identifying a “sick room,” if feasible. DepEd also asked schools to establish relationships with state and local public health officials for ongoing communication and updated emergency plans so that they are in place before an outbreak occurs.

Beds in a dormitory building to be used for the quarantine of travelers at risk of coronavirus are seen at the Washington State Patrols Fire Training Academy on February 6, 2020 in North Bend, Washington.(David Ryder/Getty Images/AFP / MANILA BULLETIN) WHO country representative Dr. Rabi Abeyasinghe said the average quarantine period is still 12 to 14 days at the maximum, despite new a research study from China suggesting a quarantine period of up to 24 days. Dr. Abeyasinghe said there is still no evidence proving such a claim. In Wednesday’s press briefing, health undersecretary Eric Domingo also clarified that in normal disease monitoring, 99 percent of cases usually fall between the average period approved by the WHO. “Yung report na ‘yon says that the incubation period is anywhere from 3 days to 24 days kasi laging may outlier in any disease. But you know ‘yung middle na ‘yan, 99 percent of cases will probably fall between 7 days and 14 days and 12 days,” he said. The response came after some international news organizations published a report about China’s new research citing that the data collected from more than 1,000 patients found that the quarantine period for the virus was as long as 24 days rather than the suggested 14 days. The study was produced by a number of researchers from various Chinese hospitals led by Dr. Zhong Nanshan, a prominent scientist who is leading a government-appointed panel of experts helping to control the outbreak in the country where it originated. But the Chinese study also cautioned that the paper has yet to be peer reviewed after it was uploaded to a free online health science archive called medRxiv. The paper was listed as an unpublished manuscript, which means that it cannot be used yet as a reference for health-related practice. Tags: ncov"

And it wasn’t pretty.  National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) Undersecretary Rosemarie Edillon (NEDA / MANILA BULLETIN) In a joint hearing by the House committees on economic affairs and on tourism, National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) Undersecretary Rosemarie Edillon said the country could lose P22.7 billion a month in foregone revenue due to the COVID-2019 scare. “Applying [the] multiplier effect of tourism, we expect that per month, kasama na rin ‘yung domestic airline receipts (this includes the domestic airline receipts)…we think it’s in the order of about P22.7 billion per month,” Edillon told the joint panel upon the interpellation of Deputy Majority leader, Cavite 7th district Rep. Boying Remulla. “Our estimate is that if this goes on for five months, so meaning all the way to the second quarter, then the impact on the GDP (gross domestic product) will be at minus .3 for the full year,” she noted. The five-month time frame came from Department of Health (DOH) Assistant Secretary Dr. Kenneth Ronquillo, in his answer to Remulla’s query regarding his estimate of the duration of the COVID-2019 threat. “Sir, this is a new virus, we cannot really say when it will end, but based on past experiences with SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and MERS-cov (Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus), that took about an average of five to six months. But this time, we can’t really predict,” Ronquillo said. According to Edillon, the local tourism sector contributes 12.7 percent to the GDP. “Down the road, if this persists up to six months, then there could be some industries, especially tourism-related industries that may have to reduce [their] workers,” she said. “We think that the strategy has to be multi-pronged. One is to address the scare, kasi hindi naman kailangan (because there’s no need for a scare). We only have three positive cases so far,” the NEDA official said, referring to number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the country so far. All three individuals were from Wuhan City in China, the source of the novel coronavirus that leads to an acute respiratory disease. There are no known cures or vaccines for it. The Philippine government earlier imposed a temporary travel ban on visitors from China, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan in efforts to stifle the spread of the virus. 5,200 flights to be cancelled Attending the hearing as a resource person was Air-Carriers Association of the Philippines (ACAP) Executive Director and Vice Chairman Bobby Lim. He gave the congressmen an idea of the travel ban’s impact on the airline industry. “There are going to be refunds for all of those tickets given the ban on these travel markets. In terms of loss, this would be about P3 billion [in refunds]. But we have not calculated the impact on forward tickets sales because there is a demand depression,” he said. Lim added that up to 5,200 flights would be cancelled by the ACAP members–which include Philippine Airlines and Cebu Pacific–in the next two months alone. Resilient Department of Tourism (DOT) Secretary Bernadette Romulo-Puyat offered her perspective on the COVID-19 impact while underscoring the resilience of Philippine tourism. “The Philippines has so far overcome major outbreaks over the past two decades,” Puyat said, referring to SARS-cov in 2003, the influenza A subtype H1N1 virus in 2009, and MERS-cov in 2012. “The Philippines saw a decline of minus 1.35 percent and minus 3.89 percent for SARS and H1N1 respectively, parallel to the global statistics. Similarly, when the presence of MERS-cov did not seem to affect international tourist movement, the Philippines also saw a general growth in arrivals despite the threat,” she said. Puyat noted that Philippine tourism has the ability to bounce back strong from an outbreak scare. “During the SARS episode, tourist arrivals in the Philippines dropped by 1.3 percent from 1.93 million in 2002 to 1.9 million in 2003, according to the Philippine Statistical Bureau. But in 2004, tourist arrivals rebounded quickly by 20.1 percent totaling 2.3 million that year.” Puyat said efforts are being undertaken to soften the impact of the losses. “As mentioned by the DOH, there is no local transmission as of this time. We’d like to assure everyone that it’s safe to travel within the country. Systems and protocols are in place to safeguard the welfare of our travelers.” “The growth in domestic tourism despite the H1N1 and MERS-cov outbreaks is an opportunity that the Department is looking into. We are confident that through close cooperation, we will hurdle this 2019-nCoV (novel coronavirus) as we have others,” she added. Tags: ncov"

(REUTERS/Yimou Lee / File photo / MANILA BULLETIN) The island’s lack of WHO membership, due to the objections of China, which considers it a wayward Chinese province and not a separate state, has been an increasingly sore point for Taiwan amid the virus outbreak. Taiwan has complained it has been unable to get timely information from the WHO and has accused China of passing incorrect information to the organization about Taiwan’s total virus case numbers, which stand at 18. China has more than 44,000. But in a small diplomatic breakthrough for the island, its health experts were this week allowed to attend an online technical meeting on the virus. China’s Foreign Ministry said that was because China gave approval for Taiwan’s participation. Taiwan Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Joanne Ou said China was trying to take credit for something it didn’t deserve. “The participation of our experts at this WHO forum was an arrangement made by our government and the WHO directly. It did not need China’s approval,” Ou added. Taiwan’s experts took part in a personal capacity to avoid political disputes, and did not give their nationality when joining the online forum, she said. The WHO did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Taiwan’s WHO exclusion became another point of contention between China and the United States last week, after the U.S. ambassador to the U.N. in Geneva told the WHO’s Executive Board that the agency should deal directly with Taiwan’s government. China, which says Beijing adequately represents Taiwan at the WHO, accused the United States of a political “hype-up” about the issue. Tags: ncov"

,"February 12, 2020, 9:50 AM",nCov,WHO experts see more evidence linking COVID-19 to bats,By Vanne Elaine Terrazola,"By Vanne Elaine Terrazola Experts at the World Health Organization (WHO) are seeing more evidence linking the novel coronavirus, now called the COVID-19, to bats.  (PIXABAY / MANILA BULLETIN) In its situation report on February 11, the WHO said increasing evidence shows the link between the COVID-19 and other similar known coronaviruses (CoVs) circulating in bats, specifically those of the Rhinolophus bat sub-species. Such sub-species are abundant and widely present in Southern China, and across Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and Europe. The WHO cited recent studies indicating that more than 500 CoVs have been identified in bats in China. “Serological studies conducted in rural population living close to bats’ natural habitat in caves revealed a 2.9-percent bat-CoV seroprevalence, demonstrating that humans’ exposure to bat-CoVs might be common,” the report read. The WHO, however, said how the virus was transmitted to human remains unclear. Bats are rare in markets in China, but are hunted and sold directly to restaurants for food, it noted. “The current most likely hypothesis is that an intermediary host animal has played a role in the transmission,” the WHO said. Chinese scientists earlier suggested that the novel coronavirus may have come from bats, although they have yet to determine its transmission to humans. Recent reports said a group of researchers at the South China Agricultural University is looking at pangolins as the “potential intermediate host.” Pangolins are considered as the world’s most trafficked animal and are poached for their scales. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) classified it as a critically endangered animal. A team from WHO is now in China to work with Chinese scientists in identifying the animal source of the COVID-19. The new coronavirus was believed to have originated from a seafood and wildlife market in Wuhan, Hubei province in China, which is the epicenter of the outbreak with more than 31,000 confirmed cases. The WHO said identifying the animal source of the COVID-2019 would help “ensure that there will be no further future similar outbreaks with the same virus and will also help understand the initial spread of the disease in the Wuhan area.” “It would also increase our understanding of the virus and help us understand how these viruses jump from animals to humans,” it added. The WHO appealed for the strengthening of food control and market hygiene activities in live food markets to protect people from similar and other zoonotic diseases. Tags: ncov"

 The death toll in China from the new coronavirus epidemic jumped on Wednesday, as the chief of the World Health Organization urged countries to work together against the “grave threat” posed by the outbreak.  WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus (Nina LARSON / AFPTV / AFP / MANILA BULLETIN) The WHO is holding a conference in Geneva on combating the virus, which has killed more than 1,100 people in China and spread to dozens of countries around the world. WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said viruses could have “more powerful consequences than any terrorist action”. Although 99 percent of the infections are in China, where it remains “very much an emergency”, it also “holds a very grave threat for the rest of the world”, Tedros said at the conference, where the virus was officially named “COVID-19”. The case of a British man who passed on the virus to at least 11 other people — without having been in China — has raised fears of a new phase of contagion abroad. “We have to use the current window of opportunity to hit hard and stand in unison to fight this virus in every corner,” Tedros said, warning that a failure to act would lead to far more cases in the future. WHO sent an advance team to China this week for an international mission to examine the epidemic, where more than 44,000 people have now been infected. Chinese authorities have locked down millions of people in a number of cities, but another 94 deaths were reported on Wednesday in the hardest-hit province of Hubei, the central province where around 56 million people are under lockdown. The mortality rate remains relatively low at around 2 percent. Several governments have banned arrivals from China and major airlines suspended flights in a bid to keep the disease away from their shores. Most cases overseas have involved people who had been in Wuhan, the quarantined central Chinese city where the virus emerged late last year, or people infected by others who had been at the epicentre. The Briton caught the virus while attending a conference in Singapore and then passed it on to several compatriots while on holiday in the French Alps, before finally being diagnosed back in Britain. The 53-year-old said Tuesday he had fully recovered, but remained in isolation in a central London hospital. “The detection of this small number of cases could be the spark that becomes a bigger fire,” Tedros said on Monday. The biggest cluster of cases outside China is aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship moored off Japan, where 135 people have been diagnosed. The ship has been in quarantine since arriving off the Japanese coast early last week after the virus was detected in a former passenger who had disembarked in Hong Kong. More than 100 people were evacuated from a 35-storey Hong Kong housing block Tuesday after two residents in different apartments tested positive for the virus. People were forced to leave as health officials in masks and white overalls scrambled to work out whether the virus had spread through the complex of about 3,000 people. “Of course I’m scared,” a 59-year-old resident, who gave her surname as Chan, told AFP. The United States said Tuesday it had authorised non-essential consulate staff to leave Hong Kong “out of an abundance of caution” linked to the virus. Chinese authorities dismissed two senior health officials from Hubei and tightened restrictions in the capital Wuhan, forbidding people with fever from visiting hospitals outside of their home districts and sealing off residential compounds. Local authorities both in Wuhan — where the virus is thought to have emerged in a market selling wild animals — and Hubei have faced a torrent of criticism for hiding the extent of the outbreak in early January. The death of a whistleblowing doctor from Wuhan has sparked calls for political reform in China. Most deaths and cases are in Hubei. “The problem of human-to-human transmission has still not been solved in Wuhan,” the official Xinhua news agency quoted Zhong Nanshan, a renowned scientist, as saying. “I believe that with enough venues, enough doctors, better protective gear and our various support teams, the situation in Wuhan should improve quickly, but it is still at a rather difficult stage,” he said, forecasting a mid- to late-February peak in the outbreak. Toward the end of January, Zhong had expected a peak in a week to 10 days. President Xi Jinping has largely kept out of the public eye since the outbreak spread across the country. But he emerged on Monday, pictured wearing a mask and having his temperature taken at a hospital in Beijing. Xi called the situation in Hubei “still very grave” and urged “more decisive measures” to contain the spread of the virus. Tags: ncov"

A passenger aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship waves to the media upon arriving at Yokohama port on February 6, 2020.(AFP / MANILA BULLETIN FILE PHOTO) “Out of 53 new test results, 39 people were found positive,” he told reporters, adding that a quarantine official had also been infected with the virus. He added that: “At this point, we have confirmed that four people, among those who are hospitalized, are in a serious condition, either on a ventilator or in an intensive care unit.” The Diamond Princess has been in quarantine since arriving off the Japanese coast early last week after the virus was detected in a former passenger who got off the ship last month in Hong Kong. When the boat arrived off Japan, authorities initially tested nearly 300 people of the 3,711 aboard for the virus, gradually evacuating dozens who were infected to local medical facilities. In recent days, testing has expanded to those with new symptoms or who had close contact with other infected passengers or crew. Those who remain on the ship have been asked to stay inside their cabins and allowed only briefly onto open decks. They have been asked to wear masks and keep a distance from each other when outside, and given thermometers to regularly monitor their temperatures. The ship is expected to stay in quarantine until February 19 — 14 days after the isolation period began. Tags: ncov"
,"February 11, 2020, 9:47 PM",nCov,Indonesia says nothing to hide after no coronavirus cases detected,By Reuters,"By Reuters JAKARTA/BOGOR, Indonesia – Indonesia is not hiding anything over the coronavirus, the health minister said on Tuesday, after some medical researchers expressed concern that cases may have gone undetected in the world’s fourth most populous country.  Journalists wear protective suits inside an elevator as they prepare for a media visit to Indonesian Health Ministry’s Laboratorium for Research on Infectious-Diseases, following the outbreak of the new coronavirus in China, in Jakarta, Indonesia, January February 11, 2020. (REUTERS/Willy Kurniawan/MANILA BULLETIN) While the virus has quickly spread from China throughout much of the rest of the region and beyond, the sprawling Southeast Asian country of more than 260 million people has not recorded any cases so far. Dozens of cases have been recorded in other regional countries including Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam and the Philippines, where one person has died, raising suspicions on social media in particular over a potential lack of vigilance in Indonesia. Researchers at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, in the United States, then said in a study last week that Indonesia should rapidly strengthen outbreak surveillance and control – especially given that it had direct flights from the central Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicentre of the virus. The Harvard team said that Indonesia’s lack of confirmed cases “may suggest the potential for undetected cases” as air travel may contribute to cases being exported from China. The virus has killed over 1,000, with more than 42,000 confirmed cases in China and 319 cases in 24 other countries. Many of the cases outside China have been in people who have a history of travelling to the country. “We have the kits to check coronavirus and they’re certified … Nothing is concealed,” Health Minister Terawan Agus Putranto said after a cabinet meeting at the Bogor presidential palace outside Jakarta, in response to the concerns. Indonesia has tested 64 samples from suspected coronavirus infections – 62 of which were declared negative with two still being tested, health ministry Research and development agency head Siswanto said during a tour of its laboratory in Jakarta. Navaratnasamy Paranietharan, the WHO’s Indonesia representative, told a conference on Tuesday: “Indonesia has taken concrete measures and the World Health Organization is quite confident that Indonesia is ready to be able to respond to this situation.” Indonesia has barred entry to visitors who have been in China for 14 days and stopped all flights to and from there. Vivi Setiawaty, another health ministry official, said it was unclear why Indonesia had not seen any cases but said authorities were better prepared since facing H5N1 avian influenza from 2005. “We remain cautious,” she told reporters. Indonesia has readied 100 hospitals across the archipelago including three in Jakarta and has also quarantined more than 240 of its citizens evacuated from Hubei province, home to Wuhan, to the island of Natuna, north of Borneo. The WHO’s Paranietharan said it appeared unlikely, as some have suggested, that the hot tropical climate could be a factor in curbing cases though more data would be required to be sure. “It doesn’t make sense at this point whether that could be the reason why we don’t have coronavirus cases in Indonesia,” Paranietharan said.

,"February 11, 2020, 7:23 PM",nCov,DILG warns public against nCoV fake news infographic,By Chito Chavez,"By Chito Chavez The Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) clarified that the strict implementation of the 14-day quarantine provided in DILG Memo Circular 2020-023 (Amended Guide to Action against the 2019 Novel Coronavirus) refers only to travelers from China, Hong Kong, and Macau.  This infographic, denounced by the Department of the Interior and Local Government as false information, went viral on social media. DILG warned purveyors of fake information that they would be arrested. DILG Undersecretary and Spokesperson Jonathan Malaya issued the clarification after an infographic not issued by the department alleged that a 14-day quarantine period was issued with regard to 23 countries. Malaya described the spurious infographic as having listed South Korea, Vietnam, Sweden, Japan, Cambodia, Thailand, Finland, Nepal, Canada, Italy, Russian Federation, Spain, Singapore, Australia, Malaysia, United Kingdom, United States, France, India, Sri Lanka, Germany, and the United Arab Emirates as countries included by the government in the 14-day quarantine period. However, Malaya said that all travelers aside from those coming from China, Hong Kong, and Macau may undergo voluntary quarantine. DILG Secretary Eduardo Año warned the unscrupulous groups spreading lies about the virus to stop now before the law catches up with them. “The unauthorized and patently illegal infographic went viral and caused panic among travelers who wanted to cancel their travel plans because of the misrepresentation of these people. It has become absurd and worrisome,” Malaya said. “Again, we urge the public to trust only official sources of information and to verify first before sharing. Think first before you click,” he added. Fake news purveyors Año on Tuesday directed the Philippine National Police (PNP) to leave no stone unturned in the arrest of groups or individuals spreading fake news about nCoV to the public. “We will go after the perpetrators of false information on coronavirus because their acts are inimical to the interest of the general public,” Año said. With the country facing the nCoV problem, Año emphasized the need to end this “nuisance activity. Let’s not propagate erroneous information that is more viral than the virus itself. We already have enough on our plate.” “Hindi po sila nakakatulong sa paglutas ng ating problema, bagkus mas pinapalala pa nila ang problema (They are not helping solve the problem, but rather they are making the problem worse),” he added. With his order, Año expects the PNP to intensify their moves against those “guilty of spreading false information on the issue on various social media platforms.” “Freedom of expression has limitations, especially when its exercise threatens the welfare of the public. We must put an end to fake news on social media,” he said. Malaya said the PNP’s Anti-Cybercrime Group (ACG), which investigates crimes using information and communications technology, is capable of tracing and tracking fake news perpetrators on the Internet. It is currently verifying six suspected fake news posts on the coronavirus on social media. “The PNP-ACG is working hard to detect the whereabouts of these law offenders. We expect arrests to be made soon,” Malaya said. He explained that Article 154 of the Revised Penal Code, on the Unlawful Use of Means of Publication and Unlawful Utterances, punishes purveyors of fake news. He added that the same provision penalizes a person who causes the publication of any false news which may endanger the public order, or cause damage to the interest or credit of the State. Violators face imprisonment of one to six months and a fine ranging from P40,000 to P200,000. They can also be punished under Republic Act No. 10175, the Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012. “These laws are created for a reason — to punish law offenders,” Malaya said. Tags: ncov"
,"February 11, 2020, 4:42 PM",nCov,How one man spread coronavirus from Singapore to UK via the Alps,By Agence France-Presse ,"By Agence France-Presse  A British man managed to pass on the coronavirus to at least 11 other people without ever setting foot in the epicenter of the outbreak in China, in an infectious journey that shows how the deadly virus can spread rapidly around a globalized world.  This file photo was taken on January 24, 2020, shows people wearing face masks to help stop the spread of a deadly virus which began in the city as they wait at Wuhan Red Cross Hospital in Wuhan. – For eight days, starting on January 23, 2020, an AFP team lived and worked at the center of a global health emergency, witnessing how life in the Chinese city of Wuhan was turned upside down as it was cut off from the world. (Photo by Hector RETAMAL / AFP) / TO GO WITH China-health-virus-Wuhan, FOCUS by Sebastien Ricci / MANILA BULLETIN) The adult British citizen, who has not been named publicly, caught the virus while attending a conference in Singapore and then passed it on to several compatriots while on holiday in the French Alps, before finally being diagnosed back in the UK. Of those infected by the man, five have been hospitalized in France, five in Britain and one other man on the Spanish island of Mallorca. How did he pass on the new coronavirus so rapidly in so many different places? Singapore  The man attended a business conference in Singapore from 20-22 January. More than 100 people took part in the conference, including at least one Chinese national from Hubei province, the epicenter of the epidemic that has now left more than 900 dead. Haute-Savoie, French Alps  He then travelled on to France to spend some days from January 24-28 at the ski resort of Contamines-Montjoie in the Alps with a group of other British citizens staying in two apartments in the same chalet. Brighton, England  Stricken with fever after his return to the south of England, the man then went to a medical center in the southeastern town of Brighton where he was diagnosed with the coronavirus. On February 6 he was transferred to the infectious diseases unit at the hospital of St Thomas in London. Five other people who had contact with him at the French ski chalet were then confirmed by the British health authorities to be infected. Some of the staff from The Grenadier pub, where the man went to just before he was hospitalized, have also been placed in isolation. But the pub has stayed open. A medical center in Brighton said Monday it had temporarily closed for “an urgent operational health and safety reason.” The BBC and Sky News said one of the center’s staff members had tested positive for the virus, although this was not officially confirmed. Paris  Health Minister Agnes Buzyn said on February 8 that five British nationals, including a child, who stayed at the chalet with the man had tested positive.  Six other Britons staying in the same chalet were also hospitalized for observation. “They show no serious signs” of those infected having any threat to their lives, added Buzyn. Business owners in the Contamines-Montjoie resort have been keen to avoid any exaggerations of the threat as French families prepared to descend on the area for the half-term ski holidays. Three schools attended by one of the British infected — the child aged nine — are closed and 100 have been people tested. All the results have been negative so far. Similar efforts have been made to track down passengers who took a flight from Geneva — the closest large airport to Contamines-Montjoie — with the man when he went back to Britain on January 28. Mallorca, Spain  One member of the group he stayed with in France then sought medical help after returning to his home in Mallorca. The contamination took place between January 25 and January 29, according to the Spanish authorities. The man in Mallorca is “currently in good health. He shows practically no symptom,” said Fernando Simon, an official from Spain’s health ministry. The Mallorca man’s wife and two daughters aged 10 and 7, who were also hospitalized for tests, have shown no sign of infection. Speed of spread spurs fears  Experts said that the speed of the transmission showed the potential for the novel coronavirus to become a global pandemic. “The recent report of transmission to British nationals in France are a worrying but perhaps not unexpected development,” said Paul Hunter, Professor in Medicine, University of East Anglia. “This reinforces the fact that transmission is no longer restricted to China. It is still too early to know when and if the epidemic will become pandemic and whether we will see start to see sustained person to person transmission in Europe.” The case of the British man who passed on the virus to at least 11 other people — without having been in China — has raised fears of a new phase of contagion abroad. “The detection of this small number of cases could be the spark that becomes a bigger fire,” WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Monday. “But for now it’s only a spark. Our objective remains containment. We call on all countries to use the window of opportunity we have to prevent a bigger fire,” Tedros said. But Michael Ryan, head of the WHO’s Health Emergencies Programme, said it was “way too early” to call the Singapore conference a “super-spreading event.” “It is always a concern when people come together and then move apart and we have to have risk management procedures associated with that but you can’t shut down the world either,” Ryan said.

Wuhan has been under effective quarantine since January 23 when the government suspended transport links out of the city in a bid to contain the virus, which has so far killed 1,016 people and infected more than 42,600 across China. In order to “contain the spread of the epidemic”, Wuhan residents with fever symptoms are only allowed to seek treatment at designated facilities in the district they live in, the city’s health commission said Tuesday. People diagnosed with pneumonia who require observation must remain at the clinics, or at alternative premises provided by the facilities, the commission said in a notice. Meanwhile, all residential compounds will be placed under “sealed management”, while buildings with known or suspected virus cases must be placed under even stricter watch, the Wuhan government said in a notice Monday. The notice said the city — the capital of Hubei province — had “entered a key stage” in its fight against the virus. No further details were provided in the statement on what “sealed management” involves. The phrase has been used by local authorities elsewhere in China to describe sealing off all but a few exit points in a compound and checking the identification of all who enter and leave. Wuhan Communist Party secretary Ma Guoqiang told a news conference Monday that a “general health survey of all the people” was being carried out in the city. As of February 9, he said authorities had checked 10.6 million people. Tens of millions of people in Hubei and surrounding provinces already face tight restrictions on their movement as authorities try to slow the spread of the virus. Hubei has borne the brunt of the epidemic’s toll, with the vast majority of the fatalities occurring within the province. Tags: ncov"
,"February 11, 2020, 4:05 PM",nCov,DepEd sees no need yet to suspend graduation rites for nCoV,By Merlina Hernando-Malipot ,"By Merlina Hernando-Malipot  While it considers the 2019 novel coronavirus acute respiratory disease (2019-nCoV ARD) a serious health concern, the Department of Education (DepEd) said there is no need to suspend graduation rites or ceremonies just yet. Undersecretary for Administration Alain Del Pascua said that since graduation rites and ceremonies are scheduled in the next two months, DepEd has yet to include these in the list of activities that are temporarily suspended as a precautionary measure against the possible spread of the coronavirus.  DepEd Undersecretary for Administration and Election Task Force (ETF) Monitoring Chairperson Alain Del Pascua “Graduation ceremonies will be in March and April,” Pascua said in Filipino. “What we’re focusing [on] right now are the activities scheduled in February.” DepEd earlier suspended activities involving all learners and teachers, particularly those national and regional activities scheduled this month. In particular, the suspended national activities involving learners and teachers are the National Science and Technology Fair (NSTF), the National Festival of Talents (NFOT), and the National Schools Press Conference (NSPC). Off-campus activities such as educational tours and field trips were also suspended until further notice. “We already suspended national and regional events and activities, and off-campus activities,” Pascua said. “But it does not include graduation ceremonies since these will take place in the coming months.” Education Secretary Leonor Briones earlier issued DepEd Memorandum No. 015, series of 2020 or the First Set of Policy Directives of DepEd Task Force nCoV which sets forth the department’s initiatives in addressing concerns of school and policy changes that may arise due to the nCoV threat. Briones said in the memo that “in the interest of public health, all public and private basic education schools and learning centers are duty-bound to exercise due diligence and take precautionary measures to minimize exposure risks associated with the 2019-nCoV ARD.” For DepEd activities scheduled this February, Briones said upon the advice of the Department of Health (DOH), “all national and regional activities involving learners and/or teachers requiring travel and congregration of various schools, divisions, and/or regions are suspended.” In a recent Senate inquiry on the coronavirus, DepEd also “discouraged” schools from suspending classes over virus fears, noting that this “will not prevent our learners from going to crowded places.” In the same inquiry, the health department had yet to recommend suspending graduation ceremonies either, considering that these activities are “too far off to make any recommendations to suspend or postpone.” Modified school calendar DepEd has also modified the calendar for school year 2019-2020, especially for schools affected by Taal Volcano’s unrest. The last day for public schools was originally scheduled on April 3, Friday. In the modified school calendar, the schedule for the final examinations has been adjusted, and year-end preparations, graduation, recognition, and moving up may be scheduled between April 1 to 6. As in previous years, DepEd enjoins both public and private schools nationwide to ensure that graduation rites are “simple but meaningful” to encourage “civil rights, a sense of community, and personal responsibility.” While these rites mark a milestone in the life of the learners, DepEd noted that “these should be conducted without excessive spending, extravagant attire, or extraordinary venue.” DepEd has yet to release an official memo for school year 2019-2020 K to 12 Basic Education Program End of School Year Rites.

Philippine Overseas Employment Administrator Bernard Olalia (PIA) POEA Administrator Bernard Olalia, in a text message to Manila Bulletin, confirmed that all OFWs to Taiwan “will not be allowed to leave” the country following the recent announcement of the Department of Health (DOH) that Taiwan is covered by the temporary travel ban. Olalia also said that there are “no exemptions” to the ban “as of the moment.” Meanwhile, Olalia said in a radio interview that POEA will also temporarily suspend the processing of Overseas Employment Certificate (OECs) of OFWs to Taiwan. The POEA has already directed agencies to inform employers of OFWs who are scheduled to leave that there will be a delay in their travel because of the travel ban. Those scheduled to leave for Taiwan were allowed to do so prior to DOH’s formal announcement. Olalia added that OFWs who are scheduled to come home for a vacation will be allowed to enter the country. As a precautionary measure, they must undergo the mandatory 14-day quarantine imposed by the Philippine government.

The Alliance of Concerned Teachers (ACT) Philippines alleged that DepEd “broke” its own order in the name of the Duterte administration’s drug war and counterinsurgency.  Amid 2019-nCov threat, grade 9 Students of Ramon Magsaysay High School in Quezon City attend an anti-drug culmination activity organized by the Philippine National Police in partnership with the Department of Education (ACT Philippines via Ina Malipot / MANILA BULLETIN) ACT said the Philippine National Police (PNP) held an anti-drug culmination activity for nearly a thousand Grade 9 students in Ramon Magsaysay High School, Quezon City on Monday (Feb. 10) with DepEd Undersecretary Tonisito Umali as guest of honor and speaker. The event came days after DepEd’s Task Force nCoV released a memorandum suspending all school activities involving learners as a precautionary measure against the possible spread of the 2019-nCoV ARD. DepEd also enjoined students and teachers to avoid “crowded places” in an effort to reduce the risk of infection. “How was the PNP activity permitted with no less than a DepEd top official as its guest and speaker, when even flag ceremonies have been banned?” asked ACT National Chairperson Joselyn Martinez. “Is this sham and violent drug war more important than the health of our students?” Martinez also slammed the DepEd for allegedly “exposing students to health risks”. ACT also argued that its own activities – which do not even involve students such as the Fil-Am War forum for AralingPanlipunan teachers, ACT-NCR Union’s regional council meeting, and a dialogue between ACT-NCR Union and DepEd NCR’s Regional Director – have been suspended since the issuance of the DepEd’s memo on 2019-nCoV ARD. ACT noted that the “selective application of the memorandum makes it seem as though the order is being used as a weapon to forward Duterte’s rabid repression campaign.” The group also demanded that DepEd “explain its implementation of the said memorandum as well as its permission of the PNP’s anti-drug campaign activity.” Martinez alleged that Duterte’s drug war “has killed thousands of poor Filipinos who were not given any chance at due process” so “this is not the kind of skewed justice we want our students to learn.” She added that schools should not allow “the youth to learn to condone fascism in any way, hence we condemn DepEd’s flagrant support to such campaign.” DepEd says such activity is ‘allowed’ As a response, DepEd issued a clarification to the Manila Bulletin noting that such activity is “allowed” since it was an in-campus congregation with no students coming from other schools as attendees. Based on DepEd Memorandum No. 15, s. 2020 or the First Set of Policy Directives of the DepEd Task Force on nCoV, Undersecretary for Administration Alain Pascua said that such activity is allowed as long as the measures for the prevention and control of the 2019-NCOV ARD in basic education schools and offices “were observed.” In particular, Pascua noted Letter D, Section 2 of the DM 015. s. 2020, which states that “all personnel and learners exhibiting respiratory infections must not attend activities that involve a congregation of learners within the school.” DepEd also reiterated that based on the 2019-nCoV directives it has issued, learners are encouraged to avoid crowded places “outside the school” – among others – to minimize exposure to risks associated with the 2019-nCoV ARD. Ban such activities with or without nCoV ACT said the activity is part of the Duterte administration’s Kabataan Kontra-Droga at Terorismo (KKDT) campaign which was launched in 2019 and has since gone around schools to conduct various seminars and fora.

The decision was arrived at after Mayor Romeo Salda, Vice Mayor Roderick Awingan and the municipal councilors in an executive session discussed the possible postponement of the festival due to the threats posed by the 2019 novel Coronavirus (nCoV). As such, some councilors averred that it would be more prudent for the town to heed the advice of the Department of Health (DOH), and avoid the staging of mass gatherings to arrest the spread of nCoV.

Hubei province in central China has been struggling to contain a virus outbreak (AFP/ MANILA BULLETIN) Zhang Jin, the Communist Party boss of the provincial health commission in Hubei, and its director Liu Yingzi have been removed from their positions, reported state broadcaster CCTV, after a decision by the province’s party committee Monday. The area has found itself at the centre of a coronavirus outbreak that has killed more than 1,000 people and infected over 42,000 across China since December. Local officials have faced mounting pressure for perceived incompetence — particularly after the death of a Chinese doctor in the provincial capital Wuhan who was punished for raising the alarm about the new virus. Deputy director of China’s National Health Commission Wang Hesheng will take over the two roles, said CCTV. In another sign of personnel changes at ground zero of the outbreak, senior Beijing official Chen Yixin has been sent to Wuhan to guide epidemic control work. – Image of stability –
Chen — a former deputy party chief of Hubei — has been appointed deputy head of a central government group dispatched to the province, according to a report from the health commission on its WeChat account. Analysts have said local authorities played down the extent of the outbreak in early January because they were holding political meetings at the time and wanted to project an image of stability. Hubei remains on virtual lockdown to curb the spread of the virus. Local Communist Party secretary Ma Guoqiang acknowledged last week that officials had worsened the spread by failing to restrict travel earlier. Wuhan authorities also faced criticism in January for going ahead with an annual public banquet for 40,000 families just days before the city was placed on lockdown. Other manpower changes have been taking place in the province, including the removal of a top Red Cross official in Wuhan for dereliction of duty. Tags: ncov"

Personnel in protective gear prepare to evacuate residents from a public housing building following the outbreak of the novel coronavirus, in Hong Kong, China February 11, 2020. REUTERS/Tyrone Siu The government said it was investigating drainage pipes in the building in Tsing Yi district in the New Territories amid worries the virus may have been spread through the system as the city goes on high alert to contain an outbreak. Parts of Hong Kong, including restaurants, shopping malls and cafes, are almost deserted as people work from home and schools remain closed, invoking memories of 2003 when Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) sent panic across the city. Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam on Tuesday appealed for residents to stay indoors as much as possible. “As part and parcel of enhancing social distancing we are making an appeal to the people of Hong Kong to stay at home as much as possible,” Lam told reporters. “But at the moment, we’re making this appeal, we’re not going for compulsory closures because Hong Kong is a free society.” Authorities evacuated more than 100 residents in 35 households in the early hours of Tuesday, local media reported, after two residents from the high-rise building were confirmed to have contracted coronavirus. The government said on Tuesday the occupants of 23 households in the Tsing Yi housing complex had been sent to quarantine centers, while it was still trying to make contact with people from nine housing units. The director of the Centre for Health Protection said authorities were investigating the suspected “environmental transmission” of the two confirmed cases. Most of Hong Kong’s population of more than seven million people live in high-rise buildings. In 2003, high concentrations of viral aerosols in building plumbing in the Amoy Gardens high-rise complex were drawn into apartment bathrooms through floor drains. The initial exposures occurred in these bathrooms. SARS killed nearly 300 people in Hong Kong. The government has confirmed 42 cases of coronavirus, which has killed more than 1,000 people, almost all in mainland China. Embattled Lam is grappling with a health scare even as she faces broader tensions in Hong Kong society where months of often-violent anti-government protests paralyzed parts of the global financial center. The virus has piled further pressure on Hong Kong’s economy, with retailers, hotels and travel-related businesses among the hardest hit as tourists stay away. Tags: ncov"

Manila Economic and Cultural Office(MECO OFFICIAL FACEBOOK PAGE / MANILA BULLETIN) MECO Chairman Angelito Tan Banayo said the Taiwan government took issue with the travel ban, not because of the 2019-novel coronavirus scare, but because they were grouped with mainland China, and Hong Kong and Macau which are special administrative regions of China. “Ikinasama ng loob ng gobyerno ng Taiwan. Hindi dahil sa coronavirus kung hindi ‘yung sinabing sila’y kaparte ng Tsina, na para silang Hong Kong o Macau (The Taiwan government was offended.

This has been a point of contention between the two countries for several years now. China maintains the “One-China policy” which asserts that there should only be one sovereign state under the name of China. Taiwan argues that it is an independent state that does not belong to mainland China. Banayo expressed hope that the Taiwan travel ban will be lifted immediately, saying that the virus is being contained due to the country’s efficient health care system. “Lahat ay naaasikaso ng magaling na health care system ng Taiwan (Everything is being handled by Taiwan’s good health care system),” he said. “Wala ni isa pang namamatay, wala ni isang [Pilipinong] apektado ng sakit na ito (There has been not a single death due to the virus… no Filipino in Taiwan has been infected),” he added.

Curious passersby stopped, filled out a short questionnaire on an iPad-like touch screen attached to the robot’s chest, and even had a conversation with the machine. Promobot was created by a Philadelphia-based startup that makes autonomous service robots for businesses and is run by a group of Russians. “We did a special software to detect coronavirus symptoms,” the company’s chief business development officer, Oleg Kivorkutsev, told Reuters. “We understand how this problem is important, how people are nervous, people are afraid of this. But if they understand a few, simple things, for example, what symptoms coronavirus has, what they should do to prevent (it), everything will be fine and everyone will be happy.” The robot does not actually detect the virus. It asks if a person has common symptoms such a fever and the person has to hit “yes” or “no” on the touch screen, after which they receive a reassuring message if they chose no. “This thing is very clever.

World Bank President David Malpass attends the “1+6” Roundtable meeting at the Diaoyutai state guesthouse in Beijing, China November 21, 2019. (REUTERS/Florence Lo / MANILA BULLETIN FILE PHOTO) Malpass told Reuters the bank was working with the World Health Organization (WHO) to aid China, including offering advice about past health crises, but did not plan any financial assistance because China has ample resources of its own. “My thought is that we all wish them a speedy way to address the coronavirus in China,” he said in an interview on Monday. “We’ve offered technical assistance in the area of health, sanitation and disease policies.” Formed after World War Two to rebuild Europe, the World Bank has some $470 billion in assets and counts China among its largest borrowers, with $14.8 billion in loans committed since 2011. China is also the bank’s third largest shareholder after the United States and Japan. “China has its own large international reserves,” and new loans are not being considered at this time, said Malpass, a former Trump administration Treasury official who took over as World Bank president last April. China reported that it held $3.115 trillion in foreign exchange reserves in January. The World Bank has said its experts are in discussions with Chinese authorities and could help provide assistance on disease surveillance, food safety, lessons from previous pandemics and analysis of the effect of the outbreak on China’s economy. Inside China, more than 300 companies from food delivery services to smartphone makers are seeking more than $8.2 billion in loans to ease the impact of the coronavirus, banking sources told Reuters. Economic growth is expected to slow to 5% or less this quarter because of the virus, one Chinese government economist estimates. Malpass declined to offer an estimate of the effect of the crisis on China’s or the world’s economic growth. He said it was too early to say if the World Bank’s already tepid full-year forecast would be cut. “Clearly, coronavirus is slowing growth in the first half of 2020. What the long-term consequences are we’ll have to see as the response occurs and the adjustments are made,” he said. “China is just coming back from a long Lunar New Year holiday, so we’ll have to evaluate the growth.” Since taking his job at the Treasury in 2017, Malpass had been critical of the World Bank’s continued low-interest lending to China, arguing that the world’s second-largest economy was too wealthy for such aid while it was loading up some countries with debt from its Belt and Road infrastructure program. A former Bear Stearns and Co-chief economist who advised President Donald Trump’s 2016 election campaign, Malpass has called for more of the bank’s resources to be devoted to poorer countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America. A Feb. 3 World Bank pledge to review here financial resources that could be deployed quickly was aimed at poorer countries that could be affected by the pandemic, a bank official said. China agreed to a decline in borrowing as part of reforms associated with a $13 billion capital increase for the World Bank approved by shareholders in 2018. The World Bank in December adopted a new five-year China plan that calls for $1 billion to $1.5 billion in annual lending, down from a $1.8 billion annual average over the previous five years.. Malpass said lending to China in the 2020 fiscal year, which ends June 30, would likely fall below that range. Although the bank is “winding down” its lending to China under terms of a 2018 capital increase, the bank would grant financing for certain “global public goods,” Malpass said. These include environmental projects, private sector development and reforms to state-owned enterprises. The only new China financing approved by the World Bank so far in fiscal 2020 is a $150 million loan here toward a $686 million project to sustain forests in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River basin.

Ariel Inton of the Lawyers for Commuter Safety and Protection said he sees “nothing wrong” with the LTFRB’s directive and admitted that it has “good intentions” in helping prevent the spread of the 2019-nCoV.

Still, Inton maintained that drivers and conductors should follow the advice of health officials about wearing face masks. The LTFRB, in requiring PUV drivers and conductors to wear face masks, cited a 2011 memorandum which requires PUV operators to provide safe land public transportation to commuters The transport regulator also required operators to maintain proper sanitation and cleanliness in terminals, including the provision of face masks and sanitizers for passengers. LTFRB chairman Martin Delgra earlier warned that non-compliance would be penalized. “May polisiya ang LTFRB kapag may circular na pinapalabas at hindi sinusunod, may violation po ‘yan, breach of franchise.

After her Philippine Airlines flight from China landed at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport on Monday, Malou De Asis expressed concern that people would be disgusted with her if they would know that she came from China. “Sasabihin may sakit ka na agad, ayaw munang makihalubilo (They will say you are sick and refuse to go near you),” De Asis, from Fujian City, said over GMA’s 24 Oras. Dolea called on everyone not to discriminate against people only because they are from China. “They should not be discriminated or stigmatized for just coming from a country that has an outbreak,” she said.

(MANILA BULLETIN) “We have confirmed with the Department of Justice, which is our mother department, that Taiwan is indeed included in the expanded travel ban,” Morente stated. Last February 2, the BI implemented an order from President Rodrigo Duterte in banning all foreign nationals coming from China, as well as its Special Administrative Regions. In the said order, any passenger of any nationality who has been to China, Hong Kong, and Macau within 14 days before coming to the Philippines shall automatically be denied entry. Only Filipino citizens and aliens with permanent resident visas from the said countries may be allowed entry. According to the BI, permanent resident aliens are those who were issued immigrant visas under the Philippine immigration act, those who are residents following the alien legalization program under EO 324 or the alien social integration program under RA 7919, holders of native born visas; aliens who acquired permanent resident status by reasons of marriage to a Filipino, and aliens with approved refugee status. Different agencies sought clarification if Taiwan is included in the ban. “While not explicitly stated, we have confirmed with the Secretary of Justice that Taiwan is indeed part of the ban, and this expansion shall be implemented immediately,” said Morente. Under the guidelines, if a foreign passenger not exempted from the ban is encountered at the ports, he or she shall automatically be denied entry and returned to his port of origin. Filipinos and aliens who are exempted from the ban shall be turned over to the Bureau of Quarantine for their assessment, together with a copy of their arrival cards. Filipinos are likewise temporarily not allowed to leave for China, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan unless they are part of a government delegation conducting official duties, a member of the World Health Organization, and other agencies involved in fighting or containing the 2019 nCoV-ARD. Morente stressed that the measure is temporary. “We are implementing the directive of President Duterte, following the recommendations of the Department of Health,” said Morente. Tags: ncov"

Chinese President Xi Jinping inspects the novel coronavirus prevention and control work at Anhuali Community in Beijing, China, February 10, 2020. (Xinhua via REUTERS / MANILA BULLETIN) The Chinese president donned a face mask and had his temperature checked while visiting medical workers and patients affected by the deadly coronavirus that has infected more than 42,000 in 25 countries. The fatalities soared after hardest-hit Hubei province — the epicentre of the outbreak — reported another 103 deaths on Tuesday, the highest single-day toll since the virus emerged. At a hospital treating infected patients in Beijing Monday, Xi called the situation at the epicenter “still very grave” and “more decisive measures” to contain the spread of the virus, said state broadcaster CCTV. Xi has largely kept out of the public eye since the virus outbreak spiralled across the country from Hubei province. He appointed Premier Li Keqiang to lead a group tackling the outbreak and it was Li who visited ground zero in Wuhan last month. On Monday, Xi put on a blue mask and white surgical gown to meet doctors at Beijing Ditan hospital, observed the treatment of patients and spoke via video link to doctors in Wuhan, state media said. He then visited a residential community in central Beijing to “investigate and guide” efforts to contain the epidemic, said CCTV. Video footage showed Xi having his temperature taken with an infrared thermometer then speaking with community workers and waving at smiling residents leaning out of apartment windows. The outbreak has prompted unprecedented action by the Chinese government, including locking down entire cities in Hubei as well as cutting transport links nationwide, closing tourist attractions and telling hundreds of millions of people to stay indoors. The sweeping measures have turned cities into ghost towns — but there were some signs of normalcy returning as many went back to work this week. Chinese authorities have dismissed two senior officials from Hubei, the central province where some 56 million people, including in its capital Wuhan, have been under lockdown since late last month. The province sacked the Communist Party head and director of the provincial health commission. Local authorities in Wuhan and Hubei have faced a torrent of criticism for hiding the extent of the outbreak in early January. Most deaths and cases are in Hubei. The death of a whistleblowing doctor from Wuhan has sparked calls for political reform in China. ‘We’re worried’ Roads in Beijing and the financial hub of Shanghai had significantly more traffic, while the southern city of Guangzhou said it would start to resume normal public transport. However, many of those returning to work were uneasy. “Of course we’re worried,” said a 25-year-old man surnamed Li in a Beijing beauty salon that reopened Monday. “When customers come in, we first take their temperature, then use disinfectant and ask them to wash their hands.” The Shanghai government suggested staggered work schedules, avoiding group meals and keeping at least one meter (three feet) away from colleagues. Many were encouraged to work from home and some employers simply delayed opening for another week. State media reported that passenger numbers on the Beijing subway were half that of a normal working day. Large shopping malls in the capital were deserted and many banks closed. One bank employee in Shanghai was heading to work for a half-day, with other workers due to take over in the afternoon. The rest of the day he would work from home. “It makes our work more difficult,” he told AFP. Schools and universities across the country remained shut. The toll has overtaken global fatalities in the 2002-03 SARS epidemic when China drew international condemnation for covering up cases, though Beijing has drawn praise from the World Health Organization this time. Hurting the economy President Xi warned top officials last week that efforts to contain the new coronavirus had gone too far, threatening the country’s economy, sources told Reuters, days before Beijing rolled out measures to soften the blow. After reviewing reports on the outbreak from the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) and other economic departments, Xi told local officials during a Feb 3 meeting of the Politburo’s Standing Committee that some of the actions taken to contain the virus are harming the economy, said two people familiar with the meeting, who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter. He urged them to refrain from “more restrictive measures”, the two people said. The official Xinhua News Agency, reporting on the Politburo meeting called the coronavirus outbreak “a major test of China’s system and capacity for governance.” It added, without details, that “party committees and governments of all levels were urged to achieve the targets of economic and social development this year.” Since the meeting, China’s central bank has vowed to step up support for the economy and prepared policy tools to offset the damage. The NDRC said at a weekend briefing that it was urging companies and factories to resume work, especially in “key industries” such as food and pharmaceuticals.

In its daily update, Hubei’s health commission also confirmed another 2,097 new cases in the central province, where the outbreak emerged in December. There are now more than 42,200 confirmed cases across China, based on previously released figures from the government. The new virus is believed to have emerged last year in a market that sells wild animals in Hubei’s capital Wuhan, the city at the centre of the outbreak. Chinese President Xi Jinping met with medical workers and patients affected at a hospital in Beijing on Monday, where he called for “more decisive measures” to contain the outbreak, said state broadcaster CCTV. An advance team for a World Health Organization-led international expert mission on the virus arrived in China late Monday, headed by Bruce Aylward. He oversaw the organization’s 2014-2016 response to the Ebola epidemic in West Africa. Ahead of the team’s arrival, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned there had been some “concerning instances” of cases overseas in people with no travel history to China. Britain on Monday recorded a doubling of cases to eight, and the government warned the outbreak of novel coronavirus was a “serious and imminent threat.” US President Donald Trump said he expected the outbreak would disappear in April due to hotter weather, a prognosis at odds with top US health officials.

The President also said he would listen to local government units (LGUs) on possible quarantine areas but that the government would eventually take control of such facilities.  Philippines’ President Rodrigo Duterte gestures during a press conference at Malacanang Palace (Photo by TED ALJIBE / AFP / MANILA BULLETIN FILE PHOTO) Duterte tackled his plan of action in case the public health emergency worsens, among others, at an assembly of local government executives in Pasay City. “I would like to take this opportunity to assure all Filipinos that the national government remains to be on top of threat of the coronavirus. We are prepared to handle this public health emergency in case the worst scenario happens,” he said in the meeting with governors and mayors. “Kung sabihin mo na pandemic talaga (If there will be a pandemic), then I will have to utilize for orderly and obedience of people the military and police,” he added. On the selection of quarantine sites, Duterte said the LGUs may recommend areas where people with the suspected virus infection will be monitored or treated. “If the worst happens, it is government who takes control,” he said. “We will listen to you. We will listen to the local,” he said. Duterte made the comment after the government initially faced opposition from the local government of Capas, Tarlac when it converted the athletes’ village in New Clark City into a quarantine facility. Around 30 Filipinos from Wuhan, China, where the virus broke out, are currently under quarantine for 14 days in the Tarlac facility. To date, one Chinese patient has died from the coronavirus in the Philippines and two other cases were reported by health authorities.  More than 200 patients are under investigation for possible nCoV infection. The President expressed confidence that the nation could overcome the latest health emergency, citing adequate funds and competent health workers to help address the situation. He praised the Department of Health led by Secretary Francisco Duque III for the “prompt and efficient response” in allaying public fears about the new coronavirus. With no treatment still found by experts, he urged researchers to work hard to find a vaccine for the virus. Amid concerns on the possible local transmission, Duterte also appealed to LGUs to take urgent steps to prevent the virus from spreading and provide immediate care to those affected. He said local officials must be “more proactive in the management of cases, contact tracing, efficient prevention and control, and information dissemination of the coronavirus.” “I trust you will actively engage our schools and hospital and barangay health workers for more efficient and effective community response to avert possible outbreak that could affect the day-to-day lives of our people,” he added.

The EU ministers discuss ways to prevent the virus’ spread and “adopt conclusions in relation to the EU response to the novel coronavirus outbreak”. Last week, German health minister Jens Spahn suggested at a meeting with his French counterpart Agnes Buzyn that Europe impose restrictions on travellers from China. The United States has already banned the arrival of foreign nationals who have visited China recently. But for any such measure to be imposed in Europe the 27 EU members would have to coordinate the decision, since most of them are in the Schengen passport-free travel area.

The spurious infographic claimed that under a DILG memorandum circular, there will be strict implementation of the 14-day quarantine on people arriving from 23 coronavirus-hit countries. The material circulated on social media last Friday until it was flagged by authorities as false. Malaya insisted that the DILG has not issued such memorandum. “We are warning those people that (DILG) Secretary Año has already directed the CIDG (Criminal Investigation and Detection Group) to investigate kung sino ang nag-post ng infographic na iyon (whoever posted that infographic) because that is a violation of Article 154 of the Revised Penal Code and of the Cyber Crime Act as well,” he said in a Palace press briefing. “We will prosecute them to the fullest extent of the law because what they are doing is creating panic and creating unnecessary threats to public order and safety,” he said.

The vice president recommended proper hygiene, frequent hand washing, and avoiding crowded places for people to guard against 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease. Robredo said there is a need to intensify the call of the World Health Organization (WHO) on other practices that would help the public more than the face masks. “Kailangan ding ipaliwanag na hindi naman talaga iyon iyong pinaka-makakatulong. Kailangan paliwanagan na mayroon pang mas mabubuting mga practices,” the opposition leader said. (It needs to be explained it is not the face masks that can help them the most.

We want our people to be protected and for us, prevention is of highest importance.” There are two different types of PPEs being used by the PRC. The basic set is the standard set used by frontline workers coordinating with the families of suspected patients. The frontline set is for staff who have direct contact with confirmed cases, such as those assigned in ambulances. These staff are required to wear three-layered clothing, double masks (medical N95 and surgical masks), and double gloves for extra protection. “We have prepositioned PPE sets to our key chapters with international airports and to PRC regional warehouses because we want to make sure that the PPEs are available to chapters whenever needed.

The PRC has been vigilant in monitoring suspected cases of nCoV in the country and has been promoting health and hygiene activities such as the proper washing of hands as part of its prevention intervention. As part of its response mechanism, the PRC ensures that ambulance crew are properly trained in infection precaution. Welfare desks are also established in airports and in hospitals, while sufficient blood supply is ensured.

Initially, it expressed objection to the health department’s plan to turn nearby Athletes’ Village into a quarantine site. “Capas can only move forward and throw its all-out support to this nationally-led endeavor,” Catacutan said in a statement. “Let’s all face all the challenges brought by the nCoV (novel coronavirus) and let’s all unite amid concerns, which are now already addressed by the national government’s efforts,” he added in Filipino.

(KEITH BACONGCO / MANILA BULLETIN) “We have no confirmed case in Davao yet but the problem is, if in case several will get infected, our hospitals cannot accommodate hundreds and thousands of people getting sick. Our game plan is to ensure that nobody gets sick,” Duterte told reporters during a press conference on Monday. Except for Thanksgiving Mass that will push through on March 1, the events that have been cancelled are asiugdang Pagsaulog, Reyna Dabawenya, Ginoong Davao, Sayaw Pinoy, Kalingawan sa Sta. Ana, Hudyaka, Mutya ng Dabaw, Pasidungog, Araw ng Empleyado, Kanta Bidabawenyo, Parada Dabawenyo, and the Datu Bago Awards, she said. “If you have sore throat, cough, fever, and other flu-like symptoms, do not travel in or out of Davao City. Seek medical assistance immediately,” she said. Duterte said she anticipates that it would have an adverse impact on the tourism but maintained that the cancellation would be enforced to avoid the transmission of the deadly virus to local tourists. The city posted a total of 2,573,990 arrivals last year, an increase of 7.55-percent from 2,393,384 in 2018, according to the City Tourism Office. Starting February 11, Duterte said the local government would implement a permanent ban on “welcome and send-off groups” at airports, seaports, bus terminals, and other transportation hubs “not only because of the virus but for reasons of safety and security. Only employees, workers, drivers, and passengers are allowed to enter these places, Duterte said. She added that she already asked the Department of Trade and Industry to ensure that the price freeze memorandum of the Department of Health and other pertinent regulations on goods and commodities are strictly enforced. She warned that she would cancel the business permits and padlock permanently stores selling overpriced items and hoarding food and other supplies. The mayor also ordered the city’s schools, offices, and business establishments to “come up with guidelines to ensure that students and employees who are sick are not allowed entry to the school or workplace.” Tags: ncov"

WELCOME TO BAGUIO! – This is what a performer seems to be saying as she participates in the kick-off event of the Baguio Flower Festival, or ‘Panagbenga,’ which was a parade of seven drum and lyre bands from high and elementary schools in Baguio City. (JJ LANDINGIN / MANILA BULLETIN FILE PHOTO) The landscaping competition is one of the highlights of the 25th edition of the Panagbenga, popularly known as the Baguio Flower Festival. Magalong said the city government understands the plight of the exhibitors and he is inclined to grant the request of the flower festival organizers and the exhibitors for a one-month extension of their ongoing operation for them to be able to recover their investments in the said activity. The month-long Baguio Blooms Exposition and Exhibition was formally opened by flower festival organizers last February 1 to jumpstart the 25th edition of the Panagbenga and provide residents and visitors with landscape attractions and flower-inspired handicrafts and souvenir items. Magalong explained that the temporary postponement of the major crowd drawing events in the city was a product of consultations with the concerned health authorities and upon consideration of the health and safety of the people. The interest of the business sector is also being considered in the decision-making processes and protocols that had been established but what will prevail will be the welfare of the general populace, particularly when it comes to the issue of health and security of the people who will be exposed to extreme danger once there is an influx of people to the event areas. Exhibitors aired their sentiment and complained that their supposed lucrative operation was significantly affected by the 2019 nCoV scare that resulted in the eventual postponement of the Panagbenga grand opening parade and other major crowd-drawing events in the city. Originally, the site of the market encounter was within the Camp John Hay (CJH) area before it was transferred to the Burnham Lake Drive where it was able to gain its market as it was located right at the heart of the city. The venue for the same event was transferred to the Baguio Convention Center grounds this year as the city government made its position clear that it will not allow the use of the Burnham Lake Drive as a vending area as it creates grave traffic congestion around the central business district, especially at the height of the major flower festival events.

,"February 10, 2020, 3:20 PM",nCov,Virus transforms daily life on Hong Kong’s fearful streets,By Agence France-Presse,"By Agence France-Presse  People wearing protective face masks cross a street in Hong Kong on February 9, 2020, as a preventative measure after a coronavirus outbreak which began in the Chinese city of Wuhan. – The previously unknown virus has caused alarm because of its similarity to SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), which killed hundreds across mainland China and Hong Kong in 2002-2003. (Photo by DALE DE LA REY / AFP / MANILA BULLETIN) Many in the Asian financial hub of seven million — where the 2002-03 SARS outbreak killed 299 people — are weighing up their options against an unseen danger. “I feel like I’m in a washing machine with other pregnant women trying to figure out what to do,” says Natalie Belbin, 35, who is expecting her first child and frantically considering her choices. Her baby is due in early April, a period some experts warn could be the peak of the outbreak. Hong Kong’s already under-pressure public hospitals have asked partners and family not to attend births to reduce pressure onwards. Some expectant mothers in her WhatsApp groups are scraping together cash to go private, while others have travelled overseas or are considering it. Belbin is leaning towards staying the course despite knowing her partner may not be able to be there. “I’ve accepted that,” she said. “But my main concern now is whether the baby will be safe in the hospital.” Many of Hong Kong’s inhabitants are having similar discussions about life in a city that has firsthand experience of a deadly outbreak. In 2002-03 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS, swept through hospitals and homes. The epidemic left profound psychological scars and saddled locals with a deep distrust of authorities in Beijing who initially covered up the outbreak. With 36 cases of the novel coronavirus confirmed so far in Hong Kong, one of whom died, everyone fears a repeat. At the most extreme end, fear and distrust of authorities have sparked extraordinary, and at times unnecessary, scenes of panic. Supermarket shelves in many districts have been stripped of hand sanitisers, toilet paper, rice and pasta, spurred by false rumours of shortages that the government has condemned. An acute paucity of surgical masks is real however, with long queues whenever a consignment comes in. At one pharmacy last week a crowd of 10,000 people turned up, some camping out overnight. Kris Choi, a new mother, said trying to find masks is all her neighbours talk about these days. One 70-year-old neighbour was looking for ways to make her dwindling stock last longer. “I wanted to stop her from washing the surgical masks, but I don’t have more to share with her as I have elderly parents and a child to look after,” Choi told AFP. Attitudes have hardened compared to the city-wide solidarity that permeated Hong Kong during the SARS outbreak. Police have clashed with protesters opposed to arrivals from mainland China or quarantine facilities in their neighbourhoods. One planned quarantine block was even firebombed. Thousands of medics, including frontline doctors and nurses, went on strike last week calling for the border to be sealed. Hong Kong’s unelected pro-Beijing leaders eventually closed most land border crossings and began quarantining anyone coming from the mainland from Saturday. But even before the current health crisis, anti-government sentiment was at an all-time high after seven months of seething and often violent pro-democracy protests. The perceived slow response — and failure to stockpile enough masks despite the city’s previous experience with SARS — has only added to public anger. And the outbreak is also changing daily life in more mundane ways. With schools closed, children are cooped up in a city of notoriously small apartments. Teachers are trying to roll out online classes, playgrounds are empty. University students already had months of classes disrupted by the protests. Final-year students now fret about whether they’ll even graduate. Many Hong Kongers are avoiding the office and working from home. While the streets are far from deserted, they are eerily quiet in a city where a casual walk to the shops can often feel like a rugby match. For those that venture out, the pavements are uncharacteristically walkable, the subway commute refreshingly quiet and the traffic jams unusually absent. But for business owners — especially those in the tourist and entertainment sectors — the virus has only compounded their woes after the political unrest. Ila Ng has owned a bar in Lan Kwai Fong, the city’s most famous nightclub street, for 15 years. “It’s like a ghost town, it’s really depressing,” she told AFP, with takings since the outbreak down 50 percent. In the last few months, she has laid off three part-time staff and cut four live music nights to just one. Only a sympathetic landlord and a host of regular customers have kept her bar afloat. “We’re just hoping by summer it (the virus) will be contained,” she said. Tags: ncov"

Health Undersecretary Gerardo Bayugo(PCOO / MANILA BULLETIN) In a press briefing in Malacañang Monday, Health Undersecretary Gerardo Bayugo said there was still no evidence that supports reports of aerosol transmission of the virus. “Wala pa pong ganoong information na (There’s no information that the) disease [can be] transmitted by aerosol or by air. So yun pong (the) risk of getting [the] infection by air transmission, by aerosol, is wala pa pong scientific basis at wala pa po kaming nakukuhang report (has no scientific basis as of now and we have not received any report on that),” he said. “We’ve been in contact with experts at Geneva and we are raising all these concerns maski medyo nakakatawa (no matter how funny it is) from the medical point of view. But hindi po namin pinapalampas (we are not disregarding anything), we are throwing it to them, and wala po. Wala pa pong ganoon (so far there are no reports like that),” he added. China Daily said in a report over the weekend that Shanghai officials revealed that the 2019-nCoV ARD can be transmitted via air. However, Xinhua News Agency said that there was no evidence that the virus can be transmitted via aerosol. In its report, Xinhua quoted Feng Luzhao, a researcher of infectious diseases with the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, saying the 2019-nCoV normally does not suspend or float in the air for long. It was earlier reported that the virus is mainly transmitted via respiratory droplets and contact. The DOH said there were 37,558 cases of the 2019-nCoV ARD all over the world as of February 9, 2020. Of the said figure, 813 have died and 812 of those were from China. The case fatality rate was reported to be at 2.16 percent. The Philippines recorded its first case, a Chinese woman from Wuhan, China, of the 2019-nCoV ARD late last month. Last week, the country reported the third positive case of the virus, a 60-year-old Chinese woman who is also from the reported origin of the virus. The Philippines likewise saw the first fatality outside China with the death of a 44-year-old Chinese patient from Wuhan on February 1. Tags: ncov"

Lawyer Jose Paolo Evangelista, chief of the City Information Office (CHO), said the City Health Office (CHO) has started monitoring these residents since last week. A staff from the City Epidemiology and Surveillance Unit (CESU) told media here that they assigned one staff to each PUM and reports to them daily.  These health personnel, she added, wear face mask and other protective gears whenever they engaged the PUMs. The PUMs were told to do self-quarantine for 14 days, the CESU added.  As of Saturday, these persons are still looking healthy or have no signs of any sickness. The CESU refused to identify the PUMs and the places where they are being quarantined to prevent panic among residents. Some PUMs are reportedly feeling ostracized especially when their neighbors learned they were strictly being monitored by the health office. Evangelista assured the public that they have nothing to worry about since the PUMs do not have cough, fever, body malaise, and sore throat even if they travelled to China a few days ago. The PUMs are all Filipinos, he said. On Sunday, the Department of Health (DoH) in Soccsksargen region reported its first patient-under-investigation for nCoV.

The Diamond Princess has been in quarantine since arriving off the Japanese coast early last week (AFP / MANILA BULLETIN) The Diamond Princess has been in quarantine since arriving off the Japanese coast early last week after the virus was detected in a former passenger who got off the ship last month in Hong Kong. “Test results from 103 people have now come out and 65 of them are confirmed positive for the new coronavirus,” the ministry said in a statement without giving further details such as their nationalities. Authorities have continued to test people for the virus where “necessary”, the statement added. The cruise ship operator said 66 people had been newly diagnosed, mostly Japanese, but there were also Australians, Filipinos and a Canadian, a Brit and a Ukrainian. There was no immediate clarity on the discrepancy between that figure and the health ministry’s. When the boat arrived off Japan, authorities initially tested nearly 300 people for the virus of the 3,711 on board, gradually evacuating dozens who were infected to local medical facilities. In recent days, testing has expanded to those with new symptoms or who had close contact with other infected passengers or crew, and several more cases were reported over the weekend. Those who remain on the ship have been asked to stay inside their cabins and allowed only briefly onto open decks. They have been asked to wear masks and keep a distance from each other when outside, and given thermometers to regularly monitor their temperatures. The ship is expected to stay in quarantine until February 19 — 14 days after the isolation period began. ‘Stress and high anxiety’  The quarantine has made life on board the ship difficult, particularly for those in windowless interior cabins and a significant number of passengers who require medication for various chronic conditions. The health ministry said Monday that around 600 people on board urgently needed medication, and around half received supplies over the weekend. Health Minister Katsunobu Kato told reporters that discussions were ongoing about how to increase testing capacity and also whether testing would take place after passengers are released from quarantine. The World Health Organization confirmed in a tweet that newly diagnosed cases on the ship should not extend the length of the quarantine. “The quarantine period of the #DiamondPrincess will come to an end on 19 February,” the WHO said in a tweet. “The period will be extended beyond the 19 Feb as appropriate only for close contacts of newly confirmed cases. They need to remain in quarantine for 14 days from last contact with a confirmed case.” On board the ship, news of the additional infections sparked worry for some, with passenger Yardley Wong tweeting “stress and high anxiety”. “I need to cry to get off the anxiety,” she wrote. Passengers also tweeted pictures of new supplies delivered to the quarantined passengers on Monday: wet wipes and heavy-duty filtration face masks. There are 26 confirmed cases of the new virus in Japan apart from the infections on board the ship, among them citizens evacuated from Wuhan, the Chinese city where the outbreak emerged. Japan is planning to send a fifth evacuation flight to Wuhan later this week, local media said. The outbreak has caused economic havoc, forcing firms to suspend operations in China and causing supply chain problems elsewhere. Nissan said Monday it was carrying out “temporary supply adjustments” at its Kyushu plant as a result of a shortage in the supply of parts from China. It said it will restart operations at its Huadu and Dalian plants in China on February 17 “at the earliest.” “Restart dates for other plants will differ,” it added.

(MANILA BULLETIN) In a press briefing in Malacañang, Bello said DOLE’s reintegration program for OFWs affected by the 2019-nCoV ARD scare includes financial assistance, livelihood assistance, and alternative employment abroad. Bello said DOLE has given P10,000 to each OFW affected by the travel ban to China and its special administrative regions Hong Kong and Macau. He added that his agency has also given P20,000 to each of the OFWs repatriated from Wuhan, China over the weekend as they will stay in the country “for good.” “Ang minimum assistance namin sa OFWs ay P20,000. Hindi ‘yan pautang, bigay ‘yan (Our minimum assistance to our FWs is P20,000. That is not a loan. We will give it to them),” Bello said. “It can go as high as P1 million depende sa business na papasukan nila. Ito ay interest-free (depending on the nature of the business they want to start. This is interest-free),” he added. However, the Labor Secretary said OFWs who are only in the Philippines for a vacation are not qualified for financial assistance. Meanwhile, Bello assured that if the 2019-nCoV ARD situation in the country improves, DOLE could recommend the lifting of the travel. He said Health Secretary Francisco Duque III asked for two weeks so he can observe the developments before taking any recommendatory action on the ban. Taiwan, too? Health Undersecretary Gerardo Bayugo announced during the same press briefing that the Inter-agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Disease was considering to include Taiwan in the travel ban. “A resolution will be released for the inclusion of Taiwan in the travel ban, but it’s not yet final. It will still be discussed,” he said. The Philippines has implemented a travel ban on foreign travelers from China, Hong Kong, and Macau after the Department of Health confirmed the first case of the 2019-nCoV ARD in the country. There have been 18 confirmed cases of the virus in Taiwan, with no fatalities. According to Bello, there are about 120,000 documented OFWs in Taiwan but said the figure may reach 200,000 if the undocumented OFWs are taken into account. Tags: ncov"

WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned that confirmed cases of coronavirus being transmitted by people who have never travelled to China could be the ‘tip of the iceberg’ (AFP Photo/Fabrice COFFRINI) Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus’ remarks come as members of a WHO-led “international expert mission” flew to China on Monday to help coordinate a response to the outbreak that has so far infected more than 40,000 people and killed 908 in the country. “There’ve been some concerning instances of onward #2019nCoV spread from people with no travel history to (China),” Ghebreyesus tweeted Sunday, using the virus’s provisional scientific name. “The detection of a small number of cases may indicate more widespread transmission in other countries; in short, we may only be seeing the tip of the iceberg.” While the virus’ spread outside China appeared to be slow, Ghebreyesus warned it could accelerate. “Containment remains our objective, but all countries must use the window of opportunity created by the containment strategy to prepare for the virus’s possible arrival,” he said. Outside mainland China, there have been more than 350 infections reported in nearly 30 places. There have been two deaths, one in the Philippines and the other in Hong Kong. Several countries have banned arrivals from China while major airlines have suspended flights, and Air China cancelled some of its flights to the United States. The WHO-led mission to China is being headed up by Bruce Aylward, a veteran of previous health emergencies, Ghebreyesus said. Aylward oversaw the WHO’s 2014-2016 response to the Ebola epidemic in West Africa. WHO said in recent days there had been “some stabilising” in the numbers of new cases of the coronavirus in China. But the UN agency cautioned it was too early to say if the virus had peaked. The SARS-like virus is believed to have emerged late last year in the central city of Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province where millions of people are under lockdown in a bid to stop it spreading.

,"February 10, 2020, 12:29 PM",nCov,DFA explains why some Filipinos in Hubei stayed behind,By Roy Mabasa,"By Roy Mabasa Some Filipinos in Hubei Province have opted to “stay behind” due to the improved facilities in the area and for fear of losing their jobs after the Philippine government imposed travel restrictions on certain parts of China, including Wuhan City, the epicenter of the 2019 novel Coronavirus.  Department of Foreign Affairs (MANILA BULLETIN) This was the explanation given by the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) in response to questions on why only 30 of the 56 Filipinos who earlier signified their intention to be repatriated made it home on Sunday. “There are so many reasons for that but principally because of what was happening on the ground. Basically, things and circumstances were always changing. For one, a family of four had a change of heart. For another, the facilities in Wuhan were constantly improving with the building of two new hospitals to cater to nCoV patients, including PUIs (persons under investigation) and PUMs (persons under monitoring),” according to Paola Ebora of the DFA’s Office of Strategic Communications and Research (OSCR). Ebora said the Filipinos in China’s most affected city may have been thinking that it would be better for them to stay back because the 14-day quarantine may hamper their activities and could be rendered useless. In addition, the DFA information officer noted the fact that these Filipinos cannot return to their work and their lives in Hubei because of the Philippine government’s restriction to travel to any part of China from the Philippines. “So, it’s all these and more that made our people pull back, such that in the end, some had decided they wanted to stay behind,” she added. On whether there is a second batch of repatriates from Wuhan, Ebora said the DFA will have to look at the demand, saying “people have started to hunker down with the diminishing numbers, improving facilities and general improvement of the situation in Wuhan and Hubei.” She noted that the repatriation was organized mainly for the Filipinos and their families in Wuhan and Hubei Province in general “because of the existing lockdown where they couldn’t move even if they wanted to.” On the other hand, she said freedom of movement is still available in other parts of China subject to the Chinese guidelines on disease containment and subject to Chinese procedures for Customs, Immigration and Quarantine (CIQ) clearances.

The comments from Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus came as a team of WHO experts departed for China, led by Bruce Aylward, a veteran of previous health emergencies. In an attempt to contain the virus, cities in Hubei have been locked down and transport links countrywide were cut to stop the movement of hundreds of millions of people who usually visit family during the annual Lunar New Year holiday. Officially the Lunar New Year holiday was extended by only three days, but many cities and provinces pushed the deadline until February 10. The unprecedented measures have turned cities into ghost towns, with people staying inside. But there were some signs Monday of the country beginning to make a return to normality. Roads in Beijing and Shanghai had significantly more traffic than in recent days and the southern city of Guangzhou said it would start to resume normal public transport from Monday. But for those at work, it was not an easy balance to strike. “Of course we’re worried,” said a 25-year-old man surnamed Li in a beauty salon in Beijing, which reopened Monday. “When customers come in, we first take their temperature, then use disinfectant and ask them to wash their hands.” Work, interrupted However, tens of millions of people in Hubei province were not returning to work, as the province – the epicenter of the outbreak – remained under lockdown. Even outside the quarantined province, many companies were limiting staff. The Shanghai government suggested reducing large gatherings of people through staggered work schedules, suspending central air systems, avoiding group meals and keeping at least one metre away from work colleagues. Online office communication tool DingTalk said in a Weibo post last week that nearly 200 million people were using the platform to work from home. The American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai said 60 percent of its member companies were planning mandatory work-from-home policies. State media reported that passenger numbers on the Beijing subway was down by about 50 percent Monday compared to a normal work day. Large shopping malls in the capital were deserted. A bank employee in Shanghai told AFP he was heading to work for a half-day, with other employees taking over in the afternoon. The rest of the day, staff are instructed to work from home. “It makes our work more difficult because we need to access the systems in our office,” he said. Other employers, including auto manufacturer Toyota, simply delayed work for another week. Schools and universities across the country remained shut. Difficult journeys Those returning to work faced fresh travel difficulties. The eastern city of Wuxi said anyone trying to enter the city from provinces with high numbers of cases would be “persuaded to go back” while Suzhou city, near the financial hub of Shanghai, suspended all passenger transport to the surrounding counties. “I just checked and it would takes 18 hours for me to go to work by bicycle,” wrote one frustrated commuter on Weibo. “It’s time to work now. Should I walk???” wrote another. On Saturday, travel authorities said there were 11 million journeys by train, road or plane – 84 percent down on the same day last year. The tourism industry remains in the doldrums, with several countries banning arrivals from China, major airlines suspending flights and international and domestic tour groups being halted.  ‘Tip of the iceberg’ The death toll from the novel coronavirus has overtaken global fatalities in the 2002-03 SARS epidemic, when China drew international condemnation for covering up cases. The WHO has praised the measures Beijing has taken this time, while warning figures could still “shoot up”. WHO chief Tedros said there had been some “concerning instances” of cases overseas in people with no travel history to China. “We may only be seeing the tip of the iceberg” of these cases, he tweeted. Meanwhile in Hong Kong, thousands of people stranded aboard the World Dream cruise ship for five days were allowed to disembark Sunday after its 1,800 crew tested negative for the new coronavirus. The ship carried three Chinese passengers to Vietnam between January 19 and 24 who were later found to be infected with the SARS-like coronavirus. READ MORE: WHO warns overseas virus spread may be ‘tip of the iceberg’ More coronavirus cases However, testing aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan has found 60 more confirmed cases of coronavirus, local media reported on Monday. That takes the number of coronavirus cases on the ship docked in Yokohama, south of Tokyo, to 130, according to domestic broadcasters TBS and NHK, citing Japanese health ministry sources. The health ministry’s communication office had no information on the report when contacted by Reuters. Among those tested positive for the 2019-nCoV are four Filipinos, the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) said Monday. Quoting a report from the Philippine embassy in Tokyo, the DFA said the four Filipinos tested positive yesterday, bringing to five the total number of nCoV cases. “They are now being treated in hospitals in Japan,” the DFA said in a statement. The four Filipinos are all crewmembers of the cruise ship that is currently docked in Yokohama, Japan. The Diamond Princess was placed on a two-week quarantine on arriving at Yokohama on Feb. 3 after a man who disembarked in Hong Kong was diagnosed with the virus. About 3,700 people are aboard the ship, which usually has a crew of 1,100 and a passenger capacity of 2,670. Passengers have been allowed on decks in shifts to get fresh air and encouraged to regularly take their temperature. The health ministry is separating infection counts on the ship from those discovered within Japan. The disease has killed 908 people, predominantly in mainland China, and infected more than 40,000.

Likewise, there is no evidence yet that flies and other insects could become carriers of the 2019-nCoV, Philippine Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) Undersecretary Jonathan Malaya said. Malaya issued the statement to to allay any concerns arising from the use of the Athletes’ Village at the New Clark City in Capas, Tarlac, as quarantine facility. READ MORE: DOH: No basis of 2019-nCoV’s aerosol transmission WHO, however, reiterated the importance of proper hand-washing using soap and water “after contact with pets.” “This protects you against various common bacteria such as E.Coli and Salmonella that can pass between pets and humans,” said the WHO. Tedros had emphasized the importance of “facts not fear” about the novel coronavirus. “People must have access to accurate information to protect themselves and others. While the virus spreads, misinformation makes the job of our heroic health workers even harder,” he said. “It is diverting the attention of decision makers, it causes confusion, and spreads fear to the general public,” he added.

Department of Foreign Affairs (MANILA BULLETIN) Dr. Neptali Labasan, a member of the eight-man HERT that accompanied 30 Filipinos from Wuhan back to the Philippines on Sunday, said the low number of evacuees may be because some live too far away. “Ang alam ko sa mga kasama ko sa DFA, unofficial ito, sabi masyadong malayo ‘yung iba (What I know from my colleagues at the DFA, they said some live too far away),” he said in an interview on DZBB Monday morning. On Sunday, an eight-man team with members from the DFA and Department of Health flew to Wuhan to pick up the 30 Filipinos who sought to be repatriated amid the spread of the deadly 2019-novel coronavirus. Labasan was also put under quarantine along with the 30 repatriated Filipinos at Athlete’s Village in New Clark City in Capas, Tarlac. “Ito talaga ang trabaho namin. Nasa frontline kapag may infectious disease na nangyayari (This is our job. We are on the frontlines when there is an outbreak of infectious diseases),” he said. Labasan said each patient was given their own room. Families who opt to stay in one room together can do so. He said the food that they receive is packed for safety and sanitary purposes. The staff in the area also run errands for them. The patients’ temperature and vital signs are checked twice a day, he added. They are also given cellphone privileges so they can call their family and loved ones and update them on their condition. Wuhan is the epicenter of the 2019-novel coronavirus that has claimed the lives of over 900 people and has infected over 40,000 people worldwide. The Philippines has had three confirmed cases of the virus, all involving Chinese nationals from Wuhan, China. One of them, a 44-year-old man, died due to the infection. The other two, both women aged 38 and 60, are said to be recovering from the virus. Read more: 32 Filipinos return from Wuhan Tags: ncov"

The forum is organized in collaboration with the Global Research Collaboration for Infectious Disease Preparedness. Participants such as the world’s leading scientists to public health agencies and research funders– are expected to discuss and share research results and insights that include the identification of the source of the virus and sharing of biological samples and genetic sequences. “Experts will build on existing SARS and MERS coronavirus research and identify knowledge gaps and research priorities in order to accelerate scientific information and medical products most needed to minimize the impact of the 2019-nCoV outbreak,” WHO said. SARS, or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, killed more or less 800 people from November, 2002, to July, 2003. It originated from the southern part of China. MERS, or Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, is also a deadly viral infection that caused the death of more than 800 people worldwide since 2012. “Harnessing the power of science is critical for bringing this outbreak under control,” said Ghebreyesus. WHO stated that the meeting ‘is expected to produce a global research agenda for the new coronavirus, setting priorities and frameworks that can guide which projects are undertaken first.’ “This will also fast-track the development and evaluation of effective diagnostic tests, vaccines and medicines, while establishing mechanisms for affordable access to vulnerable populations and facilitating community engagement,” the statement read.

The Chinese president was “grateful for the supplies donated by various sections of US society,” Xinhua added. Xi underscored the need for the countries worldwide to pool their efforts in the prevention and control of the global virus outbreak, which he recognized, is currently at a crucial stage. “China hopes that the United States will assess the epidemic in a calm manner, and adopt and adjust its response measures in a reasonable way,” Xi said in a report by Xinhua. The two countries, he added, can “maintain communication, strengthen coordination, and work together to contain the epidemic.” Trump expressed confidence in the ability of China under Xi’s leadership to address the epidemic. “The fact that China completed building special hospitals for novel coronavirus patients in an incredibly short time is impressive, and shows China’s outstanding organizational and response capabilities,” it said.

But it has taken nearly two weeks to get the government’s green light on its composition, which was not announced, other than to say that WHO veteran Dr. Bruce Aylward, a Canadian epidemiologist and emergencies expert, was heading it. “I’ve just been at the airport seeing off members of an advance team for the @WHO-led #2019nCoV international expert mission to #China, led by Dr. Bruce Aylward, a veteran of past public health emergencies,” Tedros said in a tweet from Geneva. Dr. Sylvie Briand, who accompanied Tedros last month and stayed behind for talks with top Chinese health officials, told Reuters last week that they were discussing a list of experts with China. “Because it is a joint mission, they need to be on board, it’s not just an international group going there. We have about 15 people,” said Briand, director of Global Infectious Hazard Preparedness at WHO. China raised the death toll from the coronavirus outbreak to 811 on Sunday, passing the number killed globally by the SARS epidemic, as authorities made plans for millions of people returning to work after an extended Lunar New Year break. [L4N2A9045] The virus, which has spread to two dozen countries, has killed some 2% of more than 37,550 cases worldwide, with 99 percent of infections in China, WHO figures show. The WHO declared the outbreak a global emergency on Jan. 30, days after the Chinese central government imposed a lockdown on 60 million people in Hubei province and its capital Wuhan, the epicenter of the virus that emerged in December in a seafood market. Tedros said on Saturday that he hoped the team would include experts from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC). “It has to be meaningful on the ground,” Lawrence Gostin, professor of global health law at Georgetown Law, said in an interview in Geneva this week. Gostin called for a “genuine partnership with transparent flows of information and accountability for the response”, adding that there should be a strong CDC presence. “CDC has got no peer in terms of its experience and technical expertise in dealing with international outbreaks,” he said. “But the other benefit is the smart diplomacy, what it could signal is that despite all of our differences in ideology, trade, politics, that when faced with a common threat to humanity, we come together as a human community to tackle it,” Gostin said.

Passengers queue up to disembark from the World Dream cruise ship in Hong Kong (AFP Photo/Philip FONG) Health authorities in the semi-autonomous Asian financial hub said the crew and a similar number of passengers had been released from a quarantine imposed because of fears some staff could have contracted the deadly virus on a previous voyage and passed it on. The World Dream carried three Chinese passengers to Vietnam between January 19 and 24 who were later found to be infected with the SARS-like coronavirus, which has killed more than 800 people in China since it emerged in December. The government grounded the ship on its arrival in Hong Kong Wednesday while tests were carried out on the crew, but said the passengers need not undergo examination as they had no contact with the three sick holidaymakers on the January trip. First found in the city of Wuhan in central China last December, the virus has infected more than 37,200 people on the Chinese mainland and at least 36 in Hong Kong. The passengers and crew isolated on the vessel had been expecting to stay aboard until Tuesday after Hong Kong authorities said testing would take at least four days. But chief port health officer Leung Yiu-hong said Sunday “all tests have results this afternoon and are all negative”. He added that passenger testing was deemed unnecessary because they were at relatively low risk. All 3,600 onboard will not be required to self-quarantine after leaving. As he left the ship, passenger Rocky Chan said quarantine conditions had been “okay”, though his time on board had caused him a few problems. “My job was somewhat affected due to the time I had to spend here,” he said, but added that a letter he received from the Department of Health should smooth out any issues. Vice-president of marketing at Dream Cruises, Phoebe Yip Ching-man, said the company arranged for dozens of coaches to take passengers into the city, while free hotel rooms were booked for the more than 100 foreign passport holders on board who needed them. Hong Kong on Saturday began enforcing a 14-day quarantine period on all people arriving from mainland China in a fresh bid to curb the spread of the virus. The city’s health minister on Sunday morning said 468 people had so far been ordered to stay at home, in hotel rooms or at a government quarantine camp since the policy took effect. Tags: ncov"

There are now more than 39,800 confirmed cases across China, based on previously released figures from the government. The new virus is believed to have emerged last year in a market that sells wild animals in Hubei’s capital Wuhan, the city at the centre of the outbreak, before spreading across the country. The World Health Organization (WHO) said Saturday that the number of cases being reported daily in China was “stabilising”, although the health body warned it was too early to say if the virus had peaked. A WHO “international expert mission” left late Sunday for China, the agency’s director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Twitter. The only confirmed fatalities outside the mainland are a Chinese man in the Philippines and a 39-year-old man in Hong Kong. The toll has overtaken the global number of deaths caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) virus, which killed 774 people in 2002-03. Tags: ncov"

Test results are still coming in as passengers on the Diamond Princess face a two-week quarantine against the virus, which has killed hundreds of people, most of them in China. Japanese authorities had earlier tested 279 people on board the cruise ship, finding 64 of them were infected with the coronavirus. Aside from infections on board the ship, Japan has reported 26 cases. The Diamond Princess was quarantined after a former passenger who disembarked in Hong Kong last month was diagnosed with the virus. There were more than 3,700 passengers and crew on the ship when it arrived off Japan’s coast last week. Dozens have been taken to hospital and around 3,600 people, many of them elderly, were still onboard on Sunday. It was not clear whether Japanese authorities would conduct tests on all of them. The ship docked in Yokohama on Sunday to resupply for a quarantine that could last until February 19. Local reports said Japan’s health authorities brought urgently needed drugs and other medical supplies to some 500 people. About 100 said they had a fever or felt unwell, according to the reports. Passengers on the ship have been asked to stay inside their cabins to prevent new infections with some expressing confusion and frustration.

A passenger shows an illustration of the coronavirus on his mobile phone at Guangzhou airport in Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China, 23 January 2020. (EPA-EFE / ALEX PLAVEVSKI / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN) Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) Undersecretary for Civilian Security and Consular Concerns of the Philippines Brigido J. Dulay said the Philippines had a high regard for China that it will be able to rebound from this unfortunate fate with reinforced vigor and strength. Being an ally of China and having a great respect for human lives, the Philippines donated surgical masks, protection suits, medical gloves, sanitation products and goggles to Hubei province, the epicenter of the nCoV outbreak that will further improve the diplomatic ties between the two countries. Dulay said the “assistance is our affirmation of the abiding friendship and legacy of mutual aid that has been the hallmark of Philippine-Chinese ties over the years.” “To the people of China, we say ‘Jiayou’ (Be strong)!” Dulay added. Also, Namibia’s ruling party, the South West Africa People’s Organization (SWAPO), gave China its untiring support in the fight against the epidemic. In a letter of SWAPO Secretary General Sophia Shaningwa, the group “expressed its confidence that the Communist Party of China (CPC) and the Chinese people will overcome the epidemic’’. “SWAPO party solidly stands with the CPC and the people of China,” said Shaningwa, adding that China will “definitely” contain the spread of the virus. Not to be outdone, the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association (CCBA) and Chinese language newspaper, the Sing Tao Daily (West USA), in the United States announced a donation of more than $15,000 dollars in China’s fight against the epidemic. Ding Bong Lee, presiding president of San Francisco-based CCBA, expressed overwhelming emotions by the donation collected in less than 10 days. “We all should get united, whether in the United States or back in China, to make concerted efforts to fight the virus,” Lee said. But Lee has recognized the humongous task ahead will require the influx of more resources to win the anti-virus battle while having faith that “China is strong enough to overcome the challenge’’. Michalis Voniatis, a Cypriot specialist in infectious diseases, told Xinhua that Chinese authorities are doing their best and most to prevent the spread of the novel Coronavirus. The former World Health Organization expert said China did not hesitate to take measures to contain the epidemic, noting that the government was even able to build within 10 days two makeshift hospitals to receive coronavirus-infected patients in Wuhan. Ian Jones, professor of virology at the British University of Reading, said China’s response to the novel coronavirus has been rapid, practical and efficient. The latest molecular techniques were used and the data released quickly, allowing diagnostic tests to be developed, Jones added.

It’s for my work, for my life, and I want to contribute to the society to realize a little self-value.” Guo, who delivers goods for Dada-JD Daojia, an online grocery, and delivery arm of JD.com, is one of thousands of workers that are keeping Chinese residents supplied as they isolate themselves at home. The authorities have ordered people to stay indoors and away from crowded, public areas. The coronavirus, which started in Wuhan city in central Hebei province in December, has killed more than 800 people and infected over 37,000 in China. Many migrant workers like Guo had already made the long trek home to see their families, but companies recalled workers, urging them to serve their communities and offering to triple their salaries. To assuage the anxieties felt by customers, firms such as Yum China’s fried chicken chain KFC, Alibaba Holdings’ Ele.me, Meituan Dianping and JD.com have rolled out no-touching “contactless delivery,” and some meal deliveries come with notes detailing the temperature readings of the workers who prepared and delivered the food. “I have to say I’m indeed worried,” said Guo, when asked about how he felt about his own safety. “Sometimes I’m nervous even if I have a little cough. That’s why I have a thermometer at home and, sometimes when I come back, I’ll check my body temperature.” While the coronavirus outbreak has hit sectors such as hospitality and tourism hard, it has shored up demand for mobile and online firms, such as short video apps and games as well as for meal and grocery delivery firms. Most of those staying at home have been focused on buying the essentials. JD.com said the sales of vegetables, eggs and rice by its supermarket chain 7Fresh each surged on average by about 300% during this period compared with last year’s Spring Festival. China will sputter towards normal on Monday after holiday extensions authorities made to the Lunar New Year holiday end, but many shops are expected to still remain shut with workers being asked to work from home. Huge Chinese cities, including Beijing and Shanghai, currently look like ghost towns.

The physician handling the PUIs is now considering the patients for discharge. On Friday, February 7 the 31-year-old Chinese woman tourist was discharged from a hospital here for also testing negative for nCoV. As such, there are still seven PUIs in Bohol, to include the two American tourists. The other PUIs are the three nurses who attended to the nCoV-positive 60-year-old Chinese woman from Wuhan, China, and the remaining two are a crewmember and passenger of a fastcraft which the same Chinese woman took in her trip from Cebu to Bohol. The two Americans were tourists who travelled to Beijing, China from the USA and then to Coron and El Nido in Palawan before proceeding to Bohol. Because of their history of contact with the nCoV-positive 60-year-old woman, the three nurses were treated as PUIs based on the Department of Health protocol, and placed in private hospital isolation for proper case management, Lopez said The ship crew and passenger had themselves assessed in a government hospital for cough in response to the contact-tracing call of the government health authorities. The two American PUIs are confined in isolation also at a government hospital. Lopez further clarified that PUIs are not yet considered nCoV cases, much less a confirmed case. A person is treated as a PUI if he/she has previous direct contact with a confirmed nCoV case, has come from China, or has passed through China before arriving to the Philippines. Lopez added that their contact-tracing of the workers of a Panglao hotel where the Chinese woman checked in and of the driver of the van that transported her to the hospital yielded symptom-negative.

Self-isolation with monitoring was observed for these students. They have been cleared by the DOH/IPHO by the DOH/IPHO of Negros Oriental. Tags: ncov"

Immigration Spokesperson Dana Sandoval (PCOO) Dana Sandoval, BI spokesperson, in an interview by ABS-CBN News, said: “Sa unang tingin maraming senyales na isa itong fake news (Upon first glance, there are a lot of signs that indicate that this is fake news).” Sandoval also told ABS-CBN News that they have so far not received any official report on the incident. The government has imposed a travel ban on passengers coming from China, Macau and Hong Kong which have been affected by 2019 novel coronavirus acute respiratory disease (nCoV ARD). Based on the travel ban, only Filipinos and foreigners with permanent resident visa coming from the said places are allowed to enter the country. Passengers who show symptoms consistent with nCoV ARD infection may still be allowed entry after they undergo a 14-day quarantine period. There have been news reports of quarantine patients in other countries trying to escape, however, in the Philippines, there has been no incident of this nature. As of this posting, all 82 persons who reported were in contact with the two Chinese visitors who tested positive for nCoV ARD infection have been accounted for.

Vice President Leni Robredo(Juan Carlo de Vela / MANILA BULLETIN FILE PHOTO) Justice Secretary Menardo Guevarra has directed the NBI to investigate all fake news involving the 2019-nCoV and find out who were behind these misinformations. “Sana i-activate iyan tungkol sa kahit anong bagay, kahit anong issue, kahit sino ‘yung nabiktima. Kasi hindi nakakatulong sa bansa natin ‘yung hindi mo na alam kung ano iyong totoo at hindi,” she said on her Sunday radio show. (I hope that will be activated for whatever it may be, any issue, and whoever is the victim. Because it doesn’t help the country if you no longer know which is true or not.) The vice president made the statement in view of the latest allegation against her of living in a “luxury mansion” supposedly being paid by government, which she called “fake news.” She was referring to a commentary published recently by a national daily that claimed she was living in a mansion at New Manila, Quezon City with a monthly rent of P1 million. Robredo said the Quezon City Reception House in New Manila serves as her office, and it’s not her residence. “We are renting it from the Quezon city government which can attest we are not paying P1 million,” she said, adding her office was not also renting a separate mansion for her security personnel. The opposition leader then called on the public to report purveyors of fake news so they can be held liable. “Kailangan talagang panagutin dahil kung talagang legitimate itong newspaper, bakit ba sila papayag na magpapublish sila ng article na wala talagang basehan o hindi talaga totoo, kasinungalingan?” she said. (We have to make those responsible accountable because if this is really a legitimate newspaper, why did they allow to publish an article that is baseless or not true, a lie?) In her weekly radio show, Robredo also warned government officials against giving out conflicting statements because these may confuse the public. “They should be careful in making public statement because there is always presumption and regularity when it comes from a government official or agency,” she said in Filipino. Robredo was reacting to the latest incident involving Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana who refuted Presidential Spokesperson Salvador Panelo over the notice to terminate the Philippines-United States Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA).

(AP File Photo / DOH / MANILA BULLETIN) According to the health department, 30 of those repatriated were overseas Filipino workers (OFWs), while two are members of the Philippine consulate staff in China. The DOH said that the repatriates had undergone three levels of screening. The agency said that before they boarded the plane, the repatriates were screened to determine if they are symptomatic (has fever, cough, and colds) or asymptomatic (does not have any signs or symptoms). During the flight, the repatriates were closely monitored for the occurence of any signs and symptoms. Upon landing, they were again assessed if they developed signs and symptoms. The DOH assured that the repatriates are well-accommodated and closely monitored, and all basic necessities were provided–including hygiene kits and meals. The quarantine procedure is in coordination with the Bases Conversion and Development Authority and the Provincial Government of Tarlac, the DOH said. The DOH assured that the repatriates will be regularly monitored by medical personnel “to ensure their health and safety.” “If an individual, during his/her stay in the quarantine facility, suddenly shows signs and symptoms, the DOH had deployed medical teams to immediately assess and facilitate transfer to hospital for close monitoring,” the health department said. “The DOH will be taking charge of the management, coordination, and logistics of the entire quarantine process. Rest assured that repatriated OFWs (overseas Filipino workers) will be attended to and treated with utmost care,” it added. Meanwhile, the Code Blue Alert, which requires half of all hospital personnel to report for duty in order to provide medical assistance and services, has been raised to all hospitals under the DOH-Central Luzon Center for Health Development.

,"February 10, 2020, 12:23 PM",nCov,What’s in a name? WHO tiptoes around what to call virus,By Agence France-Presse,"By Agence France-Presse GENEVA  – Keen to avoid stigmatizing the city of Wuhan, where the outbreak began, or Chinese people, the World Health Organization is treading carefully on naming the new virus.  Coronavirus has spread around the world since it first emerged in Wuhan — but WHO will not name the virus after the city (AFP Photo/Manan VATSYAYANA/MANILA BULLETIN) The UN health agency’s official temporary name for the disease, which it has designated as a global health emergency, is “2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease.” The date refers to when it was first identified on December 31, 2019 and “nCoV” stands for “novel coronavirus” — the family of viruses it belongs to. “We thought it was very important that we provide an interim name so that no location was associated with the name,” Maria Van Kerkhove, head of WHO’s Emerging Diseases unit, told the agency’s executive board on Friday. “I’m sure you’ve all seen many media reports that are still calling it using Wuhan or China and we wanted to ensure that there was no stigma,” she said. The final decision on a name is expected within days and is up to the WHO itself as well as coronavirus experts on the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV). But picking a more specific name is fraught with dangers. Under a set of guidelines issued in 2015, WHO advises against using place names such as Ebola and Zika — where those diseases were first identified and which are now inevitably linked to them in the public imagination. Sylvie Briand, head of WHO’s Global Infectious Hazard Preparedness division, said this week that the use of a place name created “an unnecessary burden.” ‘Unnecessary and unhelpful profiling’ More general names such as “Middle East Respiratory Syndrome” or “Spanish flu” are also to be avoided as they can stigmatize entire regions or ethnic groups. “It is the responsibility of us all to ensure that there is no stigma associated with this disease, and the unnecessary and unhelpful profiling of individuals based on ethnicity is utterly and completely unacceptable,” said Michael Ryan, head of WHO’s Health Emergencies Programme. The WHO also points out that using animal species in the name can create confusion such as H1N1, which was popularly referred to as “swine flu.” This had a major effect for the pork industry even though the disease was being spread by people rather than pigs. H1N1 was also sometimes also called Mexican flu “which was not very nice for Mexican people,” Briand said. People’s names — usually the scientists who identified the disease — are also banned, as are “terms that incite undue fear” such as “unknown” or “fatal,” the WHO said. “We’ve seen certain disease names provoke a backlash against members of particular religious or ethnic communities, create unjustified barriers to travel, commerce and trade, and trigger needless slaughtering of food animals,” the WHO said in its guidelines. Instead, it recommended that any new name should be descriptive and include the causative pathogen if known, as well as being short and easy to pronounce. “We are really trying to be as neutral as possible, but as helpful as possible as well, because we need to name things with the same name everywhere in the world if we want to tackle the enemy in the same way,” Briand said.   Tags: ncov"

(MANILA BULLETIN) The orders were issued to curb the spread of the 2019 novel Coronavirus (nCoV), and in response to the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) and Department of Health (DOH) department orders that were issued over the weekend. In General Luna town, Mayor Matt Erwin Florido issued an urgent memorandum no. 1-2020 urging all OFWs, balikbayan and local tourists who traveled to China, Hongkong and Macau and are planning to go to the town that they should undergo 14-day self-quarantine even if they are not experiencing any symptoms of the virus. The order further stated that they should be monitored by public health workers, and have themselves registered with the Rural Health Unit. Florido also directed barangay chairmen and members of Sangguniang Barangay to report to the Municipal Health Officer the arrival of these persons in their respective villages. According to Florido’s memorandum, those tourists, OFWs and balikbayan are constrained from roaming at public places of the town, or mingling with relatives, friends and local residents, until such time that they have finished the 14-day self-quarantine, and is found to be nCoV-free. In Padre Burgos town, it was decided that the 103rd town day celebration scheduled on February 13-17 will be canceled, based on memorandum order no. 10 series 2020 issued by mayor Ruben Diokno. Though, both towns still remain negative of 2019 nCoV, but, in Padre Burgos, there is one recorded resident under monitoring and investigation (PUI) with symptoms and has a travel history outside the Philippines, Diokno said.  The said case has been properly managed by the health authorities with the pending release of diagnostic test results anytime soon, Diokno added. Diokno’s memorandum added that the Municipal Health Office has issued a recommendation on suspending any kind of activities and gatherings that require huge audiences for the safety of the entire populace.

China’s People’s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) Ba Yi aerobatics team perform an aerial display during a media preview of the Singapore Airshow in Singapore February 9, 2020. (REUTERS/Edgar Su/MANILA BULLETIN) Few deals are expected at the biennial event, where health warnings have triggered new safety measures and cast a shadow over airline profits and demand for airplanes. After years in which the airline industry has become used to weathering external shocks from epidemics to security threats, one of the industry’s leading showcases has itself been thrust into the spotlight as the number of deaths in mainland China, where the virus first erupted, rose above 800. More than 70 exhibitors have pulled out of the Feb. 11-16 show, usually a magnet for planemakers, suppliers and arms buyers due to strong demand for civil jetliners coupled with weapons demand fed by regional power rivalries. “Based on our assessment of the situation today…we have decided to proceed with the trade and public days,” said Tan Kong Hwee, assistant managing director of Singapore’s Economic Development Board. Organizers advised trade visitors to avoid shaking hands and to choose alternative forms of greeting such as bowing or waving hands. The number of public tickets available will be halved. Singapore on Friday raised its coronavirus alert level and reported more cases not linked to previous infections or travel to China. It advised non-essential large-scale events should be deferred or canceled, but said the air show would go ahead. Organizers said they were expecting more than 930 companies from 45 countries and 45,000 trade attendees – down from last time. In 2018, there were 54,000 trade attendees and 1,062 firms as the event contributed S$343 million ($247 million) to the local economy through hotels and other spending, according to organizers. The show also attracts high-level foreign delegations. Five delegates privately expressed surprise the show was going ahead, but organizers insisted they had a responsibility to those who wished to attend. “It has grown to such stature and importance it is a very important part of the entire ecosystem of the global aviation industry,” said Leck Chet Lam, managing director of Experia Events, partly owned by ST Engneering and government agencies and which manages the show and exhibition site. SUPERPOWER FLIGHT DISPLAY This year’s depleted gathering comes against the backdrop of slowing passenger growth in Asia, down to 4.2% in 2019 from 7% in 2018 as economies cool their recent expansion, according to the Association of Asia Pacific Airlines. “Already, there were signs of weakness in the cycle and then coronavirus comes along,” said Rob Morris, head consultant at UK-based Ascend by Cirium. “Given how much bigger China is today as a part of the global economy and the global airline traffic, the potential for impact is clearly much greater than it was for SARS back in the 2000s,” Morris said, referring to a 2002/2003 viral outbreak. The crisis further complicates a challenging picture caused by the 11-month-old grounding of Boeing’s 737 MAX, he added. Both Boeing and Airbus have reduced attendance at the show. Air freight, which feeds a significant proportion of Asian airline revenues, has had its weakest performance since the financial crisis in 2009 amid US-China trade tensions. This week’s show will still feature a rare head-to-head, superpower fighter display from the United States and China. The United States will fly the F-35B a month after it gave approval for Singapore to purchase up to 12 of the jets. Manufacturer Lockheed Martin Corp has, however, pulled out of show and the Pentagon has reduced its participation. The announcement of the first appearance of China’s People’s Liberation Army Air Force aerobatics team, Ba Yi, with J-10 fighters was a last-minute surprise, given Singapore’s travel restrictions due to the virus that led 10 Chinese exhibitors to pull out from the show.

A total of P25.5 million coming from the province’s disaster fund will be released, said Cebu Governor Gwen Garcia, who met town and city mayors in the province last Wednesday to discuss the preparation against the 2019nCoV.  Cebu Governor Gwen Garcia(Cong. Gwen Garcia Facebook page / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN) Each local government unit (LGU) under the province will be given P500,000 for the purchase of protective equipment such as alcohol, face masks and disinfectants. “This is more urgent nature than socio cultural,” said Garcia in explaining the release of funds. Each LGU was required to declare “state of preparedness” so they could avail of the financial assistance. Because of the threat brought about by the virus, some LGUs have decided to cancel holding public events such as fiestas although Garcia stressed that it will be up to the mayors whether or not to pursue their activities. “It’s on the discretion of the mayors. I trust their judgement because after all, they will be the ones who will be answerable. That is within their jurisdiction, they were elected by their people and the people therefore trusts the leaderships of their local chief executives” said Garcia. For one, the municipality of Consolacion decided to cancel its Sarok Festival and other events as part of its centennial celebration. “I agree with the postponing or suspension of the fiestas in the barangays. That’s one way that would remove us from the bondage of solicitation,” said Balamban Mayor Alex Binghay. Also present in the meeting was Department of Health-Central Visayas (DOH-7) regional director Jaime Bernadas, who asked the public to stay at home if they can. “If you would just go to social conveniences, it’s better to just stay at home,” said Bernadas.

Catacutan said that he wanted to clarify his first statement regarding the New Clark City as the quarantine zone for the repatriated Filipinos. “While it is true that I, as a Filipino, am in favor of the repatriation of OFWs from the province of Hubei, China, I feel perturbed by the fact that Department of Health (DOH) did not at all, in any way, involve the Capas LGU in its last-minute decision for New Clark City Capas to be used as quarantine zone for these Persons under Monitoring (PUMs).” he said. “We acknowledge that the Bases Conversion and Development Authority (BCDA) has full jurisdiction over NCC, but I, as the mayor of Capas, appeal in behalf of all Capaseños to our dear President Rodrigo Duterte and DOH Secretary Francisco Duque to consider another place or facility as isolation area.” he added. Catacutan said his reaction was natural for a head of a town who only aims to protect his people. “This was not a FINAL STAND. I repeat, THIS WAS NOT A FINAL STAND but an initial reaction from a father who was protecting his family. Bilang ama ng Capas na malayo sa kanila, I initially reacted dahil nag cause po ng panic ang biglaang balita na sa New Clark City dadalhin ang mga repatriated Filipinos na under monitoring.” (Being the father of Capas who was away from them, I initially reacted because it caused panic when the news about the repatriated Filipino under monitoring will be brought to New Clark City) The mayor also said they were not informed of the decision which caused fake news because they weren’t able to inform the residents. “We were blindsided. And we owed it to our people na mag explain sa kanila pero wala kaming full information the very moment na lumabas po ito sa national news,” he said. (We were blindsided. And we owed it to our people to explain to them but we do not have full information the very moment it came out on national news) Catacutan also stated that the people were confused on the decision to use NCC as the quarantine site, since it is a sports facility and if it will fit the needs of the repatriated Filipinos. He also said that they are worried on the future of New Clark City since it originally has upcoming events. “Ano ang magiging implication nito sa image ng Capas at ng New Clark City gayong may mga upcoming events sana dito. Ano kaya ang magiging future ng NCC kung magiging quarantine zone ito at biglang may magpositive. Ang NCC na ginastusan po ng napakalaki ng national government at ipinagmalaki natin bilang world-class facility.

(What will be the implication on the image of Capas and New Clark City since it originally has upcoming events. What will be the future of NCC if it will be the quarantine zone and if ever there will be a positive case. NCC was funded by the national government and a world class facility. It might go to waste and have a stigma or irreversible negative image as a quarantine zone) Catacutan clarified that the reaction of the residents of Capas is a result of not informing the LGU of the sudden change of the quarantine site. Catacutan said they do not own the NCC and it doesn’t need any permission from the LGU, but if they were just have been informed before it was released on national news. “Wala pong authority ang LGU Capas sa New Clark City.

,"February 10, 2020, 12:21 PM",nCov,New study offers glimpse of how nCoV spread from ground zero,By Martin Sadongdong,"By Martin Sadongdong Nearly half of the first 138 patients who were admitted at a hospital in Wuhan, China on the early days of the outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus acute respiratory disease (2019-nCoV ARD) presumably acquired the virus in the same medical facility, a study recently published in an American peer-reviewed medical journal has disclosed. In “Clinical Characteristics of 138 Hospitalized Patients with 2019 Novel Coronavirus-infected Pneumonia in Wuhan, China,” a study whose corresponding author was Dr. Zhiyong Peng of the Department of Critical Care Medicine at the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, it showed that 41.3 percent or 57 of the 138 patients “were presumed to have been infected” at the Zhongnan Hospital where some were admitted for other medical conditions while others were hospitalized due to suspected nCoV infection. The study was published online in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) on Friday, February 7, providing insights in what could be regarded as one of the earliest and largest single-center case series of hospitalized patients with nCoV-infected pneumonia (NCIP) that may help shed light on how the deadly disease spread in such an alarming rate. The clinical outcomes of all 138 patients, who were admitted at Zhongnan Hospital from January 1 – 28, were monitored until February 3. Their medical records were then analyzed by a research team of the Department of Critical Care Medicine. The Zhongnan Hospital is described as “one of the major tertiary teaching hospitals” and is “responsible for the treatments for NCIP assigned by the [Chinese] government.” Quick spread According to the study, 17 patients (12.3 percent) who were “hospitalized for other reasons” and 40 health care workers (29 percent) at Zhongnan Hospital were presumed to have a human-to-human hospital-associated transmission of the virus. Presumed hospital-related transmission was suspected if a cluster of health professionals or hospitalized patients in the same wards became infected and a possible source of infection could be tracked, it stated. As of February 3, the last day of the monitoring, the study said 85 of the 138 patients were still hospitalized (61.6 percent), 47 had been discharged (34.1 percent), and six had died (4.3 percent). Of the patients, 36 required intensive care unit (ICU) treatment (26 percent). “The data in this study suggest rapid person-to-person transmission of 2019-nCoV may have occurred,” the study said. “As an infection spreads to new people, it reproduces itself,” it added. Based on the report, the R0 from nCoV is 2.2 which means that in an average, each patient has been spreading infection to 2.2 other people. The R0 indicates the average number of additional individuals that one affected case infects during the course of their illness and specifically applies to a population of people who were previously free of infection and have not been vaccinated, the study explained. “One reason for the rapid spread may be related to the atypical symptoms in the early stage in some patients infected with nCoV,” it said. The researcher wrote that at present, no specific treatment has been recommended for coronavirus infection except for “meticuluous supportive care.” “Currently, the approach to this disease is to control the source of infection; use of personal protection precaution to reduce the risk of transmission; and early diagnosis, isolation, and supportive treatments for affected patients,” the study emphasized. As of Saturday, February 8, the World Health Organization (WHO) said 34,886 confirmed nCoV cases have already been noted in 25 countries and on a cruise ship which was in Japanese territorial waters at the time of detection — 3,419 of which were newly recorded. In the Philippines, the Department of Health said the number of the persons under investigation (PUIs) along with the confirmed cases (3) has risen to 267 as of Saturday. Tags: ncov"

Coming up with any vaccine typi­cally takes years, and involves a lengthy process of testing on animals, clinical trials on humans, and regula­tory approvals. But several teams of experts are racing to develop one quicker, backed by an international co­alition that aims to combat emerging diseases, and Australian scientists hope their’s could be ready in six months. “It is a high-pressure situation and there is a lot of weight on us,” said se­nior researcher Keith Chappell, part of the group from Australia’s University of Queensland. But the scientist added he took “some solace” knowing several teams around the world were engaged in the same mission. “The hope is that one of these will be successful and can contain this outbreak,” he said. But even a timeframe of six months looks agonizingly slow with the virus, believed to have emerged from a mar­ket selling wild animals, killing close to 100 people every day in mainland China. Efforts are being led by the Coali­tion for Epidemic Preparedness Inno­vations (CEPI), a body established in 2017 to finance costly biotechnology research in the wake of an Ebola out­break in West Africa that killed more than 11,000 people.

German biopharmaceutical com­pany CureVac and US-based Moderna Therapeutics are developing vaccines based on “messenger RNA” – instruc­tions that tell the body to produce proteins – while Inovio, another American firm, is using DNA-based technology. DNA-and RNA-based vaccines use the genetic coding of the virus to trick the body’s cells into producing proteins identical to those on the surface of the pathogen, explained Ooi Eng Eong, deputy director of the emerging infec­tious diseases program at the Duke-NUS Medical School in Singapore. The immune system learns to rec­ognize the proteins so that it is ready to find and attack the virus when it enters the body. The Australian researchers are using “molecular clamp” technology invented by the university’s scientists that allows them to rapidly develop new vaccines based solely on a virus DNA sequence. French scientists at the Pasteur Institute are modifying the measles vaccine to work against the coronavi­rus, but do not expect it to be ready for about 20 months. Meanwhile, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention has also started developing vaccines, according to the state-run Xinhua news agency. The World Health Organization (WHO) has set up measures to curb the spread of misinformation about the 2019 novel coronavirus acute respira­tory disease. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus emphasized the importance of knowing the actual facts about the novel coronavirus, say­ing that people must have “access to accurate information to protect them­selves and others.” “While the virus spreads, mis­information makes the job of our heroic health workers even harder. It is diverting the attention of decision makers and it causes confusion and spreads fear to the general public, said Ghebreyesus in his opening remarks during a media briefing on Saturday which was broadcasted live at the WHO’s official Twitter page. “At WHO, we’re not just battling the virus; we’re also battling the trolls and conspiracy theorists that push misinformation and undermine the outbreak response,” he added.

President Rodrigo Roa Duterte  (ALFRED FRIAS / PRESIDENTIAL PHOTO / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN) Presidential spokesman Salvador Panelo made the statement after it was reported that the Philippine tourism industry has lost at least P10 billion due to the travel ban be­ing implemented by the government to contain the spread of the virus in the country. In a radio interview, Panelo said President Duterte was already wor­ried since the Philippine economy was starting to get affected. “Every President will be both­ered every time na (the) economy is affected. Kaya nga ginagawan ng paraan (That’s why we’re doing something about it),” he said Sunday morning. “Lahat tayo sa buong mundo na apektado niyan, ganyan ang resulta (Everyone of us affected by the virus are suffering from the same thing). What we can do is to stop the spread of the disease,” he said. According to the Philippine Tour Operators Association, about 50 per­cent of reservations in Boracay, Bohol, Cebu, and Palawan have been cancelled as the government contin­ues to implement a travel ban to and from China. The Department of Tourism (DOT) said it was eyeing to boost promotions in South Korea and the United States, the country’s top and 3rd largest tourist markets, respectively, and was already coordinating with hotels and airlines to give discounts to attract more visitors. Panelo enjoined the public in pray­ing for a cure to the dreaded virus. Chinese tourists The 2019-nCoV scare will make the Philippines realize the importance of Chinese tourists to local tourism industry. “With this nCoV scare I’m sure the tourist arrivals will decrease especially [since] our government is imposing a ban on arrivals coming from China,” Surigao del Sur 2nd district Rep. Johnny Pimentel said. “I’m sure we will feel it because the average expenses of every tourist per day is between $84 and $100 and if you multiply this by a million tour­ists, we will be a losing almost $100 million so definitely there will be re­percussions in our tourism industry,” explained Pimentel, a Deputy Speaker of the House in the 18th Congress. Deputy Speaker in Camarines Sur 2nd district Rep. LRay Villafuerte wants the DOT to focus on enticing domestic tourists to visit local “hotspots” as a way to offset the expected losses from the travel ban. “As the tourism industry braces for a major hit with the timely imposition by President Duterte of a temporary travel ban to China and its territories Hong Kong and Macao, and to in­clude all foreigners who have visited these areas over the past two weeks, it is time for the DOT to make a more aggressive push for domestic tour­ism… by selling to our countrymen our ‘hotspots,’ particularly the fave destinations for extreme sports and ecotourism,” he said.

Presidential Spokesman Salvador Panelo (OPS / MANILA BULLETIN) Presidential Spokesman Salvador Panelo made the statement after the 30 Filipinos from the origin of the dreaded 2019-novel coronavirus acute respiratory disease (2019-nCoV ARD) arrived at the Haribon hangar of the Philippine Air Force in Clark, Pampanga Sunday morning. In a radio interview, Panelo said the Palace understood the concern of the local officials of Capas and its residents but said there was nothing they could do since the New Clark City is completely under the control of the government’s Bases Conversion and Development Authority (BCDA). “Natural lang yun. Pero alam mo, yung unang-una, national government yung lugar na yun. So, walang ano ang local government doon (They’re reaction was only natural. But first of all, that place is under the national government so the local government can’t really do anything about it),” he said Sunday. Panelo, however, assured the local government of Capas, Tarlac that the virus will not spread in their area as the Department of Health (DOH) was implementing the strictest protocol. “Lahat ng protocols naman ini-implement so walang danger sa kanila. Kasi isolated nga yung mga dumating (Every protocol is being implemented so there’s no danger to them. Everyone coming in is isolated),” he said. According to the Department of Foreign Affairs, the repatriated Filipinos were safely and swiftly transferred from the chartered Royal Air flight to their dedicated buses and brought to the Athletes’ Village in New Clark City where they will undergo quarantine for 14 days. The DOH earlier said that the quarantined Filipinos will be provided with food, hygiene kits, other necessities, and will be given access to cellphones. Their mental health will likewise be assessed on the third day of their quarantine. Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles last week assured residents around the quarantine site to not worry as the virus will not spread outside the facility. “‘Wag silang matakot at maabala kasi doon nga yung pinaka-safe kasi yung highest quarantine level ang i-impose doon (They do not have to be afraid and alarmed because that is going to be the safest place because of the quarantine level to be imposed there). So all quarantine measures will be at its level there,” he said. “All our medical health workers going in and out of that facility will undergo such extensive quarantine medical protocol so that’s probably going to be the safest place in terms of quarantine protocols and procedures,” he added.

Presidential Spokesman Salvador Panelo(OPS / MANILA BULLETIN) According to Presidential Spokesman Salvador Panelo, medical expenses such as laboratory tests and quarantine would be waived if a person is admitted to the athlete’s village in New Clark City or any public hospital. The athletes’ village, recently built for the Southeast Asian Games, has been converted into a quarantine area for Filipinos returning from the coronavirus-hit Hubei province in China. “Sa national government nga ‘yung lugar. Hindi sila mag-shoulder nun. tayo nagso-shoulder nun (The national government owns the place. They won’t shoulder the expenses. We will shoulder the expenses),” Panelo said in a radio interview Sunday. For people seeking laboratory testing for the new coronavirus in public hospitals, Panelo maintained that the fees will be paid by the government. Those who get consultation in private hospitals, on the other hand, may have to pay for the corresponding fees. “Kung sa private sila papasok, eh talagang gagastos sila. Pero kung gobyerno, palagay ko hindi (If they enter a private hospital, they will really have to pay. But if they go to a government hospital, I don’t think so),” Panelo said. At least 30 Filipinos have returned home from Hubei, China as part of the government’s repatriation efforts from the epicenter of the 2019 novel Coronavirus Acute Respiratory Disease (2019-nCoV ARD). Upon arrival at the Clark airport, they were transported to the quarantine area in New Clark City in Tarlac for a 14-day quarantine period. To date, the government has monitored more than 200 patients suspected of carrying the respiratory virus. The country has recorded three cases of coronavirus, including one death of a patient last February 1. It became the first death from the disease outside of China amid growing fears about the spread of the illness. Tags: ncov"

The World Health Organization (WHO) has released three guidelines on the prevention and control of the 2019-novel Corona Virus (nCoV) Acute Respiratory Disease (ARD) amid the spread of the virus in China and 24 other countries.  FILE PHOTO: The World Health Organization (WHO)  (REUTERS / Pierre Albouy / MANILA BULLETIN) Based on the WHO 19th Situation Report released on Sunday, there are 34,886 confirmed cases across the world, 34,598 of them are in China. At least 18 new cases of infection were reported outside China. A total of 724 deaths were reported, all of them in China, except one in the Philippines. In order to contain the rapid infection rate, WHO officials has convened global expert networks for laboratory, clinical management, mathematical modelling, risk communication and community engagement, and infection prevention and control (IPC) to come up with guidelines on how people should protext themselves and measures that could be done during the infection. The materials are available here according to the WHO Situtation Report: https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technicalguidance The first key guideline deals with infection prevention and control during health care when novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection is suspected. In order to prevent human-to-human transmission in health care settings, these were recommended: 1. Ensuring triage, early recognition, and source control (isolating patients with suspected 2019-nCoV infection);
2. Applying standard precautions for all patients;
3. Implementing empiric additional precautions (droplet and contact and, whenever applicable, airborne precautions) for suspected cases of 2019-nCoV infection;
4. Implementing administrative controls;
5. Using environmental and engineering controls. HOME CARE The second key guideline focuses on what people should do if mild symptoms of nCoV are showing. The document talks about home care and management of contacts for people showing mild symptoms of nCoV. It includes guidance on: 1. Household/caregiver’s protection including what personal protective equipment (PPE) to wear when caring for someone infected with 2019-nCoV and on environmental and waste management; 2. For an infected individual with mild disease, for example to wear a mask; and 3. For the management of contacts (including caregivers/health care workers) which includes 14 days of monitoring of health for contacts. WEARING OF MASKS The last guideline focuses on the use of masks in the community, during home care and in health care settings in the context of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak.
Initially, these are the guidelines:
1. In community settings, medical masks are not recommended for people without symptoms; 2. For those who choose to wear medical masks, appropriate mask management should be followed, which includes how to use and dispose of masks; 3. Symptomatic individuals are recommended to wear medical masks and seek early medical care if there are any signs of respiratory distress. Tags: ncov"

The WHO also tapped different search and social media platforms such as Google, Facebook, Tencent, Baidu, Twitter, TikTok, Weibo, Pinterest, among others to help in spreading the right information about the novel coronavirus. “We are asking them to filter out false information and promote accurate information from credible sources like WHO, CDC (Centers for Disease Control) and others,” said the WHO official. The organization also asked the help of some influencers on Instagram and Youtube in a bid to spread “factual messages to their followers.” “In essence, to fight the flood of misinformation, we are building a band of truth-tellers that disperse fact and debunk myths,” said Ghebreyesus.

Of this number, five are said to have interacted with the 60-year-old Chinese woman who is the third confirmed case of 2019-nCoV in the country, according to a report from GMA News on Saturday. Three of the PUIs were her attending nurses after she was admitted to a hospital, while two were on board the same fast ferry that she rode from Cebu to Tagbiliran. The two other PUIs are United States citizens aged 23 and 24 who reportedly travelled from New York to Beijing, China before arriving in the Philippines. The seven patients, who displayed flu-like symptoms, have been isolated and are in stable condition, the report showed. Recently, Bohol Governor Arthur Yap said that the local government tracked the country’s third 2019-nCoV case in China and found that she has already recovered. According to the Department of Health, there are now 267 PUIs in the country. The health department said 230 of this number are currently admitted and isolated, 17 have been discharged but remain “under strict monitoring,” and 13 refused admission. The Philippines has had three people, all Chinese nationals from Wuhan, who tested positive for the new virus. The first case is a 38-year-old woman who is reportedly under stable condition. Her companion, a 44-year-old man, died due to the infection, the first 2019-nCoV-related fatality to be reported outside of China. Tags: ncov"

Canadian Forces personnel load luggage onto a bus for Canadians, who had been evacuated from China on an American charter plane due to the outbreak of novel Coronavirus, as they disembark from another aircraft at Canadian Forces Base (CFB) Trenton in Trenton, Ontario, Canada, February 7, 2020. (Courtesy of Edward Wang via REUTERS/MANILA BULLETIN) But with hundreds of thousands of other people in Wuhan also stuck inside their homes doing the same thing, and retailers struggling to get hold of their staff, the service became overloaded. So for Wang, now in Canada after flying out of Wuhan on an evacuation flight, a daily ritual developed during his days on virtual lockdown in the city. At the turn of midnight, grocery stores would open up their order book for the day’s deliveries, and he would pounce to place his order before all the delivery slots were taken by other customers. “You have to be very quick,” he told Reuters by phone. “Usually, if they release their inventory at midnight, the day before, you basically have to finish by 12:02 or 12:03, so within 2 or 3 minutes, otherwise, all the delivery schedules are booked up.” “There are basically no delivery people working right now. Basically for those stores, it is just the store manager driving their own private car around the neighborhood trying to deliver groceries.” Wang grew up in Canada, and has family in Wuhan, the city at the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak. He was in Wuhan when the coronavirus outbreak hit. Eventually, he left Wuhan on board a U.S.-chartered evacuation flight, and then, with other evacuees, he transferred to another plane that landed on Friday at a Canadian military base in Trenton, Ontario. He recorded video footage on the plane after it landed, showing a Canadian immigration official, dressed in a face mask and goggles, addressing passengers. The official said that on disembarking, they would go through a sanitary footbath, and would have to hand over their used face masks and be given fresh ones. “Welcome home,” he said to the passengers. The evacuees will now stay in quarantine in the Trenton military base for 14 days. Wang said once he had been cleared as free of the virus by Canadian medical authorities, he planned to head to Vancouver, where his family has a home. “I have not been in this kind of situation before, where I had to be evacuated from somewhere. You imagine things like this happening in war zones,” he said. He said he had weighed his options before deciding to fly to Canada. In Wuhan, he could limit the chance of infection by avoiding contact with other people. By boarding a plane, he would potentially put himself in contact with people who were infected. On balance, though, he decided to leave because he believed China’s healthcare services were struggling to cope. “On the off chance that we do get sick, I’d rather get sick in Canada,” he said.

Wei Ye and his 2-year-old daughter Cerena who is stranded in China’s Hubei province are seen in this undated handout photo. (Courtesy of Amelia Pan/Handout via REUTERS/MANILA BULLETIN) “I am just hanging in there,” Pan, a Canadian citizen originally from China, said in a Skype interview. “I need to stay strong so I can fight for my family.” For days now, Pan has been scrambling to get her daughter onto an evacuation flight back to Canada, but it has been complicated. Cerena’s father has contracted the virus so he cannot accompany her home on the flight, and Cerena herself ran a fever so she needed to undergo checks to make sure she was not infected herself, according to Pan. In the meantime, Cerena is in a Chinese hospital, separated from her father and being looked after by a cousin of his who agreed to be in hospital with the child. “My daughter is less than 3, and still is wearing diapers, she cannot take care of herself, she needs a lot of help from adults,” said Pan. Cerena’s paternal grandfather caught the virus and died, and her grandmother is also infected. The family drama began on Jan. 17 when Pan’s husband, Wei Ye, received a call from his sister back home in the Chinese city of Yingshan, near Wuhan. The sister said Ye’s father was close to death because of complications from cancer. At the time, the family had heard of the coronavirus, but did not understand the danger it posed. The next day, Ye flew to China to be with his father, taking his daughter with him. Pan stayed behind in Canada. By Jan. 26, Pan received word that her father-in-law was infected with the coronavirus. The next morning, she was told that Ye, and his mother, had a fever. Soon after, it was confirmed Pan’s husband and mother-in-law had coronavirus and they were hospitalized. Cerena was left in the care of a neighbor. But because she was deemed an infection risk, she was put in hospital. Fortunately, test results came back negative on Saturday. If her temperature stays normal, she should be discharged from the hospital over the weekend, her mother said. Pan said she is in touch with the Canadian authorities to get Cerena, a Canadian citizen, onto an evacuation flight, and is seeking someone willing to accompany her on a plane that is supposed to leave on Monday. If this plan works out, Pan will be flying to Trenton, Ontario, to stay in quarantine with her little girl. Before the outbreak hit, Pan said she had even enjoyed being alone in Canada and briefly free of the burden of parenting. “But look at the price I paid for the freedom that I enjoyed the first week.” Tags: ncov"

OUT OF WUHAN — Some 30 Filipinos stranded inside Wuhan city in Hubei province, China, when the government ordered a lockdown are shown boarding the mercy flight that would take them back to the Philippines. The group arrived at 7 a.m. Sunday, February 9, and went straight to quarantineto monitor possible virus infection at the New Clark City in Capas, Tarlac. (DFA Photo) The chartered plane landed at around 7 a.m. at the Haribon Hangar in Clark Air Base with 29 adults and one infant. They were accompanied by a 10- member team from the Philippines which included two members from the Philippine Consulate General in Shanghai, three members from the DFA Office of the Undersecretary for Migrant Workers’ Affairs (OUMWA), and five medical team mem­bers from the Department of Health (DOH). Upon arrival, the repatriates were safely and swiftly transferred from the plane into their dedicated buses and brought to the Athlete’s Village in New Clark City (NCC) in Tarlac which will be their home for the 14-day quarantine period. China raised the death toll from the coronavirus epidemic to 811 on Sunday, passing the number killed globally by the SARS epidemic in 2002/2003. The repatriates did not exhibit any flu-like symptoms when they arrived on Sunday, the DOH said. “All 32 repatriates landed safely and free of any signs and symptoms, hence, they were all sent to New Clark City for close observation and moni­toring for 14 days,” the DOH said in a statement. The DOH said that the repatriates had undergone three levels of screen­ing. The agency said that before they boarded the plane, the repatriates were screened to determine if they are symptomatic (have fever, cough, and colds) or asymptomatic (do not have any signs or symptoms). During the flight, the repatriates were closely monitored for the oc­currence of any signs and symptoms. Upon landing, they were again as­sessed if they developed signs and symptoms. The DOH assured that the repa­triates are well-accommodated and closely monitored, and all basic neces­sities were provided – including hy­giene kits and meals. The quarantine procedure is in coordination with the Bases Conversion and Development Authority and the Provincial Govern­ment of Tarlac, the DOH said. The DOH assured that the repatri­ates will be regularly monitored by medical personnel “to ensure their health and safety.” “If an individual, during his/her stay in the quarantine facility, sud­denly shows signs and symptoms, the DOH had deployed medical teams to immediately assess and facilitate transfer to hospital for close monitor­ing,” the health department said. “The DOH will be taking charge of the management, coordination, and logistics of the entire quarantine process. Rest assured that repatriated OFWs (overseas Filipino workers) will be attended to and treated with utmost care,” it added. Meanwhile, the Code Blue Alert, which requires half of all hospital personnel to report for duty in order to provide medical assistance and ser­vices, has been raised in all hospitals under the DOH-Central Luzon Center for Health Development.

Cao said the Hubei government would ensure supply of medical products for high-risk areas, organize purchases from around the country and worldwide, help local firms expand their production and ask for support from the central government in Beijing. “Time is life,” state broadcaster CCTV cited Sun as saying, adding that she had called for the bed turnover rate to be speeded up.

New deaths, dismay, mistrust  The new deaths on Saturday reached another daily record at 89, data from the National Health Commission showed, pushing the total well over the 774 who died from SARS, or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome. An American hospitalized in the central city of Wuhan in Hubei province, where the outbreak began, became the first confirmed non-Chinese victim of the disease. The Washington Post identified him as Hong Ling, a 53-year old geneticist who studied rare diseases at Berkeley. A Japanese man who also died in Wuhan was another suspected victim. As millions of Chinese prepared to go back to work, the public dismay and mistrust of official numbers was evident on Weibo, China’s equivalent of Twitter. “What’s even more frustrating is that these are only the ‘official’ data,” said one user. “Don’t say anything else. We all know we can’t purchase masks anywhere, why are we still going back to work?” said a second. “More than 20,000 doctors and nurses around the country have been sent to Hubei, but why are the numbers still rising?” asked a third. Unreported cases  Among the latest deaths, 81 were in Hubei, where the virus has infected most people by far. New deaths in Wuhan, Hubei’s capital, saw a rare decline. New infection cases on Saturday recorded the first drop since Feb. 1, falling back below 3,000 to 2,656 cases. Of those, 2,147 cases were in Hubei. Total confirmed coronavirus cases in China stood at 37,198, commission data showed. Joseph Eisenberg, professor of epidemiology at the School of Public Health at the University of Michigan, said it was too early to say whether the epidemic was peaking. “Even if reported cases might be peaking, we don’t know what is happening with unreported cases,” he said. “This is especially an issue in some of the more rural areas.” The virus has spread to 27 countries and regions, according to a Reuters count based on official reports, infecting more than 330 people. Two deaths have been reported outside mainland China – in Hong Kong and the Philippines. Both victims were Chinese nationals. Alarm in Europe, United States and Asia  Major cities and capitals announced new travel restrictions as concern over the spread of the virus increased. Chinese-ruled Hong Kong introduced a two-week quarantine on Saturday for all people arriving from the mainland, or who have been there during the previous 14 days. Malaysia expanded its ban on visitors from China. France issued a new travel advisory for its citizens, saying it did not recommend traveling to China unless there was an “imperative” reason. Italy asked children traveling from China to stay away from school for two weeks voluntarily. The latest patients outside China include five British nationals staying in the same chalet at a ski village in Haute-Savoie in the Alps, French health officials said, raising fears of further infections at a busy period in the ski season. Britain’s final evacuation flight from Wuhan, landed at a Royal Air Force base in central England on Sunday with 200 people on board and a plane with 266 evacuees landed on Sunday in Darwin, Australia, SBS broadcaster said. Singapore also said it had organized a second evacuation flight for 174 Singaporeans and their family members in Wuhan. The island has reported 40 cases of coronavirus, putting it among the hardest hit countries, along with Japan, outside of China. On Sunday, the central bank in the Asian financial hub advised financial institutions to step up precautions for staff, after the government raised its response to the virus on Friday to “orange”, a level also adopted during SARS and the 2009 outbreak of H1N1 influenza. Organizers of the Singapore Airshow 2020 expect this week’s event to draw less than half the crowd seen on public days at the last show in 2018. “It’s getting worse & more scarier.

A view of the house where five British nationals including a child, who have been diagnosed with the coronavirus after staying in the same ski chalet with a person who had been in Singapore, were staying at the French Alpine resort of Les Contamines-Montjoie, France February 8, 2020. (REUTERS/Denis Balibouse/MANILA BULLETIN) In total, 11 people, including the five who tested positive, have been hospitalized in southeastern France and were being examined, the French health ministry said on Saturday, adding that none were in serious condition. The group of Britons included holidaymakers and a family currently residing in the Alpine village and ski resort, Les Contamines-Montjoie. They shared neighboring apartments in a chalet and temporarily hosted a British man believed to have contracted the virus at a business congress in Singapore before his short visit to France in late January, the ministry added. Two schools would be shut next week for checks, regional health official Jean-Yves Grall said, after it emerged that the nine-year-old who tested positive had attended lessons and French classes in different establishments. Two other children were also part of the group of 11 now in hospital in the cities of Lyon, Saint-Etienne and Grenoble, and they had been schooled in the area too, according to Etienne Jacquet, mayor of Les Contamines-Montjoie. “Our children were meant to go to a concert tonight, we took the decision not to take them to not expose other people,” said Beatrice Louvier, adding that her 10-year-old daughter was in the same classroom as one of the three British children. PEAK SKI SEASON The cases coincide with one of the busiest periods of the ski season for area resorts, as schools in the Paris region begin mid-term holidays. British schools are also on half-term break later this month. Health officials said they were trying to determine who had come into prolonged and close contact with the British group. Several tourists who had just arrived in Les Contamines-Montjoui brushed off the risks and said they would see through their holidays. But local resident Catherine Davout, who helps manage flat rentals in the area, said she had already had several cancellations. BUSINESS MEETING The new cases emerged after authorities began to retrace the travels of a British man who has been confirmed by Britain to have contracted the virus, French health officials said. They had formed “a cluster, a grouping around one original case”, according to Health Minister Agnes Buzyn, who identified the person as a Briton who had returned from Singapore and stayed in France between Jan. 24 and 28. The French government said Singaporean authorities were looking into a business congress that took place in a hotel there on Jan. 20-23 and was attended by 94 foreigners, including the British man at the center of the Alpine cases. As of Saturday, Singapore had 40 cases of the virus. Of the 11 total cases in France, earlier ones include an 80-year-old Chinese man in a serious condition, while the others have shown signs of improvement, according to medical officials. The epidemic began in Wuhan in China and the vast majority of cases have been in China. Tags: ncov"

(L-R) Senators Joel Villanueva and Vicente Sotto III (SENATE / MANILA BULLETIN FILE PHOTO) Senate President Vicente Sotto III said he was proven right by the concerns over the designation of a government-owned establishment as a quarantine site for Filipinos who will be returning to the Philippines from Hubei province, the epicenter of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak. Capas town officials have recently approved a resolution expressing their opposition to the plans to use the Athlete’s Village to house the more than 40 repatriates for their 14-day mandatory quarantine. “‘Di ko masasabing tama, hindi ako nagtataka na pumapalag sila (I can’t say if that is proper, but I’m not surprised that they’re objecting to it),” Sotto said over DWIZ radio on Saturday. The Senate leader earlier suggested against the repatriation of Filipinos from China, saying they might be discriminated upon when they arrive here. Sen. Joel Villanueva also said the fears of Capas residents are “legitimate.” But what the government should do about it, he said, is to “assure the public that we have sufficient capacity to contain the virus if someone gets infected.” “The facility, wherever it is, should also be well equipped to respond to the needs of the individuals who will be quarantined and the healthcare providers and staff who will attend to them,” he said in a text message. “Whether it is in Fort Magsaysay or New Clark City, what we need is the assurance that we are doing and giving our best to respond to this healthcare problem.” The national government earlier planned to transport the repatriates to the Mega Drug Abuse and Rehabilitation Center in Fort Magsaysay, Nueva Ecija.

DOH Bicol Regional Director Dr. Ernie Vera, in a press conference held Saturday afternoon, said that based on the latest 2019-case tracker of DOH Central there are no confirmed cases or PUIs due to nCoV at Bicol Regional Training and Teaching Hospital (BRTTH) – the hospital where three patients are reportedly being closely monitored by health authorities. However, two patients admitted at the BRTTH ware under observation, Vera said. Vera pointed out that official statement will come from central office if the patients admitted are PUIs or positive for nCoV. Dr. Annalynda Bellen, BRTTH Infectious Disease Specialist, confirmed that patients are on stable condition after suffering symptoms of pneumonia. She said the patients have history of travel from China and suffered breathing difficulties following their arrival in Bicol. “Yung dalawang patients natin na inoobserbahan sa BRTTH, so far okey naman sila ngayon. Nung in-admit sila nahirapan huminga pero as of now stable na po sila and occasional na lang yung ubo nila (The two patients under observation at BRTTH are in good condition. When they were admitted, they had difficulty breathing. While they occasionally cough, they are now in stable condition),” Bellen said. According to health officials, respiratory samples were already sent to Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) and the result will be out after 48 hours upon the receipt. “So pag natanggap na ng RITM ang samples today, possibly sa Lunes malalaman na natin kung yung pasyente ay PUI o kaya positive aa 2019 nCoV (If RITM received the samples today, the results will likely be out on Monday),” he added.

The drug rehabilitation center is not presently occupied by a drug patient. Alejandro said local residents reported the  presence of Chinese nationals at the beach resort in Glan, the white sand beaches of which are frequented by local and foreign tourists. Glan town mayor Vivien Yap had earlier ordered local beach resorts to refrain from accommodating Chinese nationals amid the risk of the spread of nCoV in their locality. Alejandro said the Chinese tourists were originally booked in a resort in Samal Island, but opted to proceed to Glan, Sarangani after they were denied accommodation in Samal. Sarangani Gov. Steve Solon said personnel from the provincial health office were immediately dispatched to track down the Chinese tourists, who were turned over to the epidemiology surveillance unit of the Department of Health which  administers the quarantine procedure. He said the Chinese nationals, who came from Fujian, China, were told to comply with the quarantine protocol imposed by DOH. “They are being taken care of at the quarantine facility,” Solon said. If the Chinese nationals do not show any symptoms of the nCoV infection after the 14-day quarantine period, Alejandro said they  will be issued with medical clearances and allowed to leave the country.

World Health Organization (WHO) Philippines (Facebook) This was one of the rumors and myths the WHO Philippines debunked in its latest Twitter posts. “2019-nCoV has spread to countries with both hot and humid climates, as well as cold and dry,” WHO Philippines said. “Wherever you live, whatever the climate is it is important to follow precautions,” it said. WHO Philippines reminded the public to “wash your hands frequently and cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue or a bent elbow” and “throw the tissue in the bin and wash your hands immediately afterwards.” Aside from this, WHO Philippines also debunked claims that the drinking of water and alcoholic beverages protect people from the 2019-nCoV virus. “While staying hydrated by drinking water is important for overall health, it does not prevent coronavirus infection. If you have fever, cough, and difficulty breathing, seek medical care early and share previous travel history with your health care provider. If possible call ahead so your health care provider can prepare your visit,” read its Twitter post. “Drinking alcohol does not protect you from 2019-nCoV infection,”  WHO Philippines added that “Alcohol should always be consumed in moderation, and people who do not drink alcohol should not start drinking in an attempt to prevent 2019-nCoV infection,” it advised.   Tags: ncov"
,"February 10, 2020, 12:14 PM",nCov,Tarlac town brings quarantine issue to court,By Joseph Almer Pedrajas,"By Joseph Almer Pedrajas The local government of Capas, Tarlac will seek help from the court on Monday in a bid to stop the Department of Health (DOH) from accepting more Filipino repatriates from virus-hit Wuhan, China, who will return to the country to undergo a two-week quarantine at the Athletes’ Village in New Clark City.  Vice Mayor Roseller Rodriguez (Facebook) Vice Mayor Roseller Rodriguez said Saturday morning that their lawyers will work on the issue to convince the court to issue a temporary restraining order (TRO) against the health department’s plan. “Kami naman po sa Lunes, may grupo po ng abogado na susubukan na dalhin sa korte yung usapin para po magkaroon ng TRO [Our lawyers will bring the matter to the court, so a TRO may be issued],” he said over DZBB radio, as the first batch of repatriates is expected to arrive early Sunday morning. Rodriguez also bared that the municipal council passed on Friday a resolution expressing Capas town’s objection to the DOH plan. He said, “there was no coordination” between them and the national government and they were not even informed regarding the matter. “Umaapela po kami sa Pangulo at sa DOH secretary na kung pwede po ay i-reconsider, maghanap ng ibang site [We are appealing to the President and the DOH secretary, if possible, to reconsider their decision and look for another site],” he added.
In a recent interview, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said resients should not worry as there is no nearby community at the Athletes’ Village. But Rodriguez refuted this, saying “the Sitio Kamatis in Barangay Aranguren, with a population of about 1,500, is just 300 meters away from the quarantine site.” “And then across the road, resettlement site po ‘yun na may population na 30,000. Mga evacuees po ng Mt. Pinatubo [Across the road is the resettlement site of Mt. Pinatubo evacuees, with a population of 30,000],” he added, referring to the resettlement site that is now named Barangay Cristo Rey. “Ang problema po kasi ay ginawa ang ating village para sa atleta. At ito po ay not typically designed as health facility para pwede [gawin] as quarantine station. ‘Yung lugar po ay hindi ganon ka isolated, compared doon sa Fort Magsaysay [The problem is the Athletes’ Village is built for athletes. It is not typically designed as health facility that could become a quarantine site. The place is not as isolated as the Fort Magsaysay],” the vice mayor noted. To allay fears of residents, Duque also stressed that people just need to keep a distance of at least six to 10 feet away from 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) patients to ensure that they will not get infected. But Rodriguez also expressed concern over flies after he was told that these could carry viruses to nearby communities. “Ngayon kung may bumahing at ‘yung droplet may virus. Kung dumapo ang langaw doon sa virus at yung langaw ay lumipad, pumunta doon sa nearest community at dumapo doon sa mukha [ng tao] at nahawak sa bibig, mahahawa ang kababayan namin [If someone sneezes and releases a droplet with the virus, and a fly would get into it, then fly to the nearest community, our constituents would have a chance getting infected],” he said. “Di kami binigyan ng assurance ng zero probability na hindi magkakaroon ng leak out o ng transmission sa nearest community [We are not given the assurance of zero probability that there would be no leak out or transmission to the nearest community],” he lamented. In a statement on Friday, Capas Mayor Reynaldo Catacutan appealed to the President to consider another area as a quarantine site. He added that he felt perturbed that Capas officials were not even involved in crafting the decision. Duque said he feels “sad that every community that he went to [to discuss plans to build quarantine sites on their area] expressed objection.” He urged Filipinos that now is time to show the spirit of “bayanihan” (unity and cooperation). Rodriguez retorted: “Kababayan po natin sila, pero ayaw po nating ilagay sa alanganin ‘yung kapakanan ng ating mga kababayan dito sa Capas [They’re are fellow Filipinos, but we don’t want to put our constituents in Tarlac at risk].”   Tags: ncov"

DILG Undersecretary Epimaco Densing III (FACEBOOK/ MANILA BULLETIN) DILG Undersecretary Epimaco Densing III in a radio interview said local government units do not have the authority over the national government, particularly on the planned conversion of the Athlete’s Village in New Clark City in Capas into a quarantine area, which was approved and ordered by no less than President Duterte. “Issue na po ito ng national concern (This is already an issue of national concern). It is an order by the President, it was approved by the NDRRMC (National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council)…So wala pong magagawa ‘yong local sa pagpunta o pag-quarantine ng ating mga kababayan diyan (So local government units can’t do anything about the quarantine there of our countrymen),” Densing said over DZMM radio Saturday morning. “Meron na po silang kalalagyan diyan. ‘Yong mga opisyales natin na hahaharang sa isang kautusan ng Pangulo, may kaakibat po administrative, baka may criminal side pa ho ‘yan ‘pag hinarang po nila yan (They will be put in their place. For officials who block an order of the President, there are corresponding administrative, and even criminal charges, if they block it).” The municipal council of Capas, Tarlac unanimously approved on Friday a resolution opposing the use of the Athlete’s Village as a quarantine site for the 45 Filipinos coming from China’s Hubei province, the epicenter of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak. Capas Mayor Reynaldo Catacutan said they were not consulted about the national government’s “last-minute decision.” Densing, however, said the resolution “ay opinyon lamang po nila (is merely their opinion).” And while saying he respects the local government’s move, the DILG official found it “unreasonable.” He likened it to Nueva Ecija province’s recent opposition to the initial plan to turn the Mega Drug Abuse and Rehabilitation Center in Fort Magsaysay into a quarantine zone. Densing allayed the fears of Capas officials and residents and assured them that safety and health protocols are established to protect them. He added that the Athlete’s Village, which was constructed for the 2019 Southeast Asian Games, is far from Capas town proper. He also said the group of Filipinos coming home from China were not infected with the 2019-nCoV. “Magtiwala naman tayo sa ating mga national government officials and doctors na hindi po maapektuhan ‘yong ating mga kababayan. Uulitin ko po: Wala pong sakit ‘yong pupunta doon, so bigyan po natin ng konting konsiderasyon (We should trust our national government officials and doctors that our countrymen will not be affected. I repeat: those going there are not sick, so let’s give them a bit of consideration),” he appealed. Densing said he hopes to speak with Catacutan on Saturday (Feb. 8) to clarify concerns. Tags: ncov"

Christopher “Bong” Go’ said Saturday he will try to find a suitable area in Mindanao for the more than 50 overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) returning from Wuhan City if there are strong objections from the Capas, Tarlac local government to national government plans to temporarily house them at New Clark City for their mandatory 14-day quarantine period.  Senator Christopher “Bong” Go(PRIB Photo by Cesar Tomambo /29 July 2019) “Kung wala na tatanggap sa kanila, willing ako tumanggap sa kanila. Maghahanap po ako ng lugar dito sa Mindanao, sasamahan ko po sila. ‘Di ako takot mahawa,’’ Go said in a DWIZ radio interview yesterday. (If no one wants to accept them, I will receive them. I will try to find a place for them in Mindanao. I will accompany them. I am not afraid of being infected.) Go, chairman of the Senate health committee, did not mention a specific place in Mindanao but said there are many islands in southern Philippines. The OFWs are reportedly scheduled to arrive Sunday morning (Feb. 9) at Clark International Airport at the former Clark Air Force base from the Wuhan, the origin of the deadly 2019 novel coronavirus acute respiratory disease (2019 n-CoV ARD). But the Capas local government was reportedly set to file a temporary restraining order (TRO) to block the temporary stay of the OFWs at the Athletes’ Village located in Capas, for fear that Capas residents might be infected. Go said he was informed by Department of Health (DOH) Secretary Francisco Duque III that Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) Secretary Eduardo Año has already talked to the Capas local government to reconsider their objections. Go pleaded for understanding for the plight of the OFWs, who are considered modern-day heroes of the Philippines. These OFWs, according to Go, go abroad to work to be able to send financial help to their families and suffer deprivation and loneliness as they are away from their loved ones. Government has set a 14-day observation protocol for returning OFWs or citizens or those suspected to have contracted the virus in the country. Government teams, including those from the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA), have flown to Wuhan City aboard a chartered air flight to fetch the OFWs. Go’s committee conducted a public hearing on the n-CoV scare and learned the DOH had difficulty contact tracing the passengers seated near two Chinese tourists who came from Hong Kong and visited several cities aboard Philippine Airlines and Cebu Pacific. Duque had blamed the airlines for refusing to give the personal and travel plans of the plane passengers, but PAL and Cebu Pacific belied his claim. Go said he is not inclined to conduct another public hearing on the n-CoV scare to allow officials and personnel of an inter-agency task force to do their work rather than sit during the hours-long Senate public inquiry.

Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana(AFP PHOTO / NOEL CELIS / MANILA BULLETIN) Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana, who also serves as the chairperson of the NDRRMC, made the commitment after the council held an emergency meeting at the NDRRMC Building in Camp Aguinaldo, Quezon City on Friday afternoon. According to Lorenzana, all NDRRMC response clusters were directed to collaborate with their counterparts at the national and local levels and work closely with the Department of Health. The DOH is the lead agency of both the IATF-EID and the NDRRMC Health Cluster. “Let us support the efforts of the IATF-EID. We need to have a unified response to identify, track, control, and prevent the rise of nCoV ARD cases in our country,” Lorenzana said. The defense chief said agreements were made by the NDRRMC member-agencies on the assistance to be extended to the task force. Specifically, Lorenzana said the NDRRMC shall provide aid on the task force’s information dissemination campaigns, risk communication plans, conduct of contact tracing and field validation of persons suspected to be infected by the disease, and repatriation operations of Filipinos in countries affected by the nCoV. The NDRRMC shall also coordinate with local government units and partner organizations to ensure that their efforts to contain the disease are implemented. The council was also told to mobilize its logistics and conduct biochemical interventions, manage the quarantine areas, and perform other tasks to be directed by the Health cluster or NDRRMC executive director or chairperson “to ensure an effective, efficient, timely, and well-coordinated response.” “The NDRRMC will also secure the full participation of the local DRRM [disaster risk reduction and management] councils in their response actions by cascading infection control initiatives,” Lorenzana added. The latest available data of the World Health Organization on Friday showed that there have been 31,481 confirmed nCoV cases around the world, 31,211 of which were reported in China where the virus originated. A total of 637 deaths were noted globally, with all but one case reported in China. In the Philippines, the WHO said three cases of nCoV have been confirmed, with one of them having succumbed to the virus. It was the first and only nCoV-related death outside China. At least 215 persons under investigation (PUI) were also being monitored in the country as of Friday, the Department of Health (DOH) said. Two PUIs have died, but the DOH said one of the cases had tested negative for nCoV while the other perished “due to other causes.” Tags: ncov"

In a report by Ivan Mayrina over GMA-7’s 24 Oras, CAB clarified that flights from China, Macau, and Hong Kong are not banned from coming in. What is being implemented is a travel ban on passengers who came from areas affected by nCoV ARD and not an actual total ban of flights. The CAB responded to queries from netizens who were pointing out that flights from the said countries were still coming in despite the ban. The ban, as earlier reported, does not include Filipinos and foreigners with permanent residence visas. Aside from this clarification, the CAB also said passengers who came in onboard indirect flights from Hong Kong, China, and Macau can still enter the country provided they submit themselves to a 14-day quarantine.

Presidential Communications Secretary Martin Andanar (PCOO / FACEBOOK / MANILA BULLETIN) In his radio program aired over state-run Radyo Pilipinas, Andanar said agencies involved should activate their spokespersons and relay the same information they are giving to people in Metro Manila to those in the provinces. “Yung linya natin, iyon din ang sasabihin ng sa Manila, iyon din ang sasabihin sa mga probinsiya (Whatever we say here, the same should be relayed in the provinces),” he said Friday evening. “Imagine kung lahat ng spokespersons ay iisa lang ang kanilang mensahe at tutulong din sa pag-disseminate ng tamang impormasyon ay mas madali ho ito para sa ating paglaban dito sa nCoV (Imagine if all spokespersons have the same message and will help to disseminate the correct information, we can easily combat this virus),” he added. President Duterte in the Cabinet meeting this week ordered the Presidential Communications Operations Office (PCOO) to spend more time informing the public of the health advisories and guidelines laid out by health experts, saying the public will be safe from the virus if they will observe preventive measures. According to Andanar, they have started to post hourly updates about the 2019-nCoV ARD in social media. He urged the public to be responsible netizens and to always check what they are reading online because of the prevalence of fake news. “Kailangan talaga magmasid nang husto… kasi hindi lang naman iyong traditional na TV, radio, newspaper… eh mayroon na hong online media at iyong mga fake news naman ay kadalasan ay diyan kumakalat sa online, sa social media (We should be vigilant because aside from the traditional TV, radio, and newspaper, we also have online media, and most of the fake news can be found there),” he said. The Palace official also appealed to the public to cooperate and follow the government’s directives about the virus. “Papaano natin ito mako-contain kung hindi makikipag-cooperate iyong ating mga kababayan, kung hindi sila makikinig ‘pag sinabi ng gobyerno: ‘Oy, tigilan ninyo na iyong mga fake news na ‘yan, tigilan ninyo na iyong pagiging Sinophobic ninyo’ (How can we contain the virus if the people won’t cooperate when we ask them to not spread fake news and stop being Sinophobic)?” Andanar said. “We really need the support and we need the cooperation of the citizenry para mas madali po ang pagpapatakbo at mas mabilis ang pag-asenso ng ating bansa (So that things can run smoothly and our country can improve faster).” Last week, Duterte asked the public to stop discriminating against Chinese nationals amid the coronavirus scare in the country, saying China has been good to Filipinos. “China has been kind to us, we can only also show the same favor to them. Stop this Sinophobia,” he said. “That is an utter disrespect to a human being… It’s like Sinophobia. You hate everything that is Chinese. It is not good because I’m saying we have so many [Filipinos there].” Tags: ncov"

,"February 10, 2020, 12:27 PM",nCov,Coronavirus puts Shanghai into a coma,By Agence France-Presse,"By Agence France-Presse For more than a week, the rare resident of Shanghai who dared venture outside has encountered something unfamiliar: a surreal peace and quiet. The deadly coronavirus epidemic has brought much of China to a standstill, but perhaps nowhere has the change been starker than in the country’s biggest and most vibrant city.  (REUTERS/Feline Lim/MANILA BULLETIN) Gone are the traffic jams, crowded sidewalks and businessmen hurrying to work, replaced by eerily empty roads, shuttered bars, and businesses, and only the occasional pedestrians — always behind a protective mask. Shanghai is the most populous of China’s many mega-cities, but its usual gathering points look like they were hit with a neutron bomb. The scenic Bund riverfront is normally filled with gawkers taking in the European neo-classical architecture on one shore, facing a futuristic financial district on the other. But the heavily-laden barges that usually keep the Huangpu River’s surface churning have been absent, the towering corporate skyscrapers largely empty. The stillness is only occasionally interrupted by the clang of the 90-meter-high (300-foot) clock tower atop the 93-year-old Shanghai Customs House. Zhao Feng was one of only a few scattered amblers on the promenade on a recent day. “We know it’s not good to go outside, but we’re wearing masks as a precaution,” said Zhao, 40, on a stroll with family. “(Shanghai) is so quiet because everybody has a strong sense of self-protection.” – Stir-crazy –
Shanghai’s slumber is due partly to a more than week-long city extension of the Lunar New Year holiday to help combat the virus. That ends on Monday, but many businesses and government departments are planning to allow staff to work from home. Shanghai has avoided the full or partial lockdowns seen in other parts of China. But residents are largely complying with official directives — issued via mass text messages or over blaring public loudspeakers — to avoid going outside unless absolutely necessary. When they do, pedestrians often move far to one side of the pavement to avoid other approaching residents. The city’s subway system, one of the world’s longest, has made masks mandatory, as has nearly every business that remains open. And few bat an eye any more at pausing for the ubiquitous temperature reading — a plastic thermometer gun aimed unnervingly at the forehead — when entering almost any public building. For those stuck at home, the government has issued a steady stream of tips on things like home exercise or how to avoid being stressed by the prospect of a pneumonia-like death. “Reduce your consumption of media reports that make people unhappy, thereby reducing your worries and troubles,” one government circular said brightly. But sheer boredom weighs on many. “All I can say is that I’m sick of staying home!” said one social media response to the government’s stress-reduction post.

The man in his sixties was suspected of having been infected with the coronavirus but due to difficulties in diagnosing the disease the cause of death was given as viral pneumonia, the foreign ministry said citing Chinese medical authorities. The man is potentially the first Japanese to have died of the disease, as a foreign ministry official said the government does not know of any Japanese that have died from the coronavirus epidemic, which has killed more than 700 people in mainland China and infected over 34,000. The death in Wuhan came as the number of passengers infected with the virus from a cruise liner quarantined in Japanese port of Yokohama jumped to 64 on Saturday. The virus has spread around the world, with 320 cases now in 27 countries and regions outside mainland China, a Reuters tally of official statements showed. Tags: ncov"

(MANILA BULLETIN) In a report to Immigration Commissioner Jaime Morente, BI port operations division chief Grifton Medina said the Chinese passengers were refused entry upon their arrival aboard a Philippine Airlines flight from Phnom Penh, Cambodia. “They were denied entry after our officers discovered that they were traveling as a group and that they have been to Macau last Feb. 1,” Medina said. Under the travel ban, foreigners will not be allowed to enter the Philippines if within the past 14 days they have traveled either to China, Macau and Hongkong. Medina said all 36 passengers were initially turned over to the Bureau of Quarantine (BOQ) for inspection and booked on the first available flight to Phnom Penh. Morente reiterated his appeal to airlines and shipping to “do their share in implementing the travel ban and prevent the entry of foreigners from the areas of concern”. All airlines and ships have been instructed not to board passengers covered by the ban. Morente also said that they are studying the possibility of imposing fines against violations. Meanwhile, the BI said it is now requiring both foreign and Filipino passengers from abroad to completely fill out and submit their arrival cards while undergoing immigration arrival formalities by BI officers. Morente earlier instructed all immigration supervisors in the different airports to strictly enforce the new policy so that the bureau can ably assist health and police authorities in tracking down passengers who have recently been to the areas of concern. Previously, only foreign passengers arriving at the airports are required to fill out said arrival cards while Filipinos are obliged to fill out embarkation cards when they leave the country. In another development, the BI’s immigration regulation division (IRD) said it is now strictly screening applications for extension of stay of foreign tourists to check if any of them have a history of travel to China, Hongkong, and Macau within 14 days from their arrival. Morente said a visa extension applicant covered by the restriction shall be turned over to the BOQ for medical assessment. “We have developed a series of checking, double-checking, even triple checking to ensure that we assist our health authorities in monitoring the travelers. We do what we can to help prevent the spread of this virus,” said Morente. Tags: ncov"

A passenger stands on a balcony onboard the quarantined Diamond Princess cruise ship at Daikoku Pier Cruise Terminal in Yokohama on February 7, 2020.(Photo by – / JIJI PRESS / AFP) / Japan OUT / MANILA BULLETIN) The latest confirmation came a day after an additional 41 passengers were found to have contracted the virus, which has killed hundreds of people, most of them in China, where it has infected more than 30,000 on the mainland. Japanese authorities have so far tested about 280 people on board the Diamond Princess, which was quarantined after a former passenger, who disembarked in Hong Kong last month, was diagnosed with the virus. Test results from six more people were released on Saturday, with three of them confirmed infected, the health ministry said without giving further details such as their nationalities. The three people have already been sent to hospital, the ministry said in a statement. There were more than 3,700 passengers and crew on the ship when it arrived off Japan’s coast on Monday evening. It docked in Yokohama on Thursday to resupply for a quarantine that could last until February 19. One of those found infected is in serious condition. Many onboard are elderly and at greater risk of developing complications from the virus. Testing was initially carried out on those who displayed symptoms or had come into close contact with the former passenger diagnosed. ‘Very, very scary’  Japan has already reported at least 25 cases of coronavirus aside from the infections on board the ship and evacuated hundreds of citizens from Wuhan, the Chinese city where the pathogen emerged, including on a fourth flight Friday. Passengers on the ship have been asked to stay inside their cabins to prevent new infections and have expressed confusion and frustration. The World Health Organization (WHO) called on Tokyo to provide sufficient support, including mental care, for the passengers and patients. “There’s a lot to do to support those patients. Not just from the point of view of their physical health but from a mental health perspective,” Michael Ryan, head of the WHO’s Health Emergencies Programme, told reporters in Geneva on Friday. “It’s quite scary, very, very scary to be in that situation,” he said. “It’s a very stressful situation for those individuals.” But he also called for calm, saying: “Let’s be careful here not to overreact.

,"February 10, 2020, 12:28 PM",nCov,Latest coronavirus study implicates fecal transmission,By Agence France-Presse,"By Agence France-Presse Diarrhea may be a secondary path of transmission for the novel coronavirus, scientists said Friday following the publication of the latest study reporting patients with abdominal symptoms and loose stool. The primary path is believed to be virus-laden droplets from an infected person’s cough, though researchers in early cases have said they focused heavily on patients with respiratory symptoms and may have overlooked those linked to the digestive tract.  This photo taken on February 6, 2020 shows a laboratory technician getting samples from people to be tested for the new coronavirus through a window at “Fire Eye” laboratory in Wuhan in China’s central Hubei province.(Photo by STR / AFP) / China OUT / MANILA BULLETIN) A total of 14 out of 138 patients (10 percent) in a Wuhan hospital who were studied in the new paper by Chinese authors in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) initially presented with diarrhea and nausea one or two days prior to development of fever and labored breathing. The first US patient diagnosed with 2019-nCoV also experienced loose bowel movements for two days and the virus was subsequently detected in his stool, and there have been other such cases in China documented in the Lancet, albeit infrequently. “Importantly, 2019-nCoV has been reported elsewhere in the feces of patients with atypical abdominal symptoms, similar to SARS which was also shed in urine, suggesting a fecal transmission route which is highly transmissible,” William Keevil, a professor of environmental healthcare at the University of Southampton said in a comment to the UK’s Science Media Centre. The possibility is not totally surprising to scientists, given that the new virus belongs to the same family as SARS. Fecal transmission of SARS was implicated in sickening hundreds in Hong Kong’s Amoy Gardens housing estate in 2003. A rising plume of warm air originating in bathrooms contaminated several apartments and was transported by wind to adjacent buildings in the complex. Based on the literature, “The 2019-nCoV virus found in stool may be transmitted through fecal spread,” added Jiayu Liao, a bioengineer at the University of California, Riverside. But, he added, “We still do not know how long this virus can survive outside the body — HIV can only survive roughly 30 minutes outside the body — and what temperature range the 2019-nCoV is sensitive to.” Fecal spread could present new challenges to the virus’s containment, but is more likely to be a problem inside hospitals, which can become “amplifiers” of epidemics, said David Fisman, an epidemiologist at the University of Toronto. Benjamin Neuman, a virology expert at Texas A&M University-Texarkana, cautioned that while fecal transmission was “certainly worth considering,” “droplets and touching contaminated surfaces then rubbing eyes, nose or mouth” were likely the main way the virus was transmitted based on current data.   Tags: ncov"

Christopher Lawrence ‘Bong’ Go is pushing for the establishment of infectious disease isolation and quarantine rooms in government hospitals in the country.  PHOTO BY ARMANDO FENEQUITO/ MANILA BULLETIN Go bared this statement in an interview after the Change of Command of BRP Ang Pangulo in Sasa Port, Davao City, on Friday evening. The senator said, with this measure, it would be easy for the government to act in containing any kind of infectious disease that might happen in the future. “Dapat maging handa tayo sa ganitong mga diseases (We should be ready for this kind of diseases),” he said. He said based on the situation nowadays, the health department and other agencies are having a hard time finding isolation areas for the 2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) because the country has only few quarantine areas for this kind diseases. Go said he would also craft standard protocols in handling cases like the 2019-nCoV to avoid causing panic to the public. “Kasi in panic mode na sila, kahit ano na lang maiisipan minsan ng mga kababayan natin (Because they are in panic mode, everything will go to the mind of our fellow countrymen),” he said. Go also urged the Department of Health (DOH) to coordinate with other agencies in tracing all those people who are in the same flight of the two 2019-nCoV infected patients. “Medyo hindi po ako masaya noong sinabi nila na 17 percent lang daw po yung accounted. Sabi ko, walang rason na hindi niyo ma account yung 83 percent (I was not happy when they told me that only 17 percent of that flight were accounted. I told them that there is no reason that the remaining 83 percent will not be accounted),” he said. “What if pumunta ng CR yung possible na naapektuhan, pag humawak yun sa mga knob o sa mga gripo eh, makakahawa na yun. Paano mo hanapin yung iba? (What if the infected person went to the toilet and holding the knobs and faucets, it would already spread the virus. How will you trace the others?),” Go added. He said there is an exemption on the Republic Act 10173 or the Data Privacy Act if it concerns national emergency and health officials can ask the Bureau of Immigration, Philippine National Police, National Bureau of Investigation, and even the Armed Forces of the Philippines to search these people who are possibly infected. “Para ma-account naman sila at ma-quarantine lang naman po sila at masigurado din na safe na po sila (This is in order to account these people and send them to quarantine to ensure they are safe from the said virus),” he said. The senator also appealed to the public especially those who came from mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau to follow the strict protocol to ensure their safety. “Please bear with the government, na talagang ipapatupad muna nila ang mga strict measures para maiwasan muna itong pagkalat (Please bear with the government that they will impose a strict measures against 2019-nCoV to avoid the spread of the disease),” he said.

(AFP PHOTO/MANILA BULLETIN) The new measures, which came into effect overnight, will see the vast majority of cases expected to self-quarantine. But they will face daily phone calls and spot checks by officials, with up to six months in prison for those found to be breaching their isolation period. Officials hope the new measures will virtually halt all cross-border traffic while allowing the city to remain stocked with food and goods from the mainland where the virus has now killed more than 700 people. Cabinet ministers unveiled how the quarantine would work on Friday evening, just six hours before the new policy was due to come in. Hong Kong residents arriving from mainland China will be allowed to self-quarantine at home. Chinese and international visitors will be able to self-quarantine at hotels or any other accommodation they have arranged. Those without pre-arranged accommodation will be taken to temporary facilities prepared by the government. Anyone who has been to mainland China in the past 14 days and then flies into Hong Kong from another destination will also be quarantined. The city is planning to use an army of volunteers from the civil service and some students to make the spot checks and daily calls to ensure people are staying at home. “We will be stopping a lot of people with the new measures,” Security Minister John Lee said. The South China Morning Post reported long queues on Friday night in Shenzhen, as people rushed to beat the midnight deadline before the new quarantine rules came into effect. At the Shenzhen Bay border crossing on Saturday morning, police told AFP just three people had crossed into Hong Kong in the first 90 minutes of the bridge opening. Panic buying  The new regulations have been enacted under a sweeping emergency law that allows city leaders to bypass the legislature during a disease outbreak. Exemptions would be made for a variety of key jobs, including flight and shipping crews as well as cross-border truck drivers to ensure goods and food keep coming into the city. Hong Kong has firsthand experience of a deadly outbreak when SARS swept through the city in 2003 killing 299 people. The epidemic left profound psychological scars and saddled residents with a deep distrust of authorities in Beijing who initially covered up the outbreak. In the last week, the city has been hit by a wave of panic-buying with supermarket shelves frequently emptied of staple goods such as toilet paper, hand sanitiser, rice and pasta. The government has blamed unfounded rumours of shortages, saying supplies are stable. “The problem of supply shortage doesn’t exist,” said Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung. The latest figures from China show there are more than 34,000 people infected there. Outside mainland China, there have been more than 320 infections reported in two dozen countries. Hong Kong has 25 confirmed cases with one patient who died earlier this week. Many of the newer infections have no history of travel to mainland China, prompting fears that the city now has a local self-sustaining outbreak. There have been growing calls for the border with China to be sealed entirely. Hong Kong’s pro-Beijing leadership, which has record low approval ratings after months of pro-democracy protests, had been reluctant to make such a move. But they gradually shut all but two of the land borders to the mainland while keeping the airport open. In the last two weeks, daily arrivals have plummeted some 75 percent.   Tags: ncov"

Those passengers were to take a connecting government flight to Trenton later in the day. Several countries including the United States and France have already repatriated their citizens from Wuhan. Canada’s airlift took longer to be approved by Chinese authorities. The group of Canadians, permanent residents and a handful of Chinese nationals with visas who accompanied Canadian minors on the flight will remain at the Trenton base for 14 days, the incubation period for the illness. None of the passengers showed signs of infection, Health Minister Patty Hajdu told public broadcaster CBC, but if they do they will be sent to hospital for care. She said the evacuees have been under a “tremendous amount of stress,” noting some were separated from their children or had to leave others behind. “Although the passengers won’t be interacting with each other, there will be opportunities for them to leave their room” at the Canadian base, she said. Passengers told local media that most slept through the long flight. Champagne had said Thursday that two-thirds of the Canadians who sought assistance getting out of Wuhan were expected to return on the two flights. At last count, 347 Canadians asked to be evacuated. Another Canadian airlift has been scheduled to depart Wuhan on February 10 and arrive the following day. Despite tense ties on other issues, Ottawa has commended China for its cooperation during the outbreak. Beijing also singled out Canada for praise for not closing its borders to travelers from China. Sino-Canadian relations soured in December 2018 over Canada’s arrest on a US warrant of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou and Beijing’s detention on espionage suspicions of two Canadians — former diplomat Michael Kovrig and businessman Michael Spavor — in apparent retaliation. Canada’s ambassador to China Dominic Barton told a parliamentary committee on Wednesday that both sides were “very angry” over the tit-for-tat detentions. “The first conversation I had there was probably one of the most unpleasant conversations I’ve ever had. I mean, the shaking and anger,” he said. The two nations’ foreign ministers also held their first conversation in more than a year recently, to coordinate the airlift, signaling hope of a thaw in relations. Five cases of coronavirus have so far been confirmed in Canada, and two more suspected cases have been reported. Tags: ncov"

Working together, we can have a profound impact to contain this growing threat,” he said. Pompeo, who has frequently criticized China on issues from human rights to its overseas infrastructure spending, said the United States would provide the assistance either directly or through multilateral organizations. He said the spending would come out of unspecified funds that have already been allocated within the US government. The aid pledge comes after Beijing criticized the US response to the health crisis, saying that Washington has been spreading “panic” by banning the entry of foreign nationals who traveled to China. But President Donald Trump on Friday praised China’s response as “very professional” after he spoke by telephone with his counterpart Xi Jinping. Pompeo said that the United States has donated close to 17.8 tons of medical supplies to China including masks, gowns, gauze and respirators.

Seventeen patients who were hospitalized for other reasons also became infected by the coronavirus. A total of 138 patients got the virus in a period spanning January 1 to January 28, with hospital-associated transmission accounting for 41 percent of all cases. The study comes just hours after a Chinese doctor who was punished for raising the alarm about the coronavirus died from the pathogen — sparking an outpouring of grief and anger over a worsening crisis that has now killed more than 630 people. Li Wenliang, 34, sent out a message about the new coronavirus to colleagues on December 30 in Wuhan but was later among a group of people summoned by police for “rumor-mongering.” He later contracted the disease while treating a patient. Of the 40 infected health care workers in the JAMA study, 31 worked on general wards, seven in the emergency department, and two in the ICU. The example of the patient presumed to have infected 10 health workers highlighted the high level of danger within hospitals during the first phase of the epidemic, even though overall it is currently estimated that each patient infects on average 2.2 others. “If true, then this confirms that some patients are likely to be far more infectious than others, and this poses further difficulties in managing their cases,” said Michael Head, a global health expert at the University of Southampton said in a comment to the UK’s Science Media Centre.

This photo taken on February 6, 2020 shows a laboratory technician working on samples from people to be tested for the new coronavirus at “Fire Eye” laboratory in Wuhan in China’s central Hubei province.(Photo by STR / AFP) / China OUT / MANILA BULLETIN) The number of new infections in China’s Hubei province, the epicenter of the outbreak, rose on Friday from a day earlier, Chinese health officials said, reversing two days of declines and showing the difficulty of predicting the epidemic’s peak. The death toll in mainland China jumped by 86 to 722, and is poised to pass the 774 deaths recorded globally during the 2002-2003 pandemic of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), another coronavirus that jumped from animals to humans in China. So far only two deaths have been reported outside mainland China – in Hong Kong and the Philippines – from about 332 cases in 27 countries and regions. During the SARS outbreak between November 2002 and July 2003, 774 people died globally, while the number of reported cases was 8,098, suggesting a far lower transmission rate than the latest coronavirus, but a higher mortality rate. After China recorded its first daily drop in the number of new infections on Thursday, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it was too early to say whether the outbreak had peaked. The first cases in December were traced to a seafood market in the Hubei capital of Wuhan, where wildlife was sold illegally. “It is hard to say how lethal this novel coronavirus infection is – that is, what proportion of people with infection will eventually die of the infection,” Professor Allen Cheng, an infectious diseases expert at Monash University in Melbourne, told Reuters. “While the crude mortality appears to be around 2%, there are likely to be many people who have been infected that haven’t been tested … We probably won’t know the true case fatality for some time yet.” Hubei officials on Saturday reported 81 new deaths, 67 of those in Wuhan, a city under virtual lockdown. Across mainland China, excluding the 2,050 people who had recovered and those who had died, the number of outstanding cases stood at 31,774. Beijing’s communist leadership has sealed off cities, cancelled flights and closed factories to contain the epidemic, with ripple effects for global markets and businesses dependent on the world’s second-biggest economy. WHO experts say they have not seen the same rapid increase in cases in provinces outside Hubei, or in the Chinese territories of Hong Kong and Macau that were badly hit by SARS. Speaking in Geneva, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus cautioned earlier that “the numbers could go up again.” False negatives Not all of the infected will test positive for the virus, warned Wang Chen, head of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences. “For patients who are really infected with the new type of coronavirus, the positive rate for tests is 30% to 50%,” Wang told state television in an interview that has gone viral on social media since its telecast on Wednesday. “There are still many false negatives by collecting suspected cases of throat swabs. In other words, more than half of the people who are truly infected with the new coronavirus may be ‘negative’.” Hubei has started to use computerized tomography (CT) scans for quicker and more accurate test results. Memories of how China was slow to tell the world about the SARS outbreak were rekindled on Friday when a doctor who had tried to raise the alarm about the new coronavirus succumbed to the disease in a Wuhan hospital. Ophthalmologist Li Wenliang, 34, was among eight people reprimanded by police in Wuhan for spreading “illegal and false” information after he shared details of the virus with colleagues. Social media users called him a hero and shared a selfie of him lying on a hospital bed wearing an oxygen respirator and holding up his Chinese identification card. One image showed the message “farewell Li Wenliang” etched into snow on a riverbank. There were signs that discussion of Li’s death was being censored. After briefly trending on Weibo, the topics “the Wuhan government owes doctor Li Wenliang an apology” and “we want free speech” yielded no search results. Lack of masks, gowns The WHO chief warned of worldwide shortages of gowns, masks and other protective equipment. “When supplies are short and demand is high, then there could be bad practices like hoarding in order to sell them at higher prices, and that’s why we ask for solidarity,” Tedros told a Geneva briefing. Another three people on a cruise liner off Japan tested positive for coronavirus, bringing the total number of confirmed cases from the ship to 64, Japan’s health ministry said on Saturday. Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd on Friday banned “any guests holding a Chinese, Hong Kong, or Macau passport, regardless of when they were there last” from boarding the company’s ships. WHO emergency expert Mike Ryan said reports of Asians being shunned in the West over a perceived connection to coronavirus was “utterly and completely unacceptable and it needs to stop.” Taiwan’s government said that starting from Monday it would suspend all direct passenger and freight shipping between the island and China. It had already decided to suspend most flights from Monday between Taiwan to China. Hundreds of foreigners have been evacuated out of Wuhan over the past two weeks. A second evacuation plane to airlift Australians out of Wuhan was delayed after China did not give it clearance to land, Australian officials said on Saturday. Global equity markets and government debt yields slumped on Friday, as growing concerns about the virus’ impact on global growth overshadowed a strong US jobs report. Apple Inc, however, said it was working to reopen its China corporate offices and call centres next week, and was making preparations to reopen retail stores there. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Friday said the United States was prepared to spend up to $100 million to assist China and support coronavirus efforts by the WHO. The United States has sent nearly 17.8 tons of medical supplies to China, including masks, gowns and respirators, a State Department official said. The WHO said out of $675 million it is seeking for its coronavirus response through April, it has received pledges of $110 million, $100 million of that from the Gates Foundation. Tarlac officials face charges In the Philippines, local officials of Tarlac might face charges should they continue to resist the government’s decision to use the New Clark City as a quarantine site for Filipinos returning from China, an official of the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) warned Saturday. DILG Undersecretary Epimaco Densing III, in a radio interview, said local government units do not have the authority over the national government, particularly on the planned conversion of the Athlete’s Village in New Clark City into a quarantine area which was approved and ordered by President Duterte. “This is already an issue of national concern. It is an order by the President, it was approved by the NDRRMC (National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council)… So local government units don’t have the choice if our countrymen are brought there for quarantine,” Densing said over radio DZMM Saturday morning. “They will be put in their proper places. For officials who block an order by the President, there is a corresponding administrative case and even criminal charges, if they refuse to follow,” he added. The municipal council of Capas, Tarlac unanimously approved on Friday a resolution opposing the use of the Athlete’s Village at the New Clark City as a quarantine site for the 45 Filipinos coming from China’s Hubei province, the epicenter of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak. Capas Mayor Reynaldo Catacutan said they were not consulted about the national government’s “last-minute decision”. Densing, however, said the resolution is merely their opinion. And while saying that he respects the local government’s unit’s move, the DILG official found it “unreasonable”. READ MORE: DILG Capas officials blocking use of New Clark City as quarantine site could face charges Capas seeks court remedy Aside from the council resolution, the local government of Capas will seek help from the court on Monday in a bid to stop the Department of Health (DOH) from accepting more Filipino repatriates from virus-hit Wuhan who will return to the country to undergo a two-week quarantine at the Athletes’ Village. Vice Mayor Roseller Rodriguez said Saturday morning that their “group of lawyers” will work on it, so that the court will issue a temporary restraining order (TRO) against the health department’s plan. “Our lawyers will try to bring the matter to the court so they will issue a TRO,” he said over DZBB radio as the first batch of repatriates is expected to arrive early Sunday morning. “We are appealing to the President and the DOH secretary if they could reconsider their decision and look for another site,” Rodriguez added. But Densing likened Capas officials’ resistance to Nueva Ecija’s opposition to the initial plan to turn the Mega Drug Abuse and Rehabilitation Center in Fort Magsaysay as quarantine zone. Densing allayed the fears of Capas officials and residents and assured that safety and health protocols are established to protect them. He added that the Athlete’s Village – which was constructed for the 2019 Southeast Asian Games – was far from the Capas town proper. Earlier, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said there was no nearby community at the Athletes’ Village, so residents of the town “do not have worry.” But Rodriguez refuted this, saying “Sitio Kamatis in Barangay Aranguren, with a population of about 1,500, is just 300 meters away from the quarantine site.” “Across the road is the resettlement site of Mt. Pinatubo evacuees, with a population of 30,000,” he added, referring to a community which is now called Barangay Cristo Rey. Duque also stressed that people just need to observe a distance of at least six to 10 feet distance from 2019-nCoV patients to ensure not to get infected. Densing also stressed that the group of Filipinos coming home from China arenot infected with the 2019-nCoV. “We should trust our national government officials and doctors that our countrymen will not be affected. I repeat, those who will be going there are not sick, so let’s give them a bit of consideration,” he appealed. Densing said he hopes to speak with Catacutan to clarify the local officials’ concerns.

Quezon Rep. Angelina “Helen” Tan (YOUTUBE / MANILA BULLETIN) “It’s a wake-up call,” Quezon Rep. Angelina Tan said in an interview on ANC’s Headstart. The spread of nCoV, the lawmaker said is an impetus for the country to support RITM and make it an independent body from the Department of Health. “I think we have to review the budget and ask them what they really need. And I’m sure for a long time, they have proposals to expand and strengthen their mandate,” Tan said. The lawmaker pointed out that RITM has the same function as the United States’ Center for Disease Control and only needs to be improved and strengthened. “Its mandate is to be the research arm of the Department of Health. Same functions, actually, it conducts research, they have linkage to international constitutions, and they publish research, develop vaccines,” Tan said. “It might be better to strengthen the RITM. If needs to be renamed, rename it.” Tan emphasized that the “support in research and development is very low in the Philippines” as it “always wait on the development of other countries.” “But we do have scientists, researchers here in the Philippines. But if you are not committed enough to invest and support this department or facility, it can be a waste of time…It’s about time that we have our independent body rather than creating another one.

This is our simple way of supporting inter-agency efforts to prevent and contain the spread of the virus,” Monreal said in a statement. “Let us say our goodbyes at home and not go to the airport in groups when meeting a passenger. It is very hard to fight tradition, but in times like this, everyone should look out for their own safety.” The airport chief exercised his prerogative in granting access to the four Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) terminals by limiting the issuance of visitors’ passes for the purpose of sending off or meeting passengers. Exception, however, will be given to cases when a companion may be necessary, such as medical patients or other related emergency cases, persons with disability, unaccompanied elderly, unaccompanied minors, and unaccompanied pregnant women. Exception is also given to government repatriation efforts and activities in fulfillment of government international commitments. The issuance of passes to VIP rooms will likewise be limited to airport reception of official guests of the government and of foreign embassies. Familiarization tours, movie/ad filming, and other non-airport related activities have been suspended. Administrative chiefs were also advised to confine the deployment of student on-the-job trainees to MIAA offices that are outside the four NAIA terminals. Tags: ncov"

He said they “should strictly observe quarantine procedures implemented by the Department of Health (DOH) which is to undergo a14-day isolation, among others.” He said that since the agency issues licenses to POGO workers, “it is Pagcor’s job to ensure workers comply with relevant health regulations.” He added that it should seek guidance from the DOH regarding the health protocols. The Pagcor had earlier ordered offshore gaming operators in the country to implement a 10-day quarantine for their new hires and workers who arrived from countries with confirmed cases of 2019-nCov.

House speaker Alan Peter Cayetano(PCOO / MANILA BULLETIN) Speaker Alan Peter Cayetano made the call for “more prayers” to help fight the spread of nCoV, saying that national unity and vigilance should also be part of humanity’s weapon against it. “We should be part of the solution and not the problem,” Cayetano said in a speech before members of the Independent Baptist Mission for Asians during their special recognition ceremony held at the Fundamental Independent Baptist Church of Tarlac in Tarlac City. “Amid the disasters and threat of 2019 novel coronavirus, the Lord is telling us he is here, and we will prevail on these [challenges] but we have to help each other,” Cayetano said. He urged religious leaders to continue to pray for the healing of the world. “We will pray for all of you, leaders of Baptist church in Southeast Asia, we have to partner with each other and with what is feared now, the new coronavirus, it doesn’t know any border. It doesn’t know any age, it doesn’t know any religion or color of the skin,” he added. Cayetano joined more than 1,500 members of the community, including missionaries, local pastors, and church leaders from all over the Philippines and South East Asia to deliver a message of hope and faith amid the outbreak of the new virus. P2 billion supplemental budget The House leader has vowed to swiftly pass the proposed P2.06 billion supplemental budget to finance government’s anti-nCoV program. However, he stressed the need for the Department of Budget and Management to guarantee the availability of cash.
Cayetano said House leaders were assured by the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) in their meeting early this week that once the funds are depleted, they can be augmented. The supplemental budget proposal is contained in House Bill No. 6177 filed Tuesday by Albay Rep. Joey Sarte-Salceda, vice chairman of the House committee on appropriations. “At least 95 percent of the supplemental budget will be for personal protective equipment for health care workers,” Salceda said, referring to the P2.025 billion share of the proposed additional allocation. However, he admitted that the proposed measure does not include funding for medicines and pharmaceuticals that might be developed in the future to treat the killer disease. Salceda, chairman of the House committee on ways and means, said money for such a contingency may initially be shouldered by the President’s contingency fund. In the bill, Salceda underscored the urgency of purchasing surgical masks for persons under investigation and health care workers, which have allocations of P945,000 and P9.45 million respectively. He explained the DOH also wanted a P4.522 million budget for the repatriation of 40 Filipinos from Wuhan, the center of the nCoV epidemic in China. An additional P20 million was not part of the DOH proposal but was personally added by the House official to address the financial requirements of epidemiologists who will be among the medical health workers tasked to be at the forefront of the anti-nCoV campaign.   Tags: ncov"

Former Department of Health Secretary Esperanza I. Cabral, M.D. Former Department of Health (DOH) Secretary Esperanza Cabral, in an interview on ANC’s Early Edition hosted by Christina Esguerra, said schools and parents should rethink this stopgap measure. “Well, if they want to keep their children at home, they can certainly do that, but what’s the use of going to school for three days and not going to school for two days?” she said. “On the days that they go to school, they are equally exposed to whatever it is they fear they’re going to be exposed to,” Cabral said. She elaborated, saying: “I think that the school administrators should consult with an expert in infectious diseases or with the Department of Health before they institute certain measures that they think they might want to do. “For example, in our area, one school decided that their students will go to class only three times a week and should hold home study on Tuesday and Thursdays. It’s really not necessary to do that. “They also said that students should wear masks during the days when they go to school. And this is school for young kids who are not really exposed to the virus at all.” When Esguerra asked where such a policy was being implemented, Cabral said she resides in Muntinlupa. As a seemingly knee-jerk approach to the prevention of the spread of the new coronavirus, many schools around the country have resorted to either suspending classes all together or opting to apply a homebased/ online approach to teaching, particularly for those in pre-school and, for some, also the lower elementary levels.

The PPA, however, said the crews of ships coming from China and its SARs will not be allowed to disembark. “The PPA is fully aware that replacement of crew will be done by the vessel operators in the voyage. That’s why the crew which will be replaced shall undergo strict quarantine period and will just be allowed to come upon the consent of the Department of Health (DOH),” they said.

He revealed that during the clinical trial, the possible vaccine will be tested on laboratory animals and then on humans. Domingo made the revelation as it was reported that the Chinese government has approved clinical trials of an antiviral drug that can potentially treat patients afflicted with 2019 novel coronavirus acute respiratory disease (2019-nCoV ARD). The World Health Organization (WHO) said that there is still “no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the novel coronavirus.” “Some specific treatments are under investigation and will be tested through clinical trials.

The MOE, in an official release, said that a “National Online Cloud Classroom” (www.eduyun.cn) will be opened on February 17 which is also the “date when classes were initially scheduled to resume classes.” MOE said that the online learning platform will offer a “variety of courses based on commonly used textbooks in China” and “its target users are first grade to twelfth grade pupils.” In an effort to prevent the continued spread of the 2019-nCoV, the MOE postponed the start of the spring semester 2020 and instructed the students “not to go out, meet people, organize or attend mass gatherings during the winter vacation.” It instructed after-school training institutions cancel the offline courses they offer. MOE noted that the China Education Network Television will also “broadcast relevant courses and learning resources” as required by the MOE, “to cater to the needs of students from rural and remote areas with unreliable or no Internet connection.” Earlier, MOE also mobilized resources from local educational government bodies in Beijing, Shanghai, Sichuan Province, and Zhejiang Province, and encouraged leading schools to “share their online learning resources for free until schools can reopen.” The People’s Education Press, the MOE said, will also open its digital learning database to the public for free. Last January 30, the MOE held a special meeting where “specific instructions were also issued for higher education institutions.” Aside including postponing the start of the new semester, MOE directed institutions to provide students remaining on campuses with “psychological support and daily health monitoring, reinforcing temperature checks at the entrance to campuses and buildings, and disinfecting high-traffic areas on campus.” Following the postponement of school semesters, China Daily/Asia News Network also reported that the MOE also required colleges and universities nationwide to offer online teaching and learning resources. Citing guidelines recently issued by the MOE, colleges and universities were directed to “make full use of all kinds of quality open online courses and laboratory resource platforms to organize online education activities” and that efforts should be made to “make sure that online learning can be as efficient as learning in the classroom.” Tags: ncov"

According to the World Health Organization’s Disease Control in Humanitarian Emergencies, there is no evidence that corpses pose a risk of epidemic disease especially after a natural disaster. “Most agents do not survive long in the human body after death. Human remains only pose a substantial risk to health in a few special cases, such as deaths from cholera or haemorrhagic fevers,” they said. But Hong Kong’s Center for Health Protection cited in a manual that cremation is advisable for the corpses of patients who died of nCoV acute respiratory disease. Embalming or the act of injecting preservatives into the dead body is not also allowed, though this is a common practice to slow down the process of decay. The country’s health chief Francisco Duque III said Thursday that the cremation of the remains of the 44-year-old Chinese male, the companion of the first confirmed case of nCoV in the country, was delayed anew, because funeral parlors had backed out from cremating the body amid worries that it might affect their business.

This was after Mayor Frolibar Bautista of the local government of Malay town in Aklan province issued an executive order noontime of Friday, February 7. “We are asking for your understanding and cooperation as we take precautionary measures,” said Bautista. The local government has been widely criticized for not instituting a ban of entry for tourists coming from nCov positive countries despite a travel ban imposed by Duterte administration since February 2. While there have been cancellations of flights going in and out of Kalibo Airport from mainland China and its territories, there were still visitors, believed to have come from these areas, who were able to visit Boracay Island. Bautista earlier told Manila Bulletin that these Chinese and other tourists were able to go in the country via other airports prior to the February travel ban, and just proceeded to Boracay this week. It was unclear how many Chinese tourists remain in the resort island, but the local government of Malay and the Bureau of Quarantine of the Department of Health (DOH) have given the assurance that were monitoring those who had travel history in China. With Friday’s ban, border patrol checkpoints have been set up in all entry points of Boracay and even mainland Malay town. Tourists paper works and other documents will be screened by agents just to make sure they had no travel history to China and its territories. Meanwhile, the local government assured that Boracay and Malay town remains free from nCov. “As of today, February 7, 2020, there are no confirmed cases,” Bautista added. Tags: ncov"

Researchers at the South China Agricultural University have identified the scaly pangolin as a ‘potential intermediate host’ for the virus (AFP / Sam YEH / MANILA BULLETIN) At least 31,000 people have been infected and 630 killed by the virus, which has spread to two dozen countries. Researchers at the South China Agricultural University have identified the scaly mammal as a “potential intermediate host,” the university said in a statement, without providing further details. The new virus, which emerged at a live animal market in central China’s Wuhan city late last year, is believed to have originated in bats, but researchers have suggested there could have been an “intermediate host” in the transmission to humans. After testing more than 1,000 samples from wild animals, scientists from the university found the genome sequences of viruses found on pangolins to be 99 percent identical to those on coronavirus patients, the official Xinhua news agency reported Friday. The pangolin is considered the most trafficked animal on the planet and over one million have been snatched from Asian and African forests in the past decade, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). They are destined for markets in China and Vietnam, where their scales are used in traditional medicine — despite having no medical benefits — and their meat is bought on the black market. China in January ordered a temporary ban on the trade in wild animals until the epidemic is under control. The country has long been accused by conservationists of tolerating a shadowy trade in endangered animals for food or as ingredients in traditional medicines. The SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) virus that killed hundreds of people in China and Hong Kong in 2002-03 also has been traced to wild animals, with scientists saying it likely originated in bats, later reaching humans via civets.   Tags: ncov"

This was disclosed by Department of Tourism (DOT) Regional Director Mary Jean A. Camarin who said “tourist arrivals were not affected by the Coronavirus outbreak because more than 80 percent of the visitors were Europeans, Australians and Americans.” Most of the foreign visitors visiting Caraga region, particularly in the acknowledged world tourist destinations of Siargao Island, come from Australia, US, Canada, Germany and Japan, according to Camarin. “Only 28 percent of our market is from China, and this do not affect the continuous coming in and out of other foreign tourists even though we are helping our provincial government in securing other foreign and domestic tourists against the n-CoV scare,” Camarin told the Manila Bulletin. The official, however, admitted the arrival figures for the first quarter might decline “slightly”, but the tourism department is hoping that when the travel ban on China and its administrative regions is lifted, the number of foreign arrivals will increase anew. An estimated 200,000 tourist arrivals in that Pacific Ocean facing paradise island of Siargao alone was recorded in 2019. Siargao Island, Surigao del Norte’s prime tourist destination, posted significant growth in tourist arrivals during the first six months in 2019. Tourist arrivals in Siargao posted a 32.85 percent growth rate during the period, or a total of 118,351 arrivals compared to 89,084 in 2018, Camarin said. Of the total number of arrivals in Siargao during the first half last year, 84,658 were domestic while 33,693 were foreign. The domestic arrivals posted a 39.16 percent increase and foreigners account for 20.22 percent. “Despite the n-CoV scare, our main concern also now is the health precautionary measures to our tourists, that why the provincial government of Surigao del Norte personally spearheaded by Gov. Francisco T. Matugas and province’s 1st District Rep. Francisco Jose “Bingo” F. Matugas are mobilizing all its resources for the safety and health concern of all their constituents and tourists in that province. “We are unified for the health concern of everybody,” she further said. Currently, the tourism department links with local government tourism officers, tourism associations, health department and enterprises providing them with the protocols and guidelines to ensure that precautionary measures are being instituted for the safety of locals and visitors.

Customers wear masks as they walk past empty toilet paper shelves at a supermarket, following the outbreak of a new coronavirus, in Hong Kong, China February 6, 2020. (REUTERS/Tyrone Siu/MANILA BULLETIN) Hong Kong has had 24 cases of the virus, and one of only two deaths outside mainland China where almost 640 people have died in the outbreak. “Everyone’s snatching whatever they can get. I don’t even know what’s going on,” said a 72-year-old woman surnamed Li as she clutched two bags of toilet roll. Shoppers have been clearing supermarket shelves of staples like rice and meat as well as cleaning products such as soap. The city’s government has condemned “malicious rumors” about shortages which have led to panic buying “and even chaos”, while supermarkets have put limits on the amount of products, including toilet paper, rice, and antiseptics, that people can buy. But hundreds of shoppers thronged city supermarkets again on Friday, loading up their trolleys. Xie Feng, Beijing’s top representative in Hong Kong, told diplomats and business groups the central government would support Hong Kong’s fight against the virus and guarantee the flow of essential supplies, the South China Morning Post reported. The health scare comes after months of anti-government protests in the former British colony over fears its special autonomy is being whittled away by Beijing, which denies doing so. Worry over the virus has led to new friction, with many people, particularly medical workers, demanding that the city government does more to stop the virus crossing in from the mainland by sealing off the border. Hong Kong has closed some cross-border links but has said completely sealing it would be inappropriate, impractical and discriminatory. On Saturday, Hong Kong will introduce quarantine for two weeks for all people arriving from the mainland. Thousands of hospital workers have been on strike this week to press the government to close the border and on Friday they occupied the headquarters of the government-backed Hospital Authority. “I’m quite disappointed the government refuses to listen to our demands and their policies are not very effective to contain the spread,” said a 23-year old male health worker surnamed Yeung. Separately, city authorities said they were conducting checks for the virus on a quarantined cruise ship carrying some 3,600 people that docked in Hong Kong this week. Cruise officials from the ship, the World Dream, said they were waiting to see how long it would have to remain in quarantine, after eight mainland people who had been on it in January tested positive. Health officials are trying to trace people who had traveled on the ship, many of whom disembarked in Hong Kong in January. Tags: ncov"

This handout photo taken and released on February 7, 2020, by Thailand’s Public Health Ministry shows Health Minister Anutin Charnvirakul (R) handing out protective facemasks to members of the public at a BTS Skytrain station in Bangkok. (AFP PHOTO / Thailand’s Public Health Ministry / MANILA BULLETIN) The outburst came as the kingdom faced steep losses over a drop in visitors from China, where the virus has killed more than 600 people and prompted sweeping travel restrictions. Tourism accounts for 18 percent of the country’s gross domestic product and Chinese holidaymakers make up a quarter of total arrivals. Thailand has detected 25 coronavirus cases and nine of those patients have recovered, while streets, public transport and shopping centres have filled with people wearing face masks. Health Minister Anutin Charnvirakul was distributing masks at a busy Bangkok skytrain entrance when he complained that “farang” tourists didn’t take them and acted as if they “don’t care”. Farang is a commonly used Thai word to describe Westerners and is sometimes used dismissively. “These kinds of people, we should kick them out of Thailand,” he told reporters, waving a handful of masks in the air. Anutin did not respond to additional requests for comment but posted an apology on his Facebook page for “losing it” after “some foreigners from Europe” were uncooperative in the mask campaign. More than 10 million Chinese tourists visited Thailand last year but the industry projects about two million fewer arrivals in 2020 because of the coronavirus, making US, European and other markets more vital. Debates over the efficacy of masks have bounced around the internet since the contagion first emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan last month. Since then it has spread to more than two dozen countries and infected tens of thousands, mostly within mainland China. Health experts generally agree masks are useful if you have respiratory symptoms or are caring for patients. But the World Health Organization’s own Thailand office tweeted a graphic on February 4 stating masks are “not needed for general public who do not have respiratory symptoms”. The WHO has advised people to wash their hands regularly and avoid touching their face. Tags: ncov"

In response to the coronavirus outbreak, Taiwan has stopped all Chinese nationals from entering its borders and temporarily suspended online visa applications for Hong Kong and Macau residents (AFP Photo/Sam Yeh / MANILA BULLETIN) They transited in Hong Kong on their journey to and from Europe. “After consultations with experts, we came to the conclusion that the most likely place of infection was on board the aircraft from Hong Kong to Europe where it was a confined space,” Health and Welfare Minister Chen Shih-chung told reporters late Thursday. The case highlights how air travel can spread the virus which has killed more than 600 people in China, where the outbreak first began. Hong Kong has 24 confirmed infections, including one death, and transmissions among locals who have not traveled to China recently are increasing. Taiwan confirmed five new cases on Thursday — including the couple — bringing their total number to sixteen. Also among the new infections was a woman in her forties who spent the Lunar New Year in Macau with three other family members. Taiwan has stopped all Chinese nationals from entering its borders and has temporarily suspended all online visa applications for Hong Kong and Macau residents. Other foreign nationals who have visited China, Hong Kong, and Macau in the past 14 days are also barred from entry. “I want to advise everyone to wear a face mask at all times when traveling in an aircraft and also in confined spaces such as inside airports,” Chen said.   Tags: ncov"
,"February 10, 2020, 12:38 PM",nCov,Pranks and patience: passing the time on the Diamond Princess,By Agence France-Presse,"By Agence France-Presse Tai chi, Bible study, karaoke and dancing with the “Dive Duo”: that was the entertainment promised passengers when they boarded the Diamond Princess. But an outbreak of the coronavirus has left 2,600 guests confined to their cabins and searching for ways to pass the time.  ` So, facing at least 14 days of quarantine in Japan’s Yokohama, holidaymakers are coming up with innovative ways to quell the boredom as their dream cruise turns into a nightmare. One Japanese passenger posted on Twitter that she had tried to prank the crew by greeting them wearing a seaweed face pack. “I decided to put on a short comedy performance for the crew members delivering meals. I’m waiting for them with seaweed on my face… but I wonder when they are coming. Yesterday the lunch arrived at 3 pm,” she said, before delivering a crushing blow. “Lunch arrived. My comic face didn’t get any laughs.” Matt Smith, a 57-year-old passenger, told AFP that the cruise operators had gradually increased the TV options to stave off boredom for those trapped inside their cabins. “They’ve always had some live TV channels and then some on-demand content movies and TV series. And since they announced the quarantine, they’ve added a number of live TV channels, they got them from around the world,” he said. One passenger enthusiastically tweeted: “I can’t get enough of these crazy cake shows.” But the choices were not to everyone’s liking. “Also watched ‘Dumbo’. Kinda boring for me,” complained one passenger on Twitter. ‘SOS… Corona beer’  If you think being trapped in a cruise ship cabin is bad, imagine trying to entertain a six-year-old boy at the same time. That’s the fate confronting Yardley Wong, who is also documenting the experience on social media. She posted a picture of her son pulling up the sheets on his bed with the caption: “Playing hide-and-seek in a small cabin. #killtheboredom.” Another parent posted a picture of an “entertainment pack” for children, with crayons, coloring and a (play) face mask. Sudoku, crosswords and word searches are also being provided, along with playing cards — presumably patience for the solo traveler. Others are finding entertainment in the most mundane of activities, like changing the sheets and doing the laundry, as well as making a careful choice of what to select for meals. More recently, some passengers — mainly those in inside cabins, without access to a balcony — have been allowed up on deck under strict conditions. Wong published a video of people dancing with joy as they frolicked in the sunshine, saying “I’m so excited, I just can’t hide it” and “so nice to breathe fresh air.” Others have just been gasping for their favorite tipple as the mini-bar quickly runs dry. British passenger David Abel, who has become a minor celebrity with his Facebook postings from the ship, implored the captain to personally deliver him a glass of whiskey. “I take Talisker, 10-year-old single malt, no ice, no water. It would be fantastic if that could be arranged,” he laughed. Another wag hung a sheet out of a cabin window, with the plea: “SOS, I need a Corona beer.” A more risque option emerged on Friday, as an adult webcam site announced it would be offering its services free to those on board “in an effort to keep their minds off of the coronavirus and to help with the boredom.” Read more: Coronavirus cases on Japan cruise ship treble to 61 Tags: ncov"

Health Undersecretary Rolando Enrique Domingo said the DOH is in talks with the local government unit of Capas, Tarlac to allay fears over the measure. “The Secretary [Francisco Duque III] is talking right now, I mean, is contacting the mayor to explain to them. Of course, all the agencies of government are going to do everything possible to make sure that the OFWs (overseas Filipino workers) who are coming in will not come in contact with the community,” Domingo said in a press briefing on Friday at the DOH-Central Office in Sta. Cruz, Manila. “Although it is in Capas, it’s inside the New Clark City. And everybody, not only DOH but all the other agencies, are going to make all necessary arrangements to make sure that there is no risk [to] the community.” Quarantine procedures  Domingo said repatriates who have flu-like symptoms will be transported straight to a medical facility. “Kung meron sa kanilang may sakit at may nararamdaman, diretso iyon sa hospital. Ang ilalagay lang natin sa quarantine facility ‘yung malulusog at walang pinapakitang sintomas,” he said. (If they are sick or unwell, they will be brought straight to a hospital. Only those who are healthy [upon arrival] and not showing [flu-like] symptoms will be placed in the quarantine facility.) Duque also made the same pronouncement in a press briefing last Thursday. “Upon alighting [from] the plane, the Bureau of Quarantine (BOQ) shall screen all passengers. All OFWs with symptoms shall immediately be admitted as patients under investigation at identified hospitals, while asymptomatic OFWs will be transported to the quarantine facility,” the health chief then said. “The BOQ will coordinate the disinfection of all luggage and the plane used, while the Center for Health Development (CHD)-Central Luzon will be in charge of disinfecting the vehicles used for transport.” Duque said that one room will be allotted per person during the quarantine period to ensure the “patient’s safety and convenience.” “The movement of the quarantined people shall be limited to the building only. DOH shall be in charge of the management, coordination, and logistics of the entire quarantine process. All DOH hospitals in the region will check for the deployment of medical teams in the quarantine area,” he said. Capas mayor reacts Meanwhile, Capas town Mayor Reynaldo Catacutan said the health department did not involve the Capas local government regarding the decision to make New Clark City the quarantine site for returning Filipinos. “We acknowledge that the Bases Conversion and Development Authority has full jurisdiction over NCC, but I, as the Mayor of Capas, appeal in behalf of all Capaseños to our dear President Rodrigo Duterte and DOH Secretary Francisco Duque to consider another place or facility as isolation area,” he said in a statement on Friday.

,"February 10, 2020, 12:38 PM",nCov,"Death of Chinese doctor fuels anger, demands for change",By Agence France-Presse,"By Agence France-Presse The death of a whistleblowing doctor whose early warnings about China’s new coronavirus outbreak were suppressed by the police has unleashed a wave of anger at the government’s handling of the crisis — and bold demands for more freedom. Ophthalmologist Li Wenliang was among eight physicians who sounded the alarm about the virus in late December, only to be reprimanded and censored by the authorities in central Hubei province.  A photo of the late ophthalmologist Li Wenliang is seen with flower bouquets at the Houhu Branch of Wuhan Central Hospital in Wuhan in China’s central Hubei province on February 7, 2020. (Photo by STR / AFP) / China OUT / MANILA BULLETIN) After Li’s death was confirmed early Friday, the 34-year-old doctor was lionized as a hero on social media, while officials were vilified for letting the epidemic spiral into a national health crisis instead of listening to the doctor. But many also used the occasion to demand more liberties in the Communist Party-ruled country, with the hashtags “I want freedom of speech” and “we demand freedom of speech” appearing on Twitter-like Weibo before being censored. “Chinese people are only allowed one kind of freedom, and that is the freedom given by the country and the Communist Party,” commented one Weibo user. “But clearly it is us who should be the masters of this country’s laws.” Local authorities in Hubei and its capital Wuhan, the city at the epicenter of the crisis, had already faced rare, uncensored criticism online in recent weeks for initially downplaying the magnitude of the outbreak. While the World Health Organization and some experts have heaped praise on China, saying it took decisive steps to try to contain the virus, critics say precious time was lost by the early inaction of the local government. Hubei and Wuhan officials held key political meetings in the first weeks of January. The death toll and number of cases only began to soar afterward, going from one fatality on January 11 to more than 630 barely four weeks later. Li, who was diagnosed with the virus on February 1, said in a Weibo post in late January that local police had forced him to sign a statement agreeing not to commit any more “law-breaking actions.” He said police had summoned him after he had seen test results from some patients suggesting SARS in December and decided to remind his colleagues in a group chat to take stronger precaution measures. After the Wuhan Central Hospital confirmed on Weibo early Friday that Li had joined the growing number of victims, mourners left hundreds of thousands of eulogies. “Everything in the world can be suppressed except grief,” a blogger said on the Chinese website Baidu. ‘Strong emotions’  The public sadness appears to have taken the Chinese government’s usually tightly-controlled propaganda apparatus on the back foot. State broadcaster CCTV and the Global Times tabloid had reported his death on Weibo late Thursday but they deleted their reports soon after the news became the top search item on the platform with 12 million hits. The hospital later issued a statement saying Li was undergoing emergency treatment before confirming his death early Friday. Dali Yang, a political science professor at the University of Chicago, said authorities likely ordered the delay to show there was an effort to save the doctor “because there was such an outpouring of emotion and they wanted to give a sense of hope”. “Clearly, there was a effort nationally to channel these very strong emotions from across the country,” Yang told AFP. But the government also did not want to “let it get out of hand” and instead move the grief in the direction that the leadership wants it to go, he said. The party wants to show that only under its leadership can the country overcome the crisis, he said. “That’s revolutionary discourse that the party has used again, again and again,” he said. In recent weeks, censors had allowed Weibo users to criticize Hubei officials — a move that placed attention on them instead of the central government. China’s anti-graft agency said Friday it was sending investigators to Wuhan to look into “issues” related to Li. After Li’s death, criticism went far beyond the anger directed at local officials, with users questioning the nature of the Communist state itself. ‘Don’t worry’  Some Weibo users used historical references, pointing to Wuhan as the birthplace of the 1911 revolution that ended thousands of years of imperial rule in China. “The eight heroes of Wuhan — the Qing dynasty has been dead for 100 years, how can there still be such bloody tragedies?” wrote one user. By Friday morning, multiple hashtags related to freedom of speech and Li’s death had been scrubbed from Weibo’s search results. “If they delete it, post it again. I oppose the criminalization of speech,” wrote a Weibo user in a post that had been reshared thousands of times. In one of his final Weibo posts, Li wrote the intensive care unit that he was having trouble moving and breathing. “Seeing all the support and encouragement from my online friends, my mood has become more relaxed,” Li said. “Please don’t worry everyone, I will actively cooperate with the treatment, and fight to be discharged soon!” Read more: Doctor who sounded the alarm on nCoV dies after contracting virus from patient   Tags: ncov"

The church founded by Sun Myung Moon distributed face coverings to the 30,000 crowd, but only some donned them (AFP / Jung Yeon-je / MANILA BULLETIN) The church founded by Sun Myung Moon — revered as a messiah by his followers — distributed face coverings to the 30,000 crowd, but only some donned them. “I am overwhelmed that I am getting married today,” said Choi Ji-young, who met her husband — matched by the church — only two months ago. “It would be a lie if I said I was not concerned at all about the infection,” said the 21-year-old university student. “But I feel like I will be protected from the virus today.” South Korea has recorded 24 cases of the novel coronavirus outbreak that emerged in neighbouring China, where more than 30,000 cases have been confirmed, and Seoul has barred entry to foreigners who have recently been in Wuhan, the epidemic’s centre. Festivals, graduation ceremonies, and K-pop concerts have been cancelled over fears large events could facilitate virus transmission, and authorities have asked religious groups to co-operate in preventing it spreading. The church went ahead with the event because it had been “four years in the making” as part of the celebrations of the 100th anniversary of Moon’s birth, said official Jang Young-chul. But followers from China were asked not to come, he added. Nearly 6,000 identical-dressed couples from 64 countries — many of whom met for the first time in recent weeks — married in Gapyeong, a festive mood filling the venue as newlyweds took group photos and were congratulated by friends and relatives. ‘God’s control’  Mass weddings, often held in giant sports stadiums with tens of thousands of couples, have long been a signature feature of the church, whose followers have been dubbed “Moonies” after its founder, who died in 2012. They began in the early 1960s, involving just a few dozen couples at first but with numbers mushrooming over the years. In 1997, 30,000 couples took part in a joint wedding in Washington, and two years later around 21,000 filled the Olympic Stadium in Seoul. Those who choose to be matched by the church must confirm under oath that they are virgins, and after their wedding the couple must refrain from sexual relations for a minimum of 40 days. Kim Chang-seong, 27, who was marrying a woman whom he met 20 days ago, said he was not concerned about infection because the mass wedding had “special meaning” for him. “By marrying a fellow church believer, I am taking a path paved by our church leaders.” The teachings of the Unification Church are based on the Bible but with new interpretations, and Moon saw his role as completing the unfulfilled mission of Jesus to restore humanity to a state of “sinless” purity. While it claims a worldwide following of three million, experts suggest the core membership is far smaller. Evelyne Chimfwembe, who flew in from Botswana to attend the ceremony with her husband of 28 years, said she was not worried about the virus as she believed the event would be “under God’s control”.

The parade was supposed to be held on February 10, start of five day of festivities. Lawyer Jose Paolo Evangelista, head of the City Information Office (CIO), clarified the activities were just postponed, and not cancelled. He said they did not want children, who will comprise most of the participants in the carnival-themed parade and drum and lyre contests, to be exposed to the virus. He, however, stressed the activities will continue on a later date or once it is confirmed that nCoV no longer poses any threat to the city. But the civic parade, which also highlights the city’s charter day on February 12, will continue as scheduled, the CIO head said. “The civic parade is participated in mostly by adults,” he added. The decision to postpone some of the activities of the foundation day was reached after a meeting on Friday of health officials from the City Health Office, City Tourism Office, CIO, and the Kidapawan City Schools Division. The result was submitted to Mayor Joseph Evangelista and immediately ordered the execution of the plan, according to CIO head. This year’s theme for the foundation day is, “Celebrating Life, Sustaining Peace, and Envisioning Progress.” Meantime, the local government has already placed bottles of hand sanitizers in different public places in the city. This, according to Evangelista, will ensure public health and safety. The local government will also see to it that public restrooms have water and soap.

(MANILA BULLETIN FILE PHOTO) BI port operations division chief Grifton Medina said the new travel ban policy was implemented after the Korean embassy in Manila informed the bureau last Monday that it was temporarily suspending the visa-free entry of Filipino tourists to Jeju. “We have already instructed our immigration officers not to allow the departure of any Filipino bound for Jeju unless the passenger was issued a visa by the Korean embassy,” Medina said. The embassy announced the suspension a day after health authorities confirmed the first reported death outside China of an Ncov patient at the San Lazaro Hospital in Manila. It was learned, however, that the suspension of visa-free entry privileges to Jeju applies not only to Filipinos but to all foreign tourists as well. Meanwhile, Medina said that almost 300 foreigners were already turned back at the airports as a result of the travel ban imposed on travelers directly arriving from China, Macau and Hongkong. “This does not include the ones that did not deplane and reach immigration during the first day of implementation,” said Medina. Nonetheless, Medina said the BI expects a sharp drop in the number of passengers covered by the ban due to the voluntary suspension by the airlines of their flights to and from the Philippines and the said three destinations. He added that he already asked the different airlines to screen Manila-bound passengers at the port of origin and disallow the boarding of those who have traveled to China, Macau, and Hongkong for the past 14 days.

Presidential Communications Secretary Martin Andanar (PCOO / FACEBOOK / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN) Amid intensified efforts to curb the spread of the new coronavirus, Andanar explained the health form is a precautionary measure that covers Cabinet Secretaries, government officials, employees, and visitors who will interact with the President. “With the public health emergency declaration due to the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) and the additional confirmed case of nCoV in the country, the health declaration form is an additional precautionary measure to ensure the safety and security, not just of President Rodrigo Duterte, but everyone who is working at or visiting Malacañang,” Andanar said. “Therefore, security clearances that have been augmented through a health declaration form by the Events Management Cluster of the Office of the President (OP-EMC) for those who have engagements with the President, are warranted,” he added. Government personnel and visitors entering the Palace are now required to provide information about their travel history and health status. The one-page health declaration forms were distributed last Thursday ahead of the oath-taking ceremony attended by President Duterte in Malacañang. In the health declaration form, persons are required to give their full name, nationality, sex, age, contact number, e-mail address, and address in the Philippines. They must also state the foreign countries or Philippine cities they visited in the past 14 days. The declaration form included questions asking if the person was sick in the past 30 days and if they experienced fever, colds, cough, sore throat, or breathing difficulties in the past 14 days. It also asked if the person had close contact with farm animals or was exposed to wild animals in the past two weeks. The form stated that the information must be true, correct, and complete, or else the person will risk “serious consequences” for failing to answer any question or any falsified response. Last Monday, the Presidential Security Group stepped up health precautions in Malacañang, conducting temperature checks of employees and visitors entering the compound.

Albay Representative Joey Salceda (ALI VICOY / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN) He said, while risk of transmission was still high, why not suspend classes, instead of cancelling small events such as those related to sports like the “Palarong Bicol”. Last Thursday, DepEd Bicol announced that the “Palarong Bicol” was moved indefinitely as a mitigating measure to control spread of nCoV. According to DepEd, this was to give more time for the agency to prepare measures to prevent the spread of the virus. “So what’s the logic? Bicol Palaro still on March as originally scheduled. So for now to contain the spread, why don’t you cancel classes instead – where human contact is more persistent, more frequent, more intense inside campuses and inside classes,” Salceda said. On February 4, Education Secretary Leonor Briones issued DepEd memorandum 15 as policy directives for the department’s Task Force nCoV to contain the spread of the virus. “Since we are behind the curve in contact tracing at 17% and we have not restrained domestic travel, then the biggest contact point with the most persistent, the most intense and the most frequent is the classroom with 26 milliom learners, bigger than the malls, the public markets, churches, the ports? For one, classroom size is only 63 square meter and there is need for 3 feet apart to avoid transmission, so only 22 students can fit. Most schools are ill-prepared and ill-equipped or have not been trained for nCoV prevention at all,” Salceda pointed out. Salceda on the other hand said that it is only a one day “stay home day” with national class and work suspension. “The logic is to mitigate crowds. Pero kung pupunta rin lang sila sa mga malls, eh di ganun din, so ipasara din muna mga yan for 1 day. In effect, parang may malaking bagyo na pinaghandaan na pwede tumama sa kahit anong parte ng bansa. Yung iba pwede magtrabaho at home via internet. Yung buong government lang ang papasok,” he said.

President Rodrigo Roa Duterte (ALFRED FRIAS / PRESIDENTIAL PHOTO / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN) Addressing new presidential appointees during an oath-taking ceremony in Malacañang last Thursday, the President said they should include hospital visits in their schedule even if there is a “contagion.” “Itong tunay pagmamalasakit. Try to visit. Hamon ko lang ito sa inyo, hamon ko lang. Try to visit ‘yung mga ospital lalo na kung may contagion. Nasa sahig ‘yan sila lahat (This is genuine compassion. This is my challenge to you: Try to visit hospitals especially if there is a contagion.

Chinese President Xi Jinping (AP Photo/Andy Wong, File / MANILA BULLETIN) Trump expressed his “confidence” in China’s ability to tackle the novel coronavirus epidemic, the White House said. Trump “expressed confidence in China’s strength and resilience in confronting the challenge of the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak,” the White House said in a statement. “The two leaders agreed to continue extensive communication and cooperation between both sides,” it said, following reports in Chinese state media that the two had spoken on the phone about the matter. The statement also noted that the two leaders had discussed “the great achievement of the recent United States-China Phase One Trade Deal and reaffirmed their commitment to its implementation.” China was gradually achieving results and was confident it could defeat the epidemic with no long-term consequences for economic development, Xi told his US counterpart in a telephone call, according to state television. Xi had earlier declared a “people’s war” on the virus, saying the “whole country has responded with all its strength (and) the most thorough and strict prevention and control measures,” Xinhua news agency reported. WHO still uncertain The conversation between the two leaders came as the World Health Organization (WHO) said it still cannot make predictions on the spread of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) as officials maintained that it is a disease whose origin is still unknown. “At this stage, it is not possible to predict the spread of the virus as this is a new disease with many unknowns,” WHO spokesperson Tarik Jasarevic said in a report by state-owned Chinese newspaper Global Times on Friday. The WHO said 28,276 confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV infection has so far been reported to them as of February 6, more than 560 of them dying of illnesses due to the new virus. Most of the confirmed cases and deaths still came from China, the epicenter of the 2019-nCoV outbreak. Dr. Mike Ryan, WHO Health Emergencies Program executive director, said it is premature to speak on numbers, especially after reported cases saw a decline in the past 24 hours. “It is still too early to make predictions related to that. We are still in the middle of an intense outbreak and we need to be very careful in making predictions,” Ryan said during the latest WHO press briefing in Geneva. READ MORE: nCoV spread unpredictable – WHO Whistleblower dies Xi’s call to the White House, which China has accused of scaremongering over the epidemic, came amid an outpouring of grief and anger on Chinese social media over the death of ophthalmologist Li Wenliang overnight. Li, 34, was one of eight people reprimanded by police in Wuhan, the epicenter of the contagion, last month for spreading “illegal and false” information about the flu-like virus that has since triggered a global health emergency. His messages to a group of doctors on Chinese social media warning of a new “SARS-like” coronavirus – a reference to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) which originated in China killed almost 800 people around the world in 2002-2003 – triggered the wrath of Wuhan police. China was accused of trying to cover up SARS. Li was forced to sign a letter on Jan. 3 saying he had “severely disrupted social order” and was threatened with criminal charges. Many Chinese people on social media described Li as a hero, accusing authorities of incompetence in the early stages of the outbreak which has now claimed more than 400 lives in Wuhan. “We deeply mourn the death of Wuhan doctor Li Wenliang … After all-effort rescue, Li passed away on 2:58 am, Feb. 7,” the ruling Communist Party’s People’s Daily said on Twitter. Some Chinese media outlets described him as a “hero who was willing to speak the truth” while other commentators posted poems, photos and drawings saluting him. “He is a hero who warned others with his life,” a fellow Wuhan doctor wrote on Weibo after reports of his death emerged. “Those fat officials who live on public money, may you die from a snowstorm,” wrote one angry Weibo user in a comment that has since been censored. “Light a candle and pay tribute to the hero,” one person posted on the Weibo social media platform. There were signs that discussion of his death was being censored. The topic “the Wuhan government owes doctor Li Wenliang an apology” briefly trended on Weibo late on Thursday, but yielded no search results on Friday. Toll mounts The death toll from the coronavirus outbreak in mainland China reached 636 on Friday with 73 more deaths recorded the previous day and 3,143 new confirmed infections, bringing the total to 31,161 cases, the National Health Commission said. The 3,143 new infections on Thursday were down from 3,694 on Wednesday and 3,887 on Tuesday, but experts warned it was too early to say if the data represented a trend. Two deaths have been reported outside China, in Hong Kong and the Philippines, but uncertainty about how deadly and contagious it is has prompted countries to quarantine hundreds of people and cut travel links with China. The virus has spread around the world, with 320 cases in 27 countries and regions outside mainland China, according to a Reuters tally of official statements. There were 41 new cases among about 3,700 people quarantined in a cruise ship moored off Japan, bringing the total to 61 cases on board. In Hong Kong, another cruise ship with 3,600 passengers and crew was quarantined for a third day after three people who had been on board were found to be infected. Taiwan, which has 16 cases, banned international cruise ships from docking. A British national was confirmed to have contracted coronavirus after travelling to an Asian country other than China. The government did not identify the country, but gave a list of countries from which returning travelers who developed symptoms should isolate themselves. It said those returning from Thailand, Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia and Macau as well as China should follow the advice. Ghost cities In China, the world’s second-largest economy, cities have been shut off, flights cancelled and factories closed, cutting off supply lines to international businesses. Beijing is like a ghost town, with Chang’an Avenue, the main thoroughfare, almost completely deserted, and attractions like Tiananmen Square, the Great Hall of the People and the Forbidden City devoid of tourists. China has chafed at some of the travel restrictions imposed by other countries, which the WHO says are unnecessary. The foreign ministry said Italy was willing to resume some flights. Anxiety over the impact of the virus returned to financial markets on Friday, with stock indexes in China, Hong Kong and throughout Asia slipping after several days of gains on fears of a pandemic. China’s central bank said it would step up policy support for sectors affected by the outbreak. Analysts believe China’s first-quarter economic growth could slow sharply by 2 percentage points, or more from 6%, in the last quarter, but could rebound sharply if the outbreak peaks soon. Toyota Motor Corp and Honda Motor Co on Friday extended suspensions of production at Chinese plants, joining a growing number of automakers facing stoppages due to supply-chain disruptions. South Korea asked Chinese regional governments for help in resuming production at South Korean auto parts suppliers’ factories in China.

A 21-year-old nurse, who is suspected of contracting the 2019-novel coronavirus, was placed under quarantine, making her the fifth person under investigation (PUI) for the virus in Bohol province. Dr. Cesar Tomas Lopez, spokesman of the Bohol provincial government’s anti-nCoV technical working group (TWG), said the nurse displayed flu-like symptoms after coming into contact with the 60-year-old Chinese woman who was the third reported 2019-nCoV case in the country. One of the newly identified PUI’s colleagues, also a nurse, was already put under investigation after showing the same symptoms. The other PUIs are two Americans aged 23 and 24. The foreign PUIs reportedly travelled from New York to Beijing, China before going to Manila. They went to El Nido and Coron, both in Palawan, before travelling to Bohol. After developing fever and cough, the PUIs sought medical treatment at the Gov. Celestino Gallares Memorial Hospital, where they are currently isolated.

Dr. Grace Tan, spokesperson of Bacolod City Inter-agency against 2019-nCoV said two Filipinas aged 45 and 29 were admitted to a hospital in Bohol Wednesday night, after suffering from dry cough and sore throat. Tan said the two women voluntarily submitted themselves for quarantine, pending the results of their swab tests from the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM). Tan said the elder Filipina came from China on January 23 and exhibited flu-like symptoms six days later, while the other PUI traveled to Hong Kong and Macau. In Negros Oriental, four of the eight PUIs were tested negative for 2019-nCoV. Bimbo Miraflor, public information officer of the provincial government, announced this in a press briefing on Thursday. Miraflor said that the eight persons under investigation (PUIs) who exhibited flu-like symptoms include four hotel staff, a van driver, a seatmate in the airplane of the Chinese couple who tested positive for 2019-nCoV, and two others who traveled to Taiwan and Hong Kong. (With reports from Minka S.

(AFP Photo/NICOLAS / MANILA BULLETIN FILE PHOTO) With three confirmed cases of the coronavirus and 133 persons under investigation (PUIs) in the Philippines, CHR Spokesperson Atty Jacqueline Ann de Guia said that it is understandable that Filipinos will be afraid about the virus spreading. However, she said that it is disconcerting that the outbreak has resulted to undue discrimination against other people and race. “With the world confronted with a virus with little information known, it is human to be afraid. But we must not allow hysteria and paranoia result to othering and irrational treatment of people,” she said in a statement. In order to put a stop to this discrimination, de Guia said that people must stop spreading information that just aren’t true and be careful about the news they read. “Putting a halt to rumor mongering and the spread of false information demand collective action. Such situation should also not, in any way, be used to justify authoritarian tendencies, such as curtailment of rights,” she stressed. The CHR has likewise called for government unity in combating the virus in the country. There are already regular monitoring systems in place, including a ban for travelers from China, Hong Kong, and Macau to enter the country. However, the CHR is calling for “greater focus and expediency.” “A situation of this scale is not a sole concern of one agency, but demands the attention of the entire government as the primary responsible for every person’s right to health – encompassing all aspects of addressing an outbreak from detection to mitigation,” said de Guia. “We commend all health professionals, here and overseas, who continue to combat this virus. As duty-bearers for our rights, we have the right to demand better services from the government. But let us also be reminded of our responsibility to respect the rights and dignity of all persons regardless of any circumstance,” she added.

Bulacan State University (MANILA BULLETIN FILE PHOTO) In a memorandum issued over the week, BulSU President Cecilia Gascon announced that the University Infirmary will start deploying inspectors with infrared thermometers in all entry points of the main campus in Malolos City. According to Gascon, this will help them verify that all persons entering the campus do not exhibit body temperature that is indicative of fever which is among the symptoms of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection. Gascon added that the thermal scanning, which will begin Monday, February 10, will continue as the university’s precautionary measure “until the novel coronavirus scare is over.” With this, the University President urged the BulSU community to make necessary adjustments in light of the anticipated build-up in all gates of the main campus, particularly in the morning rush hour.

Gatchalian said the DOH has also been “slow” in its “prevention” and “response” to the virus. “You have two million Chinese nationals going into the country, these should have been a red flag already within the DOH system,” the senator said. “The first instance [that we had detection, there] should be immediate travel ban, to curb the influx of potential carries into our country,” he added. The senator reiterated that it was the DOH’s “responsibility” to advise the President on matters concerning the virus.

(MANILA BULLETIN) DOH Secretary Francisco Duque III said that they will lay down the dos and don’ts that have to be followed by the returning OFWs to ensure the health and safety of everyone in the area should they be infected with the virus. These include limiting where they could roam around and requiring them to observe cleanliness through using various hygiene kits and disinfectant solutions. “Mayroon tayong controlled yung environment, regulated talaga. Kaya mo nga kina-quarantine para hindi makahawa [We will have a controlled environment. It will really be regulated. The reason why you’re putting them under quarantine, so they could not infect others],” Duque said over DZBB interview Friday morning. “Bibigyan na sila ng hygiene kit para maya-maya, punasan nila yung lapag ng kanilang lamesa at CR [They will be given hygiene kit so they could clean their tables and comfort rooms from time to time],” he added in another radio interview “Respiratory droplet ang mode of transmission. Wala sa hangin at doon sa plema.

Not through air but through phlegm, among others. So whoever touches a table, cellphone, book or computer with the virus, could also get infected].” Duque said that they are still finishing the complete list of rules, but gave assurance that the mental and psycho-social health of the returning OFWS will be given consideration. “[Papayagan silang] pumunta sa lugar na walang tao para makalanghap ng sariwang hangin. Syempre yung mental health din nila, kailangan mong asikasuhin. Yung psycho-social health services [They will be allowed to go to place where they could breathe fresh air. Of course, we’re taking care of their mental and phsyco-social health],” Duque said. The health secretary added that each repatriated Filipino will have his or her own room, which could accommodate two more if they have kids with them. Each room also has its own toilet, air-condition unit, television and refrigerator. While undergoing a two-week quarantine, OFW returnees would be provided with access to limited hours of internet connection so they could make calls to their families. Aside from it, the health department will give those under their care complete packed meals. Doctors and nurses wearing protective gear will also monitor the status of the repatriates. The DOH is expecting some 40 to 50 OFWs from Wuhan. However, Duque said that they are still finalizing the list as some are still hesitant to return to the country.

Col. Rhoderick Armamento (PNA / MANILA BULLETIN FILE PHOTO) In a radio interview, PNP-Criminal Investigation and Detection Group (CIDG) deputy chief for operations Col. Rhoderick Armamento said police have reached out to 91 out of the total 193 passengers of the January 21 Cebu-Dumaguete flight of Cebu Pacific and the January 25 Dumaguete-Manila flight of Philippine Airlines, as of 6 a.m. Friday. This was an increase from the 48 they have contacted as of Thursday, February 6. The CIDG was tasked to locate the passengers of the local flights boarded by the Chinese national, while the Deparment of Health was assigned to the international flights. They were given 48 hours, starting Wednesday, to trace all the concerned passengers. “Actually, matatapos na ito (this will be completed), (we are) almost done na kami,” Armamento declared in an interview over radio DzBB Friday morning. Armamento disclosed that one of the passengers who were reported to be manifesting symptoms of respiratory diseases was cleared of the 2019-nCoV. “They found out na may history lang ng asthma so ni-rule out nila na hindi ito involved (that the person has history of asthma so they ruled out the virus),” he said, saying that police were with Department of Health (DOH) epidemiology surveillance teams in checking the passengers’ conditions. Earlier, six Filipinos showed symptoms of cough, colds, and similar respiratory conditions. The PNP, he said, is still challenged by individuals who continue to ignore or refuse to answer their calls, or those who did not give contact numbers. He appealed to them to cooperate with authorities to prevent the virus from further spreading. Armamento said they will seek for the Bureau of Immigration’s help in contacting the said passengers. But overall, he said passengers have been “very accommodating, and have appreciated their efforts.” Tags: ncov"

(MANILA BULLETIN) DOH Secretary Francisco Duque III on Friday morning said that he was able to talk with the president and chief executive officer of the Bases Conversion and Development Authority (BCDA), which owns the site, and agreed that the Athletes’ Village will be put on lockdown once it begins accepting repatriated Filipinos. “I-lalack down naman nila, so walang problema na baka malagay sa alanganin ang mga komunidad [They will put the site on lockdown so there’s nothing to worry about that they might be put at risk],” Duque said over DZMM interview as some locals, including officials, reportedly expressed objection to the said plan. The health secretary asked the public not to worry as the mode of transmission of the 2019-novel coronavirus acute respiratory disease (nCoV ARD), which has already infected more than 30,000 people around the world, “is through respiratory droplet,” and not airborne. “Kung iisipin mong mabuti, ang nature ng virus eh, ito naman ‘di tulad ng measles, tuberculosis, chicken pox na sa hangin, airborne na pwedeng makalayo. Na pagka-nalanghap, pwedeng makaabot kung saan saan na komunidad [If you’re going to think of it, the nature of this virus is not like measles, tuberculosis or chickenpox that it could be passed through air and could affect nearby communities],” he said. “Respiratory droplet ang mode of transmission, wala sa hangin at doon sa plema, kapag nalapag sa lamesa, cellphone, libro, computer tapos nahawakan ng susunod na tao, kinuskos sa ilong doon ka mahahawa [The mode of transmission is through respiratory droplet. Not through air but through phlegm, among others. So whoever touches a table, cellphone, book or computer with the virus, could also get infected],” Duque added. Like SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), which emerged in 2003, Duque said, people just need to observe at least six to 10 feet distance away from nCoV ARD patients to ensure that they will not get infected. “Pagka-layo-layo ng mga komunidad [sa Athletes’ Village]. Walang tsansa na ito makahawa sa karatig na barangay o bayan,” he said, “So, wag ho kayong mangangamba [There’s no nearby community in Athletes’ Village, so there’s no chance that the virus could reach any town or barangay].” The DOH will be providing hygiene kits and disinfectant solutions to those under quarantine, so “they could clean their own environment by themselves.” “Very sensitive naman ang virus sa bleaching solution [The virus is very sensitive to bleaching solution],” he stressed. Duque told the public that it is the time to show the Filipino spirit of “bayanihan” (unity and cooperation) and care for their fellow. He said he was saddened by the fact that  “every community that I went to [to discuss plans to build quarantine sites in their area] expressed objection.” “Sabi ko, sino mangangalaga sa kapwa natin Pilipino, kundi Pilipino rin?

Liu Xiaoming said Beijing had told the UK the move was not “a good idea” and instead called for a more measured approach.  China’s ambassador to Britain Liu Xiaoming takes questions from members of the media at the Chinese Embassy in London on February 6, 2020, during a press conference relating to the coronavirus strain 2019-nCov outbreak in Wuhan, Hubei province. (Photo by Tolga AKMEN / AFP / MANILA BULLETIN) On Tuesday, the British Foreign Office advised UK nationals to leave China “if they can” to minimize their risk of exposure to the coronavirus, following similar advice by the United States. “I hope the British government… will take an objective, cool-headed view of what is going on in China,” Liu said at a press conference at the Chinese embassy in London. “We did tell them overreaction is not helpful. We don’t think there should be such a panic,” he added. “We should support each other, rather than to weaken the other’s efforts.” Liu also claimed there had been “some cases of hatred, discrimination, against Chinese nationals”, including at schools and universities, because of the virus. “People should realize that we have a common enemy of mankind. We should say ‘no’ to discriminatory words and behavior,” he told reporters. On Thursday, Britain confirmed its third case of the SARS-like virus which has so far killed at least 563 people and sparked global alarm as it spreads around the world. The ambassador defended China’s response to the epidemic, insisting it was “controllable, preventable and curable”. He said London had vowed to follow the advice of the World Health Organization (WHO) in its warning to British citizens there. “We asked them to take (the) advice of (the) WHO to make a reasonable response, do not overreact. “It seems to me the facts are not entirely squared, the words do not match with the deeds,” he added. US flu ‘more serious’  Meanwhile, according to Boris Johnson’s father, Chinese officials were concerned that the British prime minister had not sent a personal message of support to the country’s leaders. Stanley Johnson, a well-known environmental campaigner, had apparently met Liu to talk about conservation matters. But in emailed feedback to British officials — and seemingly sent to the BBC by mistake — the campaigner revealed that Beijing was upset about the lack of personal support for China’s predicament from Boris Johnson. The British government insisted Stanley Johnson had attended the meeting as a private citizen and was not acting on its behalf. The PM’s deputy spokesman, Jamie Davies, said: “We have been working closely with international partners including China on this. “Our response has been expert-led by health professionals and it will continue to be.” Liu insisted communications with the prime minister were “good” and that the two men had recently met at a Chinese new year reception at Downing Street. “He (Johnson) told me he’s still committed to the golden years of China-UK relations,” the ambassador added. However, Liu accused some US politicians of trying to “take advantage” of the situation “for political gains”, while arguing the common flu virus in the US was “more serious” than the coronavirus. “In the United States, more than 19 million people have fallen ill with a flu so far this season, with a death toll being 10,000,” Liu said. “This is more serious than coronavirus infection.” Tags: ncov"

In an interview during his visit to fire victims in Quezon City the other day, Go said that the OFWs might be repatriated “anytime soon.” He also expressed his concern for the Filipinos who are currently in Wuhan, the ground zero of the global health emergency. “They will come (home) soon. Anytime in the next few days, kaya inihahanda na po ang possible quarantine areas,” Go said, urging officials to expedite the repatriation process. (The possible quarantine areas are being prepared.) “Dapat sa lalong madaling panahon, while observing our health protocols. Kung pumayag na ang bansang China, ready na po, pauwiin na po (agad). Kawawa din sila roon. Hindi nababayaran ang lungkot at pangamba sa ibang bansa,” he added. (Their return home should be sooner while observing protocols.

The Village is ready to accommodate the returning OFWs from China.) Go, former special assistant to President Duterte, said the President prefers that the returning OFWs should be made comfortable and safe. He also said that New Clark City would be a strategic site for the quarantine protocol because its location is near the Clark International Airport. According to the  Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging and Re-Emerging Infectious Diseases, there are 45 Filipinos so far who will be repatriated from Wuhan City. They are currently finalizing the documents needed, with the help of foreign affairs officials and Chinese authorities, in order to be allowed by the Chinese government to be repatriated back to the Philippines. Once granted permission by the Chinese authorities to exit China, the repatriation is tentatively scheduled on February 8 and the repatriates are expected to arrive in the Philippines the next day, according to the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA). The government will be assigning officers to help in the repatriation, including doctors and nurses from the DOH. Personal protective equipment shall be provided to the team. The IATF clarified that the repatriates must have Public Health Clearance as well as Customs, Immigration, and Quarantine clearance from China. Briefing and counseling for the repatriates will be conducted by the Philippine embassy. A chartered commercial plane shall be used to fly the repatriates back to the Philippines. Before boarding, thermal scanning and assessment shall be conducted again by the DOH team. While on-board the plane to the Philippines, DOH shall conduct orientation on quarantine rules and procedures. Upon arrival in Clark International Airport, thermal scanning shall again be conducted prior to disembarkation. From Clark International Airport, the repatriates shall be transported to the Athletes’ Village. Pre-arranged rooms will be assigned to all OFWs, packed food will be served by DOH Regional Office, and routine nursing care will be available for their healthcare needs. If there are repatriates with developing cases, they will be brought to the nearest referral hospital. Five DOH hospitals in Region 3 shall deploy medical teams for the whole duration of the repatriates’ stay in NCC. The Overseas Workers Welfare Administration (OWWA) will be in charge of the send-off after fourteen days of quarantine. Go reiterated his advice to Filipinos to remain calm and help the government in protecting the country and its people from this global health concern. Meanwhile, Go extended help to around 60 families affected by a fire that started on February 4 at Astor Street, Barangay North Fairview, Quezon City. Aside from relief and financial assistance, Go also offered to provide for the uniforms and school supplies of the affected students.

Senator Joel Villanueva (Senator Joel Villanueva Official Facebook Page / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN) “We need all hands on deck. We have a serious health crisis. We expect the cooperation of everyone to implement the ban,” Villanueva said on Thursday. The senator issued the call after a report, quoting local officials, said tourists from mainland China have arrived in Boracay Island in Malay, Aklan, last Tuesday, two days after President Duterte ordered the prohibition on the entry of all travelers from China. Eusebio Monserate Jr., acting chief of Civil Aviation Authority of Philippines at Kalibo Airport, denied the report. Monserate maintained that flights to and from mainland China, as well as those from Hong Kong and Macau, have ceased since the travel ban directive was issued on Sunday. “Allowing tourists from China, particularly Wuhan, to arrive in Boracay is irresponsible. It exposes workers, other tourists, and residents at risk. It strains our limited resources, particularly our capacity to respond to public health emergency,” Villanueva said. “We need everyone to cooperate so we can prevent the spread of the disease and limit the exposure of the public. Let’s follow the ban,” he appealed. Malay officials are monitoring at least 300 Chinese tourists who are still in Boracay.

There were more than 3,700 passengers and crew on the ship when it arrived off Japan’s coast on Monday evening (JIJI PRESS/AFP / STR / MANILA BULLETIN) An additional 41 passengers were found to have contracted the virus, which has killed hundreds of people, most of them in China, and infected more than 30,000 on the mainland. Japanese authorities have so far tested 273 people on board the Diamond Princess, which was quarantined after a former passenger, who disembarked in Hong Kong last month, was diagnosed with the virus. “The results of the remaining 171 tests came out and 41 tested positive,” Health Minister Katsunobu Kato told reporters. “Today they will be sent to hospitals in several prefectures, and we are now preparing for that.” The newly diagnosed include 21 Japanese, as well as Americans, Canadians, Australians, an Argentine and a Briton. There were more than 3,700 passengers and crew on the ship when it arrived off Japan’s coast on Monday evening. It docked in Yokohama on Thursday to resupply for a quarantine that could last until February 19. Twenty people who were earlier diagnosed with the virus have already been removed from the vessel, including one in serious condition, a health ministry official said, without providing further details. Testing was initially carried out on those who displayed symptoms or had come into close contact with the former passenger diagnosed with the virus. But Kato suggested testing would now be expanded to those “who are susceptible to illness, including elderly people and those with other ailments, as well as those who had close contact with the people newly diagnosed with the virus.” There were no immediate details on how many people would meet those criteria or when the testing might take place. ‘Disheartening’  Japan has already reported at least 25 cases of coronavirus aside from the infections on board the ship, and evacuated hundreds of citizens from Wuhan, the Chinese city where the virus emerged, including on a fourth flight Friday. Passengers on the ship have been asked to stay inside their cabins to prevent new infections, and have expressed confusion and frustration about a quarantine expected to last until February 19. American attorney Matt Smith, 57, and his wife Katherine, are among the luckier passengers, in a suite with their own balcony. But he told AFP that the 14-day quarantine was a “hard pill to swallow.” “My thought is, the greater number they diagnose on the ship, the greater chance they’re going to find some reason to extend the quarantine,” he added. “It’s a little disheartening.” Passengers in windowless inside cabins have been allowed only onto open decks briefly, under strict conditions, including wearing a mask at all times. “The quarantine officials require that you avoid congregating in large groups and maintain a separation of at least one metre from each other when talking,” the ship’s captain said in an announcement on Friday morning. “We require that you wear as a minimum, warm clothing, hat and a scarf if possible,” he added. Crew are wearing masks and gloves when they deliver meals, Smith said, and on Friday thermometers were distributed to passengers, who were asked to notify staff of temperatures over 37.5 Celsius. While some passengers have reportedly urged their governments to intervene, Smith said he understood the measures. “The Japanese government is going to do what it can to prevent this virus, just as the US is doing in its borders,” he said. A second cruise ship carrying a passenger suspected of infection with the new virus is headed towards Japan, and authorities said they would ask it to avoid docking.

Jeju Island. (Photo by Jonathan Hicap / MANILA BULLETIN) “In an effort to help stem the spread of novel coronavirus, the Ministry of Justice of the Republic of Korea has suspended visa-free entry to Jeju Special Self-Governing Province beginning Feb. 4. This temporary measure is aimed at stopping any new coronavirus infections in the province and mainland, by strengthening entry procedures. This includes the screening of new visas,” the Jeju Tourism Organization announced. Before the suspension, Philippine passport holders were allowed to enter Jeju Island without a visa through direct flights and ships. They are now required to have a valid visa to travel to the island. Besides the Philippines, those affected by the visa suspension policy are regular passport holders from Algeria, Angola, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Belize, Benin, Bolivia, Cambodia, China, Gabon, Georgia, India, Indonesia, Laos, Lebanon, Moldova, Mongolia, Mozambique, Oman, Tajikistan, Ukraine, Vanuatu, and Vietnam. Official and general passport holders from Jordan and Turkmenistan are also covered by the new rule. Also affected by new policy are diplomatic, official, and regular passport holders from  Bhutan, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cape Verde, Central African Republic, Chad, Comoros, Congo, Democratic Republic of Congo, Djibouti, East Timor, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Ivory Coast, Kenya, Libya, Madagascar, Malawi, Maldives, Mali, Mauritania, Namibia, Niger, Papua New Guinea, Rwanda, Sao Tome and Principe, Sierra Leone, Tanzania, Togo, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. The Korean Embassy in Manila has also announced the new Jeju Island policy. It said “the Korean Government has announced that the visa-free entry to Jeju Island and visa free entry for transit passengers who depart from China are suspended until further notice.” “In addition, starting February 4, 2020, any foreigner who have visited or stayed in the Hubei Province, China – within the last 14 days, are not permitted to enter Korea,” it added. As of Feb. 6, South Korea has 23 confirmed cases of coronavirus, according to the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC). Tags: ncov"

(MANILA BULLETIN) Dr. Cesar Tomas Lopez, spokesman of the Bohol provincial government’s anti-nCoV technical working group (TWG), said the nurse displayed flu-like symptoms after coming into contact with the 60-year-old Chinese woman who was the third reported 2019-nCoV case in the country. One of the newly identified PUI’s colleagues, also a nurse, was already put under investigation after showing the same symptoms. The other PUIs are two Americans aged 23 and 24. The foreign PUIs reportedly travelled from New York to Beijing, China before going to Manila. They went to El Nido and Coron, both in Palawan, before travelling to Bohol. After developing fever and cough, the PUIs sought medical treatment at the Gov. Celestino Gallares Memorial Hospital, where they are currently isolated. The PUIs’ swab samples were taken and submitted to the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine to determine if they are carriers of the virus from China. Bohol Governor Arthur Yap said in an interview with DZMM that a 31-year-old Chinese national who was also quarantined after displaying flu-like symptoms has already been released from the hospital. The Bohol provincial government also tracked the 60-year-old Chinese woman who tested positive for 2019-nCoV, and found that she is already healed and has returned to China. Data from the Department of Health showed that there are 133 PUIs for 2019 nCoV nationwide. Of this, 115 are admitted and under quarantine while 16 are under strict monitoring after being discharged.

A woman wearing a face mask rides a bicycle a,imid snow, as the country is hit by an outbreak of coronavirus, in Beijing, China February 6,2020. (REUTERS/Carkis Garcia Rawlins/File Photo/MANILA BULLETIN) Despite this, Beijing would typically be thronged with morning traffic and tourists heading to Tiananmen Square, the Great Hall of the People and the Forbidden City. Instead, Reuters Greater China Chief video producer Mark Chisholm has spent the last 10 days commuting through a “ghost city” to work amid an extension of the Lunar New Year holidays due to the coronavirus outbreak. “You see empty walkways, empty streets with very little cars, bicycles or motorbikes,” Chisholm said. The virus, believed to have originated in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, has killed more than 630 people and infected more than 31,000, the vast majority of them in China. The outbreak is also inflicting a growing toll on businesses and consumers in the world’s second-largest economy. Strict transport curbs have been imposed in many parts of the country, and like Beijing, some cities are in virtual lockdown. Chisholm exits the diplomatic compound where he lives through double doors, and a guard at the gate wearing a face mask checks his temperature. Chisholm finds Chang’an Avenue, the capital’s main thoroughfare, almost completely deserted, with one or two people standing at bus stops, and roads devoid of traffic. He then heads down a flight of steps into the underground Yong’anli train station on Line 1, his voice echoing in the vacant stairwell. The only people he encounters are the workers operating the thermal scanner at the turnstiles. A platform normally packed with hundreds of people is eerily empty, the automated announcements reverberating in the otherwise silent station. Passengers sit in small groups on the train, everyone masked and no one making eye contact. Chisholm gets off and walks into the three-storey Wangfujing shopping mall, filled with shuttered shops and bright red Lunar New Year decorations featuring oversized rodents to mark the Year of the Rat. Finally, as Chisholm nears the Reuters offices, he sees a man in a hazard suit spraying disinfectant into dark corridors from a yellow backpack. “I’ve lived in Beijing for 15 years and never seen the city so deserted,” Chisholm said. “I actually find it rather sad that this usually vibrant place has become a ghost city with 25 million people holed up in their apartments.” Tags: ncov"

Another 3,143 new cases of infection were confirmed, bringing total infections in the country thus far to 31,161, it said. The central province of Hubei where the virus originated continued to be hardest-hit, accounting for 69 of the new deaths reported in the 24 hours to Friday. Of the reported infections, more than 4,800 of those people were in serious condition. Chinese authorities are still struggling to contain the outbreak despite ordering millions of people indoors in a growing number of cities, with overwhelmed hospitals struggling to treat the surging numbers of ill. The contagion emerged in the Hubei provincial capital of Wuhan in December, later spreading to the rest of China and more than two dozen other countries, prompting the World Health Organisation to declare a global emergency. The number of confirmed infections in China could still grow significantly, with the health commission saying that more than 26,000 other people were “suspected” of having contracted the virus.   Tags: ncov"

(Photo by STR / AFP) / China OUT / MANILA BULLETIN FILE PHOTO) “At this stage, it is not possible to predict the spread of the virus as this is a new disease with many unknowns,” WHO spokesperson Tarik Jasarevic said in a report by state-owned Chinese newspaper Global Times on Friday. The WHO said 28,276 confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV infection has so far been reported to them as of February 6, more than 560 of them dead of illnesses due to the new virus. Most of the confirmed cases and deaths still came from China, the epicenter of the 2019-nCoV outbreak. Dr. Mike Ryan, WHO Health Emergencies Programme executive director, said it is premature to speak on numbers, especially after reported cases saw a decline in the past 24 hours. “It is still too early to make predictions related to that. We are still in the middle of an intense outbreak and we need to be very careful in making predictions,” Ryan said during the latest WHO press briefing in Geneva. Ryan cited the 3,722 new cases reported on February 6, which was lower than the 3,925 new cases relayed to them the previous day. He added that despite increasing cases in Hubei province, the WHO observed “relatively stable numbers” in other China provinces, as well as in Hong Kong and Taiwan. “We’re seeing it in the graphs…It looks like the cumulative daily numbers are rising, but the actual numbers compared to the numbers reported yesterday (February 5) is actually down on the day. And does that mean anything? Well, at least it’s not going in the wrong direction,” he said. Ryan, however, maintained that “we may see increase in the coming days” due to the 2019-nCoV’s varying cycles of transmission. The figures are “still a great worry,” he added. Health experts and scientists from all over the world are set to gather on February 11 to 12 in the WHO’s global research & innovation forum to tackle measures to prevent the 2019-nCoV from further spreading.   Tags: ncov"

Hua Chunying, spokeswoman of China’s Foreign Ministry (REUTERS/Jason Lee / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN) “We deplore and oppose those countries who went against WHO’s (World Health Organization) professional recommendations and ICAO’s (International Civil Aviation Organization) bulletins and have lodged stern representations with them. Their actions, which sowed panic among the public, will not help prevent and control the epidemic. They have gravely disrupted normal personnel exchanges, international cooperation and order of the international market of air transportation,” China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs Spokesperson Hua Chunying said in a press briefing in Beijing on Thursday. The Chinese foreign ministry official explained that at the onset of the outbreak, Beijing has already taken the “most thorough and strict prevention and control measures” which she said are increasingly showing their effects. Hua pointed out that the WHO even lauded China’s strong measures and stressed many times that it does not recommend and even opposes imposing restrictions on travel. Instead, the Chinese government appealed to the concerned countries to “think carefully, not to overreact, nor restrict flights operated by airlines of the two sides, with bilateral relations and cooperation in mind.” “They should immediately correct their policies and wrongdoings in reference to recommendations of the WHO and ICAO and take concrete actions to support China’s battle against the epidemic,” she added. Airline companies from the Philippines, along with several other international airlines all over the world, have suspended their flights going to and from China following the coronavirus outbreak. Over the weekend, Cebu Pacific said all of its flights between the Philippines and Mainland China (Beijing, Shanghai, Xiamen, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen) are canceled from Feb. 2 until March 29, 2020, while its flights between the Philippines, Hong Kong, and Macau are trimmed. AirAsia flights from Manila and Kalibo in Aklan to Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Macau are also canceled until March 1, 2020. Hua also branded as “baseless assumptions” the call of some countries for their citizens to leave China due to travel restrictions. “We hope all countries can assess the epidemic situation and China’s efforts in a calm, objective, and rational manner and do not overreact,” she said.

Li, a 34-year-old doctor working in the city of Wuhan – the epicenter of the novel coronavirus outbreak, tried to warn others about the deadly coronavirus as early as December. He posted in his medical school alumni group on the Chinese messaging app WeChat that seven patients from a local seafood market had been diagnosed with a SARS-like illness and were quarantined in his hospital. However, soon after he posted the message, Li was accused of rumor-mongering by the Wuhan police, and was one of several medics targeted by authorities for trying to blow the whistle on the deadly virus in the early weeks of the outbreak. According to reports, Li was hospitalized on January 12 after he contracted the virus from one of his patients. He was confirmed to have the 2019-nCoV on February 1.

Mark Anthony Geguera (front) and Sanny Darren Bejarin (center) of the Philippine Consulate General in Shanghai discuss with members of the Filipino community in Wuhan the details of their repatriation. (DFA Photo / MANILA BULLETIN) The DFA team, led by Mark Anthony Geguera and Sanny Darren Bejarin of the Philippine Consulate in Shanghai, arrived in Wuhan on Thursday and immediately met with members of the Filipino community in Wuhan as well as with the Foreign Affairs Office in Hubei Province to discuss the details of the repatriation. “Today we already have our DFA team inside Wuhan City for the repatriation of our OFWs. They are on the ground and they’re taking the risk,” DFA Undersecretary for Civilian Security and Consular Concerns Brigido J. Dulay said. As of the posting of this report, the DFA said a total of 45 Filipinos are confirmed for repatriation. Upon arrival in the Philippines, the repatriates from Wuhan and Hubei Province will be brought to the Athlete’s Village in New Clark City in Tarlac and will undergo the mandatory 14-day quarantine per guidelines of the Department of Health. Health Secretary Francisco Duque III disclosed Friday morning in an an interview with radio DZMM that Filipinos planning to return to the country for quarantine will have to take pre-departure screening in China first before being allowed to fly back to the Philippines. If they show any symptoms of the 2019-novel coronavirus acute respiratory disease (2019-nCoV ARD), they would no longer be allowed to fly and have to proceed to a hospital in Wuhan, Duque said. “From the airport, they would be fetched… what’s important is that they have a separate service vehicle,” he added in Filipino. “Then, their luggages will be disinfected.” He said repatriated Filipinos already have pre-dedicated rooms, while their bags would be tagged accordingly. Also, each repatriate will have his or her own room, which could accommodate two more if he or she has a kid. While undergoing a two-week quarantine, OFW returnees would be provided with access to limited hours of Internet connection so they could make calls to their families. Aside from it, the health department will give those under their care complete packed meals. Doctors and nurses wearing protective gears will also monitor the status of the repatriates. And in case anyone from the repatriates would show symptoms while under quarantine, Duque said, “there is no problem as we have a dedicated ambulance that is ready to bring his/her to the hospital.” President Duterte had earlier expressed willingness to welcome the returning Filipinos upon their arrival, but Duque said, it would still “depend on [the decision of the] Presidential Security Group” because “it is not really necessary [for him to welcome them].” “If he could not be stopped, we are just going put him in safe distance. For example, he would be inside a bus where he could wave and see them,” Duque said. Do’s and don’ts Duque also bared that the Department of Health (DOH)  will lay down the “dos and don’ts” that have to be followed at the Athletes’ Village by the returning OFWs to ensure the health and safety of everyone in the area should they be infected with the virus. These include limiting where they could roam around and requiring them to observe cleanliness through using various hygiene kits and disinfectant solutions. “We will have a controlled environment. It will really be regulated. The reason you’re putting them under quarantine is to prevent them from infecting, others,” Duque said over DZBB interview Friday morning. “They will be given hygiene kit so they could clean their tables and comfort rooms from time to time,” he added in another radio interview Mode of transmission “The mode of transmission is through respiratory droplet. Not through air but through phlegm, among others. So whoever touches a table, cellphone, book or computer with the virus, could also get infected by touching his nose,” he said. Duque said that they are still finishing the complete list of rules, but gave assurance that the mental and psycho-social health of the returning OFWS will be given consideration. “They will be allowed to go to place where they could breathe fresh air. Of course, we’re taking care of their mental and phsyco-social health,” Duque said. The DOH is expecting some 40 to 50 OFWs from Wuhan. However, Duque said that they are still finalizing the list as some are still hesitant to return to the country According to the DFA, the first repatriation team is in close coordination with another team from the DFA Home Office that will be flying in soon to Wuhan to assist in the effort. On January 28, 2020, the DFA initiated the call to repatriate the workers through the facilitation of the Philippine embassy in Beijing and the Philippine Consulate General in Shanghai, the post which has jurisdiction over Wuhan and Hubei. Filipinos in China were given until February 5, 2020, to register for the government repatriation service. Tags: ncov"

(REUTERS/Tyrone Siu / MANILA BULLETIN) The National Health Commission said Thursday the number of confirmed infections rose to more than 28,000 nationwide in an outbreak that has spiraled into a global health emergency with cases reported in more than 20 countries. Among the cases was a newborn baby, diagnosed just 30 hours after being born. Six Filipino passengers of two domestic flights boarded by the two Chinese tourists who tested positive for 2019-novel Corona Virus (2019-nCoV) showed signs and symptoms of respiratory diseases. Labor Secretary Silvestre Bello III reported on Thursday the death of a 59-year-old Filipina domestic worker in Dubai on January 29 due to coronavirus. Bello said he was unsure yet of what coronavirus caused the death of the Filipina. Col. Rhoderick Armamento, deputy chief for Operations of the police’s Criminal Investigation and Detection Group (CIDG), said three of the passengers were on board the January 21 Cebu-Dumaguete flight of Cebu Pacific while the three others were in the Dumaguete-Manila flight of the Philippine Air Lines (PAL). “Among the 61 passengers on board the Cebu Pacific flight 5J 241 from Cebu to Dumaguete City, the CIDG has already contacted 23 passengers, of which, three were con- firmed to have manifested signs and symptoms of the respiratory infec- tion,” said Armamento. He said one of the three passengers already went to the local hospital for quarantine while the two opted to stay inside their house. Armamento said that the already advised the Department of Health about the other two passengers. “For the 132 passengers of PAL 2452 from Dumaguete City to Manila 25 passengers were already contacted, three of which are now on quarantine in different hospitals,” said Armamento. ‘Severe lack of hospital beds’  Despite authorities building a hospital from scratch and converting public buildings to accommodate thousands of extra patients, there was still a ”severe” lack of beds, said Hu Lishan, an official in Wuhan, the quarantined city where the virus first appeared — and where doctors are now overwhelmed with cases. There was also a shortage of ”equipment and materials,” he told reporters, adding that officials were looking to convert other hotels and schools in the city into treatment centers. A growing number of cities have imposed a range of restrictions far from Hubei, as authorities battle to contain the virus. Tens of millions of people, from the eastern industrial heartlands to near the northern border with Russia, have been told to stay indoors as authorities battle to curb the outbreak. Global concerns have risen after the World Health Organization declared an international health emergency last week. The WHO called for $675 million (613 million euros) in donations for a plan to fight the novel coronavirus, mainly through investment in countries considered particularly ”at risk.” The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation pledged to commit up to $100 million. Ten more people on a cruise ship off Japan’s coast have tested positive for the new coronavirus, the health minister said Thursday, raising the number of infections detected on the boat to 20. Japanese authorities have tested 273 people among the approximately 3,700 passengers and crew on the ship after a man who got off the boat last month in Hong Kong was diagnosed with the new strain. On Wednesday, “we received 31 test results, of which 10 were positive,” Health Minister Katsunobu Kato told parliament. Also in Japan, the chief executive of the Tokyo Olympics set for later this year admitted organizers were ”extremely worried” about how the virus could affect the Summer Games, but the International Olympic Committee urged calm. Italy announced that passengers from every international flight would be scanned for fevers, while Vietnam joined a growing list of countries banning arrivals from China. Hong Kong, which reported its first coronavirus death this week, said anyone arriving from the mainland would face a mandatory two-week quarantine from Saturday.

Hopefully, unti-unti ng bababa yung PUI natin (If we reach 14 days, then it will be easier for us because we will just be monitoring those who are here in the Philippines. Hopefully, the number of PUIs will dwindle),” he added. A total of 133 PUIs for 2019-nCoV ARD were recorded by the DOH since they started their monitoring early January. Of the total figure, 115 are admitted and isolated in medical facilities, while 16 have been discharged but under strict monitoring. Quarantine site In a press conference late Thursday afternoon, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III announced that two buildings at the New Clark City in Capas, Tarlac have been designated as quarantine site for the Filipinos who will be repatriated from China on Sunday. One building will be allotted for the quarantined Filipinos, while the other will be occupied by the staff who will be providing support services to them. According to Duque, facilities at what served as Athletes’ Village in the recently-concluded 30th Southeast Asian Games convinced them that it would be a better venue for the 14-day quarantine than the drug rehabilitation center in Fort Magsaysay in Nueva Ecija. Moreover, the New Clark City buildings would just be a few minutes ride from the Clark International Airport where the Filipinos are set to arrive early Sunday. Duque said each repatriated Filipino will have his or her own room. Each room has its own toilet, is air- conditioned and has television and refrigerator. Packed meals will be brought to their rooms. Meanwhile, Domingo said the drug rehabilitation center in Fort Magsaysay in Nueva Ecija is still being readied as possible quarantine site for returning Filipinos from China. “The building is there pero furnishings ata kailangan pa [but furnishings are still needed]. Syempre hindi sya ginagamit ngayon so kailangan pang ay- usin yung mga banyo siguro–lilinisin–sa- ka gawin lang habit- able yung building [Of course, it is currently not being used.

Senator Sherwin Gatchalian(MANILA BULLETIN) At the same time, Gatchalian urged Filipinos to support local tourism saying avoiding out of the country travels can also contain the spread of the virus, which experts say is increasingly becoming a pandemic. “It is during this time when we must show our ‘Bayanihan’ spirit to help our kababayans, whose livelihoods are affected by the travel ban,” Gatchalian said in a statement. “Instead of planning a trip abroad this year, let’s explore the Philippines more for a change,” the senator added. Gatchalian said promoting domestic destinations will help the micro and small entrepreneurs (MSMEs) and even the menial workers in the regions to cope with possible economic vulnerabilities. “Maraming apektado sa travel ban, nandiyan ang mga bangkero, tour guides, mga ordinaryong vendor, lahat yan apektado kapag walang turista (There are many people affected by the travel ban—the boatmen, tour guides, ordinary vendors—all of them are affected when there are no tourists),” Gatchalian explained. “Kaya imbes na magbakasyon tayo sa ibang bansa, dito na lang at matutulungan pa natin sila (That is why instead of vacationing in other countries, let’s do it here and we will be able to help them to),” he said. During Tuesday’s Senate committee on health’s hearing on the country’s response to the nCoV, Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez said it is too early to ascertain the economic effects of the virus scare, and that the virus isn’t expected to make the Philippine economy sick. “At this moment, it is reasonable to expect that while these developments might slightly restrain our economic expansion, these threats are not enough to force a dramatic reduction in our growth estimates,” Dominguez had said. The DOF chief said the government is still standing on its projection of a GDP (gross domestic product) growth rate of between 6.5 percent and 7.5 percent for 2020. Nevertheless, Dominguez acknowledged that the nCoV scare will undoubtedly have an impact on the tourism sector, but it won’t be unique to the Philippines. “The travel and tourism industry around the globe is taking a hit as a result of the various levels of travel bans imposed by national governments and of voluntary decisions of airlines to cut flights to and from China,” the secretary said.

In Paris, both Asian tourists and worried locals are stocking up. Pharmacist Pascal Legrand, who sells Medicom masks, said the situation was “extremely tense”. He was looking for other manufacturers as supply was getting tighter and prices on some products had increased five- to ten-fold. He said customers had been pre-ordering shipments, two of which, totaling 3,500 masks, had already been sold. He said 80% of his customers were Chinese visitors in France looking to send masks back home to China, where stores had run out. “Although some customers may be purchasing the masks out of paranoia, it’s better to be safe than sorry, especially when visiting crowded spaces and airports,” Legrand said. France has six confirmed cases of coronavirus infection out of a global total of over 28,000. On Thursday, China said that 563 people had died in the outbreak since it started last month. Tags: ncov"

Social media giants have promoted their strategies to combat misinformation related to the epidemic, which has claimed more than 560 lives in China and spread to 24 countries. Twitter, which reported 15 million coronavirus-related tweets in January, said it had suspended auto-suggest search results that would likely produce untrustworthy content. Facebook also said it was targeting false claims aimed at discouraging treatment or taking appropriate precautions with the respiratory virus. “This includes claims related to false cures or prevention methods — like drinking bleach cures the coronavirus — or claims that create confusion about health resources that are available,” Kang-Xing Jin, Facebook’s head of health, said in a statement. The World Health Organization (WHO) has also launched a campaign to discredit specific claims, such as that sesame oil and mouthwash can effectively kill the virus. Yet the misinformation continues to pollute social media platforms and messaging apps. Here is a selection of the false claims that AFP, which has a specialized fact-checking team, has debunked in recent days: – Boiling fresh garlic – A claim that the coronavirus can be cured overnight if sufferers drink freshly boiled garlic water was shared across Facebook, Twitter and YouTube in Pakistan. “There is no scientific evidence to substantiate the claim that garlic boiled water cures the novel coronavirus nor is there any proper medical research available on the subject,” said Dr Wasim Khawaja, an expert at the Pakistani Institute of Medical Sciences, for an AFP fact-check report. – Antibiotic eye drop – In the Philippines, videos viewed many millions of claim the virus can be cured with an eye drop made of sap from a local shrub that is commonly used to treat fever and stomach issues. One 11-minute video, claiming the tinospora crispa plant is an effective “antibiotic” for the virus, was viewed more than 1.5 million times on Facebook. There has been no medical evidence to back this claim. – Steaming face masks – A video of a purported doctor advising people to steam disposable surgical face masks to reuse them was viewed hundreds of thousands of times in multiple Chinese-language posts on Facebook, Weibo and Youku. In Hong Kong, the video was viewed almost 900,000 times within a day after a lawmaker shared it on Facebook. The WHO, the Hong Kong Red Cross and the Hong Kong Centre for Health Protection have all issued warnings against steaming ?- or reusing at all ?- single-use masks. – Herbal remedies – In the days following Sri Lanka’s first confirmed coronavirus case, an article was shared hundreds of times on Facebook claiming that asafoetida, a plant often used in traditional Indian medicine, can prevent infection. The claim was widely refuted by health experts who urged Sri Lankans to follow official Ministry of Health recommendations. “There is absolutely no basis to the claims that various herbs such as perumkaayam can serve as protective barriers against the spread of coronavirus,” said Dr Ashan Pathirana, a registrar at Sri Lanka’s state-run Health Promotion Bureau. – Gargling saline solutions – A claim that a top Chinese respiratory expert advised people to rinse their mouths with salt water to prevent infection was shared widely on multiple social media platforms, including Weibo, Twitter and Facebook. “No present findings have suggested that saline water can kill the new coronavirus,” the expert, Zhong Nanshan, said as he refuted the false claim.

Taiwan has gradually been restricting overseas and especially Chinese visitors since the virus outbreak began picking up speed, including this week suspending the entry of all Chinese citizens who live in mainland China. Taiwan’s Mainland Affairs Council said the new restrictions on Hong Kong and Macau residents were due to the infection rate continuing to climb there. “The epidemic situation is getting more and more serious in Hong Kong,” the council’s deputy head, Chiu Chui-cheng, told a news conference in Taipei. “This is a professional decision made by our (disease) control centre.” Hong Kong and Macau residents who have already obtained Taiwan visas will have to self-quarantine for 14 days upon arriving in Taiwan, the council added. Hong Kong and Macau residents who have an urgent need to come to Taiwan will have to apply for visas outside the island and prove they have not been to mainland China for a 14-day period, it said. Taiwan has only reported 13 cases, compared with more than 28,000 in China. Hong Kong has reported 22 cases, two of them critical, and Macau 10. Hong Kong saw its first death from the virus on Tuesday. Tags: ncov"

At least 11 pharmacies were inspected by personnel from the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Criminal Investigation and Detection Group (CIDG), Regional Anti-Cybercrime Unit (RACU), Department of Health and Cebu City Hall.  People queue to buy boxes of face masks. (Rio Deluvio / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN) The inspecting team also caught several sidewalk stalls selling not just the usual dry goods but also surgical masks. Ines Cajegas of the DTI-Region 7, said the surprise inspections were conducted to ensure that face masks are sold based on the suggested retail price (STP). Demand for masks soared here due to the 2019 novel coronavirus scare. “Based on the SRP, the surgical masks should be sold at P8 per piece while the N95 mask is priced at P105 per piece,” said Cajegas. Some pharmacies followed the SRP and some even sold their facemasks as low as P5. “There are four pharmacies which were issued with show-cause orders to explain why they sold their face masks beyond the SRP,” Cajegas said. Surgical face masks sold on sidewalks were found to be more expensive. “They sold each face mask at P10 but at night, the price goes up as high as P20 since people are already in a hurry to go home,” said Cajegas. CIDG personnel confiscated the surgical masks sold by sidewalk vendors. Police Major Edwin Lacostales of CIDG 7 said ambulant vendors are prohibited from selling surgical facemasks since their products are not approved by FDA. “We are not sure if those masks met the standards set by the FDA,” said Lacostales who added that those who sell surgical masks have to secure permit from the FDA. “The FDA issues a non-exempt certificate for the distributors of surgical face masks as medical device. This is to guarantee the safety, efficacy and purity of the product,” said Diana Tindoy of the FDA-Region 7 regulatory office. No arrest was made during the confiscations, but the sidewalk vendors were warned that they were prohibited from selling such medical device. The vendors alleged that they didn’t own the face masks and that the owners only left them in their stalls. Some vendors admitted that the distributors of the face masks contacted them through Facebook messenger. RACU is already tracking down individuals who are selling masks online. “We have received numerous complaints that prices of masks sold online have tripled. Some pharmacies have run out of stocks but face masks are always available online but a very high price. We will track down these people and we will take legal steps,” said Lacostales.

,"February 10, 2020, 12:40 PM",nCov,From ‘Sexiest Legs’ contest to quarantine in a windowless cruise ship cabin,By Reuters,"By Reuters When American Sawyer Smith got hold of discount cruise tickets, he invited his brother and grandparents along for what they expected to be a luxurious treat, from Japan to Hong Kong and back again, full of good food and fun port calls along the way. They boarded on Jan. 20 and all went well until a passenger, who had disembarked in Hong Kong, was diagnosed with the coronavirus, and their ship, the Diamond Princess, was locked down in quarantine just off Yokohama, the port south of Tokyo from where the tour had started.  General view of a cabin of the cruise ship Diamond Princess, where passengers are being quarantined due to coronavirus suspicions onboard, in Yokohama, Japan February 6, 2020, in this picture obtained from social media. (Sawyer Smith/via REUTERS/MANILA BULLETIN) Now Sawyer, 25, his brother and their grandparents, Clyde and Renee, both 80, are spending their second full day in a cabin that, as Renee told Reuters by phone from the ship, is tiny. “We don’t have a window, there are four of us – and only one chair,” she said. About 3,700 people on the Diamond Princess face quarantine for at least two weeks on the ship, which has 20 virus cases, with testing continuing. Everybody’s temperature was taken by health officials who swarmed the ship, with Clyde and Renee – who’d been on a bus tour with the infected man – given additional tests. Both proved negative. “If they’d had symptoms we would have been more worried,” Sawyer said. Clyde’s past work, including a stint doing epidemiological work for the US state of Georgia, may also have contributed to their equanimity. Clyde and Renee have been spending their time reading. The family has also watched movies, including “Crazy Rich Asians” and “Aquaman.” Sawyer, a fitness fanatic who went to the ship’s gym or pool every other day and came second in a shipboard “Sexiest Legs” contest, now does crunches and pullups in the room, which at six meters by nine doesn’t allow for a lot more. Masked and gloved ship staff brought a breakfast of pastries, granola with yogurt, fruit and boiled eggs around 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, along with a menu from which they could choose later meals. Wednesday they had mostly sandwiches. The death toll from the virus, which originated in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, jumped by 73 to 563 in China, with more than 28,000 confirmed infections there. Sawyer’s family said they appreciated the efforts health officials were making to contain the virus and that the ship’s crew was taking good care of them, although Renee spoke wistfully of the “Hungarian Rhapsody Trio” that had played live several times a day. Sawyer said cruise officials were negotiating to see if small groups could be taken on deck for air. “It’s not really at the point where we’re getting stir-crazy,” Sawyer said. “If they keep us in the rooms for four to five days, it might be a little different.” Tags: ncov"
,"February 10, 2020, 12:39 PM",nCov,WHO probes Singapore meet linked to spread of virus,By Reuters,"By Reuters The World Health Organization (WHO) has begun an investigation into three virus infections linked to an international business meeting in Singapore last month, heightening concerns about the spread of the disease outside China. The cases linked to the meeting provide more evidence that the coronavirus is spreading through human-to-human contact outside China, which the WHO has said is deeply concerning and could signal a much larger outbreak.  The Grand Hyatt hotel in Singapore February 5, 2020. (REUTERS/Tim Chong/MANILA BULLETIN) “WHO is coordinating with relevant ministries of health in relation to it,” spokeswoman Olivia Lawe-Davies said in response to questions from Reuters. “As countries are stepping up surveillance, the detection of more cases of local transmission can be expected.” The cases, in Malaysia and South Korea, have been linked to a 100-strong meeting in Singapore of staff from an as-yet-unnamed multinational sales firm, while one Chinese delegate was from the central city of Wuhan, where the virus originated. The sister of a Malaysian who attended has since been infected, while Singapore said virus symptoms had surfaced in four of the firm’s local staff. Authorities have not revealed the name of the company, although Korea has said it was an international sales firm. Malaysia offered the first revelation when it confirmed the case of a 41-year-old citizen who had attended the meeting at the plush Grand Hyatt hotel near the city-state’s Orchard Road shopping district. South Korea then confirmed two cases involving its citizens who had also attended. The Koreans and the Malaysian shared a buffet meal during the conference, South Korean media said. Of 109 meeting participants, 94 were from overseas and have since left Singapore, its health ministry said, adding that four local staff were referred to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases. The hotel will carry out “thorough sanitization and deep cleaning” of guest rooms that were potentially affected and will monitor staff and guests for symptoms, its general manager, Willi Martin, said. Singapore has reported 28 cases of the coronavirus, some involving domestic transmissions. Several firms in Singapore have suspended business and media events, including a big travel fair and hotel trade show, but the Singapore Airshow will go ahead next week, although on a smaller scale. On Thursday, China reported its biggest daily jump in deaths from the virus, an increase of 73 to 563, although only two deaths have been reported outside mainland China. Tags: ncov"

Department of Health Secretary Francisco Duque III (CZAR DANCEL / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN) Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said that the Bases Conversion and Development Authority (BCDA) has offered the use of the said facility in New Clark City as the quarantine area for repatriated Filipinos. “We plan to bring back our fellow Filipinos here in the country as seamlessly and efficiently as possible. Procedures were set into place from the moment our OFW kababayans board the plane up until their arrival at New Clark City,” said Duque. The health chief said that they decided to use the New Clark City facility due to “it’s much more strategically located.” The Filipinos are expected to be planed from China early Sunday at the nearby Clark International Airport. “Two, the facilities are more complete. The ambiance is very nice—it’s well lit, it’s open space. The rooms are with almost complete amenities with refrigerators, televisions–individualize toilets– which are very very good,” said Duque. “Not to belittle the Fort Magsaysay’s facilities– in fact we continue to improve the Fort Magsaysay facility–to be prepared just in case there will be more to be repatriated. It is better that we proactively provide adequate quarantine facilities down the road,” he added. Duque said that the government will provide the needed medical logistics including hygiene kits, disinfectant solutions, transportation, and other things that will be needed in the quarantine process. “Upon completion of the 14-day quarantine period, the discharge of all repatriated OFWs shall be facilitated by the Overseas Workers Welfare Authority in coordination with the Department of Foreign Affairs,” the health chief said. “Rest assured that all our kababayans will be treated with utmost care and dignity as they go through the whole process of repatriation,” he added. Department of Foreign Affairs Undersecretary Brigido Dulay said that around 45 Filipinos in Wuhan, China have already signified their intentions to be repatriated. Dulay noted that they have yet to secure a clearance from Chinese authorities to repatriate Filipinos from Hubei province. “I just like to emphasize that the repatriation is not solely a Philippine dictated procedure it entails coordination with the Chinese authorities,” said Dulay. The Foreign Affairs official said that a lot of preparations are still being undertaken because “there are a lot of permits and clearances that we need to follow.” “We already have our DFA team inside the hot zone– They have entered Wuhan City today. And they are there working on the ground preparing for the repatriation of our OFWs. They are talking now with the Chinese authorities and our Filipino community there in Wuhan to fix the repatriation,” he said. Dulay said there are two aspects that they have to fix. First, will be the exit permits of the Filipinos which the DFA team is now fixing. “Now, the agreement here is that– in the 45 that we are supposed to bring back to the Philippines– they will again –as required by the Chinese Health Commission—they are required to undergo another check before they board the plane,” said Dulay. “If they are found to be with a fever or any symptom of the nCoV (novel coronavirus) they will be taken by the Chinese authorities to their hospital/to their facility for treatment and they will not be boarded,” he added.

House of the Representatives (ALVIN KASIBAN / MANILA BULLETIN / FILE PHOTO) Anakalusugan party-list Rep. Mike Defensor, chairman of the House committee on public accounts, said a congressional inquiry may be conducted soon to determine whether or not there was anomaly in the DOH decision. It was reported that the DOH dropped its current choice of anti-pneumonia vaccine and chose a “weaker” vaccine for its nationwide vaccination program. The DOH reportedly decided to suspend the bidding for the purchase of PCV 13 vaccine and opted to invite suppliers to offer bids for PCV-10. Iloilo Rep. Janette Garin, former DOH secretary, assailed the health department’s decision, saying it has been using PCV-13, which protects children from 13 types of pneumococcal bacteria, since 2014. PCV-10, on the other hand, covers only 10 types of bacteria. Garin said purchasing PCV-10 is a “step backward” because it has less efficacy in preventing pneumonia among children aged five and below in the country, likening it to “getting a Betamax when you’re already using a VHS player.” The lawmaker said that PCV-13 is more effective in preventing pneumonia as it covers more bacteria as compared to PCV-10. Defensor said his committee “will eventually investigate the efficacy of PCV10 vis-a-vis PCV13. “There are models all over the world. I hope the DOH can justify their stand.” Defensor said the congressional inquiry will be conducted at a later date, as soon as the nCoV crisis is over. “We don’t want to take away the focus of DOH now in containing the spread of nCoV (2019 novel coronavirus acute respiratory disease).” Still, Defensor said Health Secretary Francisco Duque III would have to eventually prepare himself to face the inquiry into the issue involving the pneumonia vaccine for children. Last week, Deputy Minority Leader Iloilo Rep. Janette Garin raised questions on the decision of DOH to suspend the bidding for PCV-13 vaccine and allow a bidder offering PCV-10. Tags: ncov"

Col. Rhoderick Armamento (PNA) Col. Rhoderick Armamento, deputy director for operations of the Philippine National Police (PNP) Criminal Investigation and Detection Group (CIDG), said three of the passengers were on board the Jan. 21 Cebu-Dumaguete flight of Cebu Pacific, while the three others were on the Dumaguete-Manila flight of Philippine Air Lines (PAL). “Among the 61 passengers on board the Cebu Pacific flight 5J 241 from Cebu to Dumaguete City, the CIDG has already contacted 23 passengers, of [whom] three were confirmed to have manifested signs and symptoms of the respiratory infection,” Armamento said. He said one of the three passengers has already entered the local hospital for quarantine while the other two opted to stay at home. Armamento said he has advised the Department of Health (DOH) about the other two passengers. “For the 132 passengers of PAL 2452 from Dumaguete City to Manila, 25 passengers were already contacted, three of [whom] are now on quarantine in different hospitals,” he added. The CIDG has been tapped to conduct contact tracing of all the passengers of two domestic flights boarded by two Chinese tourists who tested positive for nCoV. One of them later died. The PNP was given 48 hours starting Wednesday to trace all the passengers. “We are doing the contact tracing through phone calls in order to protect our personnel. We also tapped the Anti-Cybercrime Group (ACG) to contact them through e-mail or social media accounts,” Armamento said. Among those who were contacted were seven foreigners on board the two domestic flights. But police said they are all in good health condition. The official said the DOH will take care of contacting all the passengers of the Hong Kong to Cebu flight boarded by the two Chinese. Hitches Armamento said they encountered some problems in contacting all the passengers, the reason why only 48 were contacted on Wednesday. He said some passengers would not answer their phones while the phone numbers of some others appeared to be non-existent. “That’s why during our meeting, we asked the airline companies to accomplish the vital information needed before the passengers are allowed entry to the country,” Armamento said. It was for those whom they were not able to contact that they sought help from the ACG. Advice All passengers who have been contacted by the CIDG were advised to avoid unnecessary contact with people and stay at home as much as possible, Armamento said. “They were also asked to monitor themselves for fever, colds, and cough, observe proper hygiene, to wear masks, and immediately contact the Department of Health if they experience any signs and symptoms of respiratory infection.” Tags: ncov"

The virus is also set to have an impact on international supply chains and manufacturing given China’s lynchpin role in the global economy. Foxconn now projects a sales increase of one to three percent this year, down from a January forecast of three to five percent, chairman Young Liu told Bloomberg News. Foxconn has tried to allay fears of production shortfalls, saying it had previous experience of viral outbreaks following the SARS epidemic in 2003. It is China’s biggest private-sector employer, with more than a million people working in some 30 factories and research facilities, including one in Wuhan. Taiwan has reported 11 confirmed cases so far, mostly people returning from Wuhan. The government announced Thursday that all foreigners who resided in or visited China, Hong Kong or Macau in the past 14 days will be temporarily barred from entering the island. Foreigners with residency permits in Taiwan returning from these areas must undergo a 14-day stay-home quarantine. Tags: ncov"

Singapore has clamped down on visitors from China in a bid to stop the spread of the coronavirus, but will allow the countries airforce to take part in a popular air show(AFP / Roslan RAHMAN / MANILA BULLETIN) Singapore last week barred passengers who had recently travelled to mainland China from landing or transitting through the city in a bid to contain the virus that has killed hundreds and infected tens of thousands. Visas for Chinese passport holders were also suspended. An aerobatics team from the People’s Liberation Army Air Force had been given permission, however, to take part in Asia’s biggest air show, which opens Tuesday. “The Ba Yi aerobatics team has taken proactive measures like health checks and temperature screenings to ensure that they are healthy before they fly into Singapore,” organiser Experia Events said in a statement late Wednesday. “They are taking all necessary precautionary measures in line with existing guidelines while they are in Singapore.” China’s Xinhua news agency said members of the team arrived in Singapore on Wednesday. The team, established in 1962, will participate in the aerial displays which are a highlight of the biennial airshow. An aerobatics team from the South Korean air force pulled out of the event earlier this week because of virus fears. Several exhibitors, including Canada’s Bombardier and 10 Chinese companies, have also withdrawn, and a conference that traditionally precedes the main event has been cancelled. So far more than 560 people have been killed and over 28,000 infected in China by the virus, which has spread to two dozen countries. Singapore has reported 28 cases. Tags: ncov"

Read more: Filipino among passengers quarantined on virus-hit cruise ship off Japan Authorities decided to quarantine the ship and test hundreds on board after a former passenger who disembarked in Hong Kong last month tested positive for the virus. Health Minister Katsunobu Kato told parliament on Thursday that results for 102 people had now come in, with 20 testing positive. In all, some 273 people on board were tested, including those who had close contact with the former passenger and others displaying potential symptoms. Ten people diagnosed with the new virus have already been removed from the ship, which on Thursday docked in Yokohama to resupply for a quarantine that could last until February 19. Ambulances arrived at the port, where officials could be seen dressed in white protective suits, complete with face masks and helmets, to remove the additional 10 infected people. ‘Almost unbearable’ Passengers took to social media to document their confinement, with one posting audio of an announcement on the ship promising better internet and room service. “The crew are working extremely hard for you,” the announcement in English said. “Masks will be delivered to your staterooms as we are negotiating with the Japanese quarantine officials to allow small groups of guests to spend some time on the open decks to get some fresh air.” British passenger David Abel uploaded a series of videos on his Facebook page, jokingly asking the captain to send him some whiskey and requesting a banana a day from room service. “It’s a horrible situation for most passengers onboard, being stuck here, confined to the cabin,” he said, sympathizing especially with those with inside rooms. “It must be almost unbearable for them.” City health officials in Hong Kong said passengers would only be allowed off the World Dream after tests were completed, with crew checked first and passengers to be screened on Thursday. Panic buyers in the city descended on supermarkets to snap up toilet rolls as the government warned that online rumors of shortages were hampering the city’s fight against the virus. On Wednesday, city authorities announced anyone arriving from the Chinese mainland from Saturday would face a mandatory two-week quarantine. Two dozen countries now have confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus that emerged from a Wuhan market selling exotic animals at the end of last year. China is struggling with a shortage of hospital beds, equipment and materials to treat those infected, despite building two hospitals from scratch and converting public buildings to house patients. ‘Don’t go out!’  Tens of millions across the mainland have been told to stay indoors as authorities battle to curb the outbreak. In parts of Hangzhou, 175 kilometers (110 miles) from Shanghai, only one person per household is allowed outside every two days. “Please don’t go out. Don’t go out. Don’t go out!” blared a message on a loudspeaker urging people to wear masks, wash their hands regularly and report any people from Hubei. Several governments have imposed travel restrictions over the virus, while major airlines have suspended flights to and from China. Italy announced that passengers on every international flight would be scanned for fever, while Taiwan Thursday banned all international cruise ships from docking. China has reacted angrily to the travel bans, noting that the WHO does not advise imposing them. Health experts note that the mortality rate of the new virus, at around two percent, is well below that of SARS, which killed 800 people in 2002-2003, around 10 percent of those infected. Two fatalities have been reported outside the mainland, in Hong Kong and the Philippines.

Foxconn employees wearing masks attend the company’s year-end gala in Taipei, Taiwan January 22, 2020. (REUTERS/Yimou Lee/File Photo/MANILA BULLETIN) Taiwan is not a WHO member because of China’s objections. Beijing says the island is a wayward Chinese province and not a country and is adequately represented in the organization by China. Democratically governed Taiwan says it is an independent country called the Republic of China – its formal name – and has never been part of the People’s Republic of China. On Tuesday the WHO corrected the number of cases reported on the island after having said there were 13. At the time Taiwan had only 10. Taiwan’s current figure is 11, compared to more than 28,000 in China. Speaking at a news conference, Taiwan Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Joanne Ou said the crux of the problem was China giving the wrong case number details to the WHO. “This was wrong information that was provided by China which created the mistake,” she said. “I’d like to ask the WHO, how many times are you going to change Taiwan’s name? These are not our correct names. Let me reiterate – our name is Taiwan, whose formal name is the Republic of China,” she added. “We beseech the WHO not to put Taiwan’s information under China, creating mistake after mistake after mistake.” Taiwan says the main consequence of that so far has been Italy including Taiwan in its ban on flights from China. Ou said they continue to press Italy to reverse that decision. Neither China’s Foreign Ministry nor the WHO immediately responded to a request for comment. Ou this week said China was “vile” for seeking to limit Taiwan’s access to WHO meetings about the virus. Both the WHO and China have repeatedly said Taiwan is getting the access and cooperation it needs. China’s Taiwan Affairs Office said in a statement on Thursday the island should not “use the virus to plot independence”, and reiterated Taiwan faced no problem with technical cooperation with the WHO.

Fears over the coronavirus have prompted several countries to ban entry to foreigners who have recently been in China, upending the travel plans of thousands of Chinese (AFP Photo/NOEL CELIS / MANILA BULLETIN) From the US to Australia and Israel, several countries have banned entry to foreigners who have recently been in China, while major airlines have suspended flights to and from the country. AFP spoke to four Chinese people in limbo: Extended vacation After travelling to Japan from the Chinese city of Chongqing for a skiing holiday in the mountains of Hokkaido, Wang Bili was supposed to return to Washington, where he works for an international organisation, on February 10. “The American decision was a total shock,” he said. “I had to change my tickets for a later date to comply with the incubation period.” Now he will not be able to return to Washington until mid-February, but he said he doubted whether the US decision would be effective. “They can’t know when a Chinese person left China,” he said, noting that China does not stamp the passports of its citizens when they leave. But the main thing bugging the 32-year old is the cost of extending his stay in Japan. “This will cost me another $1,000,” he said. “I’m annoyed but what can I do?” Sydney student  Like other Chinese students who were back at home when Australia announced its restrictions, Chloe has not been able to return to her university Down Under. “Some Chinese students didn’t even find out about it until they got off the plane in Australia. Then they had to pay out of their own pockets for a flight back to China,” she said. She is worried about paying her rent in Sydney and being evicted if she cannot. “Will we be able to graduate? It’s really a hassle. All of this is upsetting the plans we had for the next two or three years.” Her plans to take a holiday in New Zealand before term started again were also ruined when the country announced similar restrictions. “I’ve lost a lot of money in cancelled hotel bookings.” Research halted When Sherry Huang first heard about the US travel ban, she felt shocked. “How could such a strict measure come out so suddenly?” said the 36-year-old, who is staying at her parents’ home in Xiamen, in the southeastern province of Fujian. Huang, who does biomedical research in the United States, had last visited China in 2016. This year was a rare chance to gather with family over the Lunar New Year holiday. But the Chinese researcher is now stuck on the mainland after Washington banned all foreign nationals who have travelled to China in the last two weeks. That means her lab experiments -– which she cannot conduct remotely –- have been suspended until she returns. “This is a key time period,” Huang emphasised. “I have made some very interesting findings and we can make some new discoveries soon.” If research is suspended now, she said, the impact will be “pretty large”. “China is so big -– implementing a travel ban on an entire country is not reasonable,” said Huang. “Such a large-scale travel ban will impact many people’s lives.” No information  A second-year student at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology, Xiao Shen said he has not heard anything from his university or Australian authorities since the ban. “Everything I know has come from the news,” he fumed. “Australia hasn’t told us anything, nothing on whether term has been postponed or if we’ll be able to take our classes over the internet… it’s really irresponsible. I’m angry.” As Chinese students are forced to defer studies, top Australian universities stand to lose around $2 billion in fees alone, according to preliminary estimates from analysts at Standard & Poor’s. Xiao thinks Australia should only have banned entry to tourists, or those coming from Hubei province at the epicentre of the virus. “I understand it’s for safety reasons but it’s too much. They haven’t thought about how it will impact foreign students at all.” Tags: ncov"

Medical workers prepare traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) at a TCM hospital as the country is hit by an outbreak of the new coronavirus, in Binzhou, Shandong province, China February 5, 2020. Picture taken February 5, 2020. (cnsphoto via REUTERS/MANILA BULLETIN) Chinese health authorities have said there is not yet any effective cure for the virus, which has killed more than 500 people in China. Although there is no evidence from clinical trials, China’s National Health Commision said the HIV drug lopinavir/ritonavir can be used for coronavirus patients, without specifying how they might help. That triggered a rush, specifically for Kaletra, also known as Aluvia, which is drugmaker AbbVie’s off-patent version of lopinavir/ritonavir and the only version approved for sale in China. It is usually used to treat and prevent HIV and AIDS, and AbbVie said last month that China was testing it as a treatment for coronavirus symptoms. Devy, a 38-year-old freelancer in Shandong province who did not want to give his family name for fear of retaliation, said he was among hundreds who contacted people with HIV to ask for medicine. Although he had not recently traveled to Hubei province or Wuhan, the epicenter of outbreak, he grew worried that he had somehow caught the coronavirus after a doctor’s visit found symptoms of pneumonia. He also had other symptoms associated with coronavirus, such as fever and nausea. Desperate and worried, he heard from a friend that a HIV-positive man nicknamed “Brother Squirrel” was offering Kaletra for free to people suspected to have the new coronavirus. He received about 30 pills. “When you were left alone, seeing the blur shadow of death far away, I think no one can feel calm,” Devy told Reuters by telephone. DRUG HOARDER Brother Squirrel, whose real name is Andy Li, told Reuters he was a 30 years old and coined his nickname because he hoards drugs for his condition the way “squirrels like to hoard nuts”. After hearing the Chinese health authorities’ comments on Kaletra, he and a few other HIV patients pooled about 5,400 Kaletra tablets in less than a week. They then posted their offer on China’s Twitter-like platform Weibo. “We felt like we were organized for a military mission,” Li said, recalling that hundreds of messages soon flooded in, leaving him barely any time to sleep or eat in the first three days until all of the pills were mailed. “There are so many people in need of the drug, and I don’t want to waste time,” Li told Reuters. “Time is life.” Chinese health authorities cautioned that lopinavir/ritonavir, a prescription drug, has potential side effects such as diarrhea, nausea, vomiting and liver damage. The rush has also opened up moneymaking opportunities. More than 28,000 people have been confirmed to be infected in China, most in Wuhan and Hubei. But a shortage of test kits has led to suspicions that many more are undiagnosed. Gatsby Fang, a Chinese cross-border buying agent, told Reuters that he ordered generic versions of Kaletra from India on Jan. 23, shortly after he firstly heard that the drug might be useful against the new coronavirus. Fang, whose primary job is in the financial industry, said he sold each bottle for 600 yuan ($86) each, bringing in 200 yuan to 300 yuan in profit on each. His stock was sold out by Jan. 25. Some clients ordered 600 tablets at once, he said. His buyers included infected patients, front-line doctors in Hubei, and those who did not need the drug but thought it might offer protection. Other drug sellers also approached him, pretending to be patients, Fang said. Gray market prices for the drugs in India, where he sourced them, started to rise on Jan. 25, Fang told Reuters. “For the 60-pill-per-bottle product, its price went up to about 300 yuan, 400 yuan from about 100 yuan in the beginning,” he said. “Basically the patients reaching out to me were those who have no place for treatment, no place where they can confirm 100% if they have or not have the virus,” Fang said. “That’s the core of the problem.” The World Health Organization has warned that there are “no known effective” treatments for the coronavirus, knocking down unconfirmed reports of a research breakthrough in China. There is no evidence that such treatments help in fighting the coronavirus, Gauden Galea, the WHO’s representative in China, told Reuters on Saturday. Tags: ncov"

File picture of officials singing the national anthem at the closing session last year of the National People’s Congress (NPC) at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, China March 15, 2019. (REUTERS/Thomas Peter/File Photo/MANILA BULLETIN) The National People’s Congress (NPC), made up of about 3,000 delegates, typically gathers for a session lasting at least 10 days in Beijing, beginning on March 5, to pass legislation and unveil key economic targets for the year. A postponement would be the first since China adopted the current March schedule in 1995 for the meeting of parliament. “The focus remains on taking steps forward towards meeting on schedule, but we are discussing a range of options as the (virus) situation doesn’t look likely to be contained by March,” a senior government official told Reuters, declining to be identified given the sensitivity of the matter. “A delay is one of those options,” the official said. “It should come as no surprise given that we are in a very difficult time.” China’s State Council Information Office and the NPC media center did not immediately respond to faxed requests for comment. Foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying, asked during a daily briefing on Thursday whether the NPC session could be postponed due to the virus oubtreak, said she has not heard anything on the matter. The virus, believed to have originated in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, has killed more than 560 people and infected more than 28,000, the vast majority of them in China. The outbreak is also inflicting a growing toll on businesses and consumers in the world’s second-largest economy. Strict transport curbs have been imposed in many parts of the country and some cities are in virtual lockdown. To minimize job losses, China’s stability-obsessed leaders are likely to sign-off on more spending, tax relief and subsidies for virus-hit sectors, alongside further monetary easing to spur bank lending and lower borrowing costs for businesses, policy insiders have told Reuters. Many officials who would ordinarily be involved in preparation for the NPC are staying at home under 14-day mandatory quarantines after returning to Beijing from their home provinces following the Lunar New Year holidays. Central government officials in Beijing were told to resume work on Feb. 3. China has already postponed a high-level business event, the China Development Forum, which is usually held in late March, and the venue for the Canton Fair, a trade fair in the southern city of Guangzhou, has been suspended until further notice. The spring session of the trade fair was due to begin on April 15. The NPC gathering is crucial this year, as it is set to ratify China’s first-ever civil code, a key milestone in President Xi Jinping’s legal reform effort. The NPC is also widely expected to discuss the months-long protests in Hong Kong, and to announce the annual economic growth target along with China’s defense budget. Under China’s constitution, a full plenary session of the NPC must be held every year. Chucheng Feng, a partner at Plenum, an independent research firm in Hong Kong, put the chance of a delay at just 10% because of the meeting’s political importance. “However, as the epidemic extends into February, the gathering of China’s entire political elite in a confined Great Hall of the People for over a week looks quite dangerous,” he said. China’s legislative meeting happens around the same time as the meeting of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), the country’s top political consultative body, which has another over 2,100 members. Together, the gatherings are known as the “Two Sessions”. The provinces of Yunnan and Sichuan have already postponed their provincial annual legislative meetings due to the outbreak. Tags: ncov"

Andanar echoed President Duterte’s assurance of government’s readiness to contain the spread of the virus, as well as his caution against Sinophobia, in the meeting attended by the member-agencies of the Regional Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict (RTF-ELCAC) Region X. He said the public should not be afraid of the coronavirus as “everything is well in our country.” “The fatality rate remains low, and our health officials are closely monitoring those suspected to carry the virus,” he added.

(MANILA BULLETIN) “It’s not true. We have too many fake news coming out,” said Engr. Eusebio Monserate Jr., acting chief of CAAP at Kalibo Airport, which caters direct international flights for tourists visiting world-famous Boracay Island in Malay town. This was after alleged information from www.flightradar24.com began circulating in social media sites that flights were still arriving at Kalibo Airport from mainland China and its territories. Monserate told Manila Bulletin Thursday that flights to and from mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau have ceased starting Sunday, February 2, when President Duterte extended the travel ban. Monserate said that the last flight from China that landed in Kalibo was from Shanghai, which arrived early Sunday morning, which was before the implementation of President Duterte’s extended travel ban. Monserate cautioned the public to stop sharing unverified flight information. Some netizens even kept on insisting that a flight from Wuhan City, the epicenter of the nCoV ARD, landed at Kalibo Airport early morning of Thursday, February 6. Monserate also denied this. A flight aviation enthusiast, who did not want to be named explained, that netizens were wrongly interpreting the information being provided by www.flightradar24.com when they were merely looking at flight schedules for Kalibo Airport and not on the flight status, which indicated that flights to and from China have been cancelled.

Mayor Joy Belmonte (Mayor Joy Belmonte Official Facebook Page / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN) She issued the statement amid claims that nCoV has reached the locality with false reports that the city’s hospitals are now filled with nCoV infected patients. For the nth time, Belmonte clarified there are no confirmed nCoV cases in the city, but said the city is ready in case of any eventuality. She also urged the public not to spread rumors or fake news about nCoV so as not to cause undue distress, chaos, and panic. In the admitting section of the East Avenue Medical Center (EAMC), Cesar Santos opted to transfer his 85-year-old mother to a hospital in Plaridel, Bulacan, instead of having her operated on for a fractured leg at EAMC. Santos said that despite assurances that EAMC has no nCoV cases at present, he decided not to take the risk, noting that “his family wants to have peace of mind.” “Maybe the nCoV scare in Quezon City might be untrue, but we want to make sure that my elderly mother gets full medical attention without fear of contracting the nCoV disease. Transferring her to another hospital with no reported nCoV disease would give us peace of mind rather than having to worry if indeed the news is fake or not,” Santos said. Santos stood firm on his decision despite assurances that Quezon City has remained nCoV free contrary to false reports, as attested by Belmonte. With this, Belmonte asked barangay officials and the public to report persons sharing fake news about nCoV as this causes unnecessary and baseless panic. Belmonte also ordered barangay officials to report immediately if any individual in their areas shows signs of nCov symptoms by calling the 122 hotline so that the proper disposition of the case can be made. She also said the city government has closely coordinated with the Department of Health (DOH) and standard protocols are strictly adhered to by the city. Aside from having close coordination with state-run hospitals in the city, Belmonte said city health officials have regularly met with private hospital owners to discuss salient matters and be prepared in case nCoV reaches the city. Belmonte also noted the city’s 80 frontline responders and logistics personnel of the QC Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Office are on alert after undergoing preparedness training in the proper use of personal protective equipment, proper handling of patients, and proper disposal and disinfection of equipment.

Former Department of Agriculture (DA) Secretary and Bohol Governor Arthur Yap (MANILA BULLETIN FILE PHOTO) This was disclosed by Governor Arthur Yap who said he has received private texts messages from resort and hotel operators warning him that at the rate of cancellations of reservations at resorts and hotels, some establishments will have to lay off several employees, thereby, affecting hundreds of working families in Bohol. It is for this reason and the possible worsening situation in the coming weeks that Yap has asked the Provincial Government of Bohol to be more pro-active in finding ways to plug the worsening leak of tourist non-arrivals, and replacing them with local travelers. According to Yap that the Philippines has more than seven million tourists annually, and Bohol may have close to two million visitors annually. “These are our fellow ‘kababayans’ traveling with their families, office mates, barkadas, or attending incentives and seminar workshops all over the country. We must compete with other provinces in attracting more local and foreign visitors to come to Bohol right away,” Yap said. Yap has advised Vice Governor Rene Relampagos to activate the Bohol Tourism Office to coordinate with the Bohol Association of Hotels Resorts and Restaurants (BAHRR) for an urgent meeting and come up with attractive tour packages to attract domestic travelers to come and visit Bohol in the next coming weeks. “We cannot just sit and do nothing. In April, I have asked that a familiarization tour of Japanese tour operators come to Bohol to acquaint themselves with the product, while we continue working on opening direct charter flights between Panglao International Airport and Narita International Airport,” Yap commented. But until such time comes, Bohol must come up with a package and go on a road show, sell tour packages directly on the internet and bring sales efforts directly to the domestic Filipino travelers. According to Yap, coming up with better rates must include airline rates, restaurant/food packages and entrance to local rides and sites, including unified and reasonable transport rates. Things will still be worse before they become better, he added. What was important, Yap added, was that the provincial government was already doing something to address the tourist cancellations.

Domingo warned private hospitals, particularly Level 2 and Level 3 hospitals, that refusal to take in patients can put their license at risk and can also be “ground for revocation” of their PhilHealth accreditation. “You are required to have the capability to treat infectious diseases, you’re required to have an isolation room so that you may treat these patients well and completely away from other patients,” he said. “Meaning if a patient comes to you there’s no reason for you to exclude this patient or to not accept it.

Photos of empty supermarket shelves prompted the government to condemn those spreading rumours that the city was running out of toilet paper (AFP/MANILA BULLETIN) Videos obtained by AFP showed long queues of frantic shoppers packing trolleys with multiple packets of toilet rolls, with some arguments breaking out. Rice and pasta have also become a popular target for panic buying. The footage — and photos of shelves emptied of toilet rolls — sparked a call from the government for the public to halt panic buying. “In response to various rumors recently that there are shortages of goods such as rice and toilet papers, leading to panic buying and even chaos, a government spokesman today expresses regret over the malicious act of spreading rumors when the city is fighting against the disease and condemns those rumor mongers with evil intentions,” the statement said. While Hong Kong has closed most of its land borders to mainland China, where the coronavirus outbreak began, freight services have not been affected, the government said. “There are sufficient stocks of staple food including rice and pastas. There is no need for the public to worry,” the statement said. Harold Yip, founder of Mil Mill, a Hong Kong-based waste paper recycling company, told AFP they received over 100 inquiries from members of the public about toilet paper on Wednesday alone. RTHK news reported that toilet paper and rice at one supermarket in the district of Wanchai — which had been fully restocked overnight — were cleared within 30 minutes of the store opening on Thursday morning. The supermarket chain Wellcome said rumors of shortages were unfounded. The coronavirus has killed more than 550 people in China since spreading from the central city of Wuhan late last year. Hong Kong now has 21 confirmed infections, including one patient who died. The majority of those infected came from mainland China. But in recent days there has been a spike in carriers with no history of travel to the mainland sparking fears local transmissions were growing. The city’s pro-Beijing leader Carrie Lam has faced growing calls to close the border with China, a step she has been reluctant to take saying it would be economically damaging and discriminatory. Her administration has gradually cut the number of land border crossings to just two. On Wednesday, she announced anyone arriving from the Chinese mainland from Saturday would face a mandatory two-week quarantine. While Hong Kong maintains close economic and cultural links to the Chinese mainland, as seething distrust of the authorities in Beijing permeates the city. The 2003 outbreak of the SARS virus, which Beijing initially covered up, killed 299 people in Hong Kong and left lasting psychological scars on the densely populated city. Lam already boasts record-low approval ratings after using riot police to quell seven months of huge and often violent pro-democracy protests.

The CAB issued the clarification because many OFWs are begging airport authorities to leave for China, Hong Kong and Macau to resume their jobs. Samudio appealed to them not to compromise their health in exchange for the salaries they will receive. He also assured the OFWs that their paid airline tickets can be refunded, or rebooked, and the payment may revert to the travel fund. Tags: ncov"

Security personnel check the temperature of shoppers at Hema, an Alibaba supermarket in Hangzhou, the latest city to face restrictions in a bid to halt the spread of the novel coronavirus (AFP Photo/NOEL CELIS / MANILA BULLETIN) But as large parts of China come to a standstill in a bid to end the spread of the deadly novel coronavirus, green fences and “no entry” signs blocked streets near the headquarters of one of the world’s most valuable companies. Alibaba’s headquarters are inside one of three Hangzhou districts where some three million people were told this week that only one person per household would be allowed outside every two days, to buy necessities. The city is on an extended Lunar New Year holiday as part of efforts to keep people indoors and a temperature check had been set up outside the Alibaba office, near a “2020 Happy New Year” sign in English and the company’s logo. Nobody was seen coming in or out, and a security guard told AFP that the company’s parks across the country were closed. Several roads in closed-off Yuhang district were sealed and manned by security personnel. Blue signs explained: “Due to the requirements of epidemic prevention and control, the road ahead is closed, please go around. Thank you for cooperating!” In nearby streets, a message blared from a loudspeaker urging people to avoid gatherings. “Please don’t go out, don’t go out, don’t go out!” said the voice advising people to wear masks, wash their hands regularly and report any people who are from Hubei. Alibaba said they were focused on “getting things done” when asked by AFP about the office closure. The coronavirus outbreak has cost 490 lives in China and so far infected over 24,000 people, mostly in Hubei, whose 56 million people have been under virtual lockdown since late last month. Hangzhou, which has a population of nine million, has 141 confirmed cases. At least three other cities in Zhejiang province — Taizhou, Wenzhou, and parts of Ningbo — have imposed similar restrictive measures on people leaving their homes. Getting food  The normally packed shores around West Lake — Hangzhou’s central tourist attraction — were deserted. Few taxis were available in the city’s quiet streets. Inside sealed off areas, residents in masks came out of buildings to collect food and groceries from deliverymen, watched by local volunteers in red armbands. Boxes of supplies piled up on the pavement. One resident came out to collect her goods wearing a blue plastic apron over pink pajamas, mask and ski goggles. A 35-year-old man surnamed Chen said he had already stocked up before the new year holiday, but that there was now competition for food. “I have to get up at 6:00 every morning to grab goods, or else I won’t be able to get any,” he said. ‘Victory is not far away’ Two South African women told AFP that when they left their building to get groceries, guards took their details in order to enforce the limits on outbound trips. But AFP saw several other people walk out of the building without having to give any details or checks. Deliverymen also moved easily in and out of the fenced-off residential areas to drop off groceries. “There are no patients in (the compound), it’s just a preventive effect,” said 27-year-old local Wang Runyu. The voice in the loudspeaker urged residents to be patient: “We know it’s hard to stay inside the house. Please tolerate it for a few more days. … Victory is not far away.” Tags: ncov"

Medical staff hug each other in an isolation ward at a hospital in Zouping in China’s eastern Shandong province (AFP / STR/MANILA BULLETIN) The number of confirmed infections rose to more than 28,000 nationwide in an outbreak that has spiralled into a global health emergency with cases reported in more than 20 countries. Among the cases was a newborn baby, diagnosed just 30 hours after being born. Despite authorities building a hospital from scratch and converting public buildings to accommodate thousands of extra patients, there was still a “severe” lack of beds, said Hu Lishan, an official in Wuhan, the quarantined city where the virus first appeared — and where doctors are now overwhelmed with cases. There was also a shortage of “equipment and materials”, he told reporters, adding that officials were looking to convert other hotels and schools in the city into treatment centres. A growing number of cities have imposed a range of restrictions far from Hubei, as authorities battle to contain the virus. Tens of millions of people, from the eastern industrial heartlands to near the northern border with Russia, have been told to stay indoors as authorities battle to curb the outbreak. Global concerns have risen after the World Health Organization declared an international health emergency last week. The WHO called for $675 million (613 million euros) in donations for a plan to fight the novel coronavirus, mainly through investment in countries considered particularly “at risk”. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation pledged to commit up to $100 million. New cases emerged abroad, with 10 people testing positive for the virus on a cruise ship quarantined off the coast of Japan with thousands on board. Also in Japan, the chief executive of the Tokyo Olympics set for later this year admitted organisers were “extremely worried” about how the virus could affect the Summer Games, but the International Olympic Committee urged calm. Italy announced that passengers from every international flight would be scanned for fevers, while Vietnam joined a growing list of countries banning arrivals from China. Hong Kong, which reported its first coronavirus death this week, said anyone arriving from the mainland would face a mandatory two-week quarantine from Saturday.  ‘Don’t go out!’  In the city of Hangzhou, some 175 kilometres (110 miles) southwest of Shanghai, fences blocked streets near the headquarters of Chinese tech giant Alibaba — one of the world’s most valuable companies — as a fighter jet circled overhead. The building appeared to be shut down, while deliverymen moved in and out of nearby fenced-in residential areas to drop off groceries. The firm is based in one of three Hangzhou districts subject to new restrictions that allow only one person per household to go outside every two days to buy necessities. “Please don’t go out. Don’t go out. Don’t go out!” blared a message on a loudspeaker urging people to wear masks, wash their hands regularly and report any people who are from Hubei — reflecting a common fear that people from the province might infect others. At least three other cities in Zhejiang province — Taizhou, Wenzhou and parts of Ningbo — have imposed the same measures, affecting 18 million people. In the central city of Zhumadian, authorities said one person would be allowed to leave each household only every five days. Residents of the city of seven million were also offered cash rewards for informing on people who came from neighbouring Hubei province. Authorities in Beijing said restaurants could no longer accept reservations for parties from Wednesday. Jitters  The disease is believed to have emerged in December in a Wuhan market that sold wild animals and spread rapidly as people travelled for the Lunar New Year holiday in January. The Ministry of Public Security said “political security” was the “top priority” in confronting the epidemic. The statement came days after the top leadership admitted “shortcomings” in its handling of the outbreak — local authorities in Hubei have been criticised for initially downplaying the situation. The death toll has steadily increased, hitting 563 on Thursday. But officials have noted that the death rate, at around two percent, is well below the mortality rate of SARS, which killed some 800 people in 2002-2003. Two fatalities have been reported outside the mainland, in Hong Kong and the Philippines. Several governments have imposed travel restrictions while major airlines have suspended flights to and from China. Thousands of Chinese tourists risked being stranded in Bali after the Indonesian government suspended flights to and from mainland China. China has reacted angrily against travel bans, noting that the WHO does not advise imposing them. It has accused the US of spreading “panic” in its response to the coronavirus, including its ban on Chinese travellers, and on Wednesday, it took another swipe at Washington. “Panic is more deadly and contagious than any virus,” foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said at a press briefing.   Tags: ncov"

(REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon/MANILA BULLETIN) About 3,700 people are facing at least two weeks quarantined on the cruise ship after 10 people initially were confirmed positive with the virus and moved out to medical facilities. If the new infections are confirmed, that would bring the total number of coronavirus patients in Japan to 45. The ship was caught up in the global coronavirus epidemic after an 80-year-old Hong Kong man tested positive for the virus after disembarking the ship late last month. Passengers on Carnival’s Diamond Princess, which arrived in Yokohama on Monday after a 14-day round trip, face another two weeks on the ship off Yokohama port near Tokyo. They and their relatives took to social media to detail their predicament and situations on the cruise ship. A passenger using the handle @daxa_tw tweeted early Thursday morning that crew members handed out medication refill request forms for those in need of medicines. Another 73 people on the Chinese mainland died on Wednesday from the coronavirus outbreak, the highest daily increase so far, bringing the total death toll to 563, the country’s health authority said on Thursday. The National Health Commission said another 3,694 coronavirus cases were reported throughout the country on Feb. 5, bringing the total to 28,018. Tags: ncov"

Motorists drive over the Trent River bridge into Trenton as Canadian Forces Base (CFB) Trenton prepare for the arrival and quarantine of Canadians evacuated from China due to the outbreak of coronavirus, in Trenton, Ontario, Canada February 4, 2020. Picture taken February 4, 2020. (REUTERS/Alex Filipe/MANILA BULLETIN) Canada plans to fly the evacuees to the base in Trenton, Ontario, the country’s main military hub for air transport, and hold them in quarantine for two weeks. The outbreak has killed 492 people and sickened nearly 25,000 worldwide. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Wednesday the plane was expected to arrive on Friday. “We understand that because of SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome), they are much more prepared for things like that,” said Cindy McMaster, 55, who manages the local Bargain Bin discount store. “But it’s not fair to say people aren’t worried or scared, because they are. And it is a concern in our area.” SARS, a contagious respiratory illness, killed 44 people in Canada in 2002-2003, the only country outside Asia to report deaths from that virus. Government health officials say Canada is better prepared this time. The evacuees arriving from China will be separated from each other and from others on the base, although family units will be kept together, the government has said. They will all stay at Yukon Lodge, a new facility on the base which resembles a small chain hotel. Individuals will only be moved to a hospital if they require acute care, said the local health authority, but local hospitals were prepared, with 21 negative-pressure rooms at four of them. “I was in the military, I know how it works,” said resident Joyce Aucoin, 81. “There’s going to be people upset about it but once they’re here and once they’re settled and they see what’s going on, I think it will all pass.” Lynn Cao, 60, who owns a tobacco shop in the town, had been concerned about the plane arriving until she received reassuring emails from friends on the base. Cao said she was more anxious about her mother and sister, who live near the Chinese capital Beijing, and had sent them a large number of face masks to limit their chances of infection. Masks were already sold out at most of the town’s pharmacies, and at some, even before the airlift was announced. “It just seems like everything is so overblown,” said Frank Meiboom, president of the local rotary club. “Let’s bring these people home, bring them back to Canada and give them the best care we can and say ‘welcome home.’” Tags: ncov"

The World Health Organization(AFP / MANILA BULLETIN) In its 15th Situation Report on nCoV-Acute Respiratory Disease (ARD), WHO stated that the plan was crafted based on what the agency and its partners have learned about the virus, and how the knowledge of the virus could be considered on the plans of action of affected countries to contain the virus. “WHO and partners have developed a global strategic preparedness and response plan, which outlines the public health measures that the international community can provide support to all countries to prepare for and respond to the 2019‑nCoV outbreak,” the report read. “The overall goal of the strategic preparedness and response plan is to stop further transmission of 2019‑nCoV within China and to other countries, and to mitigate the impact of the outbreak in all countries,” it added. Among the objectives of the plan are: to limit human-to-human transmission, including reducing secondary infections among close contacts and healthcare workers, preventing transmission amplification events, and preventing further international spread from China; identify, isolate, and care for patients early, including providing optimized care for infected patients; identify and reduce transmission from the animal source; address crucial unknowns regarding clinical severity, extent of transmission and infection, treatment options, and accelerate the development of diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines; communicate critical risk and event information to all communities, and counter misinformation; and minimize social and economic impact through multi-sectoral partnerships. The WHO will also send 500,000 masks, 350,000 pairs of gloves, 40,000 respirators, as well as 18,000 isolation gowns to 24 countries to help stop the further spread of  nCoV.

The funding will help in beefing up detection, isolation, and treatment of patients, protect at-risk populations, and develop vaccines, treatments, and diagnostics. This funding is inclusive of the $10 million that the foundation pledged to the outbreak in January. “Multilateral organizations, national governments, the private sector and philanthropies must work together to slow the pace of the outbreak, help countries protect their most vulnerable citizens, and accelerate the development of the tools to bring this epidemic under control,” Gates Foundation CEO Mark Suzman said in a statement. “Our hope is that these resources will help catalyze a rapid and effective international response. This response should be guided by science, not fear, and it should build on the steps that the World Health Organization has taken to date,” he added. With aims of interrupting transmission of the virus and containing the disease, the foundation said $20 million of the fund will be used to accelerate the detection, isolation, and treatment of patients. The fund will help multilateral organizations and national public health authorities to acquire resources to find out where they can most successfully arrest the spread of the disease. It will also aid public health authorities in covering the initial cost of labor and supplies while appropriate resources are being appropriated to fund ongoing operations. This portion of the donation will be allocated to organizations such as the World Health Organization and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and public health authorities of countries with confirmed 2019-nCoV cases. Another $20 million of the donation will be used to help strengthen the emergency operations centers of Africa and South Asia. The foundation said that recent epidemics, like the H1N1 influenza epidemic in 2009, had a disproportionate impact on the said regions since majority of its populations live in extreme poverty and have limited access to quality health care. The remaining $60 million of the fund will be used to develop safe, effective, and accessible vaccines and therapeutics. Latest data from WHO showed that the deadly virus that originated from Wuhan, China has already infected 24,000 people worldwide and killed almost 500 people in China.

Philippine Military Academy (PMA / MANILA BULLETIN) In a statement released Wednesday night, PMA Alumni Association, Inc. Chair Cavalier Rufo de Veyra said the decision to postpone the activity “is in deference to health and public safety concerns regarding nCoV.” “Alumni classes, especially Jubilarians caught in this late-breaking development, are advised to exercise their best judgements on how to proceed with their individual Class events in sync with the new date,” De Veyra said. According to the PMAAAI head, the decision to merge in one day the two-day event was reached following a meeting with Baguio City Mayor and fellow Cavalier Benjamin Magalong and PMA Superintendent, Vice Admiral Allan Cusi. De Veyra said Magalong has already coordinated with the Hotels and Restaurants Association of Baguio to fix the schedules of Cavalier-members who have prior reservations. Members who have prior reservations were advised to call their respective hotel and request for a rebooking. Over the weekend, De Veyra had said that there were “no compelling reasons” to change the date of the homecoming even as Magalong earlier cancelled the opening parade of the Panagbenga Festival on February 1. He argued that the homecoming is a “low-density” and “low-intensity” activity compared to Panagbenga.

In a memorandum issued by Mayor Imelda “Emi” Calixto-Rubiano, she assured the POGOs that there are available clinics to monitor their personnel coming from nCoV-hit countries. Should any employee is suspected to have the virus, she said POGOs must refer him to a DOH-designated coronavirus center or hospital. Calixto-Rubiano also urged the POGOs to use forehead thermometers to detect fever and to place hand sanitizers in strategic locations to avoid spreading the virus. Rubiano emphasized the importance of cleanliness in their workplaces to ensure that bacteria will not thrive. “Encourage your personnel to wear face masks , especially those who are in contact with a lot of clients throughout the day and impose a 10-day quarantine on workers coming from countries hit by the nCoV,” the mayor said. She also encouraged POGOs to keep their employees well-informed on the safety measures about the virus.

Labor Secretary Silvestre Bello III(Keith Bacongco / MANILA BULLETIN FILE PHOTO) “I agree with the position of DFA Sec. Locsin that, if possible, to lift the ban for OFWs because there is uncertainty on their part here,” he said in an interview Wednesday. “But as Health Secretary (Francisco) Duque said, we can’t gamble on the health of our workers. So he recommended that we should allow a period of two weeks and observe the situation, probably allow them to leave if the situation improves,” added Bello. The government earlier imposed a temporary travel ban to and from China, Hong Kong, and Macau due to the threat of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) which led to a number of OFWs being stranded. The president of the Society of Hong Kong Accredited Recruiters of the Philippines (SHARP) asked Philippine Overseas Employment Administration (POEA) Administrator Bernard Olalia to allow Hong Kong-bound workers with approved contracts, visas, and whose OECs (overseas employment certificate) were issued before the directive to return to their host countries of employment. Alfredo Palmiery, SHARP president, said the OFWs need to return to their work immediately because their families are heavily banking on their earnings or remittances for their financial needs, and their non-departure may lead to the cancellation of their visas and contracts by their employers. “If there will be no direct flights from Manila, we propose that they be allowed to depart via a 3rd country like Taiwan which has no flight suspensions yet to Hong Kong,” Palmiery said. He warned that 10,000 household service workers who are on vacation and have travel documents from the POEA such as Balik-Mangagawa OECs will lose their current jobs with their Hong Kong employers if they fail to return on time as they were only given two weeks of vacation by their employers. He added that 15,000 Household Service Workers (HSWs) with new employment contracts in Hong Kong were also given only two to three weeks to fly to Hong Kong to start working for their new employers.

Ghebreyesus said the plan focuses on rapidly establishing international coordination and operational support, scaling up country readiness and response operations, and accelerating priority research and innovation. It aims to limit person-to-person transmission of the 2019-nCoV, identify, isolate, and care for patients early, and to communicate critical risks and events. The three-month strategic preparedness and response plan will be needing a fund of US$60 million, the WHO chief said. The rest of the US$675-million fund will be allocated to vulnerable countries requiring aid against the new virus from China. There are 24,554 recorded cases of 2019-nCoV. The virus has also claimed the lives of almost 500 people in China. Japan health officials confirmed that a Filipino crew member was among the 10 people onboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship docked off the port of Yokohama, Japan who tested positive for the 2019-nCoV.

In a statement on Wednesday, the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) said the cruise ship was quarantined when one of the passengers tested positive for nCoV. “Since then and after this time, 10 persons onboard the cruise ship, including one Filipino, have tested positive for the virus and will be transferred to a healthcare facility. The other passengers have been asked to remain on board the ship for the required 14-day quarantine period,” the DFA said in the statement. None of the 10 infected people – three each from Japan and Hong Kong, two Australians, one American and the Filipino crew member – had severe symptoms, Japanese public broadcaster NHK reported.
A total of 538 Filipinos are said to be on board the ship. The DFA also said the Embassy in Tokyo is in constant communication with the remaining Filipinos onboard and is closely coordinating with Japanese authorities to provide them all possible assistance. Similarly, the Embassy has already established communications with Magsaysay Lines, the manning agency of the crewmember. Apart from the crewmembers, there were also seven Filipinos reportedly listed as passengers of the cruise ship. The Department of Health (DOH) reported that the Philippines has three confirmed cases of the 2019-nCoV involving Chinese nationals from Wuhan, China: a 38-year-old Chinese woman who is reportedly recovering; a 44-year old Chinese man who died due to the virus; and a 60-year old Chinese female. DOH also noted that there are 133 persons under investigation (PUI) in the country for possible coronavirus infection.

WHO Representative to the Philippines Dr. Rabindra Abeyasinghe (WHO) WHO Representative to the Philippines Dr. Rabindra Abeyasinghe told ANC Tuesday that false stories circulating on social media about nCoV are “not contributing to containing” the outbreak. “What we’re advocating is to go to reliable information sources. Go to your department of health website or in social media platforms. Go to sources that are credible,” he said. Abeyasinghe said what the public needs is “verified information” about the virus. “Stay calm. Your actions need to be dictated by evidence-based information.” Abeyasinghe also debunked reports that persons with no signs and symptoms can infect others with the virus. “That’s not true,” the health expert said. “Most of the people who get infected, do get infected from people who have symptomatic disease, not from people who are not showing signs and symptoms.” ‘Hand washing a better preventive measure’ The WHO representative reiterated that masks have no “absolute guarantee” of preventing a person from acquiring the 2019 nCoV ARD. “This only prevents you from inhaling the droplets and that’s important if you’re in close contact with people who have a disease,” Abeyasinghe said, adding that masks are important for health workers. As for the general public, Abeyasinghe said it’s more important to observe hand hygiene. “Wash your hands often, [don’t] touch your eyes and nose and mouth excessively,” he said. Tags: ncov"

Senate Majority Leader Juan Miguel Zubiri(Juan Miguel Zubiri Official Facebook page / MANILA BULLETIN) Zubiri, however, refused to described Duque’s leadership as a “failure,” as some of his colleagues put it, but admitted he found the top health official inefficient in heading the DOH in its response to the entry and spread of the new coronavirus strain in the country. “Definitely, may kakulangan (there is a lack)…I won’t say ‘failure,’ but I’d say may kakulangan. Failure is a very tough word. Medyo nahuli ang mga galaw nila (Their actions were late),” the Senate leader said in a chance interview. Zubiri pointed at the slow contact tracing of the fellow passengers of the two Chinese nationals from Wuhan, China, who tested positive for nCoV, one of whom died last Saturday. Senators, during the Senate health committee hearing Tuesday, grilled Duque for blaming airline companies for the delay in the contact tracing. According to the DOH chief, only 17 percent of the more than 300 passengers were contacted by authorities. Airline companies refuted this, saying they have provided the DOH the list of the concerned passengers. Zubiri also hit Duque’s reservations about the implementation of a temporary travel ban from all travelers coming from China to prevent the virus from entering the country. Duque only recommended this after the first case was confirmed last Thursday involving a 38-year-old Chinese woman from Wuhan. “Initially, Sec. Duque was afraid to hurt the feelings of China…I think, being Secretary of Health, his first item on his agenda is to protect his people, all the Filipinos, and the people living here in the Philippines, from nCoV,” he told reporters. “The job of [not] hurting the feelings of other countries is not his job. Maybe it’s the job of the DFA (Department of Foreign Affairs) to apologize on our behalf, but the job of the Secretary of Health is to take care of the Filipinos,” he added. “Sa tingin ko diyan siya sumablay.” (That’s where he messed up.) He said the DOH should be alarmed with the rapid increase of the 2019-nCoV cases and work “double time” especially after confirming on Wednesday the third case of the infection here. He supported the DOH’s move to tap police intelligence to trace the passengers who were with the infected Chinese nationals. The DOH should also prioritize the procurement of protective equipment, such as hazard material suits, for health workers dealing with 2019-nCoV patients. Zubiri said he hopes Duque would learn from Tuesday’s Senate hearing and improve his management of the health department. “At least now he’s trying to make up for it, hopefully and praying na ‘yong (that those) PUIs (persons under investigation)…I’m praying na marami sa kanila (most of them would test) negative,” he said.

Albay 2nd District Representative Joey Salceda (MANILA BULLETIN FILE PHOTO) Albay Rep. Joey Sarte-Salceda, vice chairman of the House committee on appropriations, filed House Bill No. 6177 that adopted the Department of Health (DOH) proposal for an additional allocation for the urgent health-related program. The bill was referred to the committee on appropriations after being read on the floor. “At least 95 percent of the supplemental budget will be for personal protective equipment (PPE) for health care workers,” Salceda said, referring to the P2.025 billion share of the proposed additional allocation. However, he admitted the proposed measure does not include funding for medicines and pharmaceuticals that might be developed in the future to treat the killer disease. Salceda, chairman of the House committee on ways and means, said the money for such a contingency may initially be shouldered by the contingency fund of the president. In the bill, Salceda underscored the urgency of purchasing surgical masks for persons under investigation and health care workers, with allocations of P945,000 and P9.45 million respectively. He said the DOH also want a P4.522 million budget for the repatriation of 40 Filipinos from Wuhan, the center of the nCoV epidemic in China. An additional P20 million was not part of the DOH proposal but was personally added by the House official to address the financial requirements of epidemiologists who are among the medical health workers tasked to be at the forefront of the anti-nCoV campaign. Meanwhile, Salceda expressed confidence that the Philippine economy can “weather nCoV” but not the continued uncertainty of the problem.
“What pervades the business community and the public at large is a sense of uncertainty and, to some extent, helplessness,” the solon, popularly known as the economic wizard of Congress, said. In an aide memoire sent to Speaker Alan Peter Cayetano and Majority Leader Martin Romualdez, Salceda said the Lower House must be prepared to support the national government in preventing the spread of nCoV, “commit to its timetable for critical reforms in the medium term, and study more institutional and structural changes to improve national resiliency in the long term.” To address the adverse economic impact of the nCoV threat, the senior adminsitration lawmaker called for the revitalization of the agricultural sector and the immediate implementation of the government Build, Build, Build program. According to him, the government might want to follow the South Korean government’s program of investing in cultural exportation. He noted that the SK government invested in the K-pop (Korean popular music) fad and emerged successful as it cashed in huge dividends for the country. Tags: ncov"

DILG Secretary Eduardo Año (Philippine Information Agency / MANILA BULLETIN) Año stressed the postponement of the PMA homecoming to a later date is the right move as the nCoV has not been contained citing the need to exercise on the side of caution or prudence. “It’s the call of the mayor and PMA superintendent. I support their positions. The three-week suspension is enough as it complies/satisfies with the incubation period,” Año said. Año noted it is up to the PMA and PMA Alumni Association officials to set a new date for the homecoming if the event is eventually postponed. On Tuesday night, Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana wants the postponement of the event after former PNP general and now Baguio City Mayor Benjamin Magalong decided to defer government-sponsored events as a preventive measure against the nCoV. Currently, the PMA has temporarily barred visitors in order to ensure the safety of cadets and trainees.

According to Executive Order No. 168, s. 2014 (Creating the Inter-Agency Task Force for the management of emerging infectious diseases in the Philippines), the DOH recommends the enlistment of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) to supplement the Philippine National Police in enforcing the quarantine of specific areas or facilitating the transport of Emerging Infectious Diseases (EID) patients when the need arises. “It (information drive) focused on raising the troop’s awareness on the threat level of the virus in the country, how to recognized symptoms, and the best practices to avoid contracting the disease,” Zagala said. Captain Ramius Dizon, of the OACS-Medical Corps, said the information drive was also aimed at easing public fears on the deadly respiratory disease. “Aside from informing our troops about the novel coronavirus, we also wanted to lessen the panic of the public. We want to avoid a public reaction which is disproportionate to the level of threat that we are currently facing,” Dizon said. Zagala said that due to the nature of their work, uniformed personnel have always been encouraged to maintain their good health so they can best perform in their missions. He stated that the Philippine Army was also taking necessary measures to ensure its readiness to respond to the situation if it becomes worse. “We want to ensure that our personnel know how to protect themselves from the virus and prevent its spread because they have a very important role in security that requires them to be ready to serve 24/7,” Zagala said. In the Philippines, at least three persons have already acquired the virus, one of them have died, marking the first nCoV-related death outside China where it originated and infected hundreds to thousands.

This was confirmed on Wednesday by Dr. Grace Tan, spokesperson of Bacolod Inter-agency Task Force against nCoV. Tan said the foreigner was scheduled to be discharged from the hospital Wednesday. She added that they were still waiting for the results of the samples taken from a 12-year-old boy who was also quarantined for the same suspicion. READ MORE: Canadian, Filipino boy quarantined for suspected nCov in Negros Occidental As this developed, Tan said that three more persons, including a foreigner, were considered persons under investigation (PUIs) in the province after exhibiting flu-like symptoms, following their travel to Taiwan and Hong Kong. Tan said that these persons were a 58-year-old Filipina, another Filipino in his 30s, and a 67-year-old male foreigner. Tan said the foreigner had a layover in Taiwan before he went home to the province last January 21 while the two Filipinos came from Hong Kong. As of Wednesday, Tan said that four PUIs are now being monitored in the hospital, pending the results of their samples from RITM. Meanwhile, five students in Talisay City were also placed under quarantine, and considered persons under monitoring (PUMs) after they reportedly traveled to China in the past 14 days. Despite the increasing number of PUIs in the province, authorities stressed that the province was still free from nCoV. Governor Eugenio Jose Lacson, in a press briefing, said that the test result of the Canadian was a big relief to Negrenses. He appealed for the cooperation of the community especially those who have traveled to China, Macau, and Hongkong, where there are positive cases of nCoV. “If you have traveled to these places, go on self-quarantine. If you exhibit flu-like symptoms, go to the nearest hospital,” the governor said. “Let us not hide anything to address this health problem. There is hope, the best thing to do is to prevent it and that’s what we are trying to do,” he added. READ MORE: DOH confirms Chinese woman 3rd case of nCoV in PH Tags: ncov"

With the death toll from the virus outbreak in China nearing 500 and cases of the disease spreading across the globe, organizers of the show are reassuring visitors that officials arriving from China will not be in attendance.  Visitors use their mobile phones to film vehicles at the India Auto Expo 2020 in Greater Noida, India, February 5, 2020. (REUTERS/Anushree Fadnavis/MANILA BULLETIN) “There will be no visitors or delegations from China at the Motor Show 2020,” Rajan Wadhera, president of the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM), the show organizer, said in a statement on Tuesday. Chinese companies have confirmed their booths would be staffed by Indian representatives or employees, he said. China’s SAIC Motor Corp, Great Wall Motor Co and FAW Haima are set to showcase cars including electric vehicles, while more than 300 Chinese autoparts companies are also due to participate at the show. With India this week identifying a third positive case of the virus in the country, SIAM has also printed advisories for visitors and set up an on-site first aid facility in partnership with a local hospital. Several journalists and delegates were seen wearing masks as a media preview of the show opened on Wednesday. The Automotive Component Manufacturers Association of India (ACMA), which is organizing a parallel exhibition for autoparts companies, late on Tuesday said that visitors from China would not be attending and that displays of 30 Chinese exhibitors would be staffed by Indian representatives as a precaution. Chinese auto companies have been working to woo Indian buyers with internet-connected cars, filling a breach left by Western and Japanese manufacturers not participating in this year’s show, including Fiat Chrysler, Honda Motor Co and Nissan Motor Co. They also hope the Indian market can help to combat slowing sales in China, which fell 8% in 2019 and are set to decline again in 2020. Suzuki Motor Corp and Hyundai Motor Co have long dominated the Indian market with low-priced compact cars and have in recent years expanded into other categories. Chinese automakers do not plan to compete in the entry-level segment, instead appealing to drivers with in-car technology, safety features and clean-energy vehicles. Great Wall, which is making its India debut at the show, had intended to bring more than 100 delegates but all have canceled, including the president, a local executive said. “The first and most important thing is the safety of people. Once this situation is taken care of, our senior executives will come to India,” said sales and marketing director Hardeep Brar. Great Wall outlined plans to invest $1 billion to set up a manufacturing base in India. Apart from Chinese carmakers, domestic companies such as Maruti and Tata are also also focusing on electric vehicles. Maruti, which showed its concept FUTURO-e sport utility vehicle (SUV), said it plans to sell a million green energy vehicles over the next few years.

,"February 10, 2020, 12:46 PM",nCov,Abante: Elderly most vulnerable to nCoV,By Ellson Quismorio,"By Ellson Quismorio House Minority Leader Benny Abante raised his concerns Wednesday over the worldwide vulnerability of elderly individuals against the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which still has no known cure.  House Minority Leader Benny Abante (Facebook) “The elderly account for the majority of those who have lost their lives to the virus, and this only serves to emphasize that the elderly require special care given their vulnerabilities,” Abante said in the House minority bloc’s weekly press conference. The 2019-nCoV, which causes an acute respiratory disease, originated in Wuhan, Hubei province, China. Of the 400-plus confirmed deaths there, over half were beyond the age of 60. According to the Department of Health (DOH), three individuals in the Philippines have now been confirmed to have contracted the virus. The latest case is a 60-year-old Chinese woman from Wuhan, the epicenter of the health scare. Upgrade of National Center for Geriatric Health “This is why I would like to again call on my colleagues to support one of my bills, House Bill (HB) No. 3939, which will convert the National Center for Geriatric Health (NCGH) into the National Geriatric Health and Research Institute (NCGHRI) and finally establish a fully-operational hospital that will cater to health services specifically for the elderly,” said the solon from Manila. “Such a facility is needed now, more than ever, to ensure that elderly Filipinos exposed to viruses such as the 2019-nCov can receive the specialized treatment needed to help them survive such outbreaks,” said Abante, a former pastor. The NCGH is currently just an outpatient department under the Jose Reyes Memorial Center. It is not operational because of the absence of a law that allows for its operations. Also known as The National Center for Geriatric Health and Research Institute Act, the measure establishes the NCGHRI, a 100-bed hospital that will be attached to the DOH. Under the measure, no less than 40 percent of the NCGHRI’s hospital beds shall be allocated for indigent patients. The NCGHRI shall, among others: (1) equip, maintain, administer, and operate an integrated medical institution that specializes in geriatric health services;
(2) provide and maintain affordable, quality, and timely hospital care through an efficient health service delivery system that prioritizes the need of the elderly; and
(3) coordinate the various efforts and activities of other government agencies and local government units for the purpose of achieving effective approaches to the delivery of geriatric health services. Funding for the NCGHRI shall be sourced from the DOH under the General Appropriations Act. Aside from these funds, the NCGHRI will also have its own trust fund composed of contributions from taxes, donations, and income from its pay wards. Donations to NCGHRI shall be exempt from donor’s tax and will be considered an allowable deduction from the gross income of the donor consistent with the provisions of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997.

Rep. Bienvenido ‘Benny’ Abante Jr. (Facebook / MANILA BULLETIN) House Minority Leader and Manila Rep.

He took a swipe at Duque for not formally asking the Congress to provide them with an augmentation fund. “We are wary over the DOH’s request to approve P1 billion supplementary fund. First of all, Secretary Duque directed the request in a media conference, instead of formally requesting the fund from Congress who has the power of the purse,” Abante said. He also asked the Inter-Agency Task Force headed by Duque to get their act together, saying the coronavirus as a public health threat should be taken seriously. “We see the need to come together to address this outbreak. I personally believe this is not the time to point fingers, but we ask the DOH and the concerned agencies at the forefront of the efforts to contain this disease to get their acts together and focus on the problem at hand,” the House opposition leader said. He said the death of a 44-year old Chinese man from the virus over the weekend underscored the need “for us to take this virus seriously.” “We stress that it is imperative that the DOH prevent this virus from being spread, especially among young school children. I believe that the Department of Education is suspending and discouraging big gatherings among students and that even private schools are cancelling activities like their proms. “We in the minority support such actions, as an overabundance of caution is preferable to ignoring the potential dangers of transmitting the virus,” Abante said.

Senator Imee Marcos (Senator Imee Marcos Official Facebook Page / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN) Marcos said public emergencies call for quick data-sharing and coordination of government agencies with local government units, which a system of identification and tracking like the national ID system could address. She made this observation after Department of Health (DOH) Secretary Francisco Duque III said in a Senate committee hearing last Tuesday that they have only been able to assess 17 percent of 331 passengers who were on the same flights as an infected couple from Wuhan who entered the country two weeks ago. “Ang national ID system ay isang digital information backbone na ginagamit ngayon para habulin ang paglaganap ng nCoV sa Wuhan at sa buong China.

Funeral parlor staff members in protective suits help a colleague with disinfection after they transferred a body at a hospital, following the outbreak of a new coronavirus in Wuhan, Hubei province, China January 30, 2020. (China Daily via REUTERS/File Photo/MANILA BULLETIN) In Wuhan, the epicenter of the disease, one person has died for every 23 infections reported. That number drops to one on 50 nationally, and outside mainland China, one death has been recorded per 114 confirmed cases. Experts say the discrepancy is mainly due to under-reporting of milder virus cases in Wuhan and other parts of Hubei province that are grappling with shortages in testing equipment and beds. “In an outbreak your really have to interpret fatality rates with a very skeptical eye, because often it’s only the very severe cases that are coming to people’s attention,” said Amesh Adalja, an expert in pandemic preparedness at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security in Baltimore. “It’s very hard to say those numbers represent anything like the true burden of infection” said Adalja, who estimates current fatality rates are likely below 1%. As of Tuesday, 24,551 cases have been confirmed globally. A 1% fatality rate would put total cases at over 49,000, based on the current death toll of 492. Gauden Galea, the World Health Organisation (WHO) representative for China, told Reuters on Sunday that a “crude calculation” done by dividing total cases by deaths put the rate at 2% and said the rate was generally falling. “Trying to really demystify those fatality numbers by including mildly symptomatic cases will help people to better understand the risk,” said Adalja. In Wuhan, some patients with milder symptoms have been turned away from hospitals in recent weeks because of the strain on resources, several people in the city told Reuters. Others have opted to self-isolate. Wuhan resident Meiping Wang said she and her sister both believe they have mild cases of the virus after their mother tested positive, but have not been tested. “There is no use going to the hospital because there is no treatment,” Wang, 31, said in a telephone interview. Under-reporting mild cases – which increases fatality rates – could have a negative social and economic impact as global health authorities race to contain the disease. “It’s good to remember that when H1N1 influenza came out in 2009, estimates of case fatality were 10 percent,” said David Fisman, an epidemiologist at the University of Toronto, who was working in public health at the time. “That turned out to be incredibly wrong.” “As the denominator is growing in terms of case numbers, and case fatality goes down and down… you start to realize it’s everywhere,” he said. The global response to the coronavirus epidemic has been swift and fierce. Several countries have implemented partial or full travel bans on Chinese travelers. “There are many actions going on all over the world that really are premised on the idea that this is a very severe illness,” said Johns Hopkins’ Adalja. WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Monday that the bans were an unnecessary interruption to travel and trade. Tags: ncov"

Senator Panfilo M. Lacson(CAMILLE ANTE / MANILA BULLETIN) “When the leader falls short of his mission, he does not look for scapegoats. He takes immediate steps and rectifies. Still failing, he simply assumes responsibility. That is leadership,” Lacson said. Lacson was referring to the failure of DOH officials and personnel to properly perform ‘contact tracing’ to find the remaining 83 percent of the 331 airline passengers who took the same plane boarded by a Chinese tourist who died in the Philippines from nCoV ARD infection. Duque pointed to the failure of his personnel in looking for the passengers of a Cebu Pacific flight from Hong Kong who sat in front, behind, or beside the nCoV fatality. He also blamed airlines for not giving details of the passengers’ addresses, presumably for security reasons, but this was belied by Cebu Pacific and Philippine Airlines (PAL) that carried the tourists, including the lone nCoV fatality in a Dumaguete-Manila flight Lacson forwarded to Senate reporters PAL’s reaction to Duque’s excuse: “We confirm that we released to the Department of Health (DOH), through the Bureau of Quarantine (BOQ), the full unredacted manifest of our 25 January 2020 flight PR2542 from Dumaguete to Manila, which includes the contact details of the passengers on the flight. “We are also assisting the BOQ in the call-out of the passengers.  We will always do our part to cooperate fully with the responsible authorities when it concerns the health and safety of the general public. “We released manifest to BOQ last Jan 31 2020 on the request of BOQ. Our VP Safety emailed Dr Oba, head of BOQ (DOH) T2 NAIA.” Lacson, a former Philippine National Police (PNP) chief, said this was the reason he blew his top during the Senate committee hearing last Tuesday “when the cabinet members present – Secretaries Duque, Teodoro Locsin (Foreign Affairs), and Arthur Tugade (Transportation) – took turns in defending an indefensible inaction and incompetence of the DOH leadership.” “Worse, they did it at the expense of hapless subalterns who cannot defend themselves given the circumstances,” he said. “It is failure of leadership, plain and simple. It is up to the appointing power to act. It is not for me or the Senate to suggest or advise what to do with Secretary Duque.” To opposition Sen. Francis N. Pangilinan, the hearing conducted by the Senate health committee chaired by Senator Christopher “Bong” Go “should be a wake-up call for the inter-agency committee and its whole-of-government approach.” “The health secretary was clearly in the dark as to his department’s efforts to trace the passengers of the two flights which flew in the two nCoV patients,” Pangilinan said. “This most basic intervention was at 17 percent success rate two weeks into the outbreak. Worse, the secretary was unaware and only found out during the hearing that it was a dismal 17 percent.” Tags: ncov"
,"February 10, 2020, 12:47 PM",nCov,Sen. Binay seeks probe of VUA program in view of Chinese-operated sex dens and nCoV,By Hannah Torregoza ,"By Hannah Torregoza  Senator Nancy Binay has filed a resolution seeking a separate Senate inquiry into the government’s visa upon arrival (VUA) program for Chinese nationals.  Senator Nancy Binay(Senate of the Philippines official Facebook page / MANILA BULLETIN) Binay said there is a necessity to probe the VUA program amid concerns on the possible health risks and its propensity to encourage the proliferation of sex trafficking and prostitution in the country. According to Binay, she believes the sudden proliferation of Chinese prostitution activities in the Philippines is tied to the explosive growth of Philippine offshore gaming operators (POGOs), online gaming companies based in the Philippines that cater to players in China where gambling is illegal. The senator also said a Senate inquiry into this issue is necessary in the light of the country’s preparation and preventive measures against the novel coronavirus (nCoV). “It is imperative to inquire and assess the current visa application process for Chinese nationals, taking into consideration the outbreak of the nCoV and the rise of Chinese-operated sex dens in the country and which calls for a more vigilant and tougher government regulation,” Binay said in the explanatory note of Senate Resolution No. 309. Earlier, the Senate committee on women and children, chaired by Sen. Risa Hontiveros, revealed how some Chinese POGO workers have resorted to ordering prostitutes online. The “menu” of trafficked Chinese women and some Filipinas are posted in online message applications such as WeChat, a Chinese social media platform. “The women are being ordered like ‘GrabFood’—there’s a menu, a price, then they will just arrive at the hotel or condominium of the client,” Hontiveros said. Binay, however, noted the VUA policy was a department circular issued by then-justice secretary Vitaliano Aguirre II supposedly to allow Chinese nationals to stay in the Philippines for 30 days, with a possible extension up to a maximum period of six months. It was also supposed to help boost tourism and foreign investments in the country, and to expedite the entry and admission of Chinese nationals in the country. “Therefore, it is hereby resolved, directing the proper Senate committees, to conduct an inquiry and assessment, on the Visa Upon Arrival program for Chinese nationals, with the end view of ensuring that the (VUA) scheme would not pose health risks and facilitate proliferation of sex trafficking and prostitution in the country,” Binay said in the resolution.

Education Secretary Leonor Briones(DepEd / MANILA BULLETIN) Education Secretary Leonor Briones issued the DepEd Memorandum No. 015 series of 2020 or the First Set of Policy Directives of DepEd Task Force nCoV which outlines the initiatives of the department in addressing concerns of school and policy changes that may arise due to the 2019-nCoV ARD threat. “In the interest of public health, all public and private basic education schools and learning centers are duty-bound to exercise due diligence and take precautionary measures to minimize exposure risks associated with the 2019-nCoV ARD,” Briones said in the memo. DepEd also urged all concerned schools and other stakeholders to “support government efforts to contain the spread of the virus.” Briones said that private schools are “highly encouraged” to adopt precautionary measures issued by the department through the newly-issued memorandum. For DepEd activities scheduled this February, Briones said that upon the advice of the Department of Health (DOH), “all national and regional activities involving learners and/or teachers requiring travel and congregation of various schools, divisions, and/or regions are suspended.” She also added that “all division and district activities that involve the gathering/congregation of various schools are highly discouraged.” Likewise, the organizers were also advised to “seek the recommendation of local health authorities should the activities push through.” In particular, the suspended the national activities which involve learners and teachers are the National Science and Technology Fair (NSTF), the National Festival of Talents (NFOT), and the National Schools Press Conference (NSPC). The 2019-2020 NSTF was scheduled on February 11 to 13 at the Novotel in Cubao, Quezon City. For this year, a total of 500 delegates are expected to participate in the event which aims to “promote Science and Technology consciousness and a culture of innovation among youth.” The NSTF also aims to “identify the most creative and innovative student researches from the Junior and Senior High School who shall represent the country in the international Science research fairs.” The 2019-2020 NFOT which is scheduled from February 17 to 21 in Ilagan City, Isabela was also suspended. This year, a total of 3,200 participants are expected to participate in the NFOT which aims to provide opportunities for learners to showcase their talents in various fields. Also postponed is the conduct of the 2020 NSPC set on February 17 to 21 in Tuguegarao City, Cagayan. This year, the NSPC is expecting 6,000 participants to take part in individual and group contests, school paper contests as well as concurrent sessions with workshops. Meanwhile, DepEd clarified that the Palarong Pambansa – which is scheduled in May to be hosted by Marikina City – is not included in the list of activities that are postponed. Earlier, the agency formed the DepEd Task Force nCoV to address concerns of schools and learners on the 2019-nCoV ARD. The said task force is created to “cooperate with the DOH [Department of Health] for the implementation of its response to the virus, including decision for school suspensions, and to promulgate standard protocols in DepEd offices and schools.” DepEd also issued a memorandum alerting all regional directors, schools division superintendents, principals or school heads, both teaching and non-teaching personnel, learners and all others concerned to “take precautionary measures against the possible spread of the virus.” Tags: ncov"

Rep. Robert Ace Barbers(YouTube / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN) “There’s a special law on that already, it was passed during the time of former president [Ferdinand] Marcos,” Surigao del Norte Rep. Robert Ace Barbers said, referring to Presidential Decree (PD) No. 90. Enacted in 1973, PD No. 90 identifies rumor-mongering and the spreading of false information as punishable offenses. Barbers, chairman of the House committee on dangerous drugs, equates the dissemination of fake or unverified news on the deadly virus with rumor-mongering. “I’d like to appeal to our fellow Filipinos to hold off on spreading unverified information on nCoV since it does not help our current situation. Worse, they will get in trouble with the law,” Barbers said. Department of Justice (DOJ) Secretary Menardo Guevarra recently tasked the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) to look into the spread of fake news regarding the 2019-nCoV and file charges against individuals of necessary. Barbers expressed support for the move. “Let the police and law enforcers do, huwag na Kongreso (not Congress).

Xavier Jesus Romualdo, said it is possible for PD 90 to be applicable, but had some reservations. “Pwede rin (It could work). I’m just not sure if the spread of fake news through the Internet and social media would be covered by the PD,” said Romualdo, who is a lawyer.

A sign on a shop window in Karak, outside Kuala Lumpur (AFP Photo/Mohd RASFAN/MANILA BULLETIN) The virus has so far killed almost 500 people and infected 24,000 others in China, and spread to more than 20 countries including Malaysia, which has 12 cases. It has also unleashed a flood of misinformation online, from misleading death tolls to vaccine conspiracies, and several Asian countries have arrested people for spreading false information. Wan Noor Hayati Wan Alias, a Malaysian newspaper journalist, denied three charges in a Kuala Lumpur court of breaking laws that ban statements which cause public fear and alarm, according to court documents. The documents did not say what she posted on Facebook, but local media reported the posts were related to the virus. One raised the alarm about the arrival of 1,000 Chinese tourists in the northern state of Penang on a cruise ship despite officials having given assurances they had all undergone medical examinations, reports said. The 40-year-old faces up to two years in prison for each count if found guilty. Attorney-General Tommy Thomas lashed out at online “rumor-mongering” related to the virus and warned more people would be charged in coming days. “Lies about the origins, scale and magnitude of the disease must not be permitted because they endanger public safety,” he said in a statement. He said such lies could be “inflammatory” in a multi-ethnic country like Malaysia. The Southeast Asian nation has a mostly Muslim population, but is also home to a substantial Chinese minority and issues related to race are sensitive. Tags: ncov"

Airports without scanners would be staffed by hundreds of Red Cross volunteers armed with tablets or digital thermometers to check each arriving traveler. At Rome’s Fiumicino airport, the controls were extended to domestic flights as well. Italy has only two confirmed cases of the virus; a Chinese couple, aged 65 and 66, from Wuhan — the virus epicenter — who were hospitalized last week in Rome’s Institute for infectious diseases. The Spallanzani institute said Tuesday that their condition had deteriorated and they had been placed on life support.

PNP spokesman P/Col. Bernard Banac(PNP / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN) Brig. Gen. Bernard Banac, spokesperson of the Philippine National Police (PNP), said the false and unverified information being spread, especially online, is only causing panic and fear among the public amid reports of deaths and the spread of the viral infection. “Please avoid spreading unofficial, unverified, and unvalidated information on nCoV or face arrest,” Banac said. Banac gave the warning amid reports of an alleged deluge of fake news and information on social media over the past days. He explained the posting of fake information on nCoV is irresponsible and insensitive because the viral infection is a serious health concern. Various fake stories about nCoV infections have been reportedly circulating on social media. Among them are fake stories about nCoV-infected people in a particular community or establishment. Early this week, for instance, a supposed police report of two people infected with nCoV in Batangas circulated online. The Batangas Provincial Police Office denied the authenticity of the police report. “We will not hesitate to file charges against anyone found spreading false information,” Banac said. The two cases, he said, are violation of Presidential Decree No. 90, Declaring Unlawful Rumor-Mongering and Spreading False Information; and Unlawful Use of Means of Publication and Unlawful Utterances under Article 154 of the Revised Penal Code in relation to Section 6 of Republic Act No. 10175, or the Anti-Cybercrime Law. Banac also warned that the penalties for the two charges, including fine and imprisonment, are one degree higher due to the Anti-Cybercrime Law. “We also urge the public to remain alert and vigilant, and report to authorities anyone spreading fake news,” Banac said. The PNP’s Anti-Cybercrime Group is tracking down the identity of netizens in connection with six social media posts containing false information on nCoV. Earlier, police filed a criminal case against a video blogger in Legazpi City who pretended to be an nCoV-infected person and pulled off a stunt in front of a mall there. Three Chinese in the Philippines have been confirmed to be infected with nCoV. One of them has died, the first case of nCoV-related death outside China.

Some 83 British citizens returned from Wuhan on a UK government-chartered flight from Wuhan to Brize Norton on Friday. They were then sent into 14 days’ isolation at a medical facility in northwest England. So far, there have been two confirmed cases in Britain, two relatives who had recently been to China. Health Secretary Matt Hancock told BBC television that the pair remained in quarantine. “There are two cases only here in the UK but we do expect more, so we are taking no chances,” he added. Hancock said people returning from China would not be quarantined and should instead “self-isolate” at home and call medics if they show symptoms rather than go to a hospital, for fear of spreading the virus. Eight British nationals and six of their family members left China on a flight to New Zealand on Tuesday. More than 24,000 people have been infected in China.

The staff in establishments even go home and the Chinese (tourists) opt to transfer to another establishment to stay. That is the situation there,” she said. The Chinese tourists staying in different hotels and establishments pose a challenge for the MDRRMO and health officials to monitor. Some hotels and establishments also lack doctors and nurses to attend or monitor for any flu-like signs on the tourists. Fulgencio suggested the establishment of a “one-stop-shop” for the safety officers and the medical team to establish a situational report of the health status of the tourists.

General Santos City Councilor Franklin Gacal, Jr. (File photo courtesy of the City Council via PNA / MANILA BULLETIN) City Councilor Franklin Gacal, who authored the resolution, stressed that the declaration of state of calamity was meant to expedite the pro-active stance of the city government to address the spread of NCOV virus in the city. He said the declaration of state of calamity in the city was contained in the resolution approved by the City Council on Tuesday which seeks a temporary ban on the entry of all foreign nationals who travelled to mainland China. “The local government should undertake prompt action to contain the spread of nCoV in the city,” Gacal said. With the declaration, the city government can now utilize its calamity funds to procure the needed medical supplies to contain the virus. Gacal said the declaration was an offshoot of the World Health Organization declaring a public health emergency. Assistant city health officer Lalaine Calonzo said the Chinese businessman had travelled to Wuhan, China during the Chinese New Year’s holiday and returned to the city on January 22. She said health authorities considered the Chinese who had undergone self quarantine, as a person under monitoring for possible infection of nCoV. Health personnel are closely monitoring the health condition of the local Chinese trader to determine if there are manifestations of nCoV during the 14-day incubation period that will end on Thursday, February 6. “If there are manifestations of nCoV, then we will isolate the person,” Calonzo said. She said health authorities were able to track down the Chinese businessman, who has been living in the city for about four years, after a concerned citizen provided them with information on the reported travel history of the Chinese to Wuhan last month. She urged local residents to provide local health authorities with any information regarding the entry of foreigners and locals from mainland China and its special administrative regions. Meanwhile, local health officials in Sarangani, are closely monitoring four Chinese tourists from mainland China and who arrived for a vacation tour in a beach resort in Glan town.

Bureau of Immigration (MANILA BULLETIN) Immigration Commissioner Jaime Morente said he has ordered the bureau’s port personnel to make sure the ban is implemented to the letter and that all BI port personnel are told to exercise extra care and vigilance in screening arriving passengers. He said the bureau’s Port Operations Division (POD) has been assisting the Bureau of Quarantine (BOQ) in filtering arriving passengers through “redundancy checks.” Airlines and shipping agents were also advised not to board passengers with travel history to the concerned areas within the last 14 days, he added. A memorandum order issued last Sunday by BI-POD chief Grifton Medina spelled out the guidelines that BI officers must observe in enforcing the travel ban. It states that any passenger of any nationality who has been to China and their SARs within 14 days before coming to the Philippines shall automatically be denied entry. “The only exception will be Filipino citizens and alien permanent status holders,” Morente said. Medina also identified permanent resident aliens as those who were issued immigrant visas under the Philippine immigration act, those who availed of the alien legalization program under Executive Order No. 324, those who availed of the alien social integration program under Republic Act No. 7919, native-born foreign nationals, aliens who acquired permanent resident status by reason of marriage to Filipinos, and aliens with approved refugee status. The guidelines also state that if a foreign passenger not exempted from the ban happens to disembark, he or she shall automatically be excluded and immediately sent back to the port of origin. Filipinos and aliens exempted from the ban who arrive from China, Hongkong, and Macau, including flight crew, shall be turned over to the Bureau of Quarantine (BOQ) for their assessment, together with a copy of their arrival cards. Further, Filipinos, including overseas workers and permanent residents of other countries, who are traveling to China, Hong Kong, and Macau will not be allowed to leave unless the passenger is part of a government delegation conducting official duties, or a member of the World Health Organization or other agencies involved in fighting the spread of the virus. Morente also said that BI seaport personnel will be implementing the same measures, and will only allow passengers coming from China, Hong Kong, and Macau upon clearance from BOQ, after the 14-day period has lapsed. Morente said that while no timelines could be given, the measure is temporary. “The directive of the President follows the recommendation of the Department of Health, which is in line with advisories from the World Health Organization.

A man wearing a mask is seen at the Nanjing Pedestrian Road, a main shopping area, in Shanghai, China January 24, 2020. (REUTERS/Aly Song/File Photo/MANILA BULLETIN) The Wuhan Institute of Virology of the China Academy of Sciences, based in the city where the outbreak is believed to have originated, said in a statement on Tuesday it applied to patent the use of Remdesivir, an antiviral drug developed by Gilead (GILD.O), to treat the virus. A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine last week reported a coronavirus patient in the United States was found to show an improvement after taking Remdesivir, which is also used to treat infectious diseases such as Ebola. The Wuhan Institute of Virology did not respond to Reuters’ request for comment. “Even if the Wuhan Institute’s application gets authorized, the role is very limited because Gilead still owns the fundamental patent of the drug,” said Zhao Youbin, a Shanghai-based intellectual property counsel at Purplevine IP Service Co. “Any exploitation of the patent must seek approval from Gilead.” Gilead did not immediately respond to request for comment but last week said it was working with China to test Remdesivir for use in a small number of patients with the coronavirus. The application was submitted jointly with the Military Medicine Institute of the People’s Liberation Army Academy of Military Science, according to the Wuhan Institute of Virology. Scientists from both institutes said in a paper published in Nature’s Cell Research on Tuesday that they found both Remdesivir and Chloroquine, which is used to treat malaria, to be an effective way to inhibit the coronavirus. The Wuhan-based laboratory said in its statement that the patent application was filed on Jan. 21 and aimed at protecting China’s national interests. However, it said it would temporarily drop its patent claims if the opportunity arose to collaborate with foreign pharmaceutical firms to fight the epidemic. Tags: ncov"

FILE PHOTO: Medical workers hold a strike the outside Hospital Authority as they demand for Hong Kong to close its border with China to reduce the coronavirus spreading, in Hong Kong, China February 4, 2020. (REUTERS/Tyrone Siu/MANILA BULLETIN) The former British colony saw its first death from the coronavirus virus on Tuesday. It has confirmed 18 cases, including at least four that were transmitted locally. Hong Kong health workers have been on strike this week to demand that city authorities seal the border with China, where the virus originated last month, to block its spread. The cruise ship, World Dream, operated by Dream Cruises, docked in Hong Kong after it was denied entry to the southern Taiwan port of Kaohsiung on Tuesday. Three mainland Chinese who had been on board from Jan. 19 to Jan. 24 were found to have had the virus, Hong Kong’s health department said, adding that most of those remaining on board were from Hong Kong. “For the time being, we cannot conclude the likely time of finishing the quarantine measures,” said Leung Yiu-hong, an official at the city’s department of health. Dream Cruises, which is operated by Genting Hong Kong (0678.HK) >, said in a statement the three “confirmed” cases of the virus had disembarked in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou on Jan. 24. The coronavirus epidemic, which began in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in December, has rekindled memories in Hong Kong of a 2003 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), another coronavirus that began in China and killed nearly 300 people in the city. The latest virus has spread rapidly in China with nearly 25,000 people infected and 490 deaths, most in Wuhan and the surrounding province of Hubei. Hong Kong health workers and members of other trade unions have demanded that the border with the mainland be completely sealed to block it. “As the disease is spreading rapidly in our community, and locally infected cases are steadily increasing, we are dangerously close to a massive community outbreak comparable to SARS,” a newly formed union called the Hospital Authority Employees Alliance (HAEA) said in a statement. TEARGAS The city’s chief executive, Carrie Lam, has suspended some links with the mainland and closed some border crossings but she has left three open, arguing that to close the entire border would be inappropriate, impractical and discriminatory. Thousands of medical staff have joined members of other trade unions this week and the city’s Hospital Authority has warned that emergency services are being severely hampered. Hong Kong’s beleaguered public hospital network was suffering from staff shortages and limited hospital beds before the coronavirus outbreak. On Wednesday, dozens of medical representatives including the chairwoman of HAEA, Winnie Yu, marched to government headquarters to press their demands for the border to be sealed. The health scare comes after months of at times violent anti-government protests in Hong Kong sparked by fears its autonomy, guaranteed under a “one country, two systems” formula, is being eroded by Beijing. Some pro-democracy protesters have come out in support of the HAEA strike with some demonstrations beginning to take on the characteristics of the pro-democracy protests. Overnight, police fired teargas and rubber bullets to disperse a crowd in the city’s rural New Territories after protesters denounced the government’s refusal to seal the border. On Wednesday, masked workers brandished posters reading “Hospital workers on strike” and “If we burn, you burn too” as they petitioned Lam to meet them and handed in a letter to her office on behalf of front-line medical staff. Thousands of Hong Kong people waited in long queues on Wednesday to buy face masks with some camping overnight to secure their place, broadcaster RTHK reported. Tags: ncov"

A man wearing a protective facemask walks on an empty street in Hangzhou, some 175 kilometres (110 miles) southwest of Shanghai on February 5, 2020, near Alibaba headquarters. – The world has a “window of opportunity” to halt the spread of a deadly new virus, global health experts said, as the number of people infected in China jumped to 24,000 and millions more were ordered to stay indoors. (Photo by NOEL CELIS / AFP/ MANILA BULLETIN ) With more than 24,000 cases in China, a growing number of cities have been imposing a range of restrictions in recent days far from central Hubei province, the epicentre of the outbreak, as authorities struggle to contain the virus. Global concerns have risen as more countries found cases that were not imported from China and 10 people tested positive for the virus on a ship quarantined off the coast of Japan. Some 56 million people in Hubei have been under virtual lockdown since last week, with its capital Wuhan at the heart of the health emergency. In Hangzhou, some 175 kilometres (110 miles) southwest of Shanghai, green fences blocked streets near the headquarters of Chinese tech giant Alibaba as a fighter jet circled overhead. Alibaba, one of the world’s most valuable companies, appeared shut down, while deliverymen moved in and out of the nearby fenced-in residential areas to drop off groceries. Many people were also seen going out. The firm is inside one of three districts where some three million people were told this week that only one person per household would be allowed outside every two days to buy necessities. “Please don’t go out, don’t go out, don’t go out!” blared a message on a loudspeaker urging people to wear masks, wash their hands regularly and report any people who are from Hubei — a common fear in other parts of the country that people from the province might infect others. At least three other cities in eastern Zhejiang province — Taizhou, Wenzhou and parts of Ningbo — have imposed the same measures, affecting some 18 million people. Similar policies were encouraged by authorities in two cities as far as China’s northeasternmost province, Heilongjiang, and a handful of others along the east coast. In Henan province, which borders Hubei, a district in the city of Zhumadian decided that only one person could leave each household every five days. Residents there have been offered cash rewards for informing on people from Hubei. Global jitters  The disease is believed to have emerged in December in a Wuhan market that sold wild animals, and spread rapidly as people travelled for the Lunar New Year holiday in January. The death toll has steadily increased, rising to 490 in China after Hubei reported 65 more people had died. Most deaths have been in the province and officials have noted that the death rate, at around two percent, is below the mortality rate of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome. The new coronavirus is from the same family of pathogens as the one that causes SARS, which killed some 800 people in 2002-2003. The epidemic has prompted the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare a global health emergency, several governments to institute travel restrictions, and airlines to suspend flights to and from China. United and American Airlines said Wednesday they have added Hong Kong to their China flight suspensions. On Wednesday Japan said at least 10 passengers on a cruise ship carrying 3,711 people have the virus. Japanese authorities began testing those on board after a former passenger who disembarked in Hong Kong was diagnosed with the illness. British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab on Tuesday advised Britons to leave China “if they can”, to minimise their risk of exposure to the virus. ‘Window of opportunity’  But the WHO said Tuesday that dramatic measures taken by China offered a chance to halt transmission. WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that the great majority of cases are in China. “That doesn’t mean that it won’t get worse. But for sure we have a window of opportunity to act,” he said. Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand all reported new infections not imported from China on Tuesday. Two fatalities have been reported outside the mainland, in Hong Kong and the Philippines. Semi-autonomous Hong Kong has closed all but two land crossings with the Chinese mainland. As countries battle to keep the virus off their shores, the WHO chief accused wealthy countries of falling short on their duties in sharing data. “Of the 176 cases reported outside China so far, WHO has received complete case report forms for only 38 percent,” he said.   Tags: ncov"

(MANILA BULLETIN) “The patient arrived in Cebu City from Wuhan, China via Hong Kong last January 20, 2020, and traveled to Bohol thereafter. On January 22, the patient consulted a private hospital in Bohol after experiencing fever and coryza,” said Health Undersecretary Rolando Enrique Domingo in a press briefing at the DOH-Central Office in Manila. Domingo said the Chinese woman had no fever when she passed through the thermal scanners upon her arrival in Cebu City last Jan. 20. Domingo explained that the samples taken from the patient last Jan. 24 tested negative for the novel coronavirus. The test was performed by both the Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory in Melbourne, Australia, and the Philippines’ Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM). “Results from said tests came back negative last January 29 and 30, and upon recovery of the patient, she was discharged and was allowed to return to China via Cebu last January 31,” Domingo said. The health undersecretary, however, noted that the RITM last Monday (Feb. 3) notified them that an earlier sample from the patient, dated Jan. 23, tested positive for 2019-nCoV “making her the third confirmed [case of] 2019-nCoV ARD in the Philippines.” “They (RITM) decided to also run all of the old samples that they had. One of her samples was from January 23, an earlier sample. So apparently, ito ‘yung naging positive (this came out positive),” Domingo said. “The picture is, the patient was infected but was getting better, and nag-negative na siya on the 24th, and a week later siya na-discharge — negative (…she tested negative on the 24th and a week later she was discharged – negative). “In their clinical explanation is that the patient was probably towards the end of the illness at that time, kaya positive pa siya, pero ‘yung (that is why she still tested positive, but the) subsequent (test) was (already) negative na, both at RITM and in Australia. So validated twice ‘yung kanyang negative result (the negative result was validated twice),” Domingo added. Domingo also noted that earlier samples of persons under investigation (PUIs) were already tested by the RITM and found negative for novel coronavirus. The health official, however, was unable to disclose the number of earlier samples tested by the RITM. “We have tested all of them–and all of them have tested negative except for this one (third confirmed case).” Meanwhile, Domingo said they are now conducting contact tracing to identify the individuals who had contact with the Chinese woman. “The Epidemiology Bureau has initiated contact tracing of persons who interacted with or were in close proximity to the patient,” said Domingo. “The Bureau of Quarantine and EB are coordinating with the concerned airline while the Central Visayas Center for Health Development is in coordination with the hotel where the patient stayed and the hospital where she was admitted.” First confirmed case update, contact tracing Domingo said the country’s first confirmed case — the 38-year-old Chinese woman — remains admitted at the San Lazaro Hospital in Sta. Cruz, Manila. “’Yung first case natin, wala na talaga siyang sakit for the past week. No fever, no cough, no colds. However, the latest test that was done (in the) last 48 hours was still positive [for nCoV],” the health official said. Domingo said they have located 203 individuals who had close contact with the first and second confirmed case of novel coronavirus, and 188 of them were advised to undergo home quarantine. Domingo also noted that of the 203 contacts, “15 are symptomatic where 14 were already isolated for monitoring.” “[The] DOH (Department of Health) urges the passengers from Cebu Pacific flight 5J 241 from Hong Kong to Cebu on January 20 and 21, 2020; Cebu Pacific flight DG 6519 from Cebu to Dumaguete on January 21, 2020; and Philippine Airlines flight PR 2542 from Dumaguete to Manila on January 25, 2020 to cooperate with DOH representatives who will be getting in touch with them for assessment,” he said. The health official gave the assurance that they are currently working with other concerned agencies to expedite the contact tracing process. Persons under investigation (PUIs) Domingo said the number of PUIs across the country for the 2019 nCoV ARD has reached 133. “Of the 133 PUIs, 115 are currently admitted and isolated, while 16 have been discharged under strict monitoring. Among the PUIs 63 are Filipinos, 54 are Chinese, and 16 from other nationalities. Thirty-two of [them] were reported to have traveled to Wuhan, China.” The health undersecretary reminded the public to practice proper hand hygiene and cough etiquette as these are still “the best way to protect oneself from this virus.” “I am calling all Filipinos to cooperate.

Tolentino(Senator Francis Tolentino official Facebook page / File Photo / MANILA BULLETIN) Tolentino reiterated the appeal he raised during the Senate’s inquiry Tuesday before Health Secretary Francisco Duque III who admitted the lack of rapid diagnostic test kits for 2019-nCoV, delaying the confirmation of the infection among persons under investigation (PUIs). He said the DOH should use the P2.25 billion fund that President Duterte had approved to buy the test kits, instead of the initial plan to procure protective equipment, such as masks, gloves and suits, for health workers dealing with infected patients or those under monitoring. “Given that you have the necessary budget for the chemical suits, what is important is to detect [the virus] at the ground level.

DILG undersecretary and spokesman Jonathan Malaya(DILG 10 via PIA / MANILA BULLETIN FILE PHOTO) DILG Undersecretary Jonathan Malaya said the conduct of the DOH-led contact tracing will be done on passengers who also took the same flights as the two persons who were tested positive for nCoV. “Secretary Eduardo M. Año has directed PNP Chief Archie Gamboa to secure the flight manifest from the airlines and immediately begin the investigation into the whereabouts of these individuals and report the same immediately to health authorities,’’ Malaya said. Año has assured the DOH of the DILG’s full cooperation and support in conducting the contact tracing. Malaya said “that Gamboa has directed the Criminal Investigation and Detection Group (CIDG) under P/MGen Joel Napoleon Coronel to deploy tracker teams for this purpose. Malaya noted that the CIDG will be under the supervision of Police Lt. Gen Guillermo Eleazar. “All PNP units nationwide will also be tapped by the CIDG as may be necessary,’’ Malaya noted. Malaya urged the public and the local government units (LGUs) to cooperate “in this important task to contain the spread of this disease in our country.” “All DILG and PNP assets will be deployed as may be necessary,’’ he added. The DILG had earlier warned uncooperative individuals with symptoms of the 2019 nCov  that they may be bodily carried out from their houses and be examined by a doctor in a government-run hospital. DILG Undersecretary Epimaco Densing III said this goes for both local citizens and foreigners. He noted there is no violation of people’s rights in these cases as public welfare concerns are at stake.

Duque,” Villaluna said over radio DZBB. Duque, during a Senate hearing on Tuesday, claimed that airline companies refused to provide them with details of the concerned passengers and allegedly invoked the Data Privacy Act. He was justifying to senators the slow contact tracing that the DOH has launched since the 38-year-old Chinese woman tested positive for the virus last week. Her companion, a 44-year-old man, died of severe pneumonia on Saturday. The Chinese couple were from Wuhan, China — the epicentre of the 2019-nCoV — and arrived in Cebu via Hong Kong last January 21.

Villaluna also pointed out that PAL has taken the initiative to contact each of the passengers, aside from those who were seated close to the infected Chinese nationals They have so far reached out to 75 of the total 132 passengers of flight PR 2542, she said. This includes the 33 passengers near the Chinese couple.

German Health Minister Jens Spahn speaks on January 28, 2020, in Berlin during a press conference on the situation after a German man contracted the novel strain of coronavirus. (Photo by Odd ANDERSEN / AFP / MANILA BULLETIN) “Indeed, there is the question of possible travel restrictions or at least increased examination (of travelers) at the border,” Germany’s Jens Spahn said at a meeting in Paris with his French counterpart Agnes Buzyn. He was responding to a question about whether Europe would consider a ban similar to that imposed by the United States, which China has accused of spreading “panic”. “It makes no sense that a single country takes measures,” on a continent with border-free travel between most nations, said Spahn. The new coronavirus has killed more than 400 people and infected a further 20,000 in China since emerging in December and has now spread to more than 20 other countries. Buzyn agreed that travel restriction “is one of the questions for European ministers. We must have a coherent vision in the (passport-free) Schengen area.” “There is no sense in one country taking this type of decision while citizens move around freely.” Buzyn said they would ask the Croatian presidency of the EU Council to call a meeting of health ministers within days to discuss further measures needed in the face of the coronavirus crisis. “We would like… closer cooperation so that we have exactly the same measures in all countries in order to be consistent in Europe since there is this free movement of people, and we wish to maintain this free movement.” Tags: ncov"

A Thai married couple recently returned from Japan and two Chinese tourists were the remaining new cases, according to Suwanchai Wattanayingcharoenchai of the disease control department.  Buddhist worshippers wearing protective masks attend prayers at Wat Dhammakaya Buddhist temple in Bangkok (AFP Photo/Lillian SUWANRUMPHA / MANILA BULLETIN) Thailand is struggling to balance control of a burgeoning health crisis with a lucrative travel sector that attracts more than 10 million Chinese tourists a year. The jump brings the total number of cases in the country to the highest outside China where more than 400 people have died since the outbreak emerged in Wuhan in December. Of Thailand’s 25 cases, three were drivers who have had contact with Chinese visitors. “One driver was picking up sick (Chinese) tourists from Hua Hin,” Suwanchai said, referring to a popular beach town three hours south of Bangkok. A South Korean traveller who passed through Thailand also contracted the virus, but it remains unclear where she got it. So far, eight patients have recovered fully and been discharged, while 17 remain in hospital. Several countries have closed their borders or temporarily barred Chinese visitors, but some states closer to home have avoided similar measures during the peak travel season. Thailand now requires visitors from China to show medical certificates stating they are healthy. But it has not adopted a blanket travel or visa ban and insists it has the health situation under control. Still, after days of diplomatic back-and-forth and public pressure, Bangkok moved ahead with an evacuation of its nationals from Wuhan. Officials dressed in full-body protective suits and respirator masks lined up on the tarmac to greet the more than 100 people repatriated late Tuesday, according to photos released by the Royal Thai Navy. They arrived at a naval base after 8:30 pm (1300 GMT) in a borrowed Air Asia plane, and will be put under a standard 14-day quarantine. Six of the 138 Thais repatriated had fevers and were immediately transferred to a hospital — though health minister Anutin Charnvirakul cautioned that it could be due to “excitement”. Two were denied departure from Wuhan due to their high temperatures, while another had overstayed their visa, officials said. Tags: ncov"

A major conference scheduled on the eve of the Singapore Airshow has been cancelled over the global health scare, but organizers said the main event, Asia’s biggest airshow, will proceed (AFP/File / Roslan RAHMAN / MANILA BULLETIN) Organizers, however, said the main event, Asia’s biggest airshow, will proceed as scheduled from February 11-16 despite the pullout of several exhibitors, many of them from China. US aircraft maker Boeing and European rival Airbus are the biggest players at the airshow, which was due to be preceded by the leadership conference featuring top airline, airport, and other industry executives. Among those who had been scheduled to speak at the conference were the senior executives of the United Nations’ International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and the International Air Transport Association (IATA). “The Singapore Airshow Aviation Leadership Summit 2020, a component of the Airshow program… will not take place this year,” a statement by organizer Experia Events said. “This will allow many of the aviation leaders who are deeply involved in working out the responses to the novel coronavirus outbreak to focus on exigencies related to the ongoing situation.” The aviation industry is one of the most affected by the virus outbreak after governments worldwide imposed restrictions on travel, including bans for those arriving from China. The death toll in China stood at 425 Tuesday, exceeding the number of fatalities in the country from the SARS outbreak of 2002-03. The World Health Organization has declared the crisis a global health emergency. IATA said Asia-Pacific Airlines lost around $6.0 billion in revenues during SARS and are likely to be hit hard by the latest crisis. The biennial Singapore Airshow attracted 54,000 trade visitors worldwide in 2018. Experia Events said 10 exhibitors from mainland China, including airplane-maker Commercial Aviation Corporation of China (COMAC), have pulled out of the airshow. Six other companies from Canada and the United States, Britain and Germany have also withdrawn. The side conference would have involved 300 aviation industry leaders including government officials, civil aviation regulators, airport operators, and airline executives. Tags: ncov"

White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow (REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque/File Photo/ MANILA BULLETIN) The US and China agreed in January to a deal that ended their trade war, with Beijing agreeing to buy an additional $200 billion in American goods over the next two years, including agricultural and manufacturing products. But the virus — which has killed more than 400 people, spread worldwide and disrupted business in China — has thrown a wrench into the works. In an interview with Fox Business Network, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow acknowledged that the outbreak may delay the deal’s implementation. “The export boom from that trade deal will take longer because of the Chinese virus, that is true,” he said. However, Kudlow said he expected “minimal impact” from the virus on the US economy. “The world is not in Wuhan,” he said, referring to the Chinese city where the outbreak began. The trade tensions between the US and China fueled a global growth slowdown in 2019, and concerns are rising that the outbreak could continue to hamper economic growth this year. Tags: ncov"

During a Senate hearing on Tuesday, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III blamed Cebu Pacific and the Philippine Airlines, which both carried the two nCoV ARD patients during their flights to Cebu and Dumaguete, for slow contact tracing of all other passengers who were onboard with them. As of Tuesday, Duque said that only 17 percent of the total passengers who were exposed on the same flights had already been contacted. He said, this was because the airlines were “not sharing the contact details of the passengers [and were] invoking confidentiality.” “Only 17 percent of the 331 passengers have been contacted.

This was disputed by Cebu Pacific in a statement yesterday, saying “CEB has been in close coordination with the DOH, the Bureau of Quarantine and other government agencies to help manage the risk of novel Coronavirus and has been working with the government from the beginning.” “Per the request of both the DOH and BVOQ, CEB has already provided a list of the passengers aboard flights.  There is no impediment whatsoever for CEB to provide any and all information that the DOH and BOQ would need from us for their purposes.

China’s National Health Commission said another 65 deaths were reported on Tuesday, a new daily record bringing the toll on the mainland to 490, mostly in and around the locked-down central city of Wuhan where the virus emerged late last year. There have been two deaths outside mainland China. A 39-year-old man in Hong Kong with an underlying illness who had visited Wuhan city died on Tuesday. A man died in the Philippines last week after visiting Wuhan, the first virus-related overseas fatality. Across mainland China, there were 3,887 new confirmed infections, bringing the total accumulated number to 24,324. Ten people on a cruise liner under quarantine at the Japanese port of Yokohama tested positive for coronavirus, Japan’s health minister said, a figure that could rise as medical screening of thousands of patients and crew continued. The 10 infected people will be transported to a medical facility, while the remaining around 3,700 people will be quarantined on board the Carnival Corp ship Diamond Princess for 14 days. There are now 33 cases in Japan. Meeting with repatriates  Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles said there will probably be a long discussion before President Duterte is allowed to go to Fort Magsaysay, Nueva Ecija, to meet Filipino repatriates from China on Saturday. Nograles said knowing the Presi- dent, he would probably insist on going to the mega drug rehabilitation facility that will serve as the quarantine site for the Filipinos repatriated from China, despite the risk to his health. Presidential spokesman Salvador Panelo had earlier said that the repatriated Filipinos will arrive at the Clark Airport on Saturday and will be transported to the drug rehabilitation facility inside Fort Magsaysay, where they will undergo quarantine for two weeks. Nograles assured residents living around the mega drug rehabilitation facility that the virus will not spread

More Chinese cities shut down HANGZHOU, China — Millions more people have been ordered to stay indoors as China battles to curb the spread of a new virus that authorities said Wednesday has already killed nearly 500 people. With more than 24,000 cases in China, a growing number of cities have been imposing a range of restrictions in recent days far from central Hubei province, the epicenter of the outbreak, as authorities struggle to contain the virus. Global concerns have risen as more countries found cases that were not imported from China and 10 people tested positive for the virus on a ship quarantined off the coast of Japan. Some 56 million people in Hubei have been under virtual lockdown since last week, with its capital Wuhan at the heart of the health emergency. In Hangzhou, some 175 kilometers (110 miles) southwest of Shanghai, green fences blocked streets near the headquarters of Chinese tech giant Alibaba as a fighter jet circled overhead.

United said it would halt flights to the international financial hub from Saturday until February 20, citing a sharp drop in passengers. American Airlines said it had already suspended flights through to February 20. Both carriers had previously said they were halting flights to mainland China where the outbreak of the new coronavirus began late last year and has since killed nearly 500 people and infected more than 24,000. Dozens of major airlines have stopped flying to the Chinese main- land in a bid to slow the spread of the virus, which has been detected among a small number of people in more than 20 countries.

(MANILA BULLETIN) This, as Secretary Francisco Duque III ordered an “aggressive” contact tracing of the passengers who were with the Chinese couple when they travelled to the country and within the country last January 21. The contact tracing must be conducted and finished “as soon as possible,” he said. “Sabi ko nga (I told them), they have to work with the PNP, the DILG (Department of Interior and Local Government), to do the aggressive contact tracing in 48 hours. Titingnan kung kakayanin. (We will see if they can do that),” Duque said in an interview Tuesday after the Senate hearing on the government’s plans for containing the 2019-nCoV. Duque said the DOH will meet with the PNP about their coordination, particularly on how they would be able to conduct the contact tracing at a much faster pace. It was Senator Ronald “Bato” dela Rosa, former PNP chief, who proposed to the DOH to coordinate with police. He said the PNP will be able to do this within a few days. Duque was criticized by senators on Tuesday after he reported that only 17 percent of 331 passengers, had been contacted by the DOH. He blamed airline companies Philippine Airlines and Cebu Pacific for supposedly not sharing the contact details of the passengers. Airline officials have denied this, saying they have since been coordinating with authorities and have submitted the names of the passengers who were seated close to the infected Chinese nationals. Duque said he will have this investigated because his people at the DOH’s Epidemiology Bureau supposedly told him that the airlines refused to cooperate. “Heads will roll, of course,” if concerned DOH personnel are found to be negligent about the contract tracing of the said airline passengers, he said The Chinese couple were from Wuhan, China, the source of the virus, and arrived in the Philippines via Hong Kong last January 21. One of them, a 44-year-old man, died on Saturday after being infected with the 2019-nCov. He was the first 2019-nCov death recorded outside of China. Tags: ncov"

Brazil’s Defence Minister Fernando Azevedo attends a press conference at the Planalto Palace in Brasilia, Brazil February 4, 2020. (REUTERS/Adriano Machado/MANILA BULLETIN) Defense Minister Fernando Azevedo said two 36-seat Embraer C-190 planes flown by the Brazilian Air Force will leave on Wednesday morning and make refueling stops in Spain and Poland and arrive in Wuhan on Friday. Foreign Minister Ernesto Araujo said 29 people, including four family members who are Chinese nationals, would be evacuated, as well other Brazilians who live outside Wuhan. The passengers, medical staff and the crew of the planes will be quarantined for 18 days at an Air Force base in Anapolis, 150 kilometers (93 miles) west of the capital Brasilia. President Jair Bolsonaro said last week that repatriating Brazilians from Wuhan would not be “opportune” as it could put the population back home at risk. He changed his mind over the weekend when some of the 55 Brazilians in Wuhan posted a video appealing to Bolsonaro to get them out. In their six-minute video here posted on Youtube, the Brazilians noted that other nations where evacuating their citizens with the help of Chinese authorities, and they pleaded with Bolsonaro to rescue them. Wuhan has been under virtual lockdown since Jan. 23. Airlines around the world have stopped flights to parts of China as cases of the virus there topped 20,000. Hong Kong reported its first coronavirus death on Tuesday, the second outside mainland China from a fast-spreading outbreak that has killed 427 people and threatened economic supply chains around the world.

,"February 10, 2020, 12:59 PM",nCov,US working with drug firm on new coronavirus treatment,By Agence France-Presse,"By Agence France-Presse The United States is working with a pharmaceutical company to develop a treatment for the 2019 Novel Coronavirus, using a class of drug that has boosted survival rates among Ebola patients, officials said Tuesday.  Monoclonal antibodies bind to certain proteins on a virus, neutralizing its ability to infect human cells (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention/AFP/File / Lizabeth MENZIES/MANILA BULLETIN) The partnership between the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and Regeneron will develop monoclonal antibodies to fight the infection, a different line of treatment to the antiretrovirals and flu drugs that have also emerged as possible defenses against the disease. Nearly 500 people have died as a result of the virus since it emerged in a Chinese live seafood and wild animal market at the end of last year. “Emerging infectious diseases can present serious threats to our nation’s health security,” said Rick Bright, an official at the HHS. “Working as public-private partners like we have with Regeneron since 2014, we can move rapidly to respond to new global health threats.” Monoclonal antibodies are lab-produced copies of a single type of antibody and are a form of immunotherapy. They lock on to certain proteins on a virus, neutralizing the pathogen’s ability to infect human cells. Regeneron’s REGN-EB3, a cocktail of three monoclonal antibodies, was last year shown to significantly boost survival rates among Ebola patients in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The company has also developed a treatment for Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS) along similar lines. “The life-saving results seen with our investigational Ebola therapy last year underscore the potential impact of Regeneron’s rapid response platform for addressing emerging outbreaks,” said George Yancopoulos, Regeneron’s president and chief scientific officer. Ultimately, the treatment for the novel coronavirus could involve a mixture of different classes of drugs. Chinese doctors have been giving HIV drugs to coronavirus patients in Beijing, based on a 2004 study published after the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) that showed “favorable” responses. Used together, lopinavir and ritonavir decrease the amount of HIV cells in a patient’s blood, stripping back the virus’s ability to reproduce and attack the immune system. Doctors have also combined the treatment with another anti-flu drug called oseltamivir, hoping the creative cocktail can sap the new coronavirus of its strength. California-based Gilead Sciences said they are working with Chinese authorities on clinical trials to determine if remdesivir — an antiviral drug used to treat SARS — is effective. In another development, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Tuesday expanded the use of a detection test for the new coronavirus to qualified laboratories across the country. The test was previously limited to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention laboratories. The US has 11 confirmed cases including two from person-to-person transmission. “Negative results do not preclude 2019-nCoV infection and should not be used as the sole basis for treatment or other patient management decisions,” the FDA cautioned.   Tags: ncov"

While the two academic institutions are not totally barring outsiders, the visitors that include parents of the cadets and military and police personnel on official business are required to be subjected to screening process before they would be allowed entry. In the Philippine Military Academy (PMA), parents and immediate family members of the cadets will have to seek permission first from the Academy’s leadership and would only be allowed entry under the supervision of school health practitioners. “The Philippine Military Academy, in coordination with the Baguio local government and health authorities, is temporarily closed to visitors until further notice,” said Capt. Cherryl Tindog, PMA spokesperson. “This is a proactive measure to safeguard the health and safety of our cadets and the general public from the novel Coronavirus,” she added. The PMA is one of the main sources of officers for the Philippine Army, Air Force and Navy. In the Philippine National Police Academy (PNPA), visitation for cadets were also suspended “until further notice,” according to its superintendent, Maj. Gen. Jose Chiquito Malayo. “All personnel entering the camp are required to wear face masks,” said Brig. Gen. Bernard Banac, PNP spokesman. “They are also subjected to temperature check at the gate before allowed entry,” he added. The PNPA is the country’s academic institution for future police, jail and fire officials.

Cruise ship Diamond Princess is seen anchored off the Yokohama Port, after a Hong Kong passenger who sailed on the vessel last month tested positive for the Wuhan coronavirus, in Yokohama, south of Tokyo, Japan February 5, 2020. (REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon/MANILA BULLETIN) The infected patients were taken to hospitals on the mainland, the remainder of the passengers and crew on board the Carnival Corp (CCL.N) ship were placed in quarantine and given health screenings. Only 31 results of 273 tests have been received so far, revealing the 10 confirmed cases. The quarantine decision meant that passengers on Carnival’s Diamond Princess, which had arrived in Yokohama on Monday after a 14-day round trip, will now spend another two weeks on the ship off Yokohama port near Tokyo. Passengers on the ship took to social media to detail their predicament, posting photos of officials in masks and gowns conducting health checks, room service meals, empty corridors, and a barren deck. British passenger David Abel said all passengers were confined to their cabins on Wednesday morning, with staff delivering food room-by-room. “The challenging situation for me is that I’m an insulin dependent diabetic,” Abel said in a video taken in his cabin and posted to his Facebook page, adding that regular and timed food intake was a key part of managing his condition. “We don’t have a choice in what we can eat, the announcement recently was that they’re starting on the bottom deck and working their way up – I’m on the ninth deck.” “This is not a good situation for me as a diabetic and I’m certain that there are many, many more diabetics on the ship.” A 43-year-old Hong Kong resident on the ship with six family members, including his wife and son, said that as of lunchtime Wednesday, they had gotten coffee and water but no food. They were hungry but had snacks of their own, he said. “I am not looking forward to the range of emotions in the next two weeks,” he told Reuters from his family’s windowless room. “Will deal as they come.” The man, who declined to be named, said he, his wife and son had been tested for the virus, since he had a cold on the ship and had seen the doctor, but none of them had been diagnosed with it, although he wondered if the virus would show up later. Another passenger, using the handle @daxa_tw, tweeted that he was “hearing from many sides that people are troubled and uneasy.” The cruise ship was caught up in the global coronavirus epidemic after an 80-year-old Hong Kong man, who joined for part of the 14-day cruise, tested positive for the virus after disembarking in Hong Kong on Jan. 25. The man had joined a shore excursion in Kagoshima, southwestern Japan, on Jan. 22, local media reported. Health Minister Katsunobu Kato said officials would continue to monitor the remaining passengers and crew for the potential development of symptoms, suggesting that more test samples could be taken. None of the 10 infected people – three each from Japan and Hong Kong, two Australians, one American and one Filipino crew member – had severe symptoms, public broadcaster NHK reported. FREE TRIP  In an effort to soothe quarantined passengers, Carnival’s Princess Cruises said they would receive free internet and telephone services “in order to stay in contact with their family and loved ones, and the ship’s crew is working to keep all guests comfortable.” The ship would go out to sea to perform “normal marine operations”, it added, including the production of fresh water, before receiving food and other supplies from Yokohama. Carnival said that passengers trapped on the Diamond Princess would receive both a full refund and a future cruise credit. It canceled another two cruises that had been scheduled for the same ship to leave Yokohama on Feb. 4 and Feb. 12. Not all passengers were overly concerned about the major change to the itinerary. American Ashley Rhodes-Courter posted a text message exchange on Instagram with her parents, Gay and Phil Courter, who are on board the ship. The couple joked that “the food is great, the staff is in good spirits and we’re all in the same boat … Plus they have not run out of some great pinot noir.”   Tags: ncov"
,"February 10, 2020, 1:00 PM",nCov,HIV drugs touted as weapon in war on coronavirus,By Agence France-Presse,"By Agence France-Presse As doctors scramble to contain the fast-spreading coronavirus, a potent brew of anti-retroviral and flu drugs has emerged as a possible defence against the disease that has killed hundreds.  Two weeks ago Chinese doctors confirmed they had been giving anti-HIV drugs to coronavirus patients in Beijing (AFP/ MANILA BULLETIN) But the science is inconclusive on whether they are actually effective, and experts say a specific treatment could take years to develop. Here is what we know — and don’t know — about the drugs deployed against the SARS-like virus. – Why anti-retrovirals? – Patients diagnosed with the common flu are often prescribed an antiviral drug widely known as Tamiflu. But seasonal flu is “very different from the Chinese coronavirus”, said Sylvie van Der Werf at the Paris-based Pasteur Institute. So far the new coronavirus has infected tens of thousands worldwide and killed more than 420 people, mostly in mainland China. Two weeks ago Chinese doctors confirmed they had been giving anti-HIV drugs to coronavirus patients in Beijing, based on a 2004 study published after the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) that showed “favourable” responses. Used together, lopinavir and ritonavir decrease the amount of HIV cells in a patient’s blood, stripping back the virus’s ability to reproduce and attack the immune system. Doctors have also combined the treatment with another anti-flu drug called oseltamivir, hoping the creative cocktail can sap the new coronavirus of its strength. In Thailand, where there are now 25 confirmed cases, a 71-year-old Chinese patient returned a negative test within 48 hours of being given the three drugs. But Thai doctors urged caution, saying the medicine needed to be given under supervision due to possible side effects. – Does it actually work? –
In short, we don’t know for sure. The 2004 study showed anti-retrovirals used on patients with SARS had “substantial clinical benefits”, experts in China said. But random trials on 41 coronavirus patients had “limitations”, according to research published in The Lancet on January 24. Doctors in Singapore — where there are 24 cases — have followed suit with the anti-retroviral treatment, said the country’s chief health scientist Tan Chorh Chuan, without going into details about the results. Other studies looked “promising” and a clinical trial has started in Wuhan. “These agents appear to be effective but we can’t be certain at the moment,” he said Tuesday. – What’s big pharma doing? –
Biotech firms are working on a suite of treatment options. California-based Gilead Sciences said they are working with Chinese authorities on clinical trials to determine if remdesivir — a drug used to treat SARS — is effective. Development of entirely new treatments are also underway. The US Health and Human Services department is partnering with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals to develop monoclonal antibodies to fight the infection, a class of drug the company has successfully used to boost survival rates among Ebola patients. Meanwhile three teams around the world — in China, Australia and the Pasteur Institute in France — have now succeeded in cultivating the coronavirus in the laboratory. That could lead to pinpointing its “Achilles’ heel” by understanding how it replicates in cells, said Christophe d’Enfert, the institute’s scientific director. – So what should you do? – The best approach for the general public is to try and “stay healthy” so your immune system can offer a robust response to the threat of the virus, said Singapore’s health minister Gan Kim Yong. But for already infected patients, hospitals must provide support to prevent complications. “Chances are if you already have underlying medical conditions… your defences are weak and your organs may already be impaired, and therefore the risk of death is higher,” he told parliament Monday. – Home remedies and quackery – Misinformation has proliferated online about home and traditional remedies. A liquid made with honeysuckle and flowering plants used in traditional medicine was initially claimed to “inhibit” the virus, sparking frenzied buying in China. But Chinese state media later sounded a more cautionary note, as researchers warned of potential side effects. In India, where there are three reported confirmed cases, the government has touted ancient homeopathy and Ayurveda remedies as the answer. The jury is out on the effectiveness, and doctors still recommended that patients be treated in a hospital. Online posts erroneously identified saline as a coronavirus killer in Australia, while in Thailand social media suggested antiseptic should be sprayed in a person’s mouth. The antiseptic brand Betadine has refuted the claim. Tags: ncov"
,"February 10, 2020, 1:00 PM",nCov,World has ‘window of opportunity’ to halt virus spread: WHO chief,By Agence France-Presse,"By Agence France-Presse The dramatic measures taken by China to rein in the deadly new coronavirus outbreak have prevented significant spread abroad, providing a “window of opportunity” to halt transmission, the World Health Organization said Tuesday.  WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the world has a “window of opportunity” to halt the spread of the coronavirus (AFP Photo/Fabrice COFFRINI) But the UN health agency’s chief also called for greater solidarity, accusing some governments of wealthy countries of being “well behind” in sharing data on virus cases. “While 99 percent of cases are in China, in the rest of the world we only have 176 cases,” Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a technical briefing to the WHO’s Executive Board in Geneva. “That doesn’t mean that it won’t get worse. But for sure we have a window of opportunity to act… Let’s not miss this window of opportunity,” he said. Tedros said the WHO had received complete case report forms for only 38 percent of the cases outside China. “Some high-income countries are well behind in sharing this vital data with WHO. I don’t think it’s because they lack capacity,” he said. “Without better data, it’s very hard for us to assess how the outbreak is evolving, or what impact it could have, and to ensure we are providing the most appropriate recommendations,” he said. More than 20,400 cases of the virus have been confirmed in China since the virus was first detected on December 31. The death toll in mainland China has soared to 425 and more than 20 countries have now confirmed cases of the virus, which the WHO has declared a global health emergency. – ‘Fear and stigma’ –
During Tuesday’s meeting, WHO’s head of emergency strategy, Scott Pendergast, stressed that preventing major international spread of the virus would require providing significant support to countries with weaker health systems. “What we are most concerned about is the lower end of the capacity scale, where you have a number of countries that are of high risk of imported cases but potentially we are not seeing those imported cases detected.” The main focus, he said, should be on supporting those countries to “make sure they have got the capacity to detect, to diagnose and to quickly isolate cases.” Tedros said the WHO was sending masks, gloves, respirators and 18,000 protective isolation gowns to 24 countries, as well as 250,000 test kits to speed up the process of diagnose carriers of the virus. A number of country representatives voiced concerns about the situation at home. Sudan’s representative told the assembly his country was preparing on Wednesday to evacuate 225 students from Wuhan, and feared they could bring the virus to the country, which he said had four suspected cases. “We are extremely short of money… We are battling with six other epidemics, we definitely don’t need more cases coming in,” he said. He said that with WHO support, the country had created an isolation ward and received test kits, but said more support would be needed. Tedros meanwhile reiterated his call for countries not to impose travel and trade restrictions because of the virus. “Such restrictions can have the effect of increasing fear and stigma, with little public health benefit,” he said, adding that 22 countries had so far informed WHO they were implementing such measures. “Where such measures have been implemented, we urge that they are short in duration, proportionate to the public health risks, and are reconsidered regularly as the situation evolves,” he said.

That puts the national total at more than 23,500, based on numbers previously issued by the central government. The epidemic, which has spiralled into a global health emergency, is believed to have emerged in December from a market that sold wild game in Hubei’s capital Wuhan. Cases have now been reported in more than 20 countries. Highlighting the concern about infections spreading in other densely-populated Chinese metropolitan areas, authorities in three cities in eastern Zhejiang province — including one near Shanghai — placed restrictions on the number of people allowed to leave their homes.

Health Secretary Francisco Duque III(AP Photo/Aaron Favila / MANILA BULLETIN) Duque, citing health experts, confirmed before the Senate health committee that the 2019-nCoV ARD acquired by the Chinese male from Wuhan, China, is no longer contagious. “The experts behind me are one in saying that they will no longer be infectious once dead,” Duque said, when asked by Sen. Nancy Binay on the Department of Health’s (DOH) protocols for fatalities infected by 2019-nCoV. “So ‘pag namatay, hindi na rin magiging carrier?” Binay clarified. “Wala na ho, hindi na ho magiging carrier (No more, he is no longer a carrier).

Duque said in the hearing that a funeral parlor agreed to cremate the Chinese fatality and scheduled the procedure for Tuesday. “I just have to get the latest update on this, whether in fact, the body of this Chinese national has been cremated,” he said. Earlier in the hearing, Duque lamented about the flip-flopping of a group “within the Chinese Chamber of Commerce” about the cremation of their fellow Chinese national. The group, he said, initially agreed to handle the cremation of the foreigner, but later “backed out.” “Well, they have their own mindset. That’s the problem with them, sabi ko, ‘Pambihira naman (That’s absurd), you are fellow Chinese, dapat pakita ninyo na susuportahan niyo (you should show that you are supporting them). I don’t know, I didn’t get the full story behind, but it’s very unfortunate to hear stories like this, because it’s at this time, they should start sense of, you know, patriotism for their fellow Chinese national,” a disappointed Duque said. “It’s difficult to understand.” The Chinese national, who arrived in the Philippines via Hong Kong last Jan. 21, died on Saturday of severe pneumonia due to the 2019-nCov, the DOH reported Sunday.

Senator Christopher Lawrence “Bong” Go (MALACAÑANG PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN) Sen. Francis Pangilinan’s allegation of “failure of leadership” on Duque’s part followed revelations of DOH’s inability to “contact trace” 83 percent of the 331 passengers of Cebu Pacific from Hong Kong that carried the Chinese passenger who eventually died in the Philippines of the coronavirus infection.

Magkaisa muna tayo,” Go told Senate reporters after conducting a public hearing on the health scare. (That is their work, the work of Secretary Duque, the work of (Transportation) Secretary Secretary (Arthur) Tugade, the members of an inter-agency task force, for now let’s not engage in blame. Let us unite first.) Go said what is important is that the public be kept informed and that there should be no panic. He said he is still studying the possibility of calling for another hearing so that Filipinos should not be victims of fake news on the matter. “Magtulungan po tayo, ‘yung totoong balita lang po, ‘wag natin dagdagan ang problema natin, tulungan natin ang kapwa Filipino. ‘Yung mga nag-spread ng maling balita, fake news, mga bashers, kayo ang dapat i-quarantine, baka kayo ang makahawa,” he said. (Let us help one another. Just the real news, let’s not add to our problems, let’s help our fellow Filipinos. Those who spread incorrect news, the bashers, you’re the ones who should be quarantined because you might be contagious.) Go said the 83 percent of passengers who haven’t been traced yet should be located and government agencies should tap the services of the police and immigration in looking for them. “If there’s a will, there’s a way, kaya ‘yan. May paraan talaga dapat. Gawin nyo lang ang dedikasyon sa trabaho,” he added. (It can be done. There should be a method to get it done. Just be dedicated to your work.) Tags: ncov"
,"February 10, 2020, 1:02 PM",nCov,Pangilinan slams DOH chief for ‘failure of leadership’ on contact tracing amid nCoV threat,By Mario Casayuran,"By Mario Casayuran Opposition Senator Francis N. Pangilinan said on Tuesday that “failure of leadership” is the main problem in alleviating the spread of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019 nCoV) and the fear of infection among Filipinos.  Senator Francis “Kiko” Pangilinan (Kiko Pangilinan Official Facebook Page / MANILA BULLETIN) In Tuesday’s public hearing of the Senate health committee chaired by Senator Christopher “Bong” Go, Pangilinan criticized Department of Health (DOH) Secretary Francisco Duque III for seeming unprepared for the worst, and not knowing the basic numbers involving the spread of the disease, including the number of flights from China and other affected areas over the last two weeks. Pangilinan, who called on Jan. 27 for a travel ban on travelers arriving from China, said these figures would make the government realize “how exposed we are.” “If we knew the volume, then we would know what we need to do,” he said. Pangilinan wanted to know how DoH is conducting the contact trace on all visitors from Wuhan, but Duque initially did not know the numbers right away; later the DoH secretary said 31 of the 80 patients under investigation are from Wuhan. “That flight came from Hong Kong. For all you know, you have 15 to 20 asymptomatic passengers. You err on the side of caution, you go the whole mile and figure out where these 300 are. You cannot try to minimize the problem. And that’s why that 17 percent of having contacted, 17 percent of those passengers is completely unacceptable,” Pangilinan said. “I do not think that it is just a failure of communication but a failure of leadership from the Secretary of Health,” he added. On detailed questions from the senators, Duque started pointing fingers at other agencies and his own staff on the low rate of contact-tracing among the fellow flight passengers of the first confirmed case of the disease who arrived in the country in Jan. 21, or 14 days ago. Duque blamed the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP), the Bureau of Immigration (BI), and even the Bureau of Quarantine (BoQ) under his department for being only able to trace 17 percent of the 331 passengers who shared the same flight as the first confirmed case who travelled from Wuhan to Hong Kong to Cebu to Dumaguete to Manila. In his defense, Duque said no issues on contact-tracing were raised. “This is quite operational and I have been in touch with our epidemiology bureau. In fact, for the record, I would like to state his name. His name is Director Ferchito Avelino and in all of our meetings, there has been no indication or no issues raised to me that this is a problem. “He is saying that he has already spoken to my undersecretary but I am not aware that this is the — As Secretary of Health, I don’t know the specific measures of how this should be done,” Duque said. “I can see here an issue of lack of transparency on the part of some of my people here. I would like to investigate this,” he added. Pangilinan also appealed to some Cabinet secretaries who were asking permission to leave the Senate hearing to address the problem of communication. “May we just appeal to the other Cabinet secretaries who are meant to leave that can we get the problem of communication addressed so that we can—at least when you leave, we are given the assurance that the matter will be addressed,” he said. Pangilinan also suggested that the DoH hotline be manned 24-7 so that those who have nCoV concerns would have someone informed respond to their queries. Earlier, Pangilinan suggested that to remain on top of the situation, the government agencies concerned should identify and try to locate all potential carriers of the virus from the list of all passengers of flights that arrived in the country from Wuhan and other Chinese cities in the last two weeks or so. He said these agencies should start with all the passengers on the flight from Wuhan that arrived last Jan. 21 together with the two confirmed nCoV carriers. Pangilinan said the concerned government agencies must, as best as they can, identify, quarantine, and monitor all suspected carriers as the first step in containing the spread of the disease.

Christopher “Bong” Go and other key national government officials on Tuesday (Feb. 4).  Sen. Christopher “Bong” Go(FACEBOOK / MANILA BULLETIN) At Go’s Senate health committee public hearing on the issue, concerned officials and health experts explained how the government could step up its efforts and ensure that the virus will not spread further throughout the country. Key government officials invited to the hearing mentioned the precautionary measures already in place to protect Filipinos from the spread of the virus. In his opening statement, Go assured the public that the government has been on top of the situation and is committed to assist Filipinos and the rest of the world in laying down measures to mitigate the impact of the 2019-nCov ARD on the worldwide community. “Since Day 1, the whole Duterte administration has said that it has been on top of the situation and is doing everything it can to address the issue. The President, and even a key official from the World Health Organization, have commended the efforts of this government in responding to this worldwide health concern,” he said. Go posed questions to the government officials and experts regarding the nature of the disease, severity of the problem, its impact on the country including the economy, and the best way forward for the government to mitigate its effects. Department of Health (DOH) Secretary Francisco Duque III gave updates on the novel coronavirus in the Philippines. “Eighty patients are under investigation in the Philippines, 67 are currently admitted and isolated, 10 discharged under straight monitoring,” Duque said in his presentation. Duque said the fatality rate of 2019-nCoV ARD is much less than SARS and MERS-CoV but it is more easily transmissible. Duque also clarified the mode of transmission of the disease, saying “Ang ating pinaka-available na info ay (Our readily available information is that) coronavirus can survive and stay alive for as long as ten hours on inanimate objects like keyboards, tables, and fomites (objects likely to carry infection such as clothes, other items).” DOH also mentioned that President Duterte has approved the budget needed for the procurement of personal protective equipment for around 5,000 health workers who will need them amid the coronavirus threat. As for the economic impacts, Department of Finance (DOF) Secretary Carlos Dominguez III said that the economic costs of the infection on the economy would most likely be centered on the tourism sector, but that “it’s too early to estimate the economic impact of the novel coronavirus.” To counter the identified economic impacts, Dominguez said that the Department of Tourism (DOT) would further strengthen the promotion of local destinations. While these developments might slightly restrain economic expansion, Dominguez said they are standing by their gross domestic product growth projection of 6.5 to 7.5 percent for 2020. Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea also said President Duterte has expanded the travel ban to include travelers to and from mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau amid the nCoV threat. He said the President “has also ordered the establishment of repatriation and quarantine facility for novel coronavirus.” Medialdea also said the establishment of quarantine facilities is still being studied.

,"February 10, 2020, 1:02 PM",nCov,Aragones says one-fifth of tourist arrivals may be lost due to nCoV,"READ MORE: Garin warns nCoV travel ban will substantially impact tourism, overall economy","By Ben Rosario The Philippine ban on tourist arrivals due to the 2019 novel coronavirus (nCoV) threat will drastically cut revenues from the tourism industry unless the affected sector cooperates fully with government in addressing the problem.  Laguna Rep. Sol Aragones (Facebook) Laguna Rep. Sol Aragones, chairperson of the House committee on tourism, said over one-fifth of tourists visiting the country are from China, which has imposed a lockdown in areas seriously affected by the nCoV outbreak. She said the Department of Tourism (DOT) had expected at least 9.2 million foreign visitors in 2020 who will spend an estimated P661 billion while on vacation in the country. Aragones said her committee will work closely with the House committee on economic affairs and their counterparts in the executive department to “comprehensively assess the potential effects of on-going travel restrictions on foreign tourist arrivals.” “Given all the travel restrictions resulting from the spread of the 2019 nCoV, we may have to revisit these numbers, especially since more than a fifth of the foreign tourists who visited us last year were from China,” said the administration lawmaker. According to her, DOT statistics showed that between January and November 2019, 22 percent of the country’s 7.4 million foreign tourists, or 1.63 million, were Chinese. With President Duterte deciding to ban foreigners coming from China, Hong Kong, and Macau, the number of Chinese tourists will be brought down to zero. According to Aragones, government and tourism stakeholders “need to strategize on a prudent way moving forward––one that allows us sustain livelihoods while protecting lives.” “We have to keep in mind that the tourism industry, per PSA data, employs 5.4 million Filipinos. A broad swath of industries could be affected by the travel restrictions that will be imposed by various governments in response to this outbreak, and we have to be prepared for that,” she said. Aragones explained that limitations on foreign travel may require the tourism sector to focus more on promoting domestic tourism in order to offset possible slowdowns in foreign arrivals. “The tourism revenue target for 2020, overall, is P4.45 trillion, with domestic tourism receipts expected to reach P3.79 trillion. We may need to work overtime to make up the difference as foreign governments take additional precautions to prevent the spread of 2019 nCov.” The solon emphasized that whatever measures to be adopted by the tourism sector moving forward “must always factor in public health considerations,” and urged the Department of Health and the whole country to continue efforts to promote the behaviors and practices necessary to stop the virus in its tracks. “A sure way to mitigate the economic impact of this virus, particularly to the tourism industry, is to contain it and to ensure that it does not spread. The sooner we can do this, the sooner everyone will be able to safely travel, here and abroad.” READ MORE: Garin warns nCoV travel ban will substantially impact tourism, overall economy Tags: ncov"

He reminded them that part of their commitment is “not to discriminate [against] patients.” Jimenez added: “A hospital is for all people who need help.” He, however, admitted that there are private hospitals incapable of fully handling 2019-nCoV cases. “Some hospitals might have the facilities to handle 2019-nCoV cases. But hospitals, in general, do not have such facilities.” He then encouraged private hospitals without adequate facilities to designate one area outside of hospital premises where they can do the history and conduct examinations of patients. “Process of elimination will determine whether patient is a possible victim or carrier of the virus, then refer to proper hospitals with adequate facilities if possible victim is positive based on physical examination and history,” Jimenez said. PHAPi has more than 600 member-private hospitals throughout the country. Tags: ncov"
,"February 10, 2020, 1:03 PM",nCov,Senators irked at DOH over failure of leadership in dealing with nCoV,By Hannah Torregoza,"By Hannah Torregoza The Department of Health (DOH) officials on Tuesday found themselves at the receiving end of the senators’ frustration and anger when they appeared at the Senate committee on health’s inquiry into the country’s response to the novel coronavirus (nCoV).  Senate of the Philippines (MANILA BULLETIN FILE PHOTO) Tensions were high when senators grilled Health Secretary Francisco Duque III over the apparent lack of command responsibility in dealing with the nCoV situation in the Philippines. The DOH first reported the first positive case of the coronavirus last Jan. 30. Then on Feb. 2, reported the second case—and the first fatality—of the nCoV. On top of this was the government’s late imposition of a ban on travelers from China, Hong Kong, and Macau, and the inability of the DOH to contact the co-passengers of the two Chinese nationals who were positive for nCoV. These two Chinese nationals came from Wuhan, traveled to Hong Kong, then to Manila. Sen. Panfilo Lacson stressed the importance of the principle of unity of command in dealing with the nCoV situation, with the DOH taking charge. “What happens to the principle of unity of command? I thought this is a health issue, and the DOH should be the first line of defense and should be designated as the office of primary responsibility,” Lacson pointed out in the hearing. Lacson said the DOH should not be blaming the Bureau of Immigration (BI) and the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP) over the failure to contain the entry of the disease. “You shouldn’t be blaming other people because this is a health issue. And it’s wrong to point to the BI and CAAP, it should be the initiative of the DOH. What we have here, as Sen. (Francis) Pangilinan mentioned earlier, is a failure of leadership,” Lacson pointed out. In the hearing, Duque admitted they were only able to contact 17 percent of the co-passengers of the two Chinese nationals positive for nCoV. Responding to a question posed by Sen. Nancy Binay, Duque admitted the government has yet to contact all of the persons who came in contact with the two Chinese nationals during the flight to the Philippines. “It’s been how many days already? And you haven’t contacted 100 percent all these persons the patient came into contact with? It’s understandable if its hotels or restaurants, but airplanes?” Binay pointed out. Binay said the DOH could have used the passenger manifesto to locate the co-passengers of the two Chinese nationals who both flew Cebu Pacific and Philippine Airlines flights. The problem, Duque said, was that the airlines are invoking confidentiality. “We managed to contact 17 percent or a total of 331 persons. Airlines are not sharing contact details of the passengers. They are invoking confidentiality, so this is what we need to face,” Duque said. READ MORE: Airlines deny being uncooperative with gov’t over passenger lists of flights taken by nCoV patients But Sen. Risa Hontiveros said the DOH should step up its efforts and be prepared for the worst case scenario. “Are we prepared? We don’t want our countrymen and women to panic. But we have to assure them and answer the most fundamental question: are we prepared for the worst?” Hontiveros pointed out. Hontiveros likewise urged the DOH to implement a stronger community health surveillance system. Citing the first case of nCoV, a Chinese woman, Hontiveros said they would not have known they have the nCoV if they did not go for a check up. “Ang worry ko dito ay marami-rami na ring kaso ng mga kagaya ng ating first confirmed case. Pwedeng mamasyal pa kung saan-saan, at dumarami ang contact points, (My worry here is that there are many cases like that of our first confirmed case. They might go somewhere else, and the contact points increase),” Hontiveros remarked. “The first nCoV case in the country also reportedly traveled to Cebu and Dumaguete before she was diagnosed in Manila. Do we have any idea how many of them have already entered the country prior to our travel ban?” she asked. Senators said it is imperative for the DOH to mandate travelers from China who arrived in the Philippines over the past three weeks to report to local health authorities. “The DOH needs to step up. Hindi mo masisisi ang ilan nating kababayang mag-alala kung hindi naman ka-level ng Japan ang healthcare system mo (You can’t blame our citizens to be worried, because we don’t have a health care system that’s at par with Japan’s),” Hontiveros said. “We need to assure the public that we are prepared.”  Tags: ncov"
,"February 10, 2020, 12:48 PM",nCov,Airlines deny being uncooperative with gov’t over passenger lists of flights taken by nCoV patients,By Hannah Torregoza,"By Hannah Torregoza Philippine Airlines and Cebu Pacific on Tuesday denied being uncooperative with authorities, saying they already provided the Department of Health (DOH) and the Bureau of Quarantine (BOQ) the list of the passengers that were on the same flight as the two Chinese nationals who tested positive for the novel coronavirus (nCoV). PAL Vice President for Security Cesar Ordoyo said PAL, in tandem with Cebu Pacific, already communicated to the DOH’s Bureau of Epidemiology their concerns regarding the pro-activeness of the contact tracing that is being done by the government. “We already submitted the names of the passengers who are in seat adjacent or in close proximity to the infected passengers,” Ordoyo told the Senate committee on health in the hearing on the country’s response to the nCoV threat. “And we were given the impression that they have reached out already to the passengers, so they told us two of them contacted the DOH and this is coming from the office of epidemiology,” he explained. “The airline is in full support and cooperating and proactively doing this because we know the effects and the risks involved here.” Cebu Pacific Director for Corporate Communications Charo Logarta-Lagamon also said they have already provided the DOH all the information about the co-passengers of the two Chinese nationals. “Per the request of the DOH and the BOQ, CEB has already provided a list of the passengers aboard both flights,” Logarta-Lagamon said. “There is no impediment whatsoever for CEB to provide any and all information that the DOH and BOQ would need from us for their purposes.” Cebu Pacific, she added, has also contacted the passengers aboard the flights taken by the nCoV-positive patients and updated those they were able to speak with. “As an additional measure, Cebu Pacific opened a hotline to enable passengers aboard the specific flights to call the airline,” she said. Earlier in the hearing, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said the airlines have refused to share the contact details of the passengers. “They are invoking confidentiality, so this is what we need to face,” Duque said. However, Privacy Commissioner Raymund Enriquez Liboro, in a related statement, said that while data privacy is a right, “it is not an absolute right.” Liboro said the Data Privacy Act (DPA) of 2012 allows the government to compel or request airlines to release passenger manifests especially when they are required to address a public health concern. “In responding to a critical public health issue like nCoV, the DOH has the mandate, purpose, and the necessity to collect and process personal data to uphold the public welfare. “Therefore, nothing should prevent airline companies from releasing relevant passenger data to competent and mandated authorities like the DOH,” Liboro said. He also said the DPA is not meant to prevent government from processing personal and sensitive personal information when necessary to fulfill their mandates. Liboro also said the DPA was crafted to promote the fair, secure, and lawful processing of information. ‘We recognize that the passenger manifest to be disclosed with the pertinent government agencies may pose privacy risks to individuals. While the DPA will not stand as an obstacle to the fulfillment by public authorities of their constitutional and statutorily mandated functions, the DPA nonetheless, serves as a reminder of the need for data protection in order to assure that rights of data subjects will be protected,” Liboro said.

Degamo, meanwhile, left to the discretion of private schools whether they will also suspend classes. Following the announcement of class suspension, Silliman University, one of Dumaguete’s top educational institutions, also announced that it will suspend classes in all levels from Wednesday until Friday. “In light of this, there shall be no work during this period unless otherwise directed by their respective heads,” the university said in an advisory. “Faculty members are required to work on alternative learning schemes to ensure completion of the requirements and competencies in their respective subjects. This includes making use of digital learning and other online platforms.” The university said it will again issue an advisory whether to extend the suspension of classes on or before Feb. 7, depending on the development of the situation. “Students are advised to stay indoors and avoid crowded places while the situation is being monitored,” it said. Health officials in Negros Oriental earlier said that five individuals who came in contact with country’s first two confirmed carriers of nCoV have already been placed under quarantine at Negros Oriental Provincial Hospital in Dumaguete City.

TUCP President Raymond Mendoza(TUCP Party-List / MANILA BULLETIN) “There is an urgent emerging need for government policy regulation for government and private business to provide a devoted and additional across-the-board cash compensation benefit unique only for all frontline employees who are in the first and secondary, exposed directly or indirectly, to the risk of infection to the dangerous nCoV virus,” TUCP President Raymond Mendoza said in a statement. He said workers at the country’s air and seaports such cabin crew, flight attendants, pilots, immigration, airport security and maintenance, customs, check-in counter, bag handlers, ground crew personnel, seamen, and porters are in imminent hazard working under extraordinary circumstances. The labor group also identified professional doctors, nurses, medical health practitioners, cleaners, security guards in private and government-owned and -operated hospitals and quarantine facilities, and hotel and restaurant employees as among those at risk of exposure to the new virus. “These workers are in the forefront, our first line of defense against the hazardous nCov virus and they must be compensated more on top of what they are getting on ordinary working days for sacrificing their life and limb in order to save the rest of the community from the deadly outbreak,” Mendoza said. “Government must ensure that employees don’t have to bear the economic burden of being quarantined performing their job.” According to Mendoza, the Department of Labor and Employment labor advisory for employees and employers in the private sectors states employees who may get sick due to nCov exposure may offset absences to their sick and vacation leaves given by the company. However, he said,  these are not enough to cover the 14-day quarantine period. He also reminded employees and employers that workers in the private sector have the right to refuse unsafe work, based on Section 6 of the Republic Act No. 11058 of 2018, otherwise known as an Act Strengthening Compliance With Occupational Safety and Health Standards.

Quezon Rep. Angelina “Helen” Tan (YOUTUBE / MANILA BULLETIN) At the same time, Quezon Rep. Angelina Tan, chairperson of the House committee on health, disclosed that President Duterte has vowed to expropriate hotels and use the drug rehabilitation facility in Nueva Ecija as isolation centers for people with nCoV if it worsens into an epidemic. Tan said the new figure for the anti-nCoV war was raised by Health Secretary Francisco Duque III in the emergency meeting called by President Duterte on Monday night. “DOH presented more than P2 billion (budget proposal) because the estimate of P900 million was for one month only,” Tan said in an interview Tuesday. Last Monday, Tan batted for the approval of a P1 billion supplemental budget to help fight the spread of the nCoV disease that has plagued areas in China, especially Wuhan City where the first cases were reported. Davao City Rep. Isidro Ungab, chairman of the House committee on appropriations, said his panel is ready to work overtime to pursue the early approval of a bill proposing supplemental budget. However, after the Malacañang meeting, Tan said the DOH clarified that the P900 million will be wiped out in just one month if the idea is to fully arm the country against the spread of the still incurable disease. She said the DOH estimate for a three-month war against the disease might reach P2 billion. The amount will be spent for the purchase of protective gear for health personnel, additional testing kits, and payment of overtime pay for state personnel involved in the anti-nCoV campaign, among other expenses. According to her, President Duterte has also raised the need to purchase ambulances for nCoV patients. The DOH seeks additional funding for logistical support for the Disease and Prevention Control Bureau; surveillance activities for the Epidemiology Bureau for its surveillance; the Health Facility Development Bureau for its health facility preparedness, the Health Emergency Management Bureau for its quick response; the Bureau of Quarantine; the Health Promotion and Communications Service; and the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine or RITM.

Abono Party-list Rep. Conrado Estrella(FACEBOOK / MANILA BULLETIN) Citing Section 91 (h), Chapter 21 of Presidential Decree No. 856 or the Sanitation Code of the Philippines, Estrella noted that there has been indecisiveness on the part of the Department of Health (DOH) to dispose of the remains of the fatality. Interviewed over CNN this morning, Health Secretary Francisco Duque admitted that the remains of the 44-year-old Wuhan man have not been cremated as scheduled Tuesday. “Cremation of the male positive of pneumonia and nCoV was supposed to happen today.  I just wanted to know if finally the (owner of the) place they agreed to cremate has not changed his mind,” Duque said. Duque lamented that even the Chinese community that previously supported cremation has started to have second thoughts about the process. “It is really  unfortunate they are backing out, I don’t understand,” he said. Estrella said the DOH must carry out its duty as provided under the law, in this case PD 856. “DOH should also now explore if they could use its funds to assist in the cremation of individuals who succumbed to nCoV,” said Estrella, who represents ABONO party-list. Reacting to the same controversy, Senior Asst. Majority Leader and BH party-list Rep. Bernadette Herrera-Dy said the Inter-Agency Task Force for Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases of the country should address the issue. “Issues like this should be left to the experts, in a body that serves as the command center in the war against this deadly disease, coronavirus crisis,” Herrera-Dy said. She called on concerned parties to put their trust in the experts handling emergency medical situations, saying “every action they take is primarily science-based with only the public interest in mind.” Under PD 856, burial of a deceased person should take place with 12 hours after demise if the “cause of death is a dangerous communicable disease.” Duque said nCoV falls under the same category as HIV-AIDS and other highly communicable diseases. He is of the belief that once the host of the virus has expired, the microorganisms also die.  However, Duque admitted that how long the microorganism will linger and remain active remains uncertain in the case of nCoV.

Senator Juan Edgardo ‘’Sonny’’ M. Angara(FACEBOOK / MANILA BULLETIN) From the current 600 beds, Angara seeks to increase it by 1,000 as the EAMC is constantly operating at overcapacity due to so many patients being accommodated by the hospital. Angara noted that the last time the EAMC was able to increase its bed capacity was in 1997 when Congress passed Republic Act 8345, which added 250 beds to its then 350-bed capacity. Established in 1969, the EAMC has been providing quality service to marginalized Filipinos from Metro Manila and surrounding provinces. “As the EAMC continuously provides quality health service for over 50 years to marginalized patients, it is only proper that the hospital be given support through a legislation that would increase their bed capacity to 1,000 to reinforce the center’s capabilities for the benefit of even more Filipinos,” Angara said. Senate Bill No. 1291 also calls for the upgrading of the existing facilities, professional health care services and health human resource of the EAMC to complement the increase in its bed capacity. Once enacted into law, the DOH Secretary will include the funding required for the increase in EAMC’s bed capacity, as well as the upgrading of the service facilities and professional health care services. The additional bed capacity must be implemented within a year after the law’s enactment. Angara said that currently, a DOH-run hospital can only increase its bed capacity and upgrade its service capability through legislation. Because of this, Angara filed Senate bill no. 698 which seeks to authorize the DOH to set and approve the bed capacity and service capability of all of its hospitals. “It makes sense that it is the DOH and not Congress that determines the requirements of these hospitals that are under its jurisdiction anyway,” he said. “By doing this, these hospitals would be able to operate more efficiently and better serve its patients,” Angara emphasized.

Justice Secretary Menardo Guevarra(TOTO LOZANO/PRESIDENTIAL PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN) Justice Secretary Menardo Guevarra gave this directive under Department Order (DO) No. 052 that he issued on Tuesday. In the DO, Guevarra told the NBI “to conduct an investigation and case build-up on alleged deliberate spread of misinformation and fake news about the 2019-nCoV ARD (acute respiratory disease) and false reporting of 2019-nCoV ARD cases and, if evidence warrants, to file appropriate charges against persons responsible therefor.” Guevarra also instructed the NBI “to coordinate with the Department of Health and provide such technical assistance as may be needed by the said agency in the contact tracing of individuals with the 2019-nCoV ARD, especially passengers who were on board the same flights as the Philippines’ two confirmed 2019-nCoV ARD cases.” The justice secretary told NBI Director Dante Gierran to submit to him “reports on the progress of the subject investigation, case build-up, and assistance.” Justice Undersecretary Markk Perete stressed the need to weed out fake news amid the 2019-nCoV scare. “Laws exist to ensure, among others, public order and safety. Upholding such laws becomes even more important when circumstances that agitate the public emerge. Persons who unnecessarily aggravate such agitation through actions violative of our laws cannot be allowed to unjustly claim protection under the basic guarantees of our Constitution. To hold otherwise will invite chaos and disorder,” he said. Tags: ncov"

The 1,000-bed facility was built to relieve hospitals swamped with patients in Wuhan, the city in Hubei province at the epicenter of the national health emergency that has killed more in China than the 2003 SARS outbreak. Wuhan started on Monday night to convert a local gymnasium, an exhibition center, and a cultural complex into makeshift hospitals, a local newspaper reported. The three venues will have more than 3,400 beds in total for patients suffering from mild cases of the infection, the official Changjiang Daily said. Fifty patients arrived at the military-run facility, the state-backed China Daily reported, with images showing workers in protective suits pushing people in wheelchairs up a ramp and into the pre-fabricated structure. The virus has killed more than 400 people and infected a further 20,000, nearly all of them in Hubei, and spread to two-dozen countries since it emerged in December at a market that sold wild animals in the city. The World Health Organization has declared the crisis a global health emergency, and the first death outside China was confirmed in the Philippines on Sunday. As reports surfaced of bed shortages in hospitals in Wuhan, construction began on Huoshenshan — ”Fire God Mountain” in Chinese — on Friday January 24. Workers toiled day and night amid a forest of earthmovers and trucks carting materials around the site, southwest of the centre of the city of 11 million. On the side of one of the trucks, the isolated city’s new rallying cry — ”Let’s go Wuhan!” — was written on a banner. The two-floor facility was handed over to the army on Sunday and will be staffed with 1,400 military medics, including some with experience dealing with SARS and Ebola. State media had initially reported that patients would begin arriving Monday — inside the 10-day timeframe authorities had set out when construction began. Leishenshan (”Thunder God Mountain”), another hospital on an adjacent site, is set to start admitting patients on Thursday, with 1,600 beds. Fire and thunder are traditionally associated in China with protection against illnesses. Authorities said the Wuhan facilities were modeled on the Xiaotangshan hospital in Beijing, which was built from prefabricated structures in barely a week to treat patients infected by SARS in 2003.   Tags: ncov"

East Avenue Medical Center (EAMC) The East Avenue Medical Center (EAMC) in a statement through its media relations committee allayed public fears on the claim sent through online messaging. “Please be advised that there is no truth to the rumor that EAMC is on lockdown due to a coronavirus suspect patient,” the hospital said in a statement. “EAMC is continuously providing healthcare services to the public at the OPD (outpatient department), ward, and ER (emergency room) departments.” The Department of Health (DOH) hospital, however, did not categorically confirm or deny that a patient under investigation due to the infectious disease is admitted at the hospital. In a facebook post, the health agency clarified that it is fake news.  “FAKE CONTENT ALERT: DOH flags the circulating message regarding the lockdown of East Avenue Medical Center as fake. ” it said. “EAMC is continuously providing healthcare services to the public at the OPD, Ward, and ER Departments,” it added. Health Secretary Francisco Duque III earlier said that DOH hospitals in Metro Manila are capable of accepting patients who manifest symptoms of the disease. “Kaya pa. Hindi lang naman San Lazaro lang, marami tayong mga hospital sa kasalukuyan. Sa NCR meron tayong 13 hospitals, sa Region 3 meron din tayo.

Dr. Sylvie Briand (Reuters) “Every outbreak has its infodemic,” said Dr. Sylvie Briand, WHO Director-Global Infectious Hazard Preparedness, in the organization’s hour-long media briefing broadcast live on its Twitter account at 7 p.m. (Manila time). “We have realized over time that this infodemic could really be an obstacle for good response and hamper effective implementation of counter-measures,” she said. Briand explained the infodemic was brought about by the lack of information on the epidemic.
“Because nature hates a vacuum and because there is unknown, people try to feel the unknown’s ways, different kinds of information.” Briand said the infodemic has existed for centuries but, over the years, its spread became much faster especially now with social media. “Now the information is spreading very fast and is amplified immediately in every corner of the world, basically,” she said. Because of the infodemic problem, Briand said WHO and its partners are trying to fight this also with information. “Our information people are dealing very much with the media, because media and journalists are really one of our key audience groups and are also extremely important amplifiers,” the WHO official said. Briand noted there are around 40,000 publications covering the 2019-nCoV. “I think the amount of information is impressive,” she said. “This is why I think it is important we collaborate to make sure the right information goes to the right place to the right people and the right time.” Briand said WHO also partnered with tech giant Google, which launched a new project called SOS Alert which she explained will “help people to [find] in one place all the information they can find on coronavirus.” Aside from this, Briand said WHO welcomes queries from the public to “understand their concern and reply [to] their concern with the appropriate answer.” Tags: ncov"

Have a good cry, say Chinese health experts. If that does not work, buy a punching bag for the office or try singing. The advice for people in China struggling mentally to cope with the virus comes as schools and businesses delay reopening this week to help contain the spread of the SARS-like pathogen that has claimed more than 420 lives. With public attractions closed, events canceled and citizens urged to stay home to avoid infections over the extended Spring Festival break, their psychological health is coming under the spotlight. There is also growing concern over the well-being of healthcare workers on the frontline as the number of infections rises above 20,400. Some provinces, such as Anhui in the east, have set up 24-hour hotlines for people mentally affected by the epidemic to talk to psychologists or psychiatrists, said state news agency Xinhua. Health experts have offered suggestions on how to deal with the “extraordinary circumstances”. – ‘Have a good cry’ – “If your emotions have been particularly suppressed, you can look for an isolated spot and have a good cry for a few minutes,” said Yang Fude of the Beijing Huilongguan Hospital. “After crying, you will feel better (…) An overcast sky will only brighten up after a heavy downpour,” he added when asked for advice for frontline workers battling the virus. Otherwise, employees can install a sandbag in their office and spend several minutes doing some punching exercises to relax, he said. His comments were met with some amusement online, with one user on China’s Twitter-like platform Weibo saying: “Surely we can’t be crying all day.” – Act responsibly – Chinese citizens are receiving advice on all fronts on how to act responsibly as well. A banner at the Beijing West Railway Station reminds people to “strengthen protection, stay calm, believe in science and avoid spreading rumors”. Another outside a Beijing housing estate urges residents to “avoid going out, wear a mask, keep a distance with others and don’t shake hands”. Jingles on television and radio remind people to wash their hands regularly, on top of round-the-clock updates online from the central city of Wuhan where the virus was detected late last year. China’s state broadcaster has been livestreaming the construction of two new hospitals in the virus epicenter, turning viewers into “online supervisors”, Xinhua reported on Sunday. – ‘Don’t drink and game’ – As people spend more time cooped up at home, hashtags detailing their boredom have made the rounds on Weibo as well, making light of the dire situation. One of them, titled “Dad has finally been driven nuts”, was viewed 440 million times, with 120,000 discussion posts. These included video clips of family members playing badminton indoors while wearing surgical masks. Another hashtag — “how bored can you be when staying at home” — had more than 80 million views. One user wrote: “This is the 10th day I have stayed home, and I can’t tell what day it is or whether it is day or night.” Another user posted photographs of a Mickey Mouse sculpture apparently made from the husks of seeds and nuts. In a bid to curb the spread of the virus, China has restricted travel and effectively locked down most of Hubei province — where the majority of deaths and infections have been reported — for almost two weeks. But experts were quick to urge citizens not to turn to drinking or gaming to pass the time at home. Chen Xuefeng of the Chinese Academy of Sciences said this week: “When avoiding going outside these days, people can relieve stress by exercising indoors, singing and so on.” “Drinking and gaming for long hours is not good for stress and could bring about worse emotional pressure,” she said.

Contrary to earlier reports, not all Chinese tourists have left Boracay, the country’s most popular beach destination. Bautista explained that it was only the chartered flights between Kalibo Airport and Wuhan, the epicenter of 2019 nCoV ARD, that were initially canceled. “The other Chinese tourists came to Boracay via other international flights from mainland China that landed in Kalibo Airport and even in Manila. Their stay in Boracay also depended on their booking schedules,” Bautista said. “For instance, some of them are staying 10 days while others are staying 20 days.” Based on the estimate of the Malay Tourism Office, around 2,000 Chinese tourists are currently in Boracay. Engr. Eusebio Monserate Jr., acting chief of the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP) at Kalibo Airport, said the Chinese tourists cannot fly directly to mainland China after President Duterte extended the temporary travel last Sunday (Feb. 2). Monserate also confirmed to Manila Bulletin that another batch of Chinese tourists from Shanghai landed in Kalibo Sunday. Meanwhile, the nCoV task force of the Malay local government is appealing for stronger cooperation from the management teams of Boracay’s hotels and resorts where the Chinese tourists are staying.

Philippine Ports Authority (MANILA BULLETIN) Crewmen of vessels from China had been prohibited from disembarking from ships while docked at any PPA-controlled ports in the country in a bid to prevent the possible spread of the contagious disease. All visiting privileges given to relatives of Filipino seafarers and non-government organizations extending emotional and spiritual help to seafarers were also canceled. PPA issued the decision Monday to mariners and vessels, including all port stakeholders, in order to protect Philippine borders from further contamination by nCoV. “Not only the passengers coming from Chinese territories should be barred from disembarking, but we should also disallow vessel crews which recently called in any China port,” PPA General Manager Jay Daniel Santiago said. “It is also a practice in the country that relatives of Filipino seafarers are allowed visitation rights, as well as several institutions giving moral, spiritual, and emotional support to anxious seafarers; this too is temporarily suspended.” A special team will be deployed to monitor the movements of personnel and people inside the port. All concerned agencies were also encouraged to issue parallel directives within their jurisdiction. “We recognize the dilemma of our seafarers and the difficulty that they face while at sea, but we also have to guarantee the safety of those offshore. Rest assured that everything will be reinstated when this nCoV scare is over,” Santiago said. “Right now, we just have to work together to protect one another and deeper understanding of the situation is expected from all of us.” Customs Commissioner Rey Leonardo Guerrero, on the other hand, said they will meet with the PPA to discuss boarding protocols “to harmonize efforts.” Tags: ncov"

The DFA chief said Duterte assured him that “he will do something” about the temporary ban that was imposed last Sunday by Malacañang for those coming from China and its special administrative regions (SARs) including Hong Kong and Macau. The temporary ban prohibits the entry of foreigners from China and its SARs to the Philippines. Filipinos and permanent resident visa holders will be allowed to enter subject to 14 days quarantine. The ban also bars Filipinos – including those who work overseas – from going to China, Hong Kong and Macau. This directive is feared to affect OFWs working in Hong Kong, who may face termination from their jobs. In his tweet, Locsin also said the OFWs are better off returning to their employers in Hong Kong. “To say we put them in contagion’s way is to say we are sending them to their deaths when it is to productive lives they cannot have in our lousy country,” he said. Locsin’s post was in response to an earlier statement of Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam who directed her labor and immigration officials to address the situation of Filipino domestic helpers who may not be able to go back to their employers as a result of the ban. Lam said she had written to all consuls general in Hong Kong to explain the work they have done since the start of the coronavirus outbreak. “Now, there could be more governments who don’t have enough understanding about our work here in fighting the infection. So to prevent that from happening, we have arranged to meet with all consul generals in Hong Kong,” Lam was quoted as saying in a report.

A man with a face mask rides the subway in the Queens borough of New York City, U.S. February 2, 2020. (REUTERS/Nick Zieminski/MANILA BULLETIN) “We expect to see more cases of person-to-person spread,” Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said during a conference call that included confirmation of a handful of new cases, bringing the US total to 11. The US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is making nearly $250 million in emergency funds available to cover the cost of the response, an agency spokesman said on Monday. Some of that may be used to support screening and monitoring returning US citizens from China who are exempt from the presidential proclamation issued on Friday suspending entry of foreign nationals who had visited China within the past 14 days. The CDC outlined enhanced screening plans for family members of US citizens and legal permanent residents returning from China, who may face a 14-day quarantine if they had been in Wuhan or the Hubei province of China, the epicenter of the epidemic. Passengers arriving in the United States on commercial airlines will be directed to one of 11 US airports for additional health assessments. If they show virus symptoms such as fever, US citizens and those who are exempt will be transferred for medical evaluation, and will not be allowed to complete their travel plans. “CDC is working with the states to determine where travelers will be quarantined,” Messonnier said. Flights with US government employees being evacuated by the State department will go to military bases. They will be under federal quarantine for 14 days from when they left Wuhan. The CDC has sent additional teams to specific locations where the planes will arrive. Those who do not have symptoms will be allowed to continue to their final destination, and will be asked to stay at home as much as possible and monitor their health for 14 days. Where people will be quarantined may differ depending on the operational plans laid out by states. Some of the designated airports have military bases nearby, while some states have planned to use hotels. “It is very localized depending on the state and local considerations,” Messonnier said. “We do not believe these people pose a risk to the communities where they are being temporarily housed. We are taking measures to minimize any exposure.” HHS on Sunday notified Congress it may need to transfer $136 million to support efforts by the CDC, the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response and the Office of Global Affairs to respond to the outbreak, the agency confirmed on Monday. That followed a Jan. 25 notice to Congress that the CDC would tap as much as $105 million from a rapid response reserve fund to cover the costs for enhanced screening, transportation, and monitoring of US citizens arriving from China. Of the five new US cases announced on Monday, one is in Massachusetts and the other four in California. Four of the five had recently traveled to Wuhan, where the outbreak originated. One of the patients in California was infected through close contact with someone in the same household who had been infected in China. It marked the second instance of person-to-person spread of the virus in the United States after such a case was announced last week in Illinois. The agency said it is currently monitoring 82 people for potential infection with the virus. Tags: ncov"

Transporation secretary Arthur Tugade (ALI VICOY/ MANILA BULLETIN) This was pointed out by Transportation Secretary Arthur Tugade in Tuesday’s public hearing on the feared spread of the NCoV in the Philippines where only 17 percent of the passengers of Cebu Pacific who recently arrived from Hong Kong have been contacted so far by health authorities. Tugade was reacting to an observation of Department of Health (DoH) Secretary Francisco Duque that his department is having difficulty in getting the list of passengers for interview by epidemiologists. He said it is up to the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) and Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP) to submit the list of their passengers because they have the power and ascendancy that the DOH does not have. “What is the protocol?  Mas maganda the one following up may latigo. It is a sad situation. There is failure to coordinate,’’ Tugade added. (It is better that the one following up the list has the whip.) Ed V. Monreal, general manager of the Manila International Airport Authority (MIAA), told the committee that the airlines would not withhold the names of passengers based on protocols. Sen. Christopher Go, chairman of the Senate Committee on Health, assured the public that the government has been on top of the situation and is committed to assist Filipinos and the rest of the world in laying down measures to mitigate the impact of the 2019-nCoV ARD on the whole community. Opposition Senator Francis N. Pangilinan said he disagrees with Duque in blaming his underlings for doing their jobs without his knowledge. Like Senator Joel Villanueva, Pangilinan lamented that only 17 percent of the passengers have been contacted so far. He said there is no failure of communications but failure of leadership at the DOH. “It’s been how many days already? And you haven’t contacted 100 percent all these persons the patient came into contact with? It’s understandable if its hotels or restaurants, but airplanes?” Sen. Nancy Binay asked. Sen. Panfilo “Ping” Lacson stressed the importance of principle of unity of command in dealing with the nCoV situation, with the DOH taking charge. “What happens to the principle of unity of command? I thought this is a health issue, and the DOH should be the first line of defense and should be designated as the Office of Primary Responsibility,” Lacson pointed out in the hearing. Sen. Risa Hontiveros said the DOH should step up its efforts and be prepared for the worst case scenario. “Are we prepared? We don’t want our countrymen and women to panic. But we have to assure them and answer the most fundamental question: are we prepared for the worst?” Hontiveros pointed out.
Senators said it is imperative for the DOH to mandate travelers from China who arrived in the Philippines in the past three weeks to report to local health authorities. “The DOH needs to step up. Hindi mo masisisi ang ilan nating kababayan na mag-alala kung hindi naman ka-level ng Japan ang healthcare system mo, (You can’t blame our citizens to be worried, because we don’t have a health care system that’s at par with Japan),” she said. “We need to assure the public that we are prepared,” Hontiveros stressed. Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) Secretary Teodoro Locsin said the problem of contact tracing these passengers is the job of the CAB and the Bureau of Immigration. As a frequent traveller himself, Locsin said one cannot leave the plane without filling up immigration documents. He said he has been reprimanded at times for failing to submit a filled-up immigration documents. “For the BOI, there is no such thing as right to privacy ‘’- else we are open to invasion,’’ he added. WHO support The World Health Organization (WHO) stands ready to help the Philippine government’s efforts in dealing with deadly 2019 novel coronavirus (2019 NCOV). Appearing before the Senate Health Committee chaired by Senator Christopher Lawrence ‘’Bong’’ Go, Dr. Rabindra Abeyasinghe, WHO Officer-in-Charge (OIC) Country Representative, asked Filipinos to stay calm as current government measures are adequate to control this medical outbreak. Abeyasinghe commended the country’s Department of Health (DOH) headed by Secretary Francisco Duque III for its active measures in dealing with the viral threat as the 2019 NcoV was declared an international concern last January 31. He said frequent washing of hands is a must, including the use of alcohol, in warding off viral spread. The WHO does not give much emphasis to the use of face masks but high-risk persons in the medical profession should use these masks. The life span of a 2019 nCoV virus is from eight to 10 hours   . The WHO believes that the deadly coronavirus could still be controlled like the SARS and Merscov. It expressed optimism that the responses by the international community would slow down the spread and even contain the spread of the virus. Abeyasinghe said the death rate caused by NCoV is low at two percent compared to previous viral attacks. Eighty-eight percent of the fatalities are persons with ages over 60.   Tags: ncov"

The 241 evacuees, who arrived on the Australian-run Christmas Island off Australia’s northwest coast on Tuesday, will remain quarantined for 14 days, the maximum incubation period for the virus.  Australian evacuees from Wuhan, China arrive at RAAF base Learmonth in Western Australia on board a chartered Qantas Boeing 747-400 plane prior to their quarantine at Christmas Island (Australia Department of Defence/Handout via REUTERS/MANILA BULLETIN) “All travelers, I’m advised, have been examined, and there are no cases of confirmed coronavirus,” Hunt told reporters in Canberra. “Fourteen were looked at more closely to ensure they were in an acceptable condition and they have now all been cleared of the virus. A further two are being tested as a precaution.” Australia has asked for permission for a second evacuation flight out of Wuhan in Hubei province, the epicenter of the coronavirus which has been in lockdown. There were 600 Australians registered in Hubei last week. An evacuation flight chartered by Air New Zealand Ltd is scheduled to leave Wuhan late on Tuesday, with 70 New Zealanders and 50 Australian citizens and permanent residents onboard. The Australians will be transferred from Auckland to Christmas Island. The newly identified coronoavirus which first appeared in Wuhan in December has killed 425 people in China, one in Hong Kong and one in the Philippines. The total number of infections in China rose by 3,235 to 20,438 on Tuesday, and there were at least 151 cases in 23 other countries and regions. Australia on Saturday followed the United States in barring entry to all foreign nationals traveling from mainland China and raised its travel warning for China to the highest level, advising people against visiting the country at all. The move has left many Chinese students at Australian universities unable to enter the country just as the university year is about to start. Many Australian universities are financially heavily reliant on Chinese students. “We are very concerned about the interests of the Chinese students who will not be able to come Australia,” , Charge d’Affaires at the Chinese embassy, Wang Xining, told reporters in Canberra. “We are in touch with the universities and also with the education ministry to sort out a proper solution for these students.” Tags: ncov"

,"February 10, 2020, 1:02 PM",nCov,Coronavirus sends Asia’s social media censors into overdrive,By Reuters,"By Reuters Deluged by misinformation about the new coronavirus on social media, some Asian governments are fighting back with arrests, fines and fake news laws – something free speech advocates fear will entrench measures that can also silence dissent. At least 16 people have been arrested over coronavirus posts in Malaysia, India, Thailand, Indonesia and Hong Kong, while Singapore has used its controversial new “fake news” law, POFMA, to force media outlets and social media users to carry government warnings on their posts and articles saying they contain falsehoods.  Security personel attempt to prevent the photographer from taking pictures at a checkpoint at the Jiujiang Yangtze River Bridge as the country is hit by an outbreak of the novel coronavirus, in Jiujiang, Jiangxi province, China, February 4, 2020. (REUTERS/Thomas Peter/MANILA BULLETIN) “Fortunately, we now have POFMA to deal with these fake news,” said Lawrence Wong, one of the ministers heading a Singapore government task force to halt the spread of the virus. Many details of the new flu-like coronavirus that surfaced just weeks ago in the Chinese city of Wuhan are unknown. As the death toll has passed 420, anxiety has been fuelled by social media posts ranging from the bizarre to the malicious. Posts include speculation about how the virus can be caught – through a video game according to one – or avoided – a government minister in Myanmar was rebuked for sharing a post that recommended eating more onions – to local scares of deaths or anti-Chinese attacks. “What I call the ‘moron strain’ has created a global, social media-driven panic that is in turn feeding on itself,” wrote Karim Raslan in his regionally syndicated column, noting how much greater the challenge had become for governments to manage. At least five people were arrested and released on bail in India’s southwestern state of Kerala over WhatsApp messages, said Aadhithya R, District Police Chief of Thrissur. Six people were arrested in Malaysia on suspicion of spreading false news. In Vietnam, where an army of cyber-censors tracks social media comment for the communist government, at least nine people have been fined and three celebrities asked to explain their actions over posts about coronavirus. Thailand hailed the success of an “anti-fake news center” it set up last year. Dozens of staff reviewed nearly 7,600 posts in four days from Jan. 25 – leading to 22 posts being highlighted as false on its website and two arrests under computer crimes laws. “The anti-fake news center is working intensively to verify these rumors and communicating truth to the people,” said Digital Minister Puttipong Punnakanta. Thailand is among countries where laws on social media posts have been toughened in recent years despite complaints from human rights groups that they could be used to target government opponents. Free-speech advocates are wary that the campaign against coronavirus could help governments extend their control as well as damaging the health campaign. “Criminalisation of speech, even if targeted at falsehoods, is highly likely to stifle the real time sharing of information that is essential during epidemics,” said Matthew Bugher, Head of Asia Programme for free expression campaign group Article 19. China has long censored social media heavily and some critics say that may have delayed information on the emerging virus in Wuhan – and therefore potential countermeasures. Eight people were arrested after being accused of spreading rumors about illness in early January, but the case was dropped last week amid growing public anger over the handling of the new crisis. Meanwhile, Tencent Holdings’ ubiquitous messaging app WeChat has added tools to help debunk virus rumors. The official People’s Daily has also introduced a tool to help people verify reports. Western social media companies are also stepping up action. Facebook Inc has said it would take down misinformation about the coronavirus – a rare departure from the usual approach to health content by the world’s biggest social network. Taiwan has warned of punishment for spreading disinformation. South Korean police were working with telecoms regulators to block “false information”, Yonhap news agency said. Indonesian police said two people had been arrested for spreading fake news and face charges that could see them jailed for up to five years. Hong Kong police said a shopping mall security guard was arrested for spreading false news about infections. In Singapore, some said the government was using its new fake news law responsibly. “Many examples of misinformation, confusing data and outright fake news present a clear and present danger to public safety, health and security,” said Nicholas Fang, founder of Singapore consultancy Black Dot Research. But not all were convinced. Journalist and activist Kirsten Han is among those who have been given a government correction notice – in her case for sharing an article related to state executions last month rather than anything to do with coronavirus. “Just because there are relatively more justifiable uses of a #fakenews law, it doesn’t mean that the law was well-drafted and can’t be an instrument of abuse and oppression,” she commented on Twitter.

Cotabato Governor Nancy Catamco(Gov. Nancy Catamco FACEBOOK / MANILA BULLETIN FILE PHOTO) The group, Inter-Agency Task Force on 2019-NCov, was created by virtue of an executive order the governor issued on Monday. Catamco has tasked the Integrated Provincial Health Office (IPHO) to lead the group whose functions would include the assessment of threats of possible entry of virus in the province; establish necessary precautionary measures; and outline specific courses of actions to contain and handle the 2019-NCov cases. The governor has also ordered those in charge of the eight public hospitals in North Cotabato to prepare their facilities and staff or personnel in case persons with travel history from China and its administrative regions have entered the province. She also urged health care professionals, including doctors and nurses, to help them identify and monitor at-risk individuals, which included pregnant women, older adults, children, and people with pre-existing medical conditions like human-immuno virus, diabetes, or heart disease. The task force, she added, will also conduct information-education campaign (IEC) to raise awareness on nCov and to dispel panic because of unverified reports in social media. “I urge the people to be extra cautious and must change their lifestyle and eating habits… that instead of eating meat and other foods high in cholesterol, they should eat vegetables like malunggay, and drink calamansi instead of soda drinks,” said the governor. In Kidapawan City, Mayor Joseph Evangelista is also set to sign an executive order which would be the basis in organizing a city-wide task force on NCov. Lawyer Jose Paolo Evangelista, head of the City Information Office, said the city would have to take all precautions needed to prevent the entry of the virus. He said the hospitals in the city are coordinating with regional hospitals – at Southern Philippines Medical Center in Davao City and Cotabato Regional Medical Center in Cotabato City. “Our first job would focus on monitoring and reporting any case at the regional office of the Department of Health for proper intervention,” he stressed. He stressed most of the hospitals in the city had been affected by recent earthquakes, thus, the need for intervention from other bigger hospitals in case an nCoV case is detected here. Meantime, Evangelista said the 22nd charter celebrations, which start on February 8 and ends on Feb 14, will proceed despite the threats posed by nCoV.

Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles (Photo from Karlo Nograles / Facebook page / MANILA BULLETIN) “Si (Trade) Secretary Mon Lopez has already spoken to our Philippine manufacturers of face masks, and there is a commitment for them to increase their supply,” he said in a media forum in Quezon City. “Secretary Mon also spoke with all of the importers of face masks for them to increase their orders, and for the arrival of additional face masks.” The Cabinet official was asked twice in Tuesday’s forum whether or not there is a face mask shortage, but he did not give a categorical answer. Supplies of face masks ran out in many stores in Metro Manila and nearby provinces following the confirmation of Philippines’ first novel coronavirus (nCoV) case. Last Sunday, the Department of Health (DOH) confirmed that another patient tested positive for the nCoV. He was a 44-year-old Chinese national who died at the San Lazaro Hospital in Manila. Nograles explained Filipinos were buying more face masks than their families need. “I think the scarcity comes with the problem of hoarding; it may not be avoided, [and] because it’s creating some sort of panic among our people, there is a tendency for our countrymen when they [are] able to get [a] supply of face masks, they purchase more than what is required,” he said. Nevertheless, Nograles gave the assurance that the government has stepped up efforts to increase the supply of face masks. “We have medical suppliers and they source their supplies from abroad. Because the demand is high, we are encouraging them to increase their supply, even the local manufacturers,” he said. Tags: ncov"

Singapore health minister Gan Kim Yong said that if the local transmissions escalate in the community the government is prepared to consider ‘measures to reduce human-to-human interaction’ (AFP / Roslan RAHMAN / MANILA BULLETIN) The Ministry of Health said it had found six additional cases, four of them involving human-to-human transmission in Singapore, bringing the total infections to 24 in the city-state. “Though four of these cases constitute a local transmission cluster, there is as yet no evidence of widespread sustained community transmission in Singapore,” the ministry said in a statement. Two of the local transmission cases involved women working at a health products shop primarily serving Chinese tourists. A third was one of the women’s Indonesian maid. Another was a female tour guide who had brought groups to the health shop. In addition to the local transmissions, two cases were among the Singapore residents evacuated from Wuhan on January 30. Health Minister Gan Kim Yong said that if the local transmissions escalate in the community the government is prepared to consider “measures to reduce human-to-human interaction”. – Aviation convention scrapped – A major international aviation conference scheduled for the eve of next week’s Singapore Airshow has been cancelled, organisers said Tuesday. Organisers, however, said the main event, Asia’s biggest airshow, will proceed as scheduled from February 11 to 16 despite the pullout of several exhibitors, many of them from China. The aviation industry is one of the most affected by the virus outbreak after governments worldwide imposed restrictions on travel, including bans on arrivals from China. The death toll in China stood at 425 Tuesday, exceeding the number of fatalities in the country from the outbreak in 2002-03 of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS.

Manuel Cabochan III said.  Rep. Manuel Cabochan III (Party-list, MAGDALO)(HOR / MANILA BULLETIN FILE PHOTO) “In a crisis management standpoint, that was a costly error,” Cabochan, an independent member of the House of Representatives, said on Tuesday (Feb. 4). Wuhan in Hubei province, China is said to be the origin of 2019-nCoV, a virus that causes a respiratory disease that currently has no vaccine against it nor treatment. Despite the local spread of the virus already being international news, a plane carrying over 100 passengers from Wuhan was still allowed to land at Kalibo International Airport last Jan. 23. Kalibo is the gateway to Boracay, a popular tourist destination. Local authorities were quick to send the tourists back to Wuhan. The Philippines so far has two confirmed 2019-nCoV cases, both of whom are Chinese nationals. One of them, a 44-year-old male, died last Feb. 2. The World Health Organization (WHO) said it was first fatality from the virus recorded outside of mainland China. Cabochan, a critic of the Duterte administration, described the lapse as a case of “misplaced priorities.” “Diplomatic relationship, if I may call it (which I think is an overstatement), was placed before the health and safety of our people… na sa paniwala ko ay mali (and that, I think, was wrong).” The former Navy lieutenant was referring to the good bilateral ties between Manila and Beijing under the Duterte administration. President Duterte has since ordered a temporary ban on travelers coming from mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau. There is as yet no confirmed case of local transmission of 2019-nCoV. Tags: ncov"
,"February 10, 2020, 1:03 PM",nCov,Coronavirus spreads fear and racism worldwide,By Agence France-Presse,"By Agence France-Presse SYDNEY – As the deadly coronavirus has spread worldwide, it has carried with it xenophobia — and Asian communities around the world are finding themselves subject to suspicion and fear.  Chinese in Italy have been subjected to abuse since the coronavirus outbreak (AFP / Tiziana FABI / MANILA BULLETIN) When a patient on Australia’s Gold Coast refused to shake the hand of her surgeon Rhea Liang, citing the virus that has killed hundreds, the medic’s first response was shock. But after tweeting about the incident and receiving a flood of responses, the respected doctor learned her experience was all too common. There has been a spike in reports of anti-Chinese rhetoric directed at people of Asian origin, regardless of whether they have ever visited the center of the epidemic or been in contact with the virus. Chinese tourists have reportedly been spat at in the Italian city of Venice, a family in Turin was accused of carrying the disease, and mothers in Milan have used social media to call for children to be kept away from Chinese classmates. In Canada, a white man was filmed telling a Chinese-Canadian woman “you dropped your coronavirus” in the parking lot of a local mall. In Malaysia, a petition to “bar Chinese people from entering our beloved country” received almost 500,000 signatures in one week. The incidents are part of what the Australasian College for Emergency Medicine has described as “misinformation” which it says is fuelling “racial profiling” where “deeply distressing assumptions are being made about ‘Chinese’ or ‘Asian-looking’ people.” Typhoid Marys Disease has long been accompanied by suspicions of foreigners — from Irish immigrants being targeted in the Typhoid Mary panic of 1900s America to Nepali peacekeepers being accused of bringing cholera to earthquake-struck Haiti in the last decade. “It’s a common phenomenon,” said Rob Grenfell, director of health and biosecurity for Australia’s science and research agency CSIRO. “With outbreaks and epidemics along human history, we’ve always tried to vilify certain subsets of the population,” he said, comparing the behavior to 1300s plague-ridden medieval Europe, where foreigners and religious groups were often blamed. “Sure it emerged in China,” he said of the coronavirus, “but that’s no reason to actually vilify Chinese people.”
In a commentary for the British Medical Journal, doctor Abraar Karan warned this behavior could discourage people with symptoms from coming forward. Claire Hooker, a health lecturer at the University of Sydney, said the responses from governments may have compounded prejudice. The World Health Organization has warned against “measures that unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade”, but this has not stopped scores of countries from introducing travel bans. The tiny Pacific nation of Micronesia has banned its citizens from visiting mainland China altogether. “Travel bans respond largely to people’s fears,” said Hooker, and while sometimes warranted, they often “have the effect of cementing an association between Chinese people and scary viruses.” Abbey Shi, a Shanghai-born student in Sydney, said the attitude shown by some of her peers has “become almost an attack on students who are Chinese.” While Australia’s conservative government has banished its citizens returning from Wuhan — the central Chinese city at the epicenter of the virus — to a remote island for quarantine, thousands of students still stuck in China risk their studies being torpedoed. “Right now it looks like they have to miss the semester’s start and potentially the whole year, because of the way the courses are set up,” Shi said. According to Hooker, studies in Toronto on the impact of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS — another global coronavirus outbreak in 2002 — showed the impact of xenophobic sentiment often lasted much longer than the public health scare. “While there may be a cessation of direct forms of racism as news about the disease dies down, it takes quite a bit of time for economic recovery and people continue to feel unsafe,” she said. People may not rush back to Chinese businesses or restaurants, and may even heed some of the more outlandish viral social media disinformation — such as one popular post imploring people to avoid eating noodles for their own safety. “In one sense you might think the effects lasted from the last coronavirus to this one, because the representation as China being a place where diseases come from has been persistent,” Hooker said.

House of the Representatives (Manila Bulletin File Photo) AAMBIS-OWA party-list Rep. Sharon Garin, chairman of the House committee on economic affairs, assured the public that the Lower Chamber is also seeking to address the impact of the Wuhan coronavirus on the country’s economic landscape. “We will conduct the meeting on Tuesday or Wednesday next week,” she told reporters in a press conference. She said those expected to be invited are officials from the Department of Tourism (DOT), Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), and National Economic Development Authority (NEDA), as well as local government units (LGUs). House Speaker Alan Peter Cayetano earlier directed the Garin panel and the House committee on tourism chaired by Laguna Rep. Sol Aragones to start working with the DOT to assess the short- and medium-term effects of the 2019 nCov. Garin said the Wuhan coronavirus does has an economic impact and that concerned government agencies should come up with contingency plans. “In terms of economy, our tourism will be greatly affected,” she said, citing that 20 percent of the total number of tourists are Chinese. “Our tourism is about 13 percent of the GDP and the contribution of the Chinese tourists is actually 2.2 percent of the GDP. As mentioned by Speaker, we have to have contingencies, what do we do to address the possible effect on our tourism industry.” DOT records showed that 1.63 million of the 7.4 million international tourist arrivals from January to November 2019 were Chinese. “We are trying to set a meeting as soon as possible, latest would be next week. We will try to invite those who are concerned,” Garin said. She said government’s imposition of the temporary travel ban from Hubei, China and other provinces of China that are seriously affected by the dreaded 2019-nCov will affect the economic growth rate of the Philippines. She pointed to the need to put in place “more permanent and effective” safeguards, saying that banning flights is not probably the best solution in the long run. “This will substantially affect our economy. This is a problem not only of China but also the rest of the world, not only in the health side, but also the economic side,” she said. “It will have a big effect on the economy. We need to review what are the possible alternatives we can do so we can maintain the very outstanding growth rate of the Philippines in terms of the economy.” READ MORE: China’s virus death toll spikes, more than SARS Tags: ncov"

Medical workers hold a strike outside the Hospital Authority as they demand for Hong Kong to close its border with China to reduce the coronavirus spreading, in Hong Kong, China February 4, 2020. (REUTERS/Tyrone Siu / MANILA BULLETIN) China’s currency and stock markets steadied in choppy trade after anxiety over the virus hit the yuan on Monday and erased about $400 billion in market value from Shanghai’s benchmark index. Macau, the world’s biggest gambling hub, said it had asked all casino operators to suspend operations for two weeks to help curb the spread of the virus. In another announcement that will compound worries about the economic impact, Hyundai Motor (005380.KS) said it would gradually suspend production at its South Korean factories because of supply chain disruptions from the outbreak. The Hong Kong death took to 427 the toll from the virus, including a man who died in the Philippines last week after visiting Wuhan, the central Chinese city at the epicenter of the outbreak. Chinese authorities said the toll in China rose by a record 64 from the previous day to 425, mostly in Hubei, the virtually locked down province whose capital is Wuhan. New cases were reported in the United States, including a patient in California infected through close contact with someone in the same household who had been infected in China. It was the second instance of person-to-person spread in the United States after a case reported last week in Illinois. “We expect to see more cases of person-to-person spread,” said Dr Nancy Messonnier, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The total number of infections in China rose by 3,235 to 20,438, and there were at least 151 cases in 23 other countries and regions. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the flu-like virus a global emergency and experts say much is still unknown about the pathogen, including its mortality rate and transmission routes. Such uncertainties have spurred extreme measures by some countries to stem the spread. Australia sent hundreds of evacuees from Wuhan to a remote island in the Indian Ocean, while Japan ordered the quarantine of a cruise ship with more than 3,000 aboard after a Hong Kong man who sailed on it last month tested positive for the virus.

Department of Health (DOH) Secretary Francisco Duque III disclosed this on Tuesday during the Senate health and demography committee’s initial investigation into the Philippine government’s response to the novel coronavirus (nCoV).  Department of Health Secretary Francisco Duque III (CZAR DANCEL / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN) “The President has approved in principle the budget of P2.25-billion for the procurement of personnel protective equipment (PPE) in the assumption that 5,000 healthcare workers will need this,” Duque told the panel chaired by Sen. Christopher “Bong” Go. The health secretary said the face masks are essential to the health workers as they have to go on duty round-the-clock at this time in their effort to combat nCoV. “This is going to be on the assumption that these will last for 90 days or three months and multiplied by three shifts, because the care has to be round the clock and the total amount would be P2.25 billion, plus of course P10 million for surgical masks,” Duque added. Each set of PPE includes headgear, goggles, N95 masks, gloves, apron, and gowns, and costs around P1,500. On the same day, Duque said the President reassured the public with transparency that the Philippine government is capable of addressing the nCoV. “This is not the first time, we have been besieged by a similar coronavirus in 2002 and 2003, as well as the MersCOV in 2014 and 2015,” he pointed out. “It is very important that we should be able to heighten all the interventions needed to respond to mount an effective response to these emerging infectious diseases.” The country now has two confirmed cases of the nCoV. The second person, a companion of a Chinese woman who was the first to be confirmed having the coronavirus, is the first fatality outside of China. According to the DOH, 80 suspected cases have been recorded, but 30 of them have tested negative for the virus. READ MORE: PH reports 1st coronavirus death In his opening statement, Go maintained that the government acted swiftly to contain the nCoV despite the late imposition of a travel ban on visitors from mainland China. “Since Day 1, the whole Duterte administration has said that they have been on top of the situation and are doing everything they can to address the issue. The President, and even a key official from the World Health Organization (WHO), has commended the efforts of this government in responding to this worldwide health concern,” Go said.

Despite this, the government imposed the temporary travel ban as an additional precautionary measure to protect the people in our country,” he added. Go also emphasized that the government should not be singling out Chinese nationals in its effort to address the issue. “We empathize with China given what they are going through, but we are putting these precautionary measures in place to protect the country and its people. “As part of a community, the Philippine government should be committed to assist other affected countries address this worldwide health concern,” Go said.

,"February 10, 2020, 1:08 PM",nCov,PH economy likely to ride out nCoV outbreak,By Vanne Elaine Terrazola ,"By Vanne Elaine Terrazola  The Philippine economy will be able withstand the impact of the novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV), Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez said Tuesday.  Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III(Facebook / File Photo / MANILA BULLETIN) While admitting that it was “too early” to assess the economic impacts of the new Coronavirus strain, Dominguez, in a Senate hearing, said they continue to believe that the economy will meet their gross domestic product (GDP) growth goal for this year. “It is reasonable to expect that while these developments might slightly strain our economic expansion, these threats are not enough to cause dramatic reduction in our growth estimates. We are standing by our working projection of the GDP (gross domestic product) rate between 6.5 percent and 7.5 percent for 2020,” he told members of the Senate health committee. But a “significant impact” on the economy would involve the country’s tourism sector. “The travel and tourism sector around the globe is taking a hit as result of the various levels of travel bans imposed by natl governments and voluntary decision of airlines to stop flights to and from China,” Dominguez said. With the 2019-nCoV outbreak is still at its early stage, Dominguez said the government may look to the negative effects of previous global epidemic. He cited for instance the outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, which caused a 1.3-percent drop in tourist arrivals, particularly from 1.93 million arrivals recorded in 2002, to 1.9 million in 2003. But the effect of the disease did not last long as tourist arrivals “rebounded quickly” in 2004 by 20.1 percent or 2.3 million, Dominguez said. The tourism sector continued to grow until the discovery and spread of the new the influenza A (H1N1) virus in 2009, which again resulted in a decline in arrivals, but only aggravated by the financial crisis that gripped world economies, he pointed out. He said the Philippine tourism likewise remained “resilient” during the spread of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV. According to Dominguez, tourism direct gross value added, or the contribution of the tourism industry to economy, had “rapidly increased” over the past years, due to the spike in arrivals from China. The Finance chief said he expects this to be affected by the travel restrictions implemented by the government amid the 2019-nCoV outbreak. Despite this, Dominguez said he sees growth in domestic tourism as Filipinos are expected to travel to local destinations, especially those who have postponed international travels. The Department of Tourism (DOT) will also intensify its promotion of domestic destinations for local travelers, he said. Meanwhile, the lockdown currently being implemented in Wuhan, China, is expected to also have an effect on Philippine trade and industry. Wuhan, the epicenter of the 2019-nCoV outbreak, is considered as China’s transport hub, and “China has been Philippines’ stock trade partner,” Dominguez said. READ MORE: China’s virus death toll spikes, more than SARS He said more than half of the country’s exports to China last year were shipments of electronic parts. “In the immediate term, the temporary closure of factories and disruption of global supply chain may cause temporary, slight decline of exports, particularly electronic and auto parts,” he told senators. “Incidentally, out top imports from China such as steel, machinery and petroleum, are products that do not seem to carry nCOv,” he, on the other hand, said. Dominguez said the DOF will continue to monitor development relating to the 2019-nCoV, and its impacts to the country. READ MORE: PH reports 1st coronavirus death Tags: ncov"

Palmiery said 15,000 HSWs with new contracts from their employers in Hong Kong only have two to three weeks to fly to Hong Kong to start their work. Labor Secretary Silvestre Bello III had earlier ordered the Overseas Workers Welfare Administration to give monetary assistance and accommodations to the stranded workers until the ban is lifted and flights are resumed by major carriers Philippine Airlines and Cebu Pacific. However, recruitment consultant Emmanuel Geslani said workers have complained that they only want to go to the jobs waiting for them in Hong Kong and Macau. “The 250,000 Filipino domestic helpers in Hong Kong and Macau are very much worried about losing their jobs if the Philippine government stops them from returning to their jobs in Hong Kong and Macau over a travel ban imposed on all Filipinos traveling to the two Special Administrative Regions (SARs) of China because of the novel coronavirus now spreading to all of Asia and in some parts of the world,” he said. “The vacationing Filipino workers have only two weeks’ worth of vacation leave from their employers and the government should issue an exemption for them to return to their jobs or lose it if the government insists on banning the travel of all Filipinos to China and the two SARs,” added Geslani. In Hong Kong where there are about over 200,000 Filipino domestic workers, majority have expressed that they would not go back to the Philippines due to the new travel ban. “This is similar to a survey conducted in Hong Kong last year at the height of the government protests wherein 95 percent of Filipinos would not return to the country despite the call of Labor Secretary Silvestre Bello III to come home because of the violent protests in the city,” he said. Around 300 OFWs, mostly bound for Hong Kong and Macau, were stranded in the airports on Monday following the travel ban imposed by President Duterte over the weekend due to the threat of the 2019-nCoV ARD.

MMDA General Manager Jojo Garcia (Facebook) MMDA general manager Jojo Garcia in an interview over CNN’s The Source hosted by Pinky Webb said: “I think Quezon City, Parañaque, Pasig they have, meron na silang exercise na nangyayari (…they are already conducting preparedness exercises),” said when asked to enumerate cities he thinks are prepared to handle nCoV ARD. During the interview, Garcia was shown clips of the preparations made by Quezon City and Pasig to deal with the threat posed by the fatal communicable disease. A clip of a simulation of how health workers will respond to a report of possible nCoV ARD infection at one of the residences in QC was shown. Garcia said: “So in case makakuha sila ng positive, they know how to handle patients,” explaining the reason behind the simulation. The MMDA official also told the host that the responding health workers should already be wearing protective gear when responding to such a situation. “That’s one of the advice of DOH sabi nga nila ang problema natin mga health workers e. Kasi baka maging victims din sila. So sabi naman ng DOH pagka-ano they have the N95 mask. And then let’s now give panic don sa tao, sa mga citizen natin sa Metro Manila. Baka masyadong magpanic,” Garcia said. (…as they said our problem lies with the health workers. Because it’s possible that they too will become infected. The DOH told us that they should be wearing N95 masks. As far as the public is concerned let’s not cause panic among Metro Manila citizens. They might really panic.) Regarding the role of the MMDA in preventing the spread of the disease, Garcia said: “First kase ang MMDA one of our tasks is our chairman will be the head of MMDRRMC, Metro Manila disaster risk management. So our first move, nitong medyo pumutok na itong ating nCoV is to call on all the DRRMC representatives, all LGUs and of then the national government of course: DOH, DILG, DOTr so that they will know how (what) to do. Paano natin gagawin if ever may virus na nakarating na sa mga LGUs, how prepared are them (they). So we had that meeting yesterday (Monday) so they asked, first they had the DOH representative had some powerpoint what to do, how to do it. So far naman the way we see it ang LGUs is naka-ready naman.” (First, the MMDA’s task, its chairman will be the head of MMDRRMC, Metro Manila disaster risk management. So our firs move, when nCoV reached the country is to call on the DRRMC representatives, the LGUs…. What will we do if the virus reaches the LGUs, how prepared are they. So far, the way we see it the LGUs seem prepared to handle it)
Garcia like other officials also made the appeal to the public to refrain from using mask if one is really not in dire need of it. “Yung mask sabi nga nila you don’t really need the mask. Pero of course if you’re in a crowded place like MRT, bus or something crowded you need really the mask to protect yourself, not only from the virus. Sabi ko nga an ordinary cold or cough talagang nakakahawa yan e kahit wala pang coronavirus e,” he said. (The mask, the DOH already said you don’t really need the mask. But of course if you’re in a crowded place like MRT, bus or something crowded…. As I’ve said even an ordinary cold or cough it is also communicable with or without the coronavirus.) Tags: ncov"

Department of Health Secretary Francisco Duque III (CZAR DANCEL / MANILA BULLETIN) In a television interview with CNN Philippines Tuesday, Health Secretary Francisco Duque said the cremation of the Chinese man’s body kept being delayed because the funeral service providers they talked to backed out. “It’s very unfortunate they’re backing out, and these are Chinese as well, so I don’t understand,” Duque said. The health secretary said the cremation was supposed to be done Tuesday, but he will still check whether the provider has not “changed his mind.” “We’ve been struggling. There were many groups who initially said they will cremate, they will bury in a Chinese cemetery only to find out that they changed their minds and did not want to cremate anymore,” Duque said. Duque then appealed to the Chinese community to help in processing the cremation of the 44-year-old man, and future cases if there will be any. “They should help in this case or in future cases. If they have cemeteries or cremation facilities, they should help, not discriminate,” he said. When asked if the DOH designated a group to process the burial of nCoV patients who would die, Duque said: “Wala pa (We haven’t yet), because we are still hopeful that this fatality ratio will remain lower than it already is,” ‘Would a dead nCoV patient still be infectious?’ The DOH said it is still unknown whether the 2019-nCoV ARD will be “inactivated” once the person who acquired it dies. “Normally, the microorganism also dies with the mortal, but how long will it survive? This is a new virus that not much is really known and is just evolving, that’s why it’s very difficult to say for sure,” Duque said. If the virus dies, the question of “how long after the person dies?” remains, Duque said. Read more: First 2019-nCoV ARD fatality to be cremated — Duque Tags: ncov"

He noted each barangay must be adequately informed about the disease and prepared to adopt protocols in containing it. In DILG Memorandum Circular 2020-018, Año said that BHERTs should visit the home of arriving passengers from a coronavirus-infected country within the locality. They will then list down the names of persons that the suspect has had contact with or without a copy of the list of arrivals from the Bureau of Immigration (BI). The BHERTs shall also require newly-arrived passengers in their localities to record daily body temperature in the morning and afternoon, for the next 14 days of home confinement, and observe possible coronavirus symptoms. The DILG chief said the BHERTs would serve as the eyes and ears of the government to ensure that residents within their jurisdiction are all accounted for and are fully informed about the coronavirus.

House of the Representatives (Manila Bulletin File Photo) Rep. Isidro Ungab of Davao City 3rd district said while, they are waiting for the formal budget request from the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) , the disaster funds under the 2020 General Appropriations Act, the available funds of Department of Health (DOH) under this year’s national budget, and the 2019 national budget can be tapped to help strengthen the country’s capability to address the threats of the virus. “The proposed P1- billion can be charged against the 2020 GAA and 2019 GAA with its validity extended. Any expenditure for the nCoV can be charged against available funds of the DOH. If funds are exhausted, the DOH and DBM can seek a supplemental budget identifying fund source with a National Treasurer certification,” he told the Manila Bulletin in a text message. “We are willing to act as the soonest time possible, once the Executive Department submits a supplemental budget for this purpose,” Ungab said. He noted that as of the moment, there’s no certification yet from the National Treasurer. When asked if a supplemental bill should have been filed, the House leader said, “I’m still thinking about it. The book [Constitution and the Administrative Code] says a supplemental budget must be supported by a certification of funds availability by the National Treasurer. We might be shooting blanks.” “It’s not good to pass a budget that is not funded,” he added. He explained that a supplemental budget is usually a proposal coming from DBM with the funds certified by the National Treasurer. Quezon 4th district Rep. Angelina Tan batted on Monday, February 3 for a P1-billion supplemental budget, not just P900 million, in order to give the DOH a buffer fund of P100 million. She cited the need for the government to strengthen the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine or RITM. According to her, RITM, currently, has only 50-beds for patients with infectious diseases requiring tertiary care, seven of which is for patients under investigation (PUIs). “The fear kits or ‘primers’ to identify if a patient is positive for the nCoV is with the RITM,” she said. She said the other DOH offices that should be strengthened are the following: the Disease and Prevention Control Bureau for its logistics and commodities; the Epidemiology Bureau for its surveillance; the Health Facility Development Bureau for its health facility preparedness, the Health Emergency Management Bureau for its quick response; the Bureau of Quarantine; the Health Promotion and Communications Service.

I am urging visitors to avoid crowded places, particularly busy tourist areas,” Bendico said over Church-run Radio Veritas. As a precautionary measure, the city government, earlier, cancelled the opening of the Panagbenga Festival, which attracts thousands of local and foreign tourists. “Baguio and Benguet nowadays are concerned about the health and safety of their residents,” the prelate said. The Department of Health has confirmed two cases of NCOV in the country, both Chinese tourists from Wuhan, China, one of them has died due to complications. Several others are still considered as persons under investigation. Bishop Bendico urges individuals to go to the nearest hospital when experiencing symptoms of the viral disease. “Let us take care of our health. Baguio’s climate is cold, in fact, much colder now during the month of February, so it is easy to get sick. Seek medical attention immediately when experiencing the symptoms of NCOV,” he said.

Medical workers hold a strike outside the Hospital Authority as they demand for Hong Kong to close its border with China to reduce the coronavirus spreading, in Hong Kong, China February 4, 2020. (REUTERS/Tyrone Siu / MANILA BULLETIN) The death of the 39-year-old man in Hong Kong came as the semi-autonomous city closed all but two land crossings with the Chinese mainland to slow the spread of the virus. On Sunday the Philippines reported the death of a Chinese man who had come from Wuhan, the central city at the epicenter of China’s health emergency. The virus has so far spread to more than 20 countries, prompting the World health Organization to declare a global health emergency, several governments to institute travel restrictions and airlines to suspend flights to and from China. A South Korean woman has tested positive for coronavirus after visiting Thailand, South Korean officials said on Tuesday, the first foreign tourist reported to have been infected after a visit to the Southeast Asian nation. The 42-year-old, identified only as Patient 16, flew back to South Korea on Jan. 19 after traveling in Thailand, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) said in a statement. Treated since developing chills and other symptoms from Jan 25, she did not improve until Sunday, the KCDC added, and was confirmed positive on Tuesday, following checks at Chonnam National University Hospital. Beijing is stepping up diplomatic efforts to reassure countries around the world it can control the coronavirus outbreak that has killed more than 420 people so far, seeking to prevent more travel bans placed against travelers from China. Chinese state councilor Wang Yi spoke with foreign ministers of seven countries, including Germany, Malaysia, Sudan, and Saudi Arabia, and reiterated that China was confident of being able to control the outbreak and spoke out against any travel curbs. China on Tuesday reported 64 more fatalities — a single-day high — from the new coronavirus, raising the toll to 425, with more than 20,000 infections across the country. With more than 20,400 confirmed infections, the mortality rate for the new coronavirus is much lower than the 9.6 percent rate for SARS. Hong Kong media said the man who died had underlying health issues that complicated his treatment. He had visited Wuhan last month. China has struggled to contain the virus despite enacting unprecedented measures, including locking down more than 50 million people in Hubei province where the outbreak emerged. Restrictions have also been imposed far from the epicenter. The city of Taizhou and three Hangzhou districts — including the area home to the main office of Chinese tech giant Alibaba — will allow only one person per household to go outside every two days to buy necessities, city officials said, measures that will affect nine million people. Another city in Zhejiang province, nine-million-strong Wenzhou, enacted the same measure at the weekend. ‘Everything is well’ President Duterte said there was no need for the public to be hysterical about the confirmed cases of the dreaded 2019-nCoV ARD in the country, expressing his belief that the virus will “die on its own.” He said the government may take over private buildings and convert them into hospitals if the new coronavirus infects more people in the country. The President said the government could install medical equipment in the confiscated property to provide care to patients “in times of emergency.” In a press briefing after an emergency meeting to discuss recent developments regarding the virus, President Duterte said having two confirmed cases was not something that should alarm the public. “Everything is well in the country. There’s nothing really to be extra scared of that coronavirus thing. Although it has affected a lot of countries–but, you know, one or two in a country is not really that fearsome,” he said. “This coronavirus is scaring people all over. The response of the people from the initial reports of the coronavirus was almost hysterical when there was really no need for it, actually,” he said. “If there is really a virus going around, why do you have to be hysterical? Why don’t you just go to the hospital and have yourself treated?” He also said that the government will consider the World Health Organization’s (WHO) position before it expands the travel ban to travelers from other countries with cases of coronavirus,. The President expressed confidence in Department of Health (DOH) Secretary Francisco Duque III in managing the latest public health emergency, saying he is a “very hardworking” and a “really good” health secretary. “We have a very hardworking Secretary of Health. And he’s very sincere in his job. This is not the second time that he has entered government.  In another President, he also was a Secretary of Health. I got him because he is just really good,” Duterte said. Duterte is also not keen on limiting his public engagements despite the threat of coronavirus and said he was leaving his mortality to fate. “When my time comes, it will come. When the time comes, you will know because I will go out of Malacañang in a funeral car,” he said.

Trade Secretary Ramon Lopez said the government could make available two million face masks per month.

READ MORE: Duterte says new face mask supplies coming in Cocktail for nCov ARD probably ‘anecdotal’  The DOH said on Monday “there is still no hard science” to prove that the combination of anti-virals which the doctors in Thailand earlier administered to a Chinese woman who was infected with nCoV is effective in treating any coronavirus – including the 2019-nCoV. The Health Ministry Thailand had earlier said said that a Chinese woman who was infected with nCoV has shown improvement after she was administered with a cocktail of anti-virals. Duque said that what the Thai doctors used was a combination of anti-virals — particularly the ozeltamivir which has been proven for influenza A virus. The doctors reportedly combined it with lopinavir and ritonavir which are used for the treatment of HIV patients. “If they say that there seems to be an improvement after 48 hours, that is probably anecdotal because you have to remember that there are 80 percent of cases in China that is considered mild and so, the possibility that they are recovering very quickly is very high,” Duque said. READ MORE: Thailand’s cocktail not scientific cure for virus — WHO ‘Shortcomings and difficulties’  China’s Communist leadership made a rare admission of fallibility on Monday as it acknowledged ”shortcoming and difficulties exposed in the response to the epidemic.” The Politburo Standing Committee called for improvements to the ”national emergency management system” at the meeting, according to the official Xinhua news agency. ”It is necessary to strengthen market supervision, resolutely ban and severely crack down on illegal wildlife markets and trade,” the Politburo said. The government also said it ”urgently” needed protective medical equipment such as surgical masks, protective suits, and safety goggles as it battles to control the outbreak. Economic woes  Global fears about the virus have risen, with cruise lines worldwide expected to deny boarding to passengers and crew who have recently travelled to China. Japan has quarantined a cruise ship carrying 3,711 people and was testing those on board for the new coronavirus Tuesday after a former passenger was diagnosed with the illness in Hong Kong. The virus is also taking an increasing economic toll, shutting down businesses, curbing international travel and impacting production lines of major global brands. The government extended the Lunar New Year holiday by three days in an effort to keep people indoors. But many provinces and major cities — including Shanghai — have called on companies to remain closed for an extra week. Schools and universities have delayed the start of new terms. The Shanghai stock market plunged almost eight percent on Monday on the first day of trading since the holiday, but shares were on the rise by midday on Tuesday.

A man wears a face mask as he practices calligraphy of Chinese characters on a pavement as the country is hit by an outbreak of the novel coronavirus in Jiujiang, Jiangxi province, China, February 3, 2020. (REUTERS/Thomas Peter TPX IMAGES OF THE DAY / MANILA BULLETIN) In central China’s Hubei province, epicenter of the epidemic, China state TV reported there were 2,345 new cases of the virus and another 64 deaths, bringing the total of virus-related fatalities in Hubei to 414 by Monday. The Chinese stock market plunged about 8% on Monday, wiping $393 billion off the value of the Shanghai bourse, on the first day of trading following an extended Lunar New Year holiday in a bid to help keep people at home and contain the virus’ spread. The White House said on Monday China had accepted its offer to have U.S. experts as part of a WHO mission to study and help combat the virus that emerged in Hubei’s provincial capital of Wuhan. A 1,000-bed hospital built in eight days to treat people with the virus in Wuhan was due to receive its first patients on Monday, state media said. A second hospital with 1,600 beds is due to be operational later this week.
With Wuhan and some other Chinese cities in virtual lockdown, travel severely restricted and China facing increasing international isolation, fears of wider economic disruption are growing. Sources at the OPEC oil cartel told Reuters producers were considering cutting output by almost a third to support prices. The WHO last week declared the flu-like virus a global emergency. It has spread to 23 other countries and regions. The Philippines reported the first coronavirus death outside of China. Airlines around the world have stopped flights to parts of China. A suspension by the United Arab Emirates on Monday will affect the Gulf airlines Etihad and Emirates. Earlier on Monday, China accused the United States of spreading fear by pulling its citizens out and severely restricting travel. Washington has “unceasingly manufactured and spread panic,” Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told reporters, noting that the WHO had advised against trade and travel curbs. “It is precisely developed countries like the United States with strong epidemic prevention capabilities and facilities that have taken the lead in imposing excessive restrictions contrary to WHO recommendations,” she said. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defended the measures taken by the United States, including suspending the entry of foreign nationals who had visited China within the past 14 days. “We made an aggressive decision in front of an unprecedented threat that action now had the biggest potential to slow this thing down. That’s what the theory is here,” said Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, as she noted that there are already some 17,000 cases of a virus for which the population does not have immunity. ‘NO REASON’ FOR TRAVEL CURBS The WHO’s director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, again said travel bans were unnecessary. “There is no reason for measures that unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade,” he told the WHO’s executive board in Geneva. “The chance of getting this (virus) going to anywhere outside China is very low, and even in China when you go to other provinces, it’s very low,” he added. The outbreak is reminiscent of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), a virus from the same family that emerged in China in 2002 and killed almost 800 people around the world out of the roughly 8,000 who were infected. Chinese data suggests the new virus, while much more contagious than SARS, is significantly less lethal, although such numbers can evolve rapidly. Prior to the latest figures from Hubei, the number of confirmed infections in China stood at 17,205. The WHO said at least 151 cases had been confirmed in 23 other countries and regions, including Japan, Thailand, Germany, Britain and the United States, which on Monday reported its second case of person-to-person transmission within its borders. Chinese President Xi Jinping said controlling the virus was his country’s most important task, Xinhua state news agency said. In addition to Monday’s Chinese stock selloff, the yuan currency had its worst day since August, and Shanghai-traded commodities from oil to copper hit their lower limits – all despite the central bank’s injection of 1.2 trillion yuan ($174 billion) into money markets. The selloff did not extend to U.S. markets, which closed higher on Monday with the S&P 500 up 0.7%. Fears over the effect of China’s lockdown on global growth have slashed more than 22% off the price of the Brent global crude oil benchmark since its recent peak on Jan. 8.. Economists are predicting world economic output will be cut by 0.2 to 0.3 percentage point. ‘YOU HAVE BEEN SPOTTED’ Taiwan’s Foxconn, which makes smartphones for Apple and other brands, has halted “almost all” of its production in China after companies were told to shut until at least Feb. 10, a source said. The company did not respond to a request for comment. Countries continued to evacuate their citizens from Wuhan. The United States, which flew nearly 200 people out last week, is planning “a handful more flights.” Russia was due to start evacuating its citizens on Monday, and Canada said 304 of its citizens were seeking to be flown out. Chinese-ruled Hong Kong, rocked by months of anti-China protests, announced the closure of four more border crossings with mainland China, leaving just three open. China’s efforts to contain the virus have taken some unexpected, and some might say unnerving forms. A video clip posted on the microblogging website Weibo showed people playing mahjong in a village near the city of Chengdu being spotted by a camera mounted on a patrolling drone. “Playing mahjong outside is banned during the epidemic!” an official tells the villagers through a loudspeaker. “You have been spotted.” Tags: ncov"

Christopher “Bong” Go asked on Tuesday affected overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) and returning Filipinos from China to abide by the 14-day quarantine protocol that the government imposes to prevent the spread of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Acute Respiratory Disease (2019 n-CoV ARD) in the country.  Senator Christopher “Bong” Go(PRIB Photo by Cesar Tomambo /MANILA BULLETIN FILE PHOTO) Go, Senate health committee chairman, asked them to heed the protocol because that is what the people want and that the government has decided to have a temporary travel ban, and for the Filipino citizens who are coming home, they need to be quarantined. The senator from Davao was reacting to reports that some OFWs were opposed to quarantine policies. ‘’Your health is at stake here. Rest assured that the government and President Duterte prioritize the interest, health and the welfare of all Filipinos,’’ he said. The day before, Go released a statement confirming President Duterte’s decision to expand the temporary travel ban to all flights between the Philippines and China, including its Special Administrative Regions. The Philippine government previously imposed a ban only on flights from and to Hubei Province, where Wuhan City, the place where the 2019-nCoV ARD emerged, is located. The ban covers all travelers and not only Chinese nationals. Filipinos and holders of Permanent Resident Visa, meanwhile, are allowed to return to the country, but they will be subjected to a 14-day quarantine period upon arrival. Go also said that the government would address the complaints of foreigners affected by the ban. “The government has solutions to make. There will be complaints and we cannot avoid it,’’ he added. For OFWs who are in the country for a vacation and need to go back to China to finish their contracts, Go said that the relevant government agencies would assist them. “The Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) will address that issue and, of course, the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) too,” he added. Meanwhile, Go extended help to 73 families, comprising of 255 individuals, affected by a fire that occurred on January 25 after midnight at 2940 Park Avenue Extension in Barangay 79, Zone 10, Pasay City. Aside from the financial assistance and food, Go also offered to pay for the uniforms and school supplies of the affected students and the expenses of those who need to undergo medical operations. The fire victims, who were gathered at the Cuneta Elementary School, also received financial assistance from the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) and the Presidential Commission for the Urban Poor (PCUP). The National Housing Authority (NHA) gave them housing materials assistance and the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) provided livelihood assistance. Go said that the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office (PCSO) and the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation (PAGCOR) would also visit the victims to provide additional assistance. Tags: ncov"

The Q&A covers topics such as what the virus is, how similar or different it is from other viruses, how it spreads, and tips on how to protect oneself. It can be accessed at WHO’s website, https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses. The outbreak of the new virus from China came with an “infodemic,” which WHO defines as “an over-abundance of information—some accurate and some not—that makes it hard for people to find trustworthy sources and reliable guidance when they need it.” Among some of the misinformation circulating online include bat soup videos, quack remedies, vaccine conspiracies, and articles citing pets as the source of the virus, leading to widespread fear and panic. Earlier, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the agency partnered with Google to ensure that the top search results for 2019-nCoV are verified information from WHO. Some social media platforms, including Facebook, Twitter, and Tiktok, have also taken steps to limit the spread of misinformation, he added. The 2019-nCoV outbreak, that WHO already declared as a global health emergency, has claimed the lives of 361 people and infected 17,391 individuals as of writing. In the Philippines, there are 80 persons under investigation although so far, only two tested positive for the virus, the health department said. One of them, a 44-year-old man from Wuhan, China who was confined at the San Lazaro Hospital in Manila, died on Saturday, February 1. His death was the first one to be recorded outside of China. The other patient, a 38-year-old woman, who was the fatality’s companion, is currently in stable condition, the Manila City government confirmed.  Tags: ncov"

Travelers arrive to LAX Tom Bradley International Terminal wearing medical masks for protection against the novel coronavirus outbreak on February 2, 2020 in Los Angeles, California. (David McNew/Getty Images/AFP / MANILA BULLETIN) It came as the number of confirmed US cases rose to 11, including the second confirmed person-to-person transmission inside the country, this one involving a patient in California. China has accused the US of spreading “panic” by banning the entry of foreign nationals who had traveled to the country over the past two weeks and announcing quarantine measures for American citizens. Nancy Messonnier, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), defended the “aggressive” measure. “A couple of weeks ago there were 41 cases in China, this morning the numbers are 17,000 — that is 17,000 cases with a novel coronavirus that the population does not have immunity to,” she said, adding: “We have the opportunity to slow it down before it gets into the United States.” China’s foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said during a briefing the US had failed to provide “any substantial assistance,” a claim that Messonnier denied. “We at CDC have incredibly strong scientists who have a lot of technical experience in really similar diseases… and our presence on the ground in China will be a help,” she said. “What I’ve seen is that in situations like this, science should trump everything else.” There are currently 195 Americans including diplomats and their families in quarantine at a military base in California after being evacuated last week from Wuhan, the city at the center of the epidemic, and more such flights were planned, said Messonnier. “Over the weekend, CDC sent four additional teams to specific Department of Defense locations where those planes will arrive,” she said. Speaking to reporters earlier in Taskhent, Uzbekistan, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the timing of the flights was being coordinated with China and would happen “in the next handful of days” while flights from other countries were being considered too. Messonnier said the 11 US patients had varying degrees of illness — some “pretty mild,” others more severe and requiring oxygen. Last week the US declared a public health emergency over the pathogen, which has killed more than 360 people and spread globally. American citizens returning from Hubei province are to be placed in quarantine, while those returning from other parts of China will be put in monitored home isolation if asymptomatic. All will be funneled through 11 major airports. The ban on foreign nationals who have traveled to China in the past two weeks exempts Hong Kong and Macau.   Tags: ncov"

(REUTERS/Toby Melville/File Photo / MANILA BULLETIN) The UK government also pledged £20 million ($26 million, 24 million euros) in funding for research at the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) — a group formed at the in Davos in 2017 — and released its sequencing data for the viral genome. GSK said its work will complement the four projects already being funded through CEPI to develop a vaccine for the deadly China strain. “Our (vaccine) adjuvant technology has previously been used successfully in the pandemic flu setting,” GSK Vaccine chief medical officer Thomas Breuer said in a statement. Adjuvants are agents that boost a body’s response to vaccines or other treatments. The World Health Organization has declared a global virus emergency but refrained from calling the new epidemic a “pandemic”. That term is reserved for a disease that spreads across multiple continents or worldwide. CEPI was originally formed in response to the Ebola epidemic that killed more than 11,300 people of the 29,000 recorded cases in West Africa from 2013 to 2016. “Our hope is that, with our partners, we can get an investigational vaccine from gene sequencing of the pathogen through to clinical testing in 16 weeks,” CEPI chief executive Richard Hatchett said. CEPI’s four other projects aimed at stamping out the new strain include a partnership between the US biotech company Moderna and the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. GSK said it will initially be joining the work already being performed by the University of Queensland in Australia. The other two projects involve the German biopharmaceutical company CureVac and the US-based Inovio pharmaceuticals firm. UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock said Public Health England has been able to sequence the genome from the two cases of new viral strain recorded in Britain. “Their findings suggest the virus has not evolved in the last month,” Hancock told parliament. China shared its genome sequencing data on January 10. Hancock said health ministers from Group of Seven (G7) nations spoke by telephone Monday to coordinate their response. “It is clear that the virus will be with us at least some months to come,” the British health minister said.   Tags: ncov"

The evacuees, mostly students, landed Sunday and will be quarantined for 14 days on Natuna island, which lies between Borneo and Peninsular Malaysia. “The government’s decision to quarantine Indonesians who returned from China has made people feel uneasy, so we strongly reject it,” Fadillah, one of the protesters who like many Indonesians goes with one name, told AFP. The protesters, wearing green surgical masks, demonstrated in front of the local parliament building, demanding the local authorities relocate the evacuation center away from a residential area. “Whatever the reason and the explanation, we don’t believe it. We believe this virus is very dangerous for people in Natuna,” Fadillah said. In response to the growing protest on the island, President Joko Widodo said the returnees had to be quarantined to ensure they were in good health before they can return home. “Those people are healthy, however, several stages are needed in health protocol before they can be returned to their family,” Widodo said. Following the evacuees’ arrival on Natuna, the local government has shut down schools for two weeks and urged students to limit outdoor activities. The coronavirus epidemic has infected more than 17,000 people across China and reached 24 nations, although Indonesia has not reported any confirmed cases so far. Tags: ncov"

Senator Grace Poe(ROY DOMINGO / MANILA BULLETIN) Poe, in a statement, urged the Philippine government to issue daily official bulletins containing the latest information about the 2019-nCoV which has already affected thousands in several countries. “Up-to-date, transparent, and correct information about the nCoV virus is vital,” she said. The senator said a massive information campaign should be sustained to make the public aware on how to prevent being infected by the virus, or when to undergo quarantine, where to go for check-up, and what to do in case one has contact with a suspected case. “This can be through brochures, comics, electronic billboards, or online, among others,” she suggested.

It also lists other countries with confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV ARD. There are currently 24 countries affected by the new coronavirus strain. As of 7 a.m. of February 4, the WHO dashboard indicated that there are a total of 17, 238 cases in China. Internationally, as of February 3, there are 17,391 confirmed cases. It was reported that the 2019-nCoV ARD originated in China’s Wuhan City, allegedly from a wet market that sells exotic meat and live animals. Health authorities said the 2019-nCov ARD spreads through aerial droplets, or when an infected person coughs or sneezes. The WHO appealed to the public to avoid close contact with persons who have respiratory infections, and to frequently wash hands.

,"February 10, 2020, 1:05 PM",nCov,Sub-standard mask donations hamper China virus response: Red Cross,By Agence France-Presse,"  By Agence France-Presse The Red Cross on Monday stressed the need to ensure that all masks used in Chinese hospitals fighting the novel coronavirus outbreak are high quality, warning that donating sub-standard gear was more problematic than helpful. China has acknowledged that it “urgently” needs medical supplies, including surgical masks, to battle the outbreak which has killed more than 360 people in the country and infected more than 17,000. “At the moment, the supply has been heavily stressed,” said Jagan Chapagain, the new secretary-general of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC). He meanwhile rejected harsh criticism lobbed against the local Red Cross chapter in Wuhan — the epicentre of the outbreak — over charges that donations of masks from across China failed to reach hospitals on the frontlines. “Clearly the Wuhan Red Cross hasn’t dealt with this type of situation recently, (and) they had to massively scale up in a short period of time, so to have some shortcomings is not totally unnatural,” he said. But he said he supported the chapter’s “deliberate” decision to withhold a number of the masks donated because they were not safe for use by health professionals who risked exposure to the deadly virus. “Having high-quality masks for the caregivers is extremely important,” the 52-year-old Nepali humanitarian told AFP in an interview Monday, two days after taking the helm of the IFRC. He said frontline medical workers required masks of the so-called N-95 standard, but warned that many of the masks being donated from within China as well as from abroad did not measure up. “They are not good enough for the caregivers,” he said. – ‘Really problematic’ –
Chapagain urged donors to ensure that any medical gear they send is of the required quality, and to “not send stuff that does not meet the standards, (which) creates more problems than help.” He noted that people using the poorer-quality masks could have “a false sense of protection”, while large quantities of such masks cause the “logistics pipeline (to get) congested, the warehouse gets congested”. Already overstretched Red Cross volunteers are left “to sort it out”, Chapagain said. “It is really, really problematic, so everybody who wants to generously donate stuff, please look into the quality that is being asked by the health officials and really stick to that.” Another drag on resources is widespread misinformation about the virus that is creating “unnecessary panic”, he said. “Agencies actually working to address the needs, their resources get diverted to try to address the misinformation,” he said. “To me that is one of the biggest disservices that can happen.” Tags: ncov"
,"February 10, 2020, 1:08 PM",nCov,World Bank calls for global effort against virus,By Agence France-Presse,"By Agence France-Presse The World Bank called on Monday for countries to step up programs to fight the new coronavirus outbreak, and said it was considering mobilizing its own resources against the disease. “We are calling on all countries to strengthen their health surveillance and response systems, which is essential to contain the spread of this and any future outbreaks,” the institution said in a statement. “The World Bank Group is reviewing financial and technical resources that can be mobilized quickly to support affected countries,” and also “closely coordinating with international partners to accelerate the international response.” Since breaking out in China, the virus has killed 425 people in the country, exceeding the 349 dead in the Chinese mainland from the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak of 2002-03, which eventually killed nearly 800 globally. The new virus has infected 17,200 people and spread to more than 20 countries amid fears it could paralyze China and harm the global economy. The World Bank said it was “monitoring the wider economic and social impacts of this crisis,” and would support “China’s efforts to respond, including its efforts to maintain resilience in its economy.” If the epidemic reaches the same severity as the Spanish flu in 1918, which killed 30 million people, it could cost the global economy between one percent and ten percent of growth, World Bank President Jim Yong Kim said at the end of January. International Monetary Fund chief Kristalina Georgieva said last week that negative impacts on the economy in the first half of 2020 were likely but “it would be irresponsible to offer any speculations around what may happen.” Tags: ncov"

The WHO, in its Twitter post, stated that the 2019-nCoV kit was developed as a result of the cooperation between its Operational Support and Logistics (OSL) and technical experts in health operations. WHO stated that the 2019-nCoV kit is similar to treatment kits used for high treatment pathogens in emergencies like cholera and Ebola. “In the coming days, the costing, procurement and assembly of these kits will be a priority,” the report read. The treatment kit is expected to boost the response in dealing with infection especially in China where thousands of cases were already reported. WHO also said that a market survey has already been distributed to over 40 organizations through the Pandemix Supply Chain Network (PCSN). The market survey aims to understand the availability, distribution, and forecasting of crucial response commodities throughout the world. “The Network is exploring operational options among its stakeholders to ensure in particular that critical personal protective equipment is secured and distributed to appropriate locations,” the report read. “Guidance is currently under development for managing the logistics associated with case management, focusing on isolation, triage, and standard treatment centre configuration,” it added.

Filipino health workers are set to receive first the infection prevention and control materials from its regional hub in Dubai. The flight to the Philippines is scheduled on February 4, the Egypt-based WHO-EMRO said in a tweet early Tuesday morning (Philippine time). The medical supplies include masks, gowns, gloves and sanitizers “to support response efforts for up to 6,000 health workers.” Aside from the Philippines, 30 other countries in Asia and the Pacific, as well as those in the Mediterranean region, will be given the medical supplies. The demand for surgical masks all over the world spiked due to the spread of the 2019-nCoV, which has affected 24 countries. In the Philippines, heightened concerns over the new virus resulted in stores running out of face masks, with people lining up for hours to be able to buy them. Local health officials have appealed to the public not to hoard the masks as priority should be given to health workers who are attending to patients with respiratory illnesses. “There is now a current shortage of this valuable commodity and let us give them to those who need them most, especially the health workers,” Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) Director Celia Carlos said in a Palace briefing Monday.

No new country reported a confirmed case of 2019-novel coronavirus acute respiratory syndrome (2019-nCoV ARD) over the past 24 hours, the World Health Organization (WHO) said Monday evening, as thousands more have been recorded in countries with existing cases. WHO said that as of 10 a.m Central European Time or 5 p.m. Philippine time, no new case in other country has been reported. However, more people continued to be infected with nCoV as 2,838 new patients were confirmed in countries with pre-existing cases. Of the latest tally, China recorded the most number, with 2831 new cases and 57 deaths. It was followed by USA, with 3, and Germany, with 2. They add to the 17,391 already confirmed cases around the world since the virus was first reported in December in Wuhan, China. The death toll has reached 362, according to the same WHO report. The Philippines still has no new reported case, although the Department of Health announced in its Monday briefing that 80 patients have been under investigation for showing nCoV ARD symptoms. WHO Director General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the organization “is reaching out to countries who aren’t consistently sharing surveillance information” as required under the 2005 International Health Regulations. “[We are also] asking them to improve the balance between current containment measures and protecting the flow of travel and trade,” he added.

A cruise ship Diamond Princess is seen near Yokohama, Japan, in this photo taken by Kyodo February 3, 2020. Mandatory credit Kyodo/via REUTERS   Television footage showed images of several quarantine officers entering the Diamond Princess cruise ship at the port of Yokohama on Monday evening to check the health of all 2,500 passengers and 1,000 crew members. The move comes after an 80-year-old passenger who disembarked on January 25 in Hong Kong tested positive for the deadly virus. Japan’s top government spokesman Yoshihide Suga said on Monday that Japanese authorities would quarantine the vessel, which arrived at Yokohama Bay a day earlier than originally planned. A woman in her twenties who was sailing with her mother on the ship told private broadcaster TBS on Tuesday that all passengers “were asked to stay in their rooms to wait for virus tests”. She said they had been waiting inside their room since Monday and had no word of when they would be tested as of early Tuesday. After the ship arrived in Yokohama on Monday evening, passengers were told their departure from the area would be delayed by 24 hours, a passenger told Kyodo News agency. The cruise ship has already been quarantined once, on Saturday at a port in Naha in Japan’s southernmost prefecture of Okinawa. But a second quarantine was organized after the man who disembarked in Hong Kong was found to be infected. Since Saturday, Japan has been barring foreign nationals who have been to Hubei in recent weeks, as well as holders of Chinese passports issued in Hubei. Arrivals displaying symptoms of the new virus can also be denied entry. A total of eight foreigners have been barred from entering so far, Suga said on Monday. The health ministry said as of Monday that 20 people in Japan have tested positive for the new virus, of whom four showed no symptoms. Japan has flown more than 500 citizens out of Wuhan, the epicenter of the coronavirus.   Tags: ncov"

,"February 10, 2020, 1:10 PM",nCov,China admits ‘shortcomings’ in virus response,By Agence France-Presse,"  By Agence France-Presse China’s top leadership on Monday admitted “shortcomings and difficulties” in its response to the coronavirus outbreak, as state media said a new hospital built at breakneck pace began receiving patients in the epicentre of the crisis.  AFP/ MANILA BULLETIN Fifty-seven new deaths were confirmed on Monday — the single-biggest daily increase since the virus was detected late last year in the central city of Wuhan. The death toll in China stood at 361, exceeding the 349 mainland fatalities from the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak of 2002-03, which eventually killed nearly 800. The government in Beijing nevertheless hit out at the United States for sparking “panic” with its response to the coronavirus, including a ban on foreigners who have recently been to China. The virus has so far spread to more than 20 countries, and several other nations have instituted similarly tough travel rules. The World Health Organization has declared the crisis a global health emergency, and the first death outside China was confirmed in the Philippines on Sunday. China’s elite Politburo Standing Committee called for improvements to the “national emergency management system” following “shortcoming and difficulties exposed in the response to the epidemic,” according to the official Xinhua news agency. “It is necessary to strengthen market supervision, resolutely ban and severely crack down on illegal wildlife markets and trade,” it added. The government also said it “urgently” needed medical equipment and surgical masks, protective suits, and safety goggles as it battles to control the outbreak. Authorities in provinces that are home to more than 300 million people — including Guangdong, the country’s most populous in south China — have ordered everyone to wear masks in public. But factories capable of producing around 20 million masks a day are only operating at 60-70 percent of capacity, industry department spokesman Tian Yulong said, adding that supply and demand remained in “tight equilibrium” as a result of the Lunar New Year break. Tian said authorities were taking steps to bring in masks from Europe, Japan and the United States, while the foreign ministry said countries including South Korea, Japan, Kazakhstan and Hungary had donated medical supplies. – Hospital open for business –
All but one of the 57 new deaths reported Monday were in Wuhan and the rest of surrounding Hubei province, most of which has been under lockdown for almost two weeks. With 17,200 confirmed infections, the mortality rate for the new coronavirus is around 2.1 percent, compared with 9.6 percent for SARS. In Wuhan, where the virus is believed to have jumped from animals at a market into humans, authorities has been racing to build two new hospitals to treat the infected. The first of those — a 1,000-bed facility — “began to receive” patients Monday, the People’s Daily reported, just 10 days after construction began, but no details were offered about how many. The second hospital is due to open later this week. – Economic woes –
The virus is taking an increasing economic toll, shutting down businesses, curbing international travel and impacting production lines of major global brands. The Shanghai stock market plunged almost eight percent Monday on the first day of trading since the holiday as investors played catch-up with last week’s global retreat. But on Wall Street, stocks rebounded, with the Dow Jones industrial average gaining 0.5 percent. In Wuhan, which has been transformed from a bustling industrial hub into a near-ghost town, residents have been living in deep fear of catching the virus. The city’s medical facilities have been overwhelmed, with Xinhua reporting that 68 medical teams of 8,300 staff had been sent to Hubei. – Travel curbs –
The emergence of the virus coincided with the Lunar New Year, when hundreds of millions travel across the country for family reunions. Originally scheduled to end last Friday, the holiday was extended by three days to give authorities more time to deal with the crisis. But some major cities — including Shanghai — extended it again, and many schools and universities have delayed the start of new terms. Road, train and air traffic were all way down on Sunday, when hundreds of millions of people would have been expected to return to their cities of work, the transport ministry said. Many companies offered staff the option to work from home or defer travel, or simply remained closed. – Stopping the spread –
Many nations have evacuated hundreds of their citizens from China — with some forcing them into quarantine on their return — and more airlines are cancelling services to the mainland. China’s foreign ministry on Monday criticised the United States for being among the first to evacuate nationals without providing “substantial assistance” to China. The US actions had caused “panic”, said spokeswoman Hua Chunying. Mongolia, Russia and Nepal have closed their land borders, while semi-autonomous Hong Kong announced Monday it was closing all but two land crossings. Also on Monday, the Cruise Lines International Association, which represents some of the world’s largest operators, said vessels will deny boarding to passengers and crew who have recently travelled to China.

Duque said they will be asking them to “set aside 20,000 for DOH’s use so that we have ample supply in our hospitals and places that are in bad need of them.” When De Castro asked whether it was really necessary for people who have coughs and colds to wear masks, Duque answered in Filipino: “That is fine too, so as to make sure you don’t spread whatever is causing you to cough.  But our priority is our healthcare workers who are at the forefront and actually dealing with those who are sick and those who are at the infectious disease ward of hospitals as well. “Those are our priority, as well as the elderly who have underlying medical problems.  Those who have diabetes, cancer, asthma, emphysema, we will provide for them, because it would be difficult if we ran out of masks for them, because they are actually the ones who need them most.  This might cause even bigger problems for us in the end.” Duque has time and again appealed to the public to refrain from panic-buying face masks amid the coronavirus scare. In previous interviews, DOH officials have explained that the surgical masks that are now in scant supply do not guarantee protection against the dreaded disease. Tags: ncov"

,"February 10, 2020, 1:10 PM",nCov,China hunts for travelers from virus epicenter,By Agence France-Presse,"By Agence France-Presse BEIJING – Communities in China are offering cash rewards, knocking on doors and questioning people trying to enter their neighborhoods – but they’re not looking for criminals. They’re searching for anyone coming from Wuhan, the central city at the epicenter of a deadly virus epidemic that has sparked fear – even panic –- in China and beyond. The end of the extended Lunar New Year holiday this weekend has raised concerns that the new coronavirus could spread further as people travel across the country. In Beijing, neighborhoods have sealed themselves off – some with homemade barriers – to force visitors or anyone returning home from the holiday to register their travel history. One district in northern Shijiazhuang city is even offering cash incentives of 2,000 yuan ($288) for reporting anyone who has travelled to Wuhan in the past two weeks. For some communities, anyone who has visited central Hubei province – of which Wuhan is the capital – is no longer welcome at all. “Even if you live here, you can’t enter,” said a security guard at the entrance of a Beijing neighborhood when asked about returning Hubei residents. “Those from Hubei could bring the infection here,” he told AFP, wearing a blue mask. “If you’re from Hubei, you have to notify the neighborhood committee.” China has scrambled to contain the epidemic by halting transport from Wuhan, suspending overseas tour groups, cutting long-distance bus routes, and suspending thousands of trains. But the virus has continued to spread, killing more than 360 people and infecting more than 17,000 across the country. Most of those infections – 11,177 – are in Hubei. All but one of the 57 deaths reported on Monday were in the province. Beijing, in comparison, has reported 191 cases. A week ago, China’s health commission urged villages around the country to leave “no blind spots” when investigating where people have travelled. But with the holiday ending on Monday, local governments are under pressure to root out those who have visited the hard-hit province of Hubei. “If they look unfamiliar or are dragging a suitcase, I’ll ask them to register,” said a woman working at a compound in Beijing. “I’m pretty worried,” she added, only offering her surname, Mei.  ‘Bottom-up’ tracking  Though some neighborhoods have taken the extreme stance of blocking visitors or residents from Hubei, many will allow travelers back in – but monitor them stringently over a two-week quarantine period. Once back in their homes, “they cannot go in and out,” explained Xu Aimin, secretary of a neighborhood in Beijing. If they need to buy food, the neighborhood committee can do that for them, she explained. Residents from Hubei province also receive daily phone calls and have their temperature recorded during quarantine, she added. According to Xu, her neighborhood committee – which manages an apartment complex of more than 2,400 households – has knocked on every door to check each residents’ records. “Our information is bottom-up”, she told AFP, adding that they also check travel histories. “We want to let everyone become a source of information,” Xu said. If residents “don’t trust the person next door, they should promptly call (the neighborhood committee)”. The virus has already spread in large numbers across China, despite drastic government lockdown measures in Hubei, highlighting the challenge of countering a pathogen like this. On Sunday, authorities announced lockdown measures for Wenzhou, a city of nine million people that has reported hundreds of infections. Wenzhou is more than 800 kilometers (500 miles) by road from Wuhan.  Wuhan stigma  But the rush to close off neighborhoods to outside visitors could also create a backlash from frustrated residents. It is a concern shared by the Beijing government, which on Saturday reminded community leaders they had “no power” to stop people from entering their neighborhood once they had passed a temperature check. Still, that hasn’t quelled fears about the increased risk of infection from travelers returning home. Gou Hairong, a woman returning to Beijing from Chengdu, southwestern Sichuan province, told AFP on Sunday that she had been barred from her compound. Stranded at the Beijing West railway station, the 24-year-old said her neighborhood had told her she was “not allowed in at all”. “If they really don’t let me back in, I’m prepared to buy another ticket home,” she said. The targeting of people from Wuhan and Hubei province has also raised concern of deepening stigma. “How you see Wuhan is how the world will see China,” wrote one user on Weibo, China’s Twitter-like social media site. Lucy Huang, a documentary maker living in Beijing, said early in the outbreak there was a trend on Weibo of “everyone criticizing Hubei people and Wuhan people”. “As a Wuhan native, I felt very hurt,” the 26-year-old told AFP. “I felt disappointed that people didn’t even have any sympathy.” While Huang said she understood the need for caution, she felt “our enemy has always been the virus itself, and should not be Hubei people or Wuhan people”.   Tags: ncov"

Only Filipinos as well as holders of permanent resident visas from China, and its SARs will be allowed to go back home. Arcilla had said earlier that a repatriation flight would be arranged for them if there will be no flights available. OFWs with permits may travel In the wake of the travel ban, Filipinos with work permits in China and its special administrative regions are exempted from the ban, Philippine Ambassador to China Jose Santiago Sta. Romana told Philippine News Agency (PNA). “Overseas Filipino workers are not prohibited from returning to China if they have a visa and work permit there,” Sta. Romana said. This comes as President Duterte issued a directive in an attempt to contain the fast-spreading novel coronavirus. The directive announces the “temporary ban on Filipinos from travel to China and its Special Administrative Regions,” which according to Sta. Romana only covers “Filipino tourists”. OFWs flying home Meanwhile, the Philippine government is expected to dispatch an aircraft to fetch a group of Filipinos in Hubei, China this week following the global outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus acute respiratory disease (2019 nCoV ARD). Around 42 Filipino workers from Hubei province have expressed willingness to return home and will be fetched by foreign affairs and health authorities, according to Foreign Affairs Undersecretary Ernesto Abella. “The expected goal is to be able to fetch them within the week,” Abella said during a Palace press briefing Monday. “Formerly it was 40, it’s now 42,” he said about the number of Filipinos who wish to return to the Philippines from Hubei province. A rapid response team from the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) along with five to seven medical personnel from the Department of Health (DOH) may be deployed to fetch the Filipino repatriates. “The aircraft may leave for China sometime this week,” he said. As soon as they return to the country, the returning Filipinos will be subjected to 14 days of mandatory quarantine based on the Department of Health (DOH) guidelines. The Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) said the government will extend assistance to overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) affected by the temporary ban on the travel to China, Hongkong, Macau and other areas. In a statement, acting Labor Secretary Renato Ebarle directed the Overseas Workers Welfare Administration (OWWA) to provide P10,000 cash assistance, accommodation, and transportation to each stranded OFW caught up by the travel ban. Ebarle issued the directive upon the instruction of Labor Secretary Silvestre Bello III. He said those stranded will also be provided with accommodation at the OWWA halfway house while arrangements for their travel to the provinces are being made.

So baka i-move natin ng mga May or June,” she said on her weekly radio show, “BISErbisyong Leni.” (The INP in Hong Kong is supposedly set this March. So we may move it to May or June.) “Matutuloy din po tayo; patapusin lang natin ito (We will push through; we will just let this to finish),” Robredo added. The vice president has been promoting real-life success stories of Filipinos here and abroad as part of INP, her office’s initiative to spread positivity and inspire people. This will be the third trip of the country’s second highest official in Hong Kong. She was in Hong Kong for the INP project back in July 2017 and March last year. Hong Kong, however, is one of the administrative regions of mainland China that is covered by the expanded temporary travel ban imposed by President Duterte in response to the nCoV threat. The other is Macau. Robredo said the administration’s ban on travelers coming from these countries was a “welcome development,” but it should have been imposed sooner to allay public fear. “The solution is the government to be more swift and aggressive in its response,” she said in Filipino.

Estacion, the assistant provincial health officer, bared that two of these PUIs are currently having fever. The rest have occasional coughs and sore throat. Negros Oriental Roel Degamo is contemplating on giving the PUMs financial support at P5,000 each from the Assistance to Individuals in Crisis Situation (AICS) Fund, considering their absence from work because of their self-quarantine. Degamo instructed the Provincial Social Welfare and Development Office (PSWDO) to assist only those who were identified by the DOH-RESU-PESU team to have direct contact with the couple. He reminded the people of Negros Oriental that based on statistics, the rate of infection with the virus is very minimal considering that we only had five PUIs even after almost 190 hours since the last contact. In the same ICS briefing Monday, the issue on the lack of a medical doctor who will take care of PUIs currently isolated at the NOPH was raised and Gov. Degamo called up DOH-7 regional director Dr. Jaime Bernadas requesting him to provide one medical doctor for the purpose which was immediately granted. Expanded EO On the implementation of Provincial Executive Order No. 4, Degamo has ordered the Provincial Legal Office (PLO) to revise its provisions so it will be cascaded down to the barangay level.

Governor Eugenio Jose Lacson confirmed on Monday that a foreign national and a Filipino were placed under investigation (PUI), after they showed flu-like symptoms. The two patients – a Canadian national, aged 43 years old, and a 12-year-old Filipino boy are now at an isolation facility in a hospital here. Lacson said the foreign national traveled from Taiwan while the child traveled from Hong Kong before they were admitted to the hospital last January 31 and February 1, respectively. Both of them first went to a private hospital where they were refused admission and advised to be confined at a government-run medical facility. Lacson said that specimen of the two patients were already sent to the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) which is expected to release the confirmatory results later this week. Another test will again be conducted on the patients. Despite the reported cases, Lacson said that it was not a cause for worry because there has been no confirmed case of nCoV in the province. He clarified that the suspected case was because of the patients’ travel history and not because of local transmission. “We don’t want to create a scare. We want to be transparent because we cannot just keep this from the public. What is important is we know them and they have been addressed,” he said. Following the recent announcement, the governor said that he will reactivate the Provincial Infectious Disease Action and Control Committee to focus on addressing the recent health concern. Lacson is urging private hospitals to be prepared. “I hope if there’s a need for patients to be admitted, they will also be willing to treat them,” he said. Meanwhile, Dr. Grace Tan, head of environment sanitation division of City Health Office (CHO), and spokesperson of the City’s inter-agency task force against nCoV, advised the public not to panic, and not to withhold any information of persons who may have traveled to places, where there are reported nCoV cases, and are showing symptoms of the deadly disease. She advised them to inform the CHO and go to the nearest hospital. They are also tracing those persons who had close contact with the two patients.

Authorities have detected around 48,800 people returning to Wenzhou from Wuhan and other “key areas” in Hubei, state broadcaster CCTV said. Wuhan has itself reported 5,142 confirmed cases so far, with another 1,246 in neighbouring Huanggang. Wenzhou businesses will not be allowed to return to work until Feb. 18, and the city has also ordered all schools to close until March 1, one of the longest suspensions in the country. The city has also stopped inter-city and inter-county rail journeys, ferry services and some buses. It is also restricting private vehicles. Wenzhou Communist Party chief Chen Weijun told an emergency meeting on Sunday that the epidemic’s spread was still at a “critical stage” and officials who fail to take responsibility will be punished. One suburb has already fired two health officials for “dereliction of duty”, state news agency Xinhua reported on Monday. Wenzhou has so far seen no fatalities. The total number of deaths in China from the epidemic rose to 361 as of Sunday, up 57 from the previous day, health authorities said. Tags: ncov"

(REUTERS/Denis Balibouse/MANILA BULLETIN) “We call on all countries to implement decisions that are evidence-based and consistent,” Tedros told the WHO executive board, reiterating his message from last week when he declared an international emergency. China is facing increasing international isolation due to restrictions on flights to and from the country, and bans on travellers from China. There have been 17,238 confirmed infections in China including 361 deaths, as well as 151 confirmed cases in 23 countries and 1 death which was reported from the Philippines on Sunday, Tendros added. “Because of this strategy and it weren’t for China, the number of cases outside China would have been very much higher,” he said. Referring to the virus’ spread abroad, he said it was “minimal and slow”, while warning that it could worsen. Tedros, who held talks in Beijing a week ago with Chinese President Xi Jinping and other leaders, coughed and interrupted his speech to take a drink of water, quipping: “Don’t worry, it’s not corona”. China’s delegate took the floor at the WHO Executive Board and denounced measures by “some countries” that have denied entry to people holding passports issued in Hubei province – at the center of the outbreak – and to deny visas and cancel flights. “All these measures are seriously against recommendation by the WHO,” said Li Song, who is China’s ambassador for disarmament at the United Nations in Geneva. China’s regular Executive Board representative was unable to attend after her flight from Beijing was canceled, Chinese diplomats told reporters on Friday. US ambassador Andrew Bremberg said that the outbreak in two dozen countries required focused attention. “We express our support, prayers, sympathy, and appreciation to the people of China and especially the health responders on the front lines, who are protecting not only their communities, but the world,” Bremberg said. “We are learning more about the virus every day and implementing appropriate public health measures, in keeping with WHO’s recommendations, to minimize the spread based on the best evidence available. The United States is committed to working with all partners to address this outbreak,” he added. Tags: ncov"
,"February 10, 2020, 1:11 PM",nCov,Hong Kong suspends four more border crossings to curb spread of virus,By Reuters,"By Reuters Hong Kong’s leader announced the closure of four more border crossings with mainland China on Monday, leaving just three checkpoints open, but stopped short of demands for the entire border to be closed to curb the spread of the new coronavirus. Hong Kong has 15 confirmed cases of the coronavirus, which emerged in central China in December and has killed more than 360 people there and sent jitters through global markets.  Supporters of medical workers hold a flash mob protest to back their strike to demand Hong Kong closing its border with China to reduce the coronavirus spreading, in Hong Kong, China February 3, 2020. (REUTERS/Tyrone Siu/MANILA BULLETIN) Carrie Lam, chief executive of Chinese-ruled Hong Kong, was speaking hours after more than 2,500 workers from the Hospital Authority Employees Alliance (HAEA) went on strike to call for the border to be shut and better protection for hospital staff, among other demands. “We should be united if we have the same goal. At this critical moment, (some people are) taking extreme means and it is inevitable it will affect the rights of patients,” Lam said. “Those using extreme means to try to force the government’s hand will not succeed.” The Hospital Authority said those using extreme means “to try to force the government and Hospital Authority’s hands will not succeed”. Striking workers at the Hospital Authority building booed as they watched Lam speak, calling her a liar and chanting: “Close all borders.” The medical workers, members of the newly formed union, held a press conference shortly after Lam spoke and said they planned to keep up their strike action. HAEA chairwoman Winnie Yu said she expected around 9,000 of the alliance’s roughly 18,000 members to strike on Tuesday. Pro-democracy protesters have in recent months formed about 40 unions as a way to press their demands on the government and at least a dozen have come out in support of the HAEA’s strike. Reflecting concerns in the broader business community, three-quarters of American business leaders polled said they wanted Hong Kong to shut the border with the mainland, according to a survey of 156 executives by the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong. Lam has rejected calls to shut the entire border, saying such a move would be “inappropriate and impractical” as well as “discriminatory”. By making it inconvenient for people to cross the border, Lam said she hoped it would help contain the spread of the virus although she does not “rule out future measures as the situation evolves”. The health scare comes after months of at times violent anti-government protests in Hong Kong triggered by fears the city’s autonomy, guaranteed under a “one country, two systems” formula, is being eroded by Beijing. China denies meddling and accuses foreign governments of fomenting the unrest. The virus is expected to heap more pressure on the former British colony, which on Monday reported its economy contracted for the first time in a decade in 2019. The HAEA’s five demands are for the government to close the border, distribute masks to the public, ensure that front-line medical workers have adequate supplies and protection, provide enough isolation wards for patients and guarantee no reprisals for strikers. Panic-stricken residents have emptied shelves in major supermarkets in Hong Kong, stockpiling meat, rice and cleaning products as fears escalate over the coronavirus. About 90 percent of the city’s food is imported, with the bulk coming from the mainland, according to official data. Toy shop owner Lam Wa-yin, 45, said closing the border would intensify worries about supplies of staples. “They’ve started rushing to buy supplies even before they fully close the borders,” Lam said. “It’ll get worse if it is fully closed. Especially food. People have been rushing to buy oil, salt and rice, not to mention the face masks.” Tags: ncov"

Lao Mao was no ordinary housebreaker – his mission was to feed two starving cats trapped in the home for 10 days. He found the animals under a sofa, barely alive. Lao Mao rang up their owners, who broke down and cried on the video call at the sight of their pets.  FILE PHOTO: Street view after Wuhan government announced to ban non-essential vehicles in downtown area to contain coronavirus outbreak, on the second day of the Chinese Lunar New Year, in Wuhan, Hubei province, China January 26, 2020. (cnsphoto via REUTERS/MANILA BULLETIN) Their owners had gone on what was originally a three-day trip to the north but had been unable to return, barred by travel curbs following the virus outbreak, which has claimed the lives of more than 360 people in China. They learned of Lao Mao, or “Old Cat” as his friends call him, from social media and messaged him, pleading for help for their cats. Wuhan, where the virus is believed to have first surfaced late last year, has been in a lockdown since Jan. 23, just as tens of millions of people across China started to leave for their Lunar New Year holidays. Wuhan’s mayor told a recent news conference that 5 million people had left the city ahead of the festive season. Up to 50,000 pets had been left alone at home in Wuhan, Lao Mao estimated, based on the number of people who left the city in Hubei province. “The volunteers on our team, me included, have saved more than 1,000 pets since Jan. 25,” said Lao Mao, declining to disclose his real name because he did not want his family to know he was out and about in the city. “My phone never stops ringing these days. I barely sleep.” Without intervention, the pets will starve to death. Many owners, either in quarantine or stranded in other provinces and countries, have sought help from animal lovers like Lao Mao on social media. “My conservative estimate is that around 5,000 are still trapped, and they may die of starvation in the coming days,” Lao Mao said. Animals in some parts of China were also caught up in spurious rumours that pets were exacerbating the virus’s spread. The number of abandoned pets rose in the past week, according to several animal rights groups, while isolated reports of pets being killed circulated on the internet. Suichang, a small county in Zhejiang, the province second to Hubei with the most infections, on Friday ordered residents to keep their dogs at home. Dogs caught in public will be exterminated, county authorities said. Many in Beijing and Shanghai also rushed to buy face masks for their dogs in their mistaken belief that pets could catch the virus. “I’m worried about my dog being hated by the neighbourhood,” said Beijinger Wang Fengyun, who has a poodle. “I haven’t found any pet masks, so I’ve made one myself with a paper cup.” Tags: ncov"

Mactan-Cebu International Airport Terminal 2 (JUAN CARLO DE VELA / MANILA BULLETIN FILE PHOTO) China’s Hubei Province and the provincial capital of Wuhan City have been at the epicenter of the 2019-nCoV outbreak. MCIAA and GMR MEGAWIDE Cebu Airport Corporation (GMCAC), with the Bureaus of Immigration and Quarantine, are working closely to ensure that all airlines operating direct international flights into Cebu from China, Hong Kong, and Macau are made aware of the new directive for them to take the appropriate action to minimize disruption to its inbound and outbound flights. GMCAC is coordinating with all airline operators, concerned airport community stakeholders, and even with the Manila International Airport Authority (MIAA), operator of the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA), to align with the overall enforcement of the travel ban ordered by President Duterte. According to GMCAC the entry ban exempts Filipino citizens and permanent residents in the country but requires them to be quarantined for 14 days. In response to this situation the MCIA has already designated an isolated holding area for these passengers who can disembark. This holding facility is closed off to nonessential airport employees and is connected to a separate bus bay to ensure proper handling and transport of the quarantined passengers, in line with the required stringent quarantine procedures, the media statement read. GMCAC chief executive advisor Andrew Harrison said in a press conference that more than a week the Mactan-Cebu International Airport community has already put in place precautionary measures to control the potential spread and transmission of the novel coronavirus and to ensure the well-being of passengers and employees. “We are committed to working with the relevant authorities to monitor the situation. The following measures are being implemented at MCIA accordingly: In-flight announcements: All airlines have been advised to make a standard in-flight announcement prior to landing at MCIA advising passengers experiencing flu-like symptoms to self-declare and voluntarily submit to a medical screening by the Bureau of Quarantine upon disembarkation. Intensified thermal scanning: The Bureau of Quarantine is on heightened alert and has intensified monitoring of arriving passengers in MCIA by taking additional thermal scans of passenger body temperatures on the aerobridges of all flights arriving directly from China. This is in addition to the thermal scanning at the Immigration Arrival Level. Bureau of Quarantine Officer Dr. Paul Longinos said they have augmented their staff manning the counters and added three more handheld thermal scanners to speed up testing and other tasks. Longinos said that all international and domestic passengers coming in and out of Cebu are subjective to thermal scans to ensure safe and protected travels. Hand sanitization and air disinfection: According to Harrison Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are being installed in all aerobridges and arrival corridors with passengers being asked to use these facilities. “Liquid disinfectant will be sprayed in the aerobridges prior to each flight arrivals, as well as ground handlers have also been given hand sanitizers,” Harrison added. Medical team to be stationed at the arrivals area: A medical team is stationed at the arrivals area of Terminals 1 and 2 to provide information and advice to any passengers. The Bureau of Quarantine will however maintain primary responsibility for dealing with suspected cases. According to Longinos even its medical team has also been augmented with an additional of 20 nurses and four doctors on top of the existing staff at the BOQ to deal with the current situation. Airport front liners to wear protective masks: All airport staff dealing with passengers upon immediate arrival are required to wear surgical masks as a precautionary measure. As the virus is currently understood to be transmitted through contaminated droplets, surgical masks will provide adequate protection. Adequate information materials and announcements: Information materials will be displayed in prominent areas at Arrival and Departure to provide the passengers with ample information on coronavirus, Harrison said. Announcements and reminders will be made on a regular basis and running electronic messages will be displayed around the airport. These messages will be based on guidance material from the Department of Health and Bureau of Quarantine, he added. Meanwhile in Negros Oriental, governor Roel Degamo has ordered the strict implementation of his Executive Order No. 4, Series 2020 directing the Negros Oriental Poiice Provincial Office (NOPPO in accordance with pertinent issuances to assist doctors and medical staff, both public and private, for the strict implementation of the EO. According to the EO, any foreign national who is subjected to be placed on quarantine based on the DOH nCoV decision tool but refused to be quarantined, shall be apprehended and be sent back to their place of origin.

Washington on Friday declared a public health emergency and temporarily banned the entry of foreign nationals who have traveled to China over the past two weeks, to contain the spread of the outbreak. Sweeping new restrictions will also be imposed on American citizens, with those returning from the province at the disease’s epicenter placed in facilities for a mandatory 14-day quarantine. There have been eight confirmed US cases of the new coronavirus, which originated in a live seafood market in Wuhan, in China’s Hubei province.

Currently only non-essential medical staff in Hong Kong are on strike (AFP Photo/Anthony WALLACE / MANILA BULLETIN) The financial hub has 15 confirmed cases of the disease, many of them brought over from the Chinese mainland where the epidemic began and has so far killed more than 360 people. The action by non-essential medical staff comes as the city’s pro-Beijing leadership resists completely sealing the border. Authorities have argued that doing so would be discriminatory, economically damaging and go against advice from the World Health Organization. Instead, the city government has closed some crossings with arrivals down some 50 percent since last week. But there is growing public anger in a city that maintains a deep historical mistrust of the mainland after the 2003 SARS outbreak — which was initially covered up by Beijing — killed nearly 300 Hong Kongers. Thousands of members of a newly formed medical worker union voted Saturday to strike unless their demand for the border to be closed was met, with the first group downing tools on Monday. The first strikers are “non-essential” staff but the union has said frontline workers, including doctors and nurses, will walk out on Tuesday if their demands are not met. Staff gathered outside hospitals across the city on Monday morning, handing white ribbons to colleagues encouraging them to join the strike action. “If there is no full border closure, there won’t be enough manpower, protective equipment, or isolation rooms to combat the outbreak,” Winnie Yu, chairwoman of the 9,000 member Hospital Authority Employees Alliance, told reporters. Talks with the government broke down on Sunday after the union said city leader Carrie Lam had decided to not attend discussions in person. ‘Strict immigration control’  The Hospital Authority, which employs some 75,000 people, said it sympathized with calls to lower the risk of new infections but was opposed to industrial action, saying patients would suffer. It warned half of pre-booked operations would be canceled or delayed by the strike. Hong Kong’s government called on workers to “reconsider their decision, continue to safeguard Hong Kong with their professionalism and together win the battle against the disease”. Some 13,400 mainlanders entered Hong Kong on Saturday, down from 27,800 three days earlier before the partial checkpoint closures were announced. More than 100,000 Hong Kong residents are also returning to the city each day, some 56,000 via land crossings with the mainland. Criticism of the Lam administration’s decision not to seal the border has come from opposition lawmakers and some medics — but also from her own pro-Beijing camp. “We think the government should take decisive and strict immigration control measures to minimize the chances of the virus coming into the city,” Starry Lee, from the pro-establishment DAB Party, told reporters on Monday. The virus outbreak comes at a politically precarious time for Lam who has record-low approval ratings after deploying riot police to face down seven months of sometimes violent pro-democracy protests. Animosity towards Beijing and mainlanders has also risen steeply in recent years in lockstep with Hong Kongers pushing for democracy. Many in Hong Kong feel an increasingly authoritarian Beijing is clamping down on the city’s freedoms. And they also resent economic pressures caused by the influx of mainland immigrants and day-trippers, something that has helped ramp up prices of everything from pharmacy goods to retail rents and housing. Anti-mainland sentiment has sometimes morphed into outright bigotry, especially online where insults and slurs abound.

At full capacity, China’s factories are only able to produce around 20 million masks a day, according to the ministry of industry. The foreign ministry said countries including South Korea, Japan, Kazakhstan and Hungary have donated medical supplies. Tian Yulong of the industry ministry said earlier Monday that authorities were taking steps to bring in masks from Europe, Japan and the US, adding that supply and demand in China remained in “tight equilibrium” as factories returned to production after the Lunar New Year lull. He said they were now operating at “between 60 and 70 percent capacity”. In addition to Hubei, the province of more than 50 million people at the centre of the outbreak, several other provinces and cities across China have made it compulsory to wear masks in public as virus fears have grown. These include Guangdong — China’s most populous province — plus Sichuan, Jiangxi, Liaoning and the city of Nanjing, with a combined population of more than 300 million. The death toll from the coronavirus soared past 360 on Monday, exceeding the 349 mainland fatalities from the 2002-03 SARS outbreak, although SARS killed a higher percentage of people infected.

The Australian citizens and permanent residents on board were due to be flown in smaller planes to Christmas Island, an Australian territory in the Indian Ocean. Foreign Minister Marise Payne said the flight was late leaving Wuhan due to a “very intensive process to manage the immigration and boarding arrangements” that also included medical checks. Passengers will be quarantined for at least 14 days in an immigration detention center which gained notoriety as the venue where asylum seekers who attempted to reach Australia by boat were detained. Officials say the evacuees will be held separately from a Sri Lankan family of four fighting their deportation — the only other residents of the facility. “The plan is to cohort people in small family groups so that there won’t be a full mingling so that the whole group doesn’t have to stay if someone does get unwell,” chief medical officer Brendan Murphy said. Australia is just the latest country to evacuate its citizens from Wuhan. Japan, the United States, and France are among those that have already sent extraction flights. Payne said the government was considering sending a second plane to Wuhan to evacuate more than around 300 other Australians. Australia is also in talks with Pacific nations to help evacuate their citizens, but Payne said any foreign nationals that traveled on an Australian charter flight would also need to be quarantined on Christmas Island. The virus has infected more than 14,000 people in China and killed more than 360. It has spread to more than 24 countries including Australia, where health officials have so far confirmed 12 cases.

Police forensics officers are seen near a site where a man was shot by armed officers in Streatham, south London, Britain, February 2, 2020. (REUTERS/Simon Dawson/MANILA BULLETIN) Sudesh Amman, who was jailed in 2018 for possession of terrorist documents and disseminating terrorist publications, was shot dead by police on Sunday after he went on the rampage with a stolen 10-inch (25 cm) knife on a busy London street. Amman had previously praised the Islamic State militant group, shared an online al-Qaeda magazine and encouraged his girlfriend to behead her parents. Johnson said the government would announce fundamental changes to the system for dealing with those convicted of terrorism offences. “Those measures will build upon the actions we have already put in place,” said his interior minister, Priti Patel. She said there would be legislation to end the early release from prison of counter-terrorism offenders. “It is right that these individuals are kept behind bars,” Patel said. British politicians have repeatedly discussed tougher rules on terrorism, calls that increased after a former convict killed two people and wounded three more before police shot him dead near London Bridge in November. Johnson said that since that attack, the government had “moved quickly to introduce a package of measures to strengthen every element of our response to terrorism – including longer prison sentences and more money for the police”. SUNDAY IN STREATHAM Sunday’s attacker, Amman, had recently been released from prison, according to police, having been jailed for promoting violent Islamist material. He went on the rampage at around 1400 GMT on Streatham High Road and had strapped a fake bomb to his body. He stabbed two people, seriously injuring a man in his 40s, while a third suffered minor injuries caused by shattered glass when police opened fire. Amman was under surveillance at the time of the attack by armed police, who shot him dead. In November 2018 he pleaded guilty to possession of terrorist documents and disseminating terrorist publications, and the following month he was sentenced to more than three years in prison. He was 17 and living at home with his mother and younger siblings when he first began committing terrorism offences, according to authorities. Police became aware of his activities in April 2018 and he was arrested by armed officers in a north London street a month later. When officers examined his computers and phone, they found he had downloaded material about making explosives and carrying out terrorist attacks, according to prosecutors. Messages showed that he had discussed with his family, friends and girlfriend his extreme views and desire to carry out an attack, often focused on using a knife, prosecutors said. In December 2017 Amman posted a picture of Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who was killed in a U.S. raid in Syria in October, and told his brother in a message that “the Islamic State is here to stay”. He also described Yazidi women as slaves and said the Koran made it permissible to rape them, and in another message he encouraged his girlfriend to behead her parents. Police said he had shared an online al-Qaeda magazine with his family and while in a discussion about school with a sibling he wrote he would “rather blow myself up”. Tags: ncov"

Customers wear masks as they shop for instant noodles at a supermarket following the outbreak of a new coronavirus, in Hong Kong, China January 30, 2020. (REUTERS/Tyrone Siu/File Photo/MANILA BULLETIN) The rush to procure food in the city of 7.4 million people is unprecedented, residents say, describing it as far worse than the panic during the 2003 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) that killed nearly 800 people around the world, including nearly 300 in Hong Kong. The new coronavirus originated in central China’s Hubei province and has so far killed 361 people in the country. Over the weekend in Hong Kong, hundreds of people queued for hours to buy masks and immune-boosting products such as vitamin C. “Everybody is really worried. I think everyone is afraid of what is going to happen in the next few days. Prices are also going to rise,” said Cindy, a retail executive who was buying dry food and soap. Dozens of mask-wearing shoppers pushed trolleys down empty aisles showing sold-out signs for hand wash and antiseptic liquids. Others tried to stock up on remaining bags of rice and packaged noodles. The rush to buy food and cleaning products comes as some shoppers said they were concerned that a potential shutdown of the border would impact the supply of products. The Hong Kong government has closed some border crossings, including the high-speed rail, but has stopped short of a complete shutdown, despite growing calls from medical workers, who plan a strike on Monday to demand action. The government is grappling with how to handle spreading infections locally, with 15 confirmed cases in the city. Calls have grown for the government to close the border with mainland China to minimize the risk of infection. Hong Kong’s economy was badly hit during the SARS epidemic with tourism and services sectors the most affected as visitor arrivals tumbled and unemployment spiraled. There was also a severe drop in consumer spending in the second quarter of 2003 due to SARS but a pick up for the rest of the year saw retail sales drop only 0.6 percent on the year Last week, at an upmarket supermarket in Kowloon’s Elements mall, chilled produce was sold out most afternoons while at Britain’s Marks & Spencer, chicken was sold out by midday. At local wet markets, which are typically packed with local residents, many stalls were shuttered as residents opted to shop in air-conditioned grocery stores, believing they were safer. “It is worrying that food is being stockpiled but what is even scarier is the stockpiling of masks and sanitizers,” said a man who would only go by his first name, Nelson, who was shopping with his wife. So frantic is the search for masks that police on Friday said a 56-year-old medical worker was in custody for stealing 36 face masks and gloves from a hospital where she worked. Tags: ncov"

The woman was not sick enough to require hospitalization, it added. The other two cases involve a married couple in San Benito County, the San Benito County Public Health Services announced in a release late Sunday. The Santa Clara woman, who recently traveled to the epicenter of the outbreak in Wuhan, China, is the second case in Santa Clara reported, health officials said. They said the case is not related to the first case in Santa Clara. The two additional cases involve a husband and wife, and the husband had recently traveled to Wuhan and apparently transmitted the disease to his wife, San Benito County Public Health Services said in a release late Sunday. Neither patient is hospitalized, officials said. San Benito County health officials were not immediately available to Reuters for comment. Santa Clara is located about 40 miles (64 km) southeast of San Francisco. San Benito County is about 80 miles west of Fresno. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) informed county health officials of the case Sunday morning, said Sara Cody, health officer of the Public Health Department of the County of Santa Clara. The flu-like coronavirus, which is believed to have originated in a market that traded illegally in wildlife in Hubei’s provincial capital, Wuhan, has so far resulted in more than 350 deaths in China. Confirmed cases of the virus have been reported in 27 other nations, according to the CDC. US health officials have said risks to the United States remain low. Tags: ncov"

FILE PHOTO: Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen speaks during a news conference on the coronavirus outbreak, in Taipei, Taiwan January 30, 2020. (REUTERS/Fabian Hamacher/MANILA BULLETIN) Taiwan is denied membership of most international bodies including the WHO, a UN agency, due to the objections of China, which considers it a Chinese province with no right to participate unless it accepts it is part of China, something Taiwan’s government will not do. Taiwan has long complained about China’s belittling of it on the international stage and its forcing of foreign governments and companies to refer to it as part of China. Now, with the virus biting, Taiwan says this policy means it has become collateral damage, as, despite having only 10 cases compared with more than 17,000 in China, where the virus emerged in December, the WHO is lumping it together with China. The consequences surfaced on the weekend when Taiwan said its largest airline, China Airlines, had been included in an Italian ban on flights from China because the WHO lists Taiwan under China as part of a high-risk virus area. Bob Chen, the head of the Taiwan foreign ministry’s Department of International Organisations, said it had complained repeatedly to the WHO to stop listing Taiwan as part of China. “But to date, the WHO’s secretariat’s attitude has been very hard-line,” he said on Sunday. “It’s very obvious that under China’s pressure they can’t show flexibility.” However, the WHO, while still listing Taiwan as part of China, now refers to it as “Taipei”, rather than “Taiwan, China” as it did in initial situation reports, Chen said. “It’s a small change, but from our perspective it’s still far from enough. The biggest problem is they are still putting us under China.” In a rare diplomatic success, Taiwan managed on Saturday to get Vietnam to lift its ban on flights to the island, which it had also initially listed under China. China Airlines says its Rome flights remain suspended as Taiwan pressed Italy for them to be resumed. Taiwan’s other main airline, Eva Airways, which is due to start flights to Milan this month, said it had no information whether they would go ahead. Foreign Minister Joseph Wu said Taiwan’s diplomats were working to ensure more countries do not stop flights from Taiwan. The WHO’s office in Beijing and Italy’s foreign ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment. ‘LIMITED’ INFORMATION China has denied seeking to make life difficult for Taiwan, saying it can get information from the WHO in a timely way. “Taiwan compatriots are our own flesh and blood, and if they encounter difficulties overseas, we are willing to provide strong support,” foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said on Monday, responding to a question on Italy’s flight ban. But the WHO is for sovereign states and Taiwan can only take part under the “one China” principle, she added. Procedures need to be changed as existing WHO channels provide only limited information, said Wang Liang-yu, Taiwan’s de facto ambassador in Geneva, where the WHO is based. “The WHO should not hint that bilateral channels are enough to replace international cooperation,” she told Reuters. The WHO says it is collaborating closely with Taiwan through a 2005 legal instrument on health reporting requirements, the International Health Regulations (IHR). Taiwan officials had been invited to WHO technical meetings last year, said spokesman Tarik Jasarevic. “WHO works with Taiwanese health officials, following established procedures, to facilitate fast and effective response, including through the IHR,” he added. Taiwan can get coronavirus information but has to wait for it to show up on WHO websites, said Chuang Jen-hsiang, deputy head of its Centres for Disease Control. “There is a time gap, but we can see it,” he said.

Senator Imee R. Marcos(Senator Imee R. Marcos official Facebook page / MANILA BULLETIN) She underscored that government directives must now cover social interaction beyond the country’s points of entry because infected persons may have already slipped in before the travel ban was imposed. Marcos made the statement after the government’s inter-agency task force officially announced a ban on the entry of all nationals who have been to China and its special administrative regions Hong Kong and Macau, except Filipinos and permanent resident visa holders who will instead undergo a mandatory 14-day quarantine. Among the stronger precautionary measures that could be taken, Marcos proposed to extend random temperature checks by nurses or trained personnel at the entrances of court offices, conference venues, and even meeting rooms; to install dispensers of antiseptic hand sanitizers not just in toilets but also along hallways and other strategic places; and to require the use of face masks by frontline, public desk, service, and utility personnel. Marcos added that government must assess events daily, even hourly, and determine if compulsory leaves of absence may have to be imposed in schools, health care centers and other places especially where children and the elderly converge, since they are considered most vulnerable to the virus. “Sketchy government advisories before the travel ban have led airlines, universities, call centers and other offices to resort to their own restrictions,” Marcos said in a press statement. “The government must also start assessing the economic impact of the ongoing epidemic on trade and tourism in the country and take necessary action to minimize its effects,” Marcos, who is the chair of the Senate economic affairs committee, added. Amid fear and uncertainty over the true extent of the viral epidemic, various countries have imposed bans on travel to and from China, disregarding the World Health Organization’s praise for China’s aggressive efforts to stem the spread of the 2109-nCoV virus and a caveat that travel and trade restrictions were not necessary. Marcos noted that Singapore was able to gain headway in its fight against the virus by imposing a travel ban January 23, one week before the WHO declared the 2019-nCoV outbreak a public health emergency of international concern.

China is set to open a new hospital built in 10 days to care for coronavirus patients (AFP / STR / MANILA BULLETIN) The fresh toll came a day after China imposed a lockdown on a major city far from the epicenter and the
first fatality outside the country was reported in the Philippines. Authorities in Hubei, the province at the epicenter of the outbreak, reported 56 new fatalities, with one reported in the southwestern megalopolis of Chongqing. That took the toll in China to 361, exceeding the 349 mainland fatalities from the 2002-3 SARS outbreak. SARS, caused by a pathogen similar to the new coronavirus and also originated in China, killed 774 people – with most of the other deaths in Hong Kong. Struggling to contain the virus, authorities took action in the eastern city of Wenzhou on Sunday, closing roads and confining people to their homes. Wenzhou is some 800 kilometers (500 miles) from Wuhan, the metropolis at the heart of the health emergency. Since emerging out of Wuhan late last year, the new coronavirus has infected more than 17,200 people across China and reached 24 nations. The G7 countries – Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States have all confirmed cases of the virus. They will discuss a joint response, Germany’s health minister Jens Spahn said on Sunday. In Thailand, which has 19 confirmed cases, doctors said Sunday an elderly Chinese patient treated with a cocktail of flu and HIV drugs had shown dramatic improvement and tested negative for the virus 48 hours later. Most of the infections overseas have been detected in people who travelled from Wuhan, an industrial hub of 11 million people, or surrounding areas of Hubei province. The man who died in the Philippines was a 44-year-old from Wuhan, ac- cording to the World Health Organiza- tion, which has declared the epidemic a global health emergency. The staff patients of the Philippines’ San Lazaro Hospital, where the Chinese died, are all safe from the 2019-novel coronavirus acute respiratory disease (2019-nCoV ARD), the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) assured the public. In a press briefing in Malacañang Monday, RITM Director Celia Carlos said the RITM and the San Lazaro Hos- pital have set standard procedures on standard prevention and control. WHO satisfied with PH  The World Health Organization (WHO), meanwhile, said it is satisfied with how the Philippine government is responding to the threat of the 2019- nCoV ARD, saying it will continue to assist the country to better manage
cases of the disease. In a press briefing in Malacañang, WHO Philippines Representative Dr. Rabindra Abeyasinghe commended the actions taken by the Philippine government to strengthen its preparations and to build its capacity to detect cases. “I believe that the Philippine government has been responding to an evolving situation. As I mentioned, this is a new situation, an evolving situation, and with the emergence of disease and the emergence of more information, the government response has been proactively strengthened,” he said. READ MORE: WHO satisfied with gov’t response to 2019-nCoV ARD With the 2019-nCoV ARD becoming widespread, the Philippine National Police (PNP) has activated its health team to assist in containing the spread of the deadly virus. PNP chief Gen. Archie Gamboa said the team is composed of 105 personnel and volunteers who are all chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and explosive (CBRNE)-trained. “The Philippine National Police has made available a team of CBRNE- trained medical personnel from the PNP Health Service who may be deployed to assist concerned agencies in the repatriation of Filipinos based in China and other countries affected by the 2019 nCoV ARD who will wish to return to the country subject to mandatory quaran- tine procedure,” Gamboa said in a press briefing at Camp Crame on Monday. The CBRNE team is equipped with necessary medical materials including protection gear, monitoring equipment, and basic medicines and paraphernalia. Gamboa said the activation of their CBRNE team is in compliance with President Duterte’s directive to the PNP to actively assist in containing the spread of the virus in the Philippines, which is the first country in the world to record a 2019-nCoV-ARD-related death outside China. “We are just waiting for the Department of Health because the deployment of the PNP will primarily depend on DOH because it is the one which is in charge of this,” Gamboa said. With the extent of the virus infection, China has embarked on unprecedented efforts to contain the virus, which is believed to have jumped to humans from a Wuhan animal market, and can be transmitted among people. READ MORE: PNP sets up health team to assist gov’t anti-nCoV efforts Wenzhou lockdown  China’s efforts have included extraordinary quarantines in Wuhan and surrounding cities, with all transport out banned, effectively sealing off more than 50 million people. But 10 days after locking down Wu- han, authorities imposed similar draconian measures on Wenzhou, a coastal city of nine million people in Zhejiang province, part of the eastern industrial heartland that has powered China’s economic rise over recent decades. Only one resident per household is allowed to go out every two days to buy necessities, and 46 highway toll stations have been closed, authorities announced. The city had previously closed public places such as cinemas and museums, and suspended public transport. Zhejiang has more than 660 confirmed infections, with several hundred of those in Wenzhou, according to the government. This is the highest tally for any province in China after ground-zero Hubei. Closing borders The United States, Australia, New Zealand and Israel have banned foreign nationals from visiting if they have been in China recently, and they have also warned their own citizens against travelling there. Mongolia, Russia and Nepal have closed their land borders. President Duterte on Sunday ordered the entry ban of all nationalities, except Filipinos and Permanent Resident Visa holders, to the Philippines traveling from China, Hong Kong, and Macau. Also on Sunday, the Philippines’ health department confirmed that another patient tested positive for the 2019-nCov ARD. The number of countries reporting infections rose to 24 after Britain, Russia and Sweden confirmed their first cases this weekend. There were 2,829 new confirmed cases nationally on Monday, bringing the total infected to 17,205, health officials said. With hospitals in Wuhan over- whelmed, China will open a military-led field hospital Monday that was built in just 10 days to treat people stricken by the virus. And with the Chinese economy suffering, the central bank announced it would release 1.2 trillion yuan ($173 billion) on Monday to maintain liquidity in the banking system – the day markets re-open after the long holiday break. READ MORE: Duterte orders entry ban on all nationalities traveling from China except Filipinos Holiday ending The emergence of the virus coincided with the Lunar New Year, when hundreds of millions travel across the country in planes, trains and buses for family reunions. The holiday, which was scheduled to end on Friday, was extended by three days to give authorities more time to
deal with the crisis. With many due back at work on Monday, people were starting to return on planes and trains over the weekend, with almost everyone wearing face masks. Customs authorities had ordered temperature checks at all exit-entry points in Beijing, according to state media. Returning travellers were being checked and registered at residential compounds, while fever checks were in place in subway stations, offices and cafes. One 22-year-old arriving at a Beijing train station from northeastern China said her family had urged her to delay her return. “But I was worried it would affect my job,” she said. Security guard Du Guiliang, 47, said he would be starting back at work in Beijing on Sunday, after returning from northeast Liaoning province. “Many colleagues (from Hubei) couldn’t come back. Now, those who work the day shift at our company have to do the night shift as well,” he said. Many businesses were to remain closed for at least another week, how- ever, while some major cities – in- cluding Shanghai – had also extended the holiday. (With reports from Dhel Nazario, Aaron B.

(REUTERS/Soe Zeya Tun/MANILA BULLETIN) The doctors from Rajavithi Hospital in Bangkok said a new approach in coronavirus treatment had improved the condition of several patients under their care, including one 70-year-old Chinese woman from Wuhan who tested positive for the coronavirus for 10 days. The drug treatment includes a mixture of anti-HIV drugs lopinavir and ritonavir, in combination with flu drug oseltamivir in large doses. “This is not the cure, but the patient’s condition has vastly improved. From testing positive for 10 days under our care, after applying this combination of medicine the test result became negative within 48 hours,” Dr. Kriangska Atipornwanich, a lung specialist at Rajavithi, told reporters. “The outlook is good but we still have to do more study to determine that this can be a standard treatment.” Chinese health officials have already been administering the HIV and flu drugs to fight the coronavirus. The use of the three together in a cocktail seemed to improve the treatment, the Thai doctors said. Another doctor said that a similar approach in two other patients resulted in one displaying some allergic reaction but the other showed improvement. “We have been following international practices, but the doctor increased the dosage of one of the drugs,” said Somsak Akkslim, director-general of the Medical Services Department, referring to the flu medicine Oseltamivir. Thailand has recorded 19 cases of coronavirus. Of the Thai patients, eight have recovered and gone home while 11 are still under treatment in hospitals. Somsak said the health ministry will meet on Monday to discuss the successful treatment in the case of the 70-year-old but said it is still too soon to say that this approach can be applied to all cases. “Initially we will apply this approach only to severe cases,” he said.

The flight had been due to leave overnight, but was loading passengers early on Monday morning. “Of course it’s pretty complex. The Wuhan airport had been closed for a while. So we expected that it might take longer on the ground, and we have planned for that,” Joyce told Australian Broadcasting Corp radio. The Qantas flight will go to an air force base in western Australia, from where the government will fly the passengers to Christmas Island, an Australian territory in the Indian Ocean 1,500 km (900 miles) from the mainland, where there is a controversial immigration detention center. Wuhan in Hubei province has been in lockdown to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus, which has killed 304 people in China. The first death from the virus outside China was reported on Sunday in the Philippines. Australia on Saturday followed the United States in barring entry to all foreign nationals traveling from mainland China and raised its travel warning for China to the highest level, advising people against visiting the country at all. There were 600 Australians registered in the Hubei region as of last week. Joyce said it was unclear whether more than 270 had sought to leave. “We’re in dialogue with the government to see if there’s a need for future flights. We don’t know what the demand was,” he said. All passengers and crew were being given masks and hand sanitizer, and the crew were being told to remain on the upper deck of the plane other than for manning the doors. The aircraft has medical grade air filters, which eliminate 99% of particles, including viruses, Joyce said. “It’s a lot safer, a lot cleaner than being in a restaurant, in an office,” he said.

A 38-year-old Chinese woman who arrived from Wuhan, China, tested positive for the virus on Thursday. President Rodrigo Duterte on Friday banned the entry of Chinese arriving from Wuhan, at the center of the epidemic, and provinces with reported cases of the disease. Carriers Philippine Airlines, Cebu Pacific and the local unit of AirAsia Group Bhd said they were canceling flights starting this month. “In light of developments related to the novel coronavirus, Cebu Pacific will be canceling all flights between the Philippines and mainland China from Feb. 2 to March 29, 2020,” the airline said. The country’s largest budget carrier, which flies to Beijing, Shanghai, Xiamen, Guangzhou, Shenzen, said it also reduced trips to Hong Kong and Macau. Philippine Airlines said it would cut the number of flights between Manila and Greater China by over 50%. It would continue to serve Filipinos and Chinese nationals returning from the Lunar New Year holidays. But further reductions are expected in the coming weeks based on daily assessments and guidelines from government authorities, the flag carrier said. Philippines AirAsia, another low-cost carrier, said flights to and from China, including Hong Kong and Macau, were suspended until March 1 “because of the current health situation”. Thousands of Filipinos live and work in Hong Kong, mainly as househelp, and in Macau gaming hub as employees of integrated casino resorts. China faced mounting isolation from international travel curbs and flight suspensions on Saturday as the death toll from coronavirus rose to 259. Tags: ncov"

Kennedy International Airport five hours early on Friday, not least because he had a lot of luggage to check for his flight to his native China: He was hauling back boxes filled with hundreds of face masks.  Jonathan Niu waits at John F. Kennedy International Airport, to accompany his father, Niu Fang Xiu and mother, Liu Xiu Lan back to their home in Hefei in east China, along with cardboard boxes filled with 200 face masks, in New York, US, January 31, 2020. (REUTERS/Jonathan Allen/MANILA BULLETIN) His mother and father, both in their 70s, came to visit him in New York about five months ago, their first trip there in 20 years. In the interim, a new coronavirus has emerged in China and become a fast-spreading global health crisis, prompting foreign governments to fly their citizens out of the country. Niu was among those who were traveling against the tide along with his parents, who missed their home after months away. “Now it’s time to go back,” said Niu, 44, who moved to the United States more than 20 years ago and lives in Manhattan, where he works in finance. The family remembers past virus outbreaks, including severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, and survived them, he said. He thought the US State Department was wise to warn Americans against nonessential travel to China because of the epidemic, which has infected nearly 10,000 people. But he wanted to shepherd his parents home. Delta Air Lines Inc and American Airlines Group Inc joined other airlines on Friday in suspending all remaining U.S.-China flights.
Even so, Niu’s father seemed relaxed ahead of his flight on China Eastern Airlines from Terminal 1. He smiled broadly, urging a reporter to immediately book a flight to China as well. His mother had been less sure. “She was so nervous, she couldn’t get any sleep,” Niu said. After arriving, Niu said he planned to make sure his parents’ home in Hefei, capital of the eastern province of Anhui, was well stocked with groceries and other supplies. He would then settle in and stay with them for a month or two in a sort of self-imposed quarantine before returning to New York. Niu figured he would cheer up his parents’ neighbors by sharing some of his supply of face masks and drop off some at a nearby hospital. “Everybody’s panicking there,” he said. “People can’t get the masks.” The stash cost him about $400. He had also packed five or so masks in his carry-on luggage, thinking he would hand them to his seatmates on the plane.
Surviving coronavirus quarantine, French style CARRY-LE-ROUET, France – Twice a day, they will have their temperature taken and nurses will check them for coronavirus symptoms: other than that, their main concern will be how to keep their phone charged and get their laundry done. The 179 evacuees — mostly made up of French nationals and their Chinese spouses — flown back from China were settling into their new life in quarantine on Saturday — a holiday resort in the southeast of France that will be their home for the next two weeks. These special guests will have the run of their seaside base in Carry-le-Rouet, about 30 kilometers (19 miles) from the Mediterranean port city of Marseille — so long as they wear a mask. On Saturday, their first morning there, some were up to take in the sunrise, others sat outside in the mild weather reading while others explored inside the hotel complex. “There are worse places,” said Marc Ziltman with a smile, as children’s shouts echoed across the facility. “The easy solution would have been a disused barracks,” Zilman, the senior Red Cross official on site, pointed out. Instead, the French authorities opted to make the evacuees stay as comfortable as possible. “The site needs to be as agreeable as possible because people are going to pass 14 days there,” he told AFP. There is volleyball for the teenagers, art classes for the toddlers and a space for the grown-ups to relax over a coffee, making it more holiday resort than hospital or clinic. The medical team looking after the evacuees is about 20 strong, including doctors, nurses and psychologists. Backing them are soldiers from France’s civil security units and 30 Red Cross volunteers, who mainly take care of the logistics of their stay. Tags: ncov"

This is after Guimaras Governor Samuel Gumarin issued an executive order barring entry of tourists who fail to present a clearance from the Bureau of Quarantine (BOQ), the attached agency of the Department of Health (DOH). “While the BOQ remains on high alert and is in constant coordination with authorities from all ports of entry for stricter border surveillance, the province of Guimaras likewise needs to have full vigilance and security in all its entry points,” Gumarin said. While Gumarin’s executive order specifically mentions barring Chinese tourists from Wuhan City, it also included any other areas with positive nCov cases. “There is a need for immediate action at the local level, particularly to protect the inhabitants and the agri-tourism industry of the province,” Gumarin said. An island province of five towns, Guimaras has been an alternative beach destination for travelers of Metro Iloilo. It also has inland resorts and religious sites that have gained popularity among domestic and foreign visitors. Guimaras is also known to be the home of one of the world’s sweetest mangoes. Quarantine In Ilocos Sur, Governor Ryan Luis V. Singson ordered local health workers and other concerned individuals in the province to strictly enforce quarantine procedures and other disease prevention and control measures to protect the province from the 2019-nCoV and other similar strains. Executive Order No. 03 issued on January 21, 2020 also mandates the implementation of precautionary measures against the possible entry of the virus in Ilocos Sur province. As of press time, Ilocos Sur is still nCoV-free. “We need to protect the province from 2019-nCoV and similar strains, as may identified by the World Health Organization and/or the Department of Health, by the strict implementation of additional quarantine, and other disease prevention and control measures,” Singson said. It is also necessary to implement the following procedures to prevent the entry of the virus to the province: inspection/clearing/checking of foreign vessels in their second or subsequent port of entry; mandatory accomplishment of passenger declaration and health declaration card of those entering the province by domestic flights and by domestic or international vessels; barangay monitoring; and tourism establishments monitoring. He enjoined local chief executives in the different cities and municipalities to mobilize their respective barangay councils, barangay volunteer workers, such as barangay health workers, barangay nutrition scholars, and barangay service point officers to monitor and record returning residents and transients with travel history from countries positive for 2019-nCoV and similar strains and/or exhibiting symptoms such as fever, cough and or/colds, and to report to the City or Municipal Health Office, if any. Tourism establishments such as, but not limited to hotels, pension houses, motels, resort dwellings and transient accommodations, shall monitor and record guests with travel history from affected countries.

In a Facebook post, the special agency of the United Nations concerning international public health clarified some questions regarding the deadly respiratory virus.  • Are antibiotics effective in preventing and treating nCoV ARD? “No, antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria,” WHO said, noting that nCoV is a virus, therefore, antibiotics should not be used as means of prevention or treatment. “However, if you are hospitalized for the 2019-nCoV ARD, you may receive antibiotics because bacterial co-infection is possible,” it added. • Are there any specific medicines to prevent or treat nCoV ARD? “To date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat nCoV ARD,” WHO said. It clarified that those infected with the virus should receive appropriate care to relieve and treat the symptoms. Those with severe illness should be given optimized supportive care. “Some specific treatments are under investigation, and will be tested through clinical trials,” it said. • Does nCoV ARD affect older people, or are younger people are also susceptible? “People of all ages can be infected by the nCoV ARD,” WHO said. Older people and people with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease) appear to be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virus. WHO advised the public to protect themselves by observing good hand and respiratory hygiene. • Can pets at home spread the nCoV ARD? “At present, there is no evidence that companion animals/pets such as dogs or cats can be infected with the nCoV ARD,” WHO said. They advised pet owners to always wash hands with soap and water after contact with pets. This will protect pet owners against various common bacteria such as E. coli and salmonella that can pass between pets and humans. According to the Department of Health, the first confirmed case of nCoV ARD in the Philippines is a 38-year-old woman from Wuhan, China. WHO on Friday (PH time) declared the outbreak a global emergency, as cases have spread to at least 18 countries. The disease has claimed 213 lives as of this writing. Tags: ncov"

Bureau of Quarantine (BOQ) Davao (Facebook) BOQ Davao head Dr. William Lim, in a phone interview, confirmed that commercial airline Xiamen Air landed at the Davao International Airport, carrying at least 79 Chinese nationals. Lim said the aircraft landed at around 12:30 p.m., and BOQ personnel immediately went outside the aircraft to check the passengers. He said they individually checked the passengers using a thermometer to see whether any passenger showed symptoms of the 2019 novel Coronavirus (nCoV). Lim said all passengers tested negative from the symptoms of the virus. “So far, wala po kaming na intercept na mga pasaherong may lagnat o flu-like symptoms (So far, we did not intercept passengers who have fever or flu-like symptoms),” he said.

Dr. Anna Ma. Teresa de Guzman , PHO chief noted that there were protocols needed to be implemented just like when there was outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) viruses. All incoming patients are bring monitored from the emergency room. De Guzman said patients were being checked if they have history of travel, especially in areas where novel coronavirus infection has been reported. Dasol Community Hospital, Bolinao Community Hospital, and the Western Pangasinan District Hospital are strictly being monitored as these are located in coastal areas. “We anticipate that some Chinese fishermen will still sail in from the West Philippine Sea, where they may encounter fishermen from the coastal areas of western Pangasinan,” de Guzman told. De Guzman explained that health officials were advised to orient the fishermen on how to avoid possible acquisition of the virus. De Guzman noted that frequent and proper hand washing  can help a lot and  still among the best ways to prevent spread of any virus. Likewise, she urged public to refrain from beso-beso (cheek to cheek greeting) or even handshakes so as not to spread the bacteria or virus. Tags: ncov"

(MANILA BULLETIN) The regional inter-agency task force is spearheaded by the DOH 13, with members of all concerned line agencies of the government. The DOH Caraga Region 13 reiterated that there is “no case of coronavirus” in Northeastern Mindanao. DOH Caraga Region 13 spearheaded by Regional Director Dr. Jose R. Llacuna, Jr., in coordination with the DFA, DILG, DOLE CAAP, DOT, Bureau of Quarantine and all other concerned line agencies of the government and the local government units, assured that measures and mechanisms are in place to detect cases of nCoV in the region. Ms. Romelyn Torralba, regional information officer of DOH 13 said the members of the activated regional inter-agency task force will meet before weekend to tackle some mitigating measures and other health programs of the agency. DOH 13 Center for Health Development in Caraga region advised the public to take precautionary measures from any respiratory infections. The DOH Caraga Region 13 said simple self-protection measures such as frequent handwashing with soap and water and proper cough etiquette should be strictly observed to effectively lower the risk of infection. People should wash their hands often and thoroughly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. An alcohol-based hand sanitizer can be used if soap and water are not available and if the hands are not visibly dirty. Proper cough etiquette means maintaining one’s distance when someone sneezes or coughs, covering coughs and sneezes with a tissue or the crook of one’s elbow, disposing used tissue in the trash can and avoiding spitting in public. The DOH also underscored the importance of avoiding close contact with people showing cold or flu-like symptoms and unprotected contact with farm or wild animals. People should also ensure that food is cooked well. Travelers with symptoms of respiratory illness, either during or after travel, must also seek medical attention immediately. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses ranging from the common cold to more serious infections such as MERS-CoV and SAR-CoV. Common signs of coronavirus infections include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath, and breathing difficulties. In severe cases, it can cause pneumonia, acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure, and even death. Tags: ncov"

,"March 15, 2020, 11:02 AM",nCov,WHO backs setting up safe houses for media covering COVID-19 outbreak,By Argyll Cyrus Geducos,"By Argyll Cyrus Geducos The World Health Organization (WHO) agrees it would be a good idea for different government agencies and media companies to provide safe houses for members of the press covering the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak. In an interview with Communications Secretary Martin Andanar, WHO representative to the Philippines Dr. Rabindra Abeyasinghe said establishing safe houses for members of the media and ordinary media employees was a good suggestion since their movement will be limited due to the community quarantine imposed in Metro Manila.  Dr. Rabindra Abeyasinghe (WHO Philippines official facebook page/ MANILA BULLETIN FILE PHOTO) “I think that’s a very good suggestion because, in this way, you minimize the opportunities for possibly infected but very mild symptomatic people to transmit the disease to other people,” he told Andanar over state-run Radyo Pilipinas. “So the social distancing that is being advocated as part of the community quarantine, we need to ensure that that’s followed if we really want to break this outbreak and stop the transmission of the virus: So we have to look at a new reality of how we reach the people, how the media reaches them, how we facilitate access to the media,” he added. Abeyasinghe said movement protocol for the media needs to be established because they have the crucial role of giving information to the public. “That’s a problem that will need to be proactively addressed. Increasingly, even WHO is facilitating many media conferences like daily press briefings do be done via the internet,” he said. Abeyasinghe also pointed out that the WHO has been using internet platforms so that the media can connect, ask questions and get the answers to questions the media want to understand and convey to the public through internet-based platforms. “We are living in an era where many things can be done using those channels. We are not saying that that is the best, but there are ways that we can reach the media and the media can reach the public even if we have to face such an extreme eventuality, travel becomes impossible for the safety of the people involved,” he added. Abeyasinghe likewise suggested that the Philippine government could consider reducing internet costs and increasing bandwidth so the public can have uninterrupted access to media and get the necessary updates. “These are critical things that we need to consider. Many governments are giving incentives to facilitate these processes and I believe that the government of the Philippines is also thinking on those lines,” he said. Metro Manila is under a 30-day community quarantine due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Travel via land, domestic air, and domestic sea to and from the National Capital Region (NCR) is likewise suspended. According to Presidential Spokesman Salvador Panelo, non-essential entry into and exit from NCR would restricted and prevented, respectively. “As a result, entry into or exit from the NCR by workers, including legitimate media practitioners, are permitted only if their travel is essential, and not simply for leisure or otherwise, such as that the purpose thereof is to report for work or conduct essential business in the place of their destination,” he said. “They shall, however, present proof of the legitimacy of their work or business at border checkpoints so our enforcement personnel can validate the necessity of their entry to or exit from the NCR,” he added. Panelo warned that those who will try to circumvent or violate the imposed community quarantine by presenting false company IDs or fabricated business agenda will be dealt with strictly in accordance with the law.   Tags: ncov"

In a further blow to the local economy, and especially to the tourism trade, the Czech government also said on Friday it was imposing a ban on foreigners entering the country and Czechs traveling abroad as of Monday. The center of Prague was quieter than normal on Thursday evening, with many restaurants and pubs only half full and customers drinking their beers with a mixture of resignation and hope that the tough measures would make a difference. “The main thing is that the virus doesn’t continue and spread further,” said Lukas Novy, while sipping a Pilsner Urquell at U Jelinku, a popular bar in the city center. Daniel Grice, who manages the London Underground bar, said his pub had generated record sales in the past two weeks but business came to an abrupt halt with the new restrictions.

But the growing concern over the global outbreak and uncertainty about how long the restrictions will remain in place have business bracing for a hit to their bottom line. “This will hurt us economically a lot,” said Bohumil Kundrt, the bartender at U Jelinku. “We are doing well now but without people we will suffer.” Tags: ncov"

(Photo by FADEL SENNA / AFP / MANILA BULLETIN) “We are lost!” said David, an Italian tourist waiting at the closed border with the Spanish enclave of Ceuta in northern Morocco. Late on Saturday, Rabat announced a suspension of air links with 21 countries including Austria, Denmark, Greece, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland in Europe, as well Turkey and Bahrain, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Oman, Tunisia, and the United Arab Emirates. Africa’s Chad, Mali, Mauritania, Niger and Senegal, and Canada and Brazil were also in the list. Morocco had already suspended air, sea and land links with European countries and Algeria on Friday, as well as taking measures to confine citizens to prevent the spread of coronavirus. Flights to and from Algeria, Spain, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Portugal and Italy were suspended “until further notice”, while sea links for passengers and Morocco’s land borders with Ceuta and a second Spanish enclave, Melilla, were closed. But France announced that Rabat had agreed to allow repatriation flights for French nationals. “New flights are being organised to enable (stranded French tourists) to return to France,” President Emmanuel Macron tweeted Saturday. The first flights back to France had already taken off that day, Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said earlier. The closure of the only land border between Africa and the European Union at Cueta and Melilla saw Spaniards rushing to leave on Thursday evening, as Moroccan day workers hastily returned in the opposite direction. The land borders are busiest in summer and the border sees regular traffic throughout the year. Now though a Moroccan police roadblock bars the road towards the border with Cueta. David said he tried to go to Spain because links with Italy, a hotspot of the disease, are suspended. After arriving in Morocco for a motorcycle tour with his partner earlier this month, the 33-year-old Italian was stuck at a service station outside Cueta. The border at Cueta, like that at Melilla, was reopened Friday only for Spaniards. The Spanish embassy in Morocco tweeted Saturday that ferries were still operating between the enclaves and mainland Spain. Its French counterpart also tweeted that “passage (into Ceuta and Melilla) is open to French ferry ticket holders with vehicles.” But except for a few travellers, the normally busy border post near the Moroccan town of Fnideq was deserted. At the service station, camper vans bearing various European license plates were parked waiting. “We don’t know how long this will last, no one has told us anything,” said Rene, a 71-year-old French man, speaking before Le Drian and Macrons’ announcements. “The weather is good here, there’s surely fewer cases of coronavirus in Morocco than in France,” he said. Moroccan authorities have reported 17 cases of COVID-19, including one death. France and Spain have together announced more than 210 COVID-19 deaths. Morocco’s Transport Minister Abdelkader Amara has tested positive for the disease after an official visit to Europe, his ministry announced Saturday. On the Spanish side at Cueta, stuck Moroccans were wondering why their country would not let them back in. “If I need to get a hotel, who will pay?” asked a man hoping to return home. At Tangiers port some 30 kilometers to the west, containers and trucks were unloaded as usual but the passenger terminal was closed. The busiest port in North Africa, the facility welcomed 568,000 foreign tourists in 2019, while some 473,000 entered from Cueta and Melilla, according to official figures. The travel restrictions are causing panic in the kingdom’s tourism sector, which accounts for 10 percent of GDP and is a key source of foreign revenues. Tags: ncov"

(Elaine Cromie/Getty Images/AFP / MANILA BULLETIN / FILE PHOTO) Georgia is the second state to delay its election as public gatherings shut down across the United States in an effort to slow the pandemic’s march. “Events are moving rapidly and my highest priority is protecting the health of our poll workers, their families, and the community at large,” Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger said in a press release. Voters throughout the United States are heading to the polls or participating in caucuses to choose candidates to run for president in November. Former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders are the only remaining viable candidates among Democrats, with Biden ahead so far and expected to land the party’s nomination to run against Republican Donald Trump. Trump faces little opposition among Republicans and some states have canceled their primary elections outright to make sure that he holds his party’s nomination. Georgia’s move to delay its election won approval from state Democratic Party officials, who said it was prudent given the need to protect voters’ health. “Our priority is to protect the health and safety of all Georgians and to ensure that as many Georgians as possible have an opportunity to vote,” said party chair and State Senator Nikema Williams. “Continued in-person voting could compromise both goals.” Raffensperger assured the party that all ballots that have already been cast will be counted, and voters who have not yet gone to the polls will be able to do so on May 19, when the state is also holding elections for other offices, Williams said. Louisiana on Friday became the first US state to postpone its presidential nominating contest because of the pandemic, while four states holding their primaries next week said those elections would go forward as planned. The Southern state said it would reschedule voting in the run-up to the Nov. 3 election because of the outbreak. Officials there said they would postpone their scheduled April 4 primary to June 20 “to best protect the health and safety of Louisiana voters and voting officials,” Louisiana Secretary of State Kyle Ardoin said at a news conference. The four states holding their primaries on Tuesday – Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Ohio – said in a joint statement they would proceed with their contests while taking steps to ensure public safety. “Americans have participated in elections during challenging times in the past, and, based on the best information we have from public health officials, we are confident that voters in our states can safely and securely cast their ballots in this election, and that otherwise healthy poll workers can and should carry out their patriotic duties on Tuesday,” election officials from the four states said.

,"March 14, 2020, 8:48 PM",nCov,Here’s what coronavirus do to your body and what makes it so dangerous,By Gabriela Baron,"By Gabriela Baron At least six other types of coronavirus are known to infect humans, with some causing the common cold and two causing outbreaks: SARS and MERS. The World Health Organization (WHO) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advise the public to be watchful for fever, dry cough, and shortness of breath — symptoms that follow contraction of the new coronavirus, officially known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 or SARS-CoV-2. The illness caused by the virus is COVID-19. According to the CDC, the virus can spread person-to-person within six feet through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby and possibly be inhaled into the lungs. Early stage After entering the body, the virus spreads to the back of the nasal passage and to mucus membranes in the throat, attaching to the body’s cell receptors. The viral particles hook onto the outer walls of the hosts’ cells, the virus’ genetic material breaches the cell membrane, and it then hijacks the cell into making more copies of the virus. At this early stage, you will not be sick. Some people may never develop symptoms. The time between infection and first symptoms appearing varies, but is five days on average. Lungs The virus then moves from the back of the throat down the bronchial tubes toward the lungs. Once the infection reaches the lungs, it can cause inflammation in their mucus membranes, damaging their air sacs. The inflammation hampers the lungs’ ability to oxygenate the blood and remove carbon dioxide from the bloodstream. The inflammation in the lungs, and their reduced efficacy, can cause them to fill with fluids, pus, and dead cells, and cause an infection, leading to pneumonia. Stomach According infectious disease specialists Dr. Pragya Dhaubhadel and Dr. Amit Munshi Sharma, some patients have reported gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea and diarrhea. Both SARS and MERS viruses can access the cells that line intestines and the large and small colon, and those infections appear to flourish in the gut, potentially causing the damage or the leakage of fluid that becomes diarrhea. Liver When the coronavirus spreads from the respiratory system, your liver is often one downstream organ that suffers. Doctors have seen indications of liver injury with SARS, MERS, and COVID-19, according to a report by National Geographic. Once a virus gets into the bloodstream, it can swim to any part of the body. The liver is a very vascular organ so coronavirus can easily get into the liver. Kidney It is estimated that around six percent become critically ill. By this point, the body is starting to fail and there is a real chance of death. The immune system is now spiraling out of control and causing damage throughout the body, leading to septic shock when the blood pressure drops to dangerously low levels and organs stop working properly or fail completely. BBC reported that acute respiratory distress syndrome caused by widespread inflammation in the lungs stops the body getting enough oxygen it needs to survive. It can stop the kidneys from cleaning the blood and damage the lining of intestines. “The virus sets up such a huge degree of inflammation that you succumb. It becomes multi-organ failure,” Dr. Bharat Pankhania told BBC. Tags: ncov"
,"March 14, 2020, 8:25 PM",nCov,To slow coronavirus cases we must ‘flatten the curve’,By Gabriela Baron,"By Gabriela Baron “Flattening the curve” is the goal of social distancing and other measures that include things like canceling large events and sending employees off to work from home. Schools are closing, major sporting events are postponing, universities are holding classes online, and cultural institutions are shutting their doors. The disruption of daily life for many is real and significant — but so are the potential-life saving benefits. It’s all part of an effort to do what epidemiologists call flattening the curve of the pandemic. The idea is to increase social distancing in order to slow the spread of the virus, so that you don’t get a huge spike in the number of people getting sick all at once.  Social distancing Social distancing is a public health tactic that helps communities slow down the transmission and spread of the coronavirus. The National Center for Biotechnology Information, the database arm of the United States National Library of Medicine, found that in areas and regions where a disease is spreading, taking measures like work from home, shutting down schools, and canceling large events can dramatically reduce the rate of new infections. Big tech companies are asking employees to work from home as the coronavirus continues to spread. Facebook, Google, Twitter, and Amazon have implemented remote working policies for many or all of their employees around the globe. “It’s like stopping a pack of matches from lighting by separating the other half from the first three that are firing off,” Lt. Gov. John Fetterman told Pittsburgh’s Action News 4. Flattening the curve To keep hospitals and doctors’ offices from becoming overwhelmed with sick patients, the ultimate goal for public health authorities is to flatten the curve. The chart illustrates the wave of new coronavirus cases expected to hit. A high curve means the virus is spreading quickly; some people won’t get the medical care they need, and the number of deaths is likely to increase. This is what is happening in Italy. According to a report by the New York Times, in less than three weeks, the virus has overloaded hospitals in northern Italy. It has turned the hard-hit Lombardy region into a grim glimpse of what awaits other countries if they cannot flatten the curve. Hospitals in northern Italy have forced doctors and nurses to make extraordinary decisions about who may live and who may die. Giorgo Gori, the mayor of Bergamo, said that in some cases in Lombardy the gap between resources and the enormous influx of patients forced the doctors to decide not to intubate some very old patients. A low curve, meanwhile, means coronavirus is spreading slowly, giving hospitals and doctors the time and resources to treat more people. In other words, flattening the curve’s goal is to not have cases come all at once. That does not mean that the number of people who are infected would necessarily be lower, but that the infections would not come all at once. The chart was originally shared by population health analyst Drew Harris on Twitter. “Important to remember that COVID-19 epidemic control measures may only delay cases, not prevent. However, this helps limit surge and gives hospitals time to prepare and manage. It’s the difference between finding an ICU bed and ventilator or being treated in the parking lot tent,” Harris said. Harris took a graphic created by journalist Rosamund Pearce, which was based on another chart in a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) paper. The viral graphic has been adapted and shared widely online in different forms. Tags: ncov"

As shoppers swarmed stores, President Donald Trump on Friday afternoon declared a national emergency aimed at slowing the spread of the novel virus, which has killed at least 47 people in the United States.  Shelves previously filled with pasta and canned food are seen empty at a Trader Joe’s grocery store as shoppers gather supplies with coronavirus fears spreading in Encinitas, California, U.S., March 12, 2020. (REUTERS/Mike Blake/MANILA BULLETIN) Daily routines have been upended as businesses including Amazon.com urge employees to work from home, schools and universities close, and sporting events and church services are paused across the country. In response to the run on certain items, major retailers have imposed some purchase limits. The chief executive of Walmart Inc, Doug McMillon, at a news conference with Trump on Friday, said the retailer was having trouble keeping up with demand for products like hand sanitizer Purell, cleaning supplies and paper goods. “Hand sanitizer is going to be very difficult to have 100% in stock for some time,” McMillon said. “We’re still replenishing it … but as soon as it hits the stores it’s going. The same thing is true for the other categories I mentioned.” In Hanover, New Jersey, about 40 customers had lined up to get into a Wegmans grocery store before it opened on Friday morning. A few hours later, shelves were stripped bare of sanitizing wipes, bulk rice and dried beans. The store posted signs announcing limits on the purchase of hand sanitizer and bottled water. “An abundance of caution – semper paratus, like the Coast Guard motto that means ‘always ready,’” shopper Marlene Russell, 69, told a reporter after packing groceries into her car. At a Fairway Market on Manhattan’s Upper West Side, shelves normally full of pasta, Oreo cookies, pasta sauce, crackers and toilet paper were depleted on Thursday evening. On the West Coast, grocery stores including Ralphs, Pavilions and Trader Joe’s had sold out of products ranging from eggs to Lysol cleaning wipes. Johnson & Johnson is accelerating production of over-the-counter pain killer Tylenol to ease any spot inventory crunches. J&J, which also makes Listerine mouthwash, said it was shipping stocks of products in a controlled manner. It was increasing production of other consumer products to ensure retailers were well supplied, it said, adding it did not expect any shortages. Pharmacy chain Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc and supermarket chain Kroger Co instituted purchase limits to stabilize inventory. Kroger, the largest U.S. grocery store operator, limited the number of cold, flu and sanitary products per visit, while Walgreens said it was limiting disinfectant wipes and cleaners, face masks, hand sanitizers, thermometers and gloves to four per customer. John Terry, 33, went to a Whole Foods in Manhattan to pick up chicken and other items his wife was unable to get at grocery stores near their Jersey City home, in New Jersey across the Hudson River from Manhattan. “It was insanity,” he said about his local stores. “She went to Costco and there was a line down the block. At another one, the shelves were picked clean.” Phil Lempert, editor of SupermarketGuru, said labor shortages due to everything from school closures to illness could cause business disruptions that last several months. “It’s a lot more than stockpiling toilet paper or Purell. This is going to have implications on our food supply and supply chain for months to come,” Lempert said. Tags: ncov"

We have never felt the need to consume English medicine,” said Om Prakash, a person who attended the party. Chakrapani Maharaj, the chief of the All India Hindu Union, posed for photographs as he placed a spoon filled with cow urine near the face of a caricature of the coronavirus.

Legislation would be published next week to give the government powers to deal with the outbreak, including to stop mass gatherings and compensate organizations, the source said. Some organizations have stepped ahead of the government in terms of limiting public gatherings. On Friday, England’s soccer Premier League suspended all matches until April 4 and other events such as the London Marathon were postponed by their organizers.

Johnson postponed for a year local and mayoral elections in England that had been due to take place in May. As of Friday, Britain had 798 cases of the illness, and 11 people had died. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Friday that the United States might include the United Kingdom in the coronavirus travel ban that it has imposed on other European countries. British media said the new ban on mass gatherings could affect events such as the Glastonbury music festival, the Wimbledon tennis championships and the Grand National horse race.

Mainland China had 11 new confirmed cases on Friday, up from eight cases a day earlier, but only four of those – all in the virus epicenter of Hubei province – were locally transmitted, according to the data released on Saturday.  A closed entrance of a residential community is seen following an outbreak of coronavirus (COVID-19), at downtown Shanghai, China March 13, 2020. (REUTERS/Aly Song/MANILA BULLETIN) The other seven – including four in the financial hub of Shanghai, one in the capital Beijing and two in the northwestern province of Gansu – were all detected in travelers coming into China from overseas, specifically Italy, the United States, and Saudi Arabia. Later on Saturday, Shanghai’s city government confirmed a further two imported cases in travelers from France and Spain. The numbers underscore how China, where the outbreak began in December, appears to now face a greater threat of new infections from outside its borders as it continues to slow the spread of the virus domestically. A total of 95 cases have entered mainland China from overseas by the end of Friday, the commission said. Hubei has now seen new infections fall for nine straight days. All four new cases on Friday were in the provincial capital Wuhan. The death toll in mainland China from the coronavirus had reached 3,189 by the end of Friday, up by 13 from the previous day. All the latest deaths were in Hubei and 10 were in Wuhan. The virus has infected 80,824 people in mainland China, the commission said. Globally, more than 138,000 have been infected and over 5,000 have died, according to a Reuters tally. As cases rise overseas, the steel hub of Tangshan in northern China’s Hebei province warned people entering the city against trying to conceal their travel history. People who do so will have to bear all treatment costs if they are later found to have contracted coronavirus, the Tangshan city government said. Meanwhile, China’s finance ministry said at a briefing on Saturday that the virus had affected first-quarter fiscal revenues but the Chinese economy remained resilient. No details were given. Despite the uptick in imported cases in Shanghai, the city is gearing up to re-open all its public parks by March 20, Fang Yan, an official from Shanghai’s Landscaping and City Appearance Administrative Bureau, told a press conference on Saturday.

Thousands of public venues had earlier been shut across China in a bid to halt the virus spread. The city’s flagship Shanghai Museum and well-known landmark the Oriental Pearl Tower have both reopened, said culture and tourism official Zhang Qi. But Shanghai is following Beijing in suspending public funerals, instead offering grave-cleaning and flower services at cemeteries as the annual Qingming tomb-sweeping festival on April 4 approaches. Of the new Shanghai cases imported from Italy, three were Chinese people who worked in Italy and flew to Shanghai via Moscow, according to the city’s municipal health commission, while the fourth was an Italian who flew in via Paris.

They can actually be quarantined in a separate facility with their own rooms,” she added. The national government has placed Metro Manila under community quarantine, which will shut land, air, and sea travel to and from Metro Manila from March 15 to April 14, except for the delivery of food and essential supplies. Metro Manila was placed on community quarantine status with the rise of the COVID-19 cases in the region. Tags: ncov"

Metro Manila Development Authority (MMDA) General Manager Jose Arturo Garcia Jr. (left) (ALI VICOY / MANILA BULLETIN FILE PHOTO) This was announced on Saturday by Metropolitan Manila Development Agency (MMDA) General Manager Jose Arturo Garcia after a five-hour meeting of the MMC, composed of Metro Manila mayors, officials from the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG), Department of Health, and the Philippine National Police (PNP). “Ang virus ay hindi airborne, hindi siya tumatakbo or naglalakad. Ang naglalakad ay ang carrier—ang tao. (The virus is not airborne, it does not run nor walk. The one moving is the carrier—the person.) So, to limit the spread of the virus, we need to limit also the movement of the people… That is why we passed a resolution unanimously approved by the mayors, we will be having a curfew in Metro Manila from 8 p.m. to 5 a.m.,” Garcia told the media in a press conference. Workers, he clarified, are exempted from the curfew, especially those whose jobs are essential to the health and security of the public. “Pero of course, may exemptions po, ang mga nagtratrabaho—‘yung essentials po. (But of course, there are exemptions, the workers—especially those in essential occupations),” Garcia said.
Lt. Gen. Guillermo Eleazar, PNP deputy for operations, said workers must always bring their proof of employment and identification cards. “Always bring your proof of employment so that you can show it to authorities once they asked why you are still out even it is already curfew,” he said. Meanwhile, the MMDA general manager said the target of the curfew are partygoers who put themselves at risk by going to crowded bars where they might get infected with COVID-19. “Ang target ng curfew natin ay ang mga gumigimik lang kung saan-saan. Ito ‘yung kung saan-saan pumupunta o nakiki-party. Iyan po ay bawal na ho (The targets of our curfew are the partygoers who go wherever. These are the people who go from one place to another to party. This is now prohibited),” he said. According to Garcia, the curfew can be lifted anytime should it be deemed that the virus is already contained. “We will impose this for 30 days pero depending pa rin kasi kapag na-contain na nang maigi ang virus. Maari kasi na within 14 days, na-contain nang maigi so maari na i-lift noon,” he said. (But it depends whether the virus has been contained well. It could be that within 14 days, the virus has been well contained, so the curfew can be lifted then.) “Please just cooperate for now, this is for the safety of everyone in Metro Manila.” Eleazar clarified that what the government will implement on Sunday (March 15) is not a total lockdown. “We are no violating any human right, this is for the our right to live. So, if you do not have anything important to do outside, please stay at home because you are safe there,” he said. DILG Sec. Eduardo Año said those defiant people without essential activities outside their homes during the curfew will get arrested should they resist being asked to go home. “Well, sisitahin ‘yan in the case of that ay pauuwiin. Kung mag-resist, aarestuhin siya (We will call their attention and tell them to go home. If they resist, they will be arrested),” he said when asked by reporters what authorities would do if they encounter defiant people. “Only those with essential tasks are allowed to go outside, those with work and those who will buy medicines,” Año added. Eleazar agreed with Año and said that if a person will violate any law, they will be apprehended, saying the government only wants to ensure the safety of the public. “Stay at home if you are not emergency workers or you do not have any important business outside your homes.” The DILG secretary also urged everyone to undergo self-quarantine, even advising companies to give the 13th month pay of employees early. LGUs urged to temporarily close malls and other establishments Garcia said the MMC also created a resolution urging LGUs in the metropolis to issue ordinances ordering the temporary closure of malls and other establishments except those offering essential services such as groceries, banks, and pharmacies. “The health of the public is our main concern. If they get sick, our economy will go down. That is why MMC came up with this resolution calling LGUs to issue an ordinance ordering the closure of non-essential establishments,” he said. “Malls are usually crowded so there is a probability of getting infected with the disease.” He said groceries and other essential establishments will remain open so the public should not panic. “Do not panic. All essential establishments will remain functional. We are just taking these measures to diminish the probability of getting infected,” Garcia explained. Tags: ncov"

People wear protective face masks at a residential community following an outbreak of coronavirus (COVID-19), in downtown Shanghai, China March 13, 2020. (REUTERS/Aly Song / File photo / MANILA BULLETIN) Apple Inc (AAPL.O) said it will close all its retail stores worldwide, outside Greater China, until March 27. Apple reopened all 42 of its branded stores in China on Friday as the spread of the virus on mainland China slowed dramatically. Countries have shuttered museums, tourist attractions and sporting events to minimise the risk of coronavirus transmission, with more than 138,000 people worldwide infected and more than 5,000 dead. Colombia said it will close its borders with Venezuela and stop visitors who have been in Europe or Asia, while a U.S. ban on entry for most people from continental Europe was due to start midnight Friday. The World Health Organization (WHO) says Europe has become the pandemic’s current epicentre after reporting more cases and deaths than the rest of world combined, apart from China where the coronavirus originated last December. Saudi Arabia will suspend all international flights for two weeks, starting Sunday, state news agency SPA said, Taiwan will require travellers from mainland Europe, Britain and Ireland to self-isolate for 14 days, while New Zealand implemented a similar measure for all those entering the country. “Alongside Israel, and a small number of Pacific Islands who have effectively closed their border, this decision will mean New Zealand will have the widest ranging and toughest border restrictions of any country in the world,” she said. The country has just six confirmed cases and has had no deaths, but Ardern said that number inevitably would rise. “That is why ultimately, we must go hard and we must go early,” she told reporters. Chilean President Sebastian Pinera announced a ban on public events with more than 500 people on Friday, joining countries such as Australia where the ban will come into force on Monday. Britain will introduce emergency laws next week to ban mass gatherings, said a government source, an escalation of its crisis plan which critics had said was too relaxed. The Philippines capital Manila, home to 12 million people, announced nighttime curfews on Saturday and urged shopping malls to close for one month. “To limit the spread of the virus, we need to limit the movement of people. We are slowing down the movement of people in Metro Manila,” said Jose Arturo Garcia, general manager of the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority. While infections continue to climb around the world, in mainland China the number of new cases is falling. The number of new coronavirus cases imported into mainland China from overseas surpassed the number of locally transmitted new infections for the first time on Friday, data released by the National Health Commission showed on Saturday. Mainland China had 11 new confirmed cases on Friday, up from eight cases a day earlier, but only four of those – all in the virus epicentre of Hubei province – were locally transmitted. Hubei has now seen new infections fall for nine straight days. All four of the new cases on Friday, down from five a day earlier, were in provincial capital Wuhan. The flu-like virus has infected 80,824 people in mainland China, the commission said. In a bid to limit the economic damage from a pandemic that has infected the U.S. House of Representatives passed an aid package that would provide free testing and paid sick leave. The U.S. military said it will halt most domestic travel, extending earlier restrictions on international travel for its more than a million active-duty troops around the world. Travel bans have hammered airlines and travel companies worldwide, while financial markets have been hit by panic selling this week. The impact of the coronavirus on everyday life is also deepening. The Czech government will shut most shops and restaurants from early Saturday, with exceptions including food stores, pharmacies and gas stations. In Paris, the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre museum and the Moulin Rouge cabaret closed their doors. The Smithsonian museums in Washington were preparing to do so on Saturday and Broadway theatres in New York went dark. The kissing of the Blarney Stone, one of Ireland’s oldest tourist traditions, was suspended. The global sporting calendar has also been left in tatters with major tournaments cancelled, postponed or forced to continue without spectators. But sport’s biggest showpiece, the Olympics, will still proceed as planned, according to Tokyo organizers. Tags: Experts uncover hidden layers of Jesus' tomb site, ncov"

Provincial Tourism Officer Neil Pinarok said they were indefinitely postponing the activities based on the directive of President Duterte suspending all big activities due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) threat. He added that this was also confirmed by the National Historical Council of the Philippines (NHCP) despite their year-long preparation for the launching of the quincentennial anniversary. “We all know that Homonhon is an island and it is not contaminated, so even if a single person enters who is affected by the virus, the people would suffer. We can no longer celebrate the quincentennial anniversary next year,” he explained. One of the highlights of the celebration should have been the simultaneous ringing of church bells on March 17 at noon after the praying of the Angelus spearheaded by the Diocese of Borongan. The activity would have signified the formal launch of the diocese’s countdown to the quincentennial of the arrival of the Christian Faith to the Philippines. Bishop Crispin Varquez was also supposed to lead a mass at the St. John the Baptist Parish, in Brgy. Casuguran, Homonhon Island. Earlier, Guiuan town acting mayor Veronica Ramirez also announced the cancellation of their activities, including the lecture series of historian Ambeth Ocampo on Magellan’s landing in Homonhon. The provincial government of Eastern Samar has already imposed a transportation curfew, effective March 15, from 12 a.m. until 4 a.m. for all inbound vehicles in Bulusao, Lawaan; San Rafael, Taft; and Catumsan, Arteche as a precautionary measure against the spread of the virus in the province.

One of the newly deceased patients was a 54-year-old Filipino from Lanao del Sur confined at the Northern Mindanao Medical Center. He was referred to as the country’s 40th confirmed case. The DOH confirmed his death on Saturday morning. The patient showed symptoms of respiratory illness on Feb. 24 and tested positive for COVID-19 on March 11. The Health department said that the patient died last Friday night from “acute respiratory distress syndrome due to severe pneumonia with concomitant acute kidney injury.” Meanwhile, the DOH confirmed “two additional COVID-19 deaths” on Saturday afternoon. The DOH has yet to provide specific information on these. “[The] DOH is currently gathering further details on the recent deaths and will provide information as soon as it is available,” it said. With these developments, a total of eight individuals who tested positive for COVID-19 have died in the Philippines. The country recorded its first coronavirus-related death last Feb. 1 in the person of a 44-year-old Chinese man from Wuhan, China. The DOH urged elderly people and those with underlying medical conditions to be extra cautious. “We further urge those who are immunocompromised and are with existing health conditions to be more vigilant and avoid crowded areas and mass gatherings,” Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said recently. “We reiterate that the best way to protect yourself from the disease is to keep yourself healthy and practice general preventive measures–proper handwashing, cough etiquette, and social distancing,” he added. World Health Organization Country Representative to the Philippines Dr. Rabindra Abeyasinghe previously said that the “disease so far indicates that largely it’s a mild disease—- about 81 percent will have mild disease—-many of them could be managed as outpatients. But, 14 percent will develop severe disease and five percent will progress to critical, meaning they will need intensive care facilities.” READ MORE:DOH announces 12 more COVID-19 cases; total confirmed cases in PH now 64 Tags: ncov"

The countries subject to the new restrictions are Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland. – Travelers from the United Kingdom, Ireland and more than a dozen Eastern and Southeastern Europe nations will exempted. Those countries do not participate in the Schengen Area’s passport-free travel. – The restrictions will not apply to U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents, or to spouses, parents and children under the age of 21 of U.S. citizens and permanent residents, among other exceptions. – Flights from the affected European nations will be funneled to 13 airports in the United States that serve 90 percent of existing European flights, according to a U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) official. Boston Logan International Airport and Miami International Airport will be added to a list of 11 airports that have been receiving incoming flights from China and Iran since early February. – At the same time, U.S. airports are cutting flights.

New Zealand’s Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has been the driving force behind calls for tech firms to tackle online extremism after the Christchurch massacre when 51 people were killed by a white supremacist (AFP / MANILA BULLETIN FILE PHOTO) “This is a pragmatic decision. We’re very saddened to cancel, but in remembering such a terrible tragedy, we shouldn’t create the risk of further harm being done,” Ardern said Saturday. The service to mark the March 15 mass shooting, when a self-avowed white supremacist opened fire at two mosques during Friday prayers, killing 51, had been expected to attract several thousand people, with many travelling from overseas. Ardern said New Zealand needed to take a precautionary approach. “The advice we received for this event is that based on people travelling from different parts of the country and from overseas, if there was a case, it could be difficult to trace those who had come into contact with that person, so we are taking a cautious approach,” she said. “March 15 now becomes an opportunity for every New Zealander to reflect in their own way on the events of a year ago.” The unveiling of a remembrance plaque, also planned for Sunday morning at Christchurch’s main al-Noor mosque, has been postponed as a precautionary measure. Mosque spokesman Tony Green said they had taken the advice of health professionals and it was right not to go ahead with the two remembrance services. “It would be unwise not to take health advice on coronavirus. It’s very concerning,” he said. “It would only need one person to be infected and it would be very difficult to track where the carrier travelled from.” Six people have so far tested positive for the new coronavirus in New Zealand although there have been no reported cases in  Christchurch. The alleged mosque attacker Brenton Tarrant, an Australian national, is due to go on trial on June 2 facing terrorism charges plus 51 counts of murder and 40 of attempted murder over the killings.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in self-isolation working from home in Ottawa, Canada (AFP Photo/Handout / MANILA BULLETIN ) “I want to be clear. I have no symptoms. I’m feeling good. Technology allows me to work from home,” Trudeau told a news conference outside his official residence in Ottawa. Standing alone in front of the small brick cottage, journalists giving him several meters (yards) clearance, the prime minister spoke publicly for the first time since his wife Sophie tested positive for the COVID-19 virus. The announcement was made late Thursday that the 48-year-old Canadian leader, his 44-year-old wife and their three children, aged 6-12, would be confined for 14 days to the house a few kilometers (miles) from parliament. Telegoverning, he said “is an inconvenience and somewhat frustrating.” “We’re all social beings after all, but we have to do this.” Public health officials have asked all Canadians to self-isolate if they exhibit any flu-like symptoms and get tested for COVID-19, especially if they recently travelled outside the country. “We are following medical advice as should all Canadians,” Trudeau commented. Sophie Gregoire-Trudeau started feeling flu-like symptoms including a low fever late Wednesday after flying back from a speaking engagement in London. “Sophie’s symptoms remain mild,” said her husband. “We are thinking about all the families across the country who have received the same diagnosis, but we’re in good hands.” Working from home, Trudeau has maintained a busy schedule: phone calls to Emmanuel Macron, Donald Trump, Giuseppe Conte, Canadian provincial and territorial leaders, and others. He has remained in contact with his cabinet and officials, unveiling on Friday a slew of measures and money to combat the spread of the virus. “I’ve been very busy both yesterday and today. I’ll continue to work from home remotely to do the important things that need to be done to keep Canadians safe,” he said. A journalist asked if the prime minister fell sick after contracting the virus from his wife, was there a contingency plan? “There have always been contingency plans for ministers who are sick or even a prime minister who has fallen ill,” Trudeau replied. Another reporter asked how the prime minister and his family were coping under the circumstances. “Most of the morning the kids have been playing with Lego and my wife has been on the phone to friends and family,” he said, adding: “I have been on the phone with President Macron, with my cabinet and officials.” And what about the kids? Is anyone in the family worried about their health? “We are obviously having some very good conversations with our kids about what’s going on, about how not to be overly concerned, but to be a little bit concerned, which is obviously why they are home today with us,” Trudeau said.

Presidential Spokesman Salvador Panelo (OPS / MANILA BULLETIN) “Anytime today,” Presidential Spokesman Salvador Panelo said Saturday morning, when asked when the directives to government agencies and the public on the quarantine will be released. Panelo made the statement after the Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF) met to provide guidelines for the proper implementation of the “emergency but temporary” directives intended to address the spread of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the country. “The Palace shall issue a set of directives and their corresponding guidelines not just for compliance by government instrumentalities but more importantly, for the information of the public,” he said. “The evaluation of these aforesaid measures is being undertaken in order to ensure that the threat of COVID-19 is properly addressed with the least amount of burden upon the lives of our citizens,” he added. President Duterte announced Thursday evening that Metro Manila will be placed under community quarantine from March 15 to April 14 due to the COVID-19 outbreak. He said this was like a lockdown, but acknowledged that people “fear” the term used. “It’s just a matter of protecting and defending you from COVID-19. That’s about it. It has nothing to do with the power of the military or the police, nor my power or these guys beside me. It’s just an issue of protecting public interest,” he said. The President likewise tapped barangay executives to help the government by strictly implementing the directives. He, however, warned them of suspension or dismissal if they fail to enforce the resolution on COVID-19. “Simply not imposing a rule imposed by the government, you lose your position or dismiss and worst you will go to jail,” he said. “You better implement these. If not, you go to prison for dereliction of duty,” he added. During the 30-day community quarantine, land, domestic air, and domestic sea travel to and from NCR will be suspended. International travel into Metro Manila will be allowed, subject to travel restrictions. Filipinos flying home from abroad will be allowed, subject to quarantine restrictions Foreigners flying to their home countries abroad will also be allowed to leave but anyone flying to Ninoy Aquino International Airport from abroad will remain in Manila starting March 15. Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles said Friday exemptions on the entry and exit of cargo, goods, produce, patients seeking medical attention in Metro Manila, and workers in NCR but living outside the quarantined area will be among those included in the guidelines. The government will strictly prohibit mass gatherings of people including in places of worship, concerts, large seminars and conventions, sporting events, social gatherings, and even weddings.

CHO head Dr. Josephine Villafuerte confirmed this on Thursday’s iSpeak media forum that the public has engaged in panic-buying in the city as retailers could hardly replenish their shelves with supplies of alchohol, disinfectant sprays, hand sanitizers and toilet paper. “We can consider it as panic buying, since there have been insufficient supplies of alcohols wherever you go,” she said. She also said that some people have been asking for alcohol supplies in their office, however, she said that their supply was enough only for their personnel, especially those who are working in field. Villafuerte has also reminded the public to not be dependent on alcohol too much, stressing that frequent washing of hands continues to be the most effective way of staying safe from infection of the coronavirus. “If you don’t have alcohol because there has been a shortage of supply, then you can constantly wash your hands. The washing of hands is effective enough to disinfect your hands. Alcohols and sanitizers, as well as face masks only last for 24 hours,” she said. Villafuerte also took note that soaps have been most disregarded amid the panic-buying by the public. The Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), in a previous report, said that they were intensifying their monitoring activities to make sure that no retailer or trader will take advantage of the COVID-19 threat to unjustly increase their prices. Deolly Roque, the division chief of the DTI’s Consumer Protection Division said that they have sets of monitoring teams which are going around the region to monitor the prices of basic goods. They are checking retail stores, business establishments, convenience stores, and shopping malls to determine there are any artificial price increases. Tags: ncov"

War-torn Libya is largely divided between forces backing the Government of National Accord and those of eastern-based military commander Khalifa Haftar, who backs a rival administration in the country’s east. To date, no cases of COVID-19 have been reported by either adminstration, but experts fear an outbreak could be catastrophic due to the country’s degraded health system. Haftar’s forces have been battling since last April to seize the capital, and hundreds of schools were already closed since the start of the offensive due to the fighting. The battle has left over 1,000 people dead and displaced a further 150,000. Tags: ncov"

In a phone interview, Audan said the additional three PUIs came from different private hospitals in Davao City and Davao Occidental, and were referred to the SPMC for isolation. Audan said the plan to convert the two intensive care units (ICUs) into extension facilities of their isolation area came after seeing an increase in the number of patients who are being confined at the state hospital as PUIs. He said the ICU 1 could hold eight patients and 13 patients for ICU 2 at one time. Audan said the existing patients who are already confined at the ICU would be temporarily transferred to the separate facilities in SPMC’s Heart Institute, where they would continue to receive treatment, so that more PUIs could be accommodated. He said they would also tap other resident doctors from their different clinical departments to prove reinforcement to the frontline health workers who are doing the initial assessment of patients who manifest the symptoms of the COVID-19. He said the hospital uses the decision tools to classify persons under investigation such as presence of any symptoms of the disease like cough, fever, and difficulty of breathing; traveled to restricted countries with a high number of COVID-19 cases; or had direct contact with patients positive for COVID-19. He said at least 34 patients, mostly doctors who attended a convention in Manila, consulted with SPMC on Thursday. He added the increasing number of patients who seek consultation with SPMC necessitated the reinforcement of their other resident doctors. The two women who fled to Davao City on Thursday after escaping containment in Sarangani for novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have already been discharged on Friday or hours after they were turned over to SPMC, Audan said. Audan added the two have been sent back to their home in Sarangani and were recommended undergoing a “home quarantine.” One of the patients was considered a person under monitoring (PUM), while the other was a person under investigation (PUI) who was supposedly now on her 14th day in isolation, he said. Department of Health (DOH)-Davao director Annabelle Yumang told a press conference that the PUM patient did not manifest any symptoms while the PUI had met the three decision tools employed by the DOH such as showing any of the signs like cough, fever, and difficulty of breathing; traveled to restricted countries with a high number of COVID-19 cases; or had direct contact with patients positive for COVID-19.

Sainsbury’s in Charlton had neither pasta nor toilet paper on Friday. Waitrose in the Canary Wharf financial district had neither pasta nor toilet paper on Thursday night. British supermarket bosses have urged people not to panic and said that they can keep shelves stocked but anecdotal evidence from across London indicates many people are hoarding basics. British supermarket group Morrisons said on Friday it planned to pay its smaller suppliers within 48 hours to help them get through the outbreak. The British government has faced questions over why it is not yet taking the more stringent measures seen in many other countries. Prime Minister Boris Johnson defended his approach, saying the government was following scientific advice and would “do the right thing at the right time”.

Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton was in the United States last week for a meeting with members of the FiveEyes intelligence alliance — Australia, the United States, Britain, Canada and New Zealand — that included Barr. He also met with US President Donald Trump’s daughter Ivanka on March 6, according to a photo posted by the Australian embassy in Washington, which shows the pair standing close together. It is not yet known when Dutton contracted the virus. “This morning I woke up with a temperature and sore throat,” said Dutton, an influential member of the government and a key architect of Australia’s controversial immigration laws. “It is the policy of Queensland Health that anyone who tests positive is to be admitted into hospital and I have complied with their advice.” Dutton said he feels “fine” but his diagnosis will raise concerns about whether other members of the cabinet and Prime Minister Scott Morrison may have been infected. The prime minister’s office confirmed Friday that Dutton attended a cabinet meeting on Tuesday, but other participants would not be quarantined. “Only people who had close contact with the minister in the preceding 24 hours before he became symptomatic need to self-isolate,” a spokesman said. “That does not include the Prime Minister or any other members of the Cabinet.” In contrast, New Zealand Internal Affairs Minister Tracey Martin — who also met Dutton in Washington — has self-isolated and will get tested for the virus on Saturday, local media reported. Morrison will no longer attend a rugby match on Saturday night after earlier saying he would even as he announced a bar on gatherings of more than 500 people. Dutton is among 184 people in Australia who have been confirmed as having COVID-19. He is just the latest in a string of political figures around the world to suffer a scare. Brazil’s President Jair Bolsonaro has been tested for the virus after a top aide was diagnosed with the disease following a trip to the US during which both met with Trump. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is in quarantine for two weeks after his wife tested positive for the virus. British MP Nadine Dorries, a junior health minister who helped craft legislation to fight the contagion, is also infected. Several US lawmakers have isolated themselves after attending a conservative conference in late February. The White House has insisted Trump does not need testing, despite interactions with several people who have been exposed to the virus, saying “only people with prolonged close exposure to confirmed positive cases should self-quarantine.” READ MORE: World Health Organization describes coronavirus outbreak as pandemic   Tags: ncov"
,"March 13, 2020, 6:06 PM",nCov,EU to give states spending leeway to tackle virus fallout on economy,By Reuters,"By Reuters BRUSSELS – The European Commission is set to formally announce on Friday measures that would let EU governments spend more freely to prop up economic sectors battered by the coronavirus crisis, officials said.  European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen holds a news conference in Brussels, Belgium, March 9, 2020. (REUTERS/Francois Lenoir/FILE PHOTO/MANILA BULLETIN) The move would give a green light to deficit spending already announced by Italy, the European Union country worst hit so far by the outbreak. It would also offer states traditionally reticent to spend, like Germany, a new argument to unlock financial resources in what could be a coordinated fiscal boost at EU level. Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and the vice-president for economic affairs, Valdis Dombrovskis, are set to unveil the widely anticipated measures at a news conference at 1 p.m. (1200 GMT). Following an emergency video-conference with EU leaders on Tuesday, von der Leyen has already announced some of the key proposals, which include the use of existing EU funds to help ailing sectors and more flexibility on fiscal rules and state aid regulations for governments. Von der Leyen is also expected to propose a plan to provide cheap loans to firms at risk of collapse because of the coronavirus crisis. Under EU fiscal rules, the bloc’s governments are required to keep their budget deficit below 3 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) and have to reduce their debt if it is above 60 percent of GDP. The rules already allow states to spend more in emergency circumstances. The commission is expected to restate this principle, clearly saying the coronavirus outbreak warrants exceptional spending. EU state aid rules limit governments to pour public money into failing companies, but they also allow emergency support under certain circumstances. The commission is set to confirm that these subsidy rules will be temporarily relaxed to fight the downturn caused by the virus, after EU antitrust commission Margrethe Vestager said on Tuesday that Brussels was open to compensation for ailing firms. During the 2008/09 global financial crisis, a similar softening of fiscal and state subsidy rules allowed governments to spend hundreds of billions of euros to bail out banks and revive the economy. For these measures to be effective it is, however, crucial that governments with larger financial power, like Germany, are willing to spend more and in a coordinated fashion. Tags: ncov"

Authorities conduct A lockdown dry-run in Manila.(ALI VICOY / MANILA BULLETIN) The joint task force led by the Philippine National Police (PNP) conducted a closed-door meeting Friday at the national headquarters (NHQ) in Camp Crame, Quezon City to iron out the details of the lockdown which will start on March 15, according to Maj. Gen. Benigno Durana, the Directorate for Police Community Relations (DPCR) and acting PNP spokesperson. The lockdown was ordered by President Duterte in a public address on Thursday night to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Aside from the PNP, the members of the JTF include the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) and Philippine Coast Guard (PCG). “‘Yung ating iba’t-ibang police precincts lalo sa Metro Manila ay nag-pre-position na ng mga assets, kagamitan, at tauhan para i-enforce ‘yung community quarantine by March 15. Sa ngayon, ‘yung joint AFP, PNP, at Coast Guard joint plan at ‘yung mga guidelines at protocols kung paano ito ipapatupad, ay fina-finalize sa NHQ,” Durana said.

Right now, the AFP, PNP, and Coast Guard joint plan, including the guidelines and protocols on how [the lockdown] will be implemented, are being finalized at the NHQ.) Checkpoints As much as possible, Durana said “all” the entrance and exit points to and from Metro Manila will be covered by checkpoints. However, the details of where and how many checkpoints will be established have yet to be finalized by the joint task force. “Malaking tulong ang local chief executives lalo sa barangay level, para makipagtulungan at ma-implement natin ito, ‘yung extraordinary measures ng pamahalaaan to protect and safeguard our residents against this deadly virus,” he said. (The local chief executives, especially at the barangay level, will be of big help to implement this extraordinary measures of the national government to protect and safeguard our residents against this deadly virus.) For his part, Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana said the military will be “in the support role” in the implementation of the lockdown. Guidelines Included in the guidelines that are being ironed out are the number of policemen who will man each checkpoint and the manner they will carry out the inspection of every individual who enters and leaves Metro Manila. While Durana refused to provide concrete details on these matters, he said the joint task force will likely follow the PNP’s police operational procedures in conducting checkpoints. According to Rule 20 of the PNP’s Revised Police Operational Procedures, the establishment of checkpoints “must always be authorized by the PNP and manned by uniformed PNP personnel assigned in the area.” However, no information was indicated as to the number of personnel needed at every checkpoint. “Pero (But) this time, ang (the) checkpoint is not to prevent crime, it is to prevent the movement and spread of the virus. Kaya may (That’s why we have) equipment na gagamitin (to use), protocols,” Durana explained. Policemen manning checkpoints will be required to wear personal protective equipment (PPE), Durana said. Movement in and out of Metro Manila Those who are exempted from the lockdown, like workers living in nearby provinces but who work in Metro Manila, will undergo a “stringent screening process” such as thermal scanning. According to Interior and Local Government Secretary Eduardo Ano, workers will have to present their work IDs so that they can enter Metro Manila. “‘Yung hindi essential to enter Metro Manila, pagbabawalan po sila (Those who are not essential to enter Metro Manila, they will be barred entry),” Durana said. Cops were told to exercise maximum tolerance in dealing with uncooperative residents, Durana said. However, he added that part of the guidelines being finalized include scenarios where a policeman can arrest an uncooperative resident. “Ang aming work philosophy, kakampi niyo ang PNP at kasama namin ang AFP at PCG para labanan itong COVID-19,” Durana said.
(Our work philosophy is that, the PNP is an ally of the public, along with the AFP and PCG to fight COVID-19.) “The ultimate and primary goal of this extraordinary measure of the government is to prevent the further spread of the virus and protect the health of citizens, protect them from contracting this deadly virus,” he also said. “We can win this fight against COVID-19 kung ang bawat isa ay makipagtulungan para sa best interest and safety of our citizens.” (We can win this fight if each of us will cooperate for the best interest and safety of our citizens.)

And it is only under state of calamity that they will be able to utilize the quick respond funds,” Belmonte said. The amount of emergency funds that the city needs is to be discussed yet, according to Belmonte. She said, what is important now “is that the barangay can now access their quick response. “As result of that, [they] are no longer dependent on the city government for their needs and no longer dependent on very long bidding process,” she added. “The state of calamity now allows the city and the abranhgys to engage in emergency procurement,” Belmonte noted. Belmonte said that she urged the city council to conduct a special session to come up with a resolution declaring the city under state of calamity. The Thursday’s session resulted in the creation of Resolution No. 11 Series of 2020, which declares “a state of calamity in Quezon City due to a coronavirus disease of 2019 outbreak, in relation to inter-agency task force for the management of emerging infectious disease.” As part of preventive measure against COVID-19, Belmonte said that she already made a list of guidelines on jail facilities, mass gatherings, fiesta, medical mission, graduation rites and other ceremonies, among others.

,"March 13, 2020, 5:47 PM",nCov,DepEd: Use of social media for learning still ‘discouraged’ despite COVID-19 threat,By Merlina Hernando-Malipot ,"By Merlina Hernando-Malipot  The Department of Education (DepEd) remains firm on its stand to highly discourage the use of social media platforms for learning while classes are suspended due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). DepEd Undersecretary for Administration Alain Pascua told the Manila Bulletin that the agency does not promote the use of social media platforms as a means of communication for learners and teachers during cancelled classes.  Education Undersecretary Alain Del Pascua(Alain Del Pascua official Facebook page / MANILA BULLETIN) “Still no [because] we are introducing DepEd Commons,” Pascua said when asked if DepEd will now allow the use of social media platforms such as Facebook Messenger, among others, so that teachers can give school-related updates to their students while classes are suspended. DepEd Commons allows the free use of teaching and learning content from around the world. Topics vary from arts, business, mathematics, science, social sciences K to 12, and higher education. Its objective is to provide free access to educational resources to teachers and learners. Pascua explained the agency will also utilize DepEd Commons to respond to the challenges of the current COVID-19 situation related to education sector. In the National Capital Region (NCR) for instance, where classes have been declared suspended for over a month starting March 10 to April 12, schools at the basic education level are expected to make adjustments on the conduct of the 4th quarter examinations scheduled next week on a staggered basis. Pascua noted that in the case of Metro Manila schools, schools can administer “online examination” among students using DepEd Commons since users have better access to the Internet. “The teachers can administer lessons for the remaining quarter and students can take examination online, especially those who are not satisfied with the transmutation formula used to compute their class standing,” he said. In June last year, DepEd discouraged the use of social media in the classroom. Pascua, in a memorandum, explained why the department discourages the use of social media in classrooms. “While social media are the easiest mediums to deliver information in this digital age using the latest on-hand technologies, the use of the platform also opens one’s identity to the world wide web, making young learners exposed to different cyber threats,” he said. Even though social media may be considered the “brightest innovation of this era,” Pascua urged educators to “look at the bigger picture, where the reality is that social media in itself is not the proper medium for schools to use, especially in connection [with] the delivery of lessons especially since there are many options specifically designed for educational use.” Given this, DepEd noted that there are existing open-source Learning Management Systems (LMS) that schools can use to support the e-learning requirements of an institution. DepEd also introduced the use of open educational resources (OER) to promote “equitable and quality education” to all Filipino learners. OERs refer to free and/or available educational materials that come with the permission for anyone to use, modify or share. “The use of OER results in tremendous cost savings to benefit families of students as well as impact their performance and completion rates in school,” Pascua explained. Meanwhile, the Federation of Associations of Private Schools and Administrators (FAPSA) urged DepEd to implement and strengthen home-based programs. Students, the group said, can also rely on tablet education. “Indeed it is time to use e-books in schools and DepEd needs to take e-books and online learning seriously,” FAPSA President Eleazardo Kasilag said.

However, he noted that senators comprising nearly half of the Senate may not attend the special session because they have decided to go on self-quarantine. “Timing is good, we are on break,” Romero stressed. Romero said that as added precautionary measure, it is advisable for the House of Representatives to declare a long holiday for employees. He noted that Secretary General Jose Luis Montales announced on Thursday night that a House employee has been found positive for COVID 19. Montales said an employee of the chamber’s printing department is currently confined in an undisclosed hospital due to coronavirus infection. This development gives another strong argument for the House leadership to declare a 14-day holiday while the declaration of a special session is being awaited. The House official pointed out that special session may not be advisable in the next two weeks because senators representing nearly half of the Senate have volunteered to undergo the 14-day self-quarantine protocol. “I suggest majority of us, our staff and administrative personnel  should be allowed to observe the 14-day self-quarantine starting March 15 to prepare ourselves for the special session,” said Romero. “A skeletal work force can be tapped to hold fort and address urgent legislative work while others can be assigned to work from home,” the 1-Pacman Party-list lawmaker said.

Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) Secretary Ramon Lopez (ALBERT ALCAIN/PPD / MANILA BULLETIN) Trade Secretary Ramon Lopez said providing temporary living quarters for employees would help limit the movement of the people to and from Metro Manila. Under the community quarantine, the government will impose a ban on land, domestic air, and sea travel in Metro Manila starting March 15 to curb the spread of the coronavirus. The transport of food and other cargo in and out of Metro Manila will be allowed as business operations will continue on flexible work arrangements. “Isa rin pong nakikita naming mga coping mechanism dito, I’m sure iyong ibang kumpanya will just encourage their people, their employees to find a place muna dito sa Metro Manila, umupa muna sila para less ang movement ng tao (One of the coping mechanisms we see is, I’m sure the companies will just encourage their people, their employees to find a place in Metro Manila. They can rent a place to reduce the movement of people),” Lopez said in a Palace press briefing Friday. Lopez said companies could shoulder the rental fees for their employees at least while the community quarantine is in effect in Metro Manila. “Actually ito naman puwedeng gawin ng employers na sila na ang kusa nila mag-upa lang ng kwarto. Sagot na nila bedspacing, hindi naman ganoon kalaki, kung gusto nila tulungan ang nagtatrabaho sa kanila (Actually the employers can rent rooms, bedspaces, this doesn’t have to be costly, if they want to help their workers),” he said. “I think mga negosyante, malalaki naman ‘yan na pwede tulungan ang kanilang empeyado kung minimize lang ang movement in and out of the workers. Pero kung wala talaga, go through the process (I think these large businesses can help their workers if only to minimize the in and out movement of the workers. But if they can’t, the workers must go through the process),” he said. Lopez said Metro Manila workers living in the provinces would be allowed inside the National Capital Region (NCR) despite the community quarantine. He said these workers would be required to show their company identification cards for entry into NCR. “We would require them to issue IDs to their employees, lalo na those living outside Metro Manila, or show proof of employment,” he said. All manufacturing, retail, and service establishments shall remain in operation as long as strict social distancing measures are observed, Lopez said. He added that employers in the private sector are urged to consider flexible work arrangements. Businesses could deploy a skeletal workforce at the office while others work from home. “Banks will be open, offices, factories, mga manufacturing, operations will continue.

Agriculture Secretary Dr. William D. Dar (KEVIN TRISTAN ESPIRITU / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN) But on the possible worst case scenario, with retailers no longer willing to sell food amid the pandemic, Agriculture Secretary William Dar didn’t offer anything concrete but said, “let’s pray that it’s not going to happen”. On Friday, Dar said the Department of Agriculture (DA) is now finalizing the crafting of the agency’s ‘Food Resiliency Action Plan’ amid the rising cases of COVID-19 in the Philippines. “As the country confronts the COVID-19 pandemic, we at the DA will make sure the sufficient and continuous supply of basic food commodities will be available in the public markets for the benefit of all family households, particularly in depressed communities,” said Dar. “For our basic staple, rice, our current inventory stored at various NFA [National Food Authority] warehouses nationwide is good for at least 80 days. And this will be further augmented by the current harvest this dry season, providing additional stocks for another two to three more months,” he added. Based on the draft of the action plan, a supply of about 929,358 metric tons (MT) will be made available for Metro Manila for the next 35 weeks. To be specific, for the expected demand of 26,241 MT of rice per week, there would be supply of about 55,586 MT per week coming from Regions 2 and 3. Dar explained that “movements of goods and services will not be impeded” despite the imposed “community quarantine” in Metro Manila. This means that food and agriculture products coming from the province can still enter the capital. “It was categorically mentioned by the President,” Dar said. “We will make sure that these products will pass [municipal borders] without any interference”. Other than rice, Dar assured that there will be enough basic food items like pork, chicken, eggs, other poultry products, fish, vegetables, fruits, sugar, and cooking oil for Metro Manila. For vegetables and root crops, Metro Manila’s demand is expected to be around 5,000 per week, while the weekly supply is going to be 17,302 MT coming from the Cordillera Administrative Region (CAR), Regions 2, 3, and 4-A. For poultry and meat, the demand is 7,934 MT per week, while there is going to be a supply of 11,074 MT from Regions 2 and 3. Meanwhile, demand for fish is forecast to be 8,000 MT per week, while the supply stands at 10,264 MT per week coming from Philippine Fisheries Development Authority (PFDA), Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR), Regions 1, 3, and 4-B. As for eggs, the demand would be 25 million pieces per week, with supply seen at 42.5 million pieces coming from Regions 3 and 4-A, while Metro Manila’s demand for sugar stood at 5,250 kilograms per week, which will be supplied with 1.58 million MT locally produced sugar as per Sugar Regulatory Administration (SRA). Dar said that with the implementation of the food action plan, the government will make sure that all the food supplies coming from these provinces will be distributed fairly across all areas in Metro Manila, adding that the agency’s Kadiwa stores will remain operational in the next weeks to come. This, while the suggested retail price (SRP) on select food items like pork, chicken and fish will still be effective. “There’s no need to hoard or buy too much because that will disrupt the marketing process,” Dar said. “The bottomline is we have determined that there will be enough supply for Metro Manila”. Right now, the DA is still trying to find out how to proceed with the distribution of farm interventions such as seeds and machinery to farmers amid the spread of COVID-19. “If we can deliver the seeds without big gatherings, we will do it. The distribution will continue,” Dar said. Dar is also expecting the pandemic to have an impact on the country’s total agriculture growth this year, but no longer provided details. (With a report from Alexandria Dennise San Juan)   Tags: ncov"

Aside from Metro Manila, police units in Central Luzon, Calabarzon (Cavite, Laguna, Batangas, Rizal, and Quezon), Mimaropa (Mindoro Oriental and Occidental, Marinduque, Romblon, and Palawan) and Bicol region were also placed under full alert. Full alert is equivalent to the military’s red alert status, which means all uniformed policemen and all police resources must be available for specific peace and order tasks. A memorandum issued on Thursday and signed by Maj. Gen. Emmanuel Luis Licup, head of the Directorate for Operations, referred to President Duterte’s Proclamation No. 922 and the raising of the COVID-19 alert to Code Red Sublevel 2 as the basis for the declaration of full alert. Proclamation No. 922 declares a state of public health emergency throughout the Philippines. “In this regard, Full Alert Status has been declared to NCRPO, PROs (Police Regional Offices) 3, 4A (CALABARZON), 4B (MIMAROPA), and 5 effective 1 a.m. on March 13, 2020,” the police memorandum read. “Other PROs shall have the discretion to raise their alert level depending on the prevailing situation in respective AORs (Areas of Responsibilities),” it added. Licup said they will also activate the Police Reactionary Standby Support Force (RSSF) in case there is a need for police augmentation of local police units in response to the COVID-19 threat. Brig. Gen. Alex Sintin was tasked to head the RSSF on COVID-19. The Philippine National Police (PNP) was among the agencies tapped to implement the “community quarantine” of Metro Manila. Part of this measure was to restrict travel to and from the nation’s capital to slow down the spread of the virus.

Commission on Higher Education Logo (PhCHED Facebook / MANILA BULLETIN) “The Commission appeals to the officials of these hospitals to exercise leniency during this difficult time and explore alternative modes that will continue the medical training and education of their students without compromising their safety,” Chairman J. Prospero De Vera III said. According to De Vera, CHED has been receiving reports that some hospitals with confirmed COVID-19 cases are requiring students to continue their rotation studies. De Vera added that these medical institutions are also warning students that failure to comply will result in their having to repeat their internship program. “Nakikiusap kami sa mga ospital, huwag pilitin ang mga medical student interns na mag-duty. Hindi pa naman sila talaga medical professionals (We are asking these hospitals not to force medical interns to be on duty. They are not yet medical professionals),” he emphasized. The country’s higher education commission earlier issued additional guidelines in a bid to curb the spread of the disease among higher education institutions (HEIs), including the suspension of on-the-job trainings (OJT), internships, and practicum of students in the National Capital Region. In the addendum, CHED urged HEIs to coordinate with their partner host training establishment for any adjustment of training hours or to consider alternative modes for OJT, internships, and practicum of affected students. In a public address on Thursday, President Duterte announced that the Philippines has raised Code Red Sub-Level 2 due to the COVID-19 threat, adding that tougher measures will be in place to combat the spread of the disease, which includes an extended suspension of classes in Metro Manila for at least a month. In the third advisory released by the commission for its guidelines against COVID-19, De Vera urged HEIs to “deploy available distance learning, e-learning, and other alternative modes of delivery in lieu of residential learning if they have the resources to do so.” CHED also told tertiary institutions to exercise their discretion to postpone graduation ceremonies, if needed, and implement “extraordinary and swift measures to address the needs of students, employees, and other stakeholders arising from COVID-related issues.” Meanwhile, De Vera added that heads of private HEIs outside the capital region are authorized to suspend classes, if needed, but are directed to inform and coordinate with CHED and its regional offices. The commission also reminded state universities and colleges that they must discuss measures to be undertaken with their respective Board of Regents and inform the CHED regional office of such action.

These are among the many efforts that government and church leaders made after the President announced the raising of the alert level to Code Red Sublevel 2 Thursday night after a lengthy cabinet meeting.  Authorities conduct a lockdown dry-run in Manila.(ALI VICOY / MANILA BULLETIN) In Manila In Manila, the city government allocated P227.5-million to provide meals to thousands of families who may be affected by the month-long Metro Manila lockdown from March 15 to April 14 to prevent the spread of the coronavirus-2019 (COVID-19). Manila City Mayor Francisco “Isko Moreno” Domagoso said during his city address on Friday that about 350,000 families will be given meals thrice a day should the situation worsen. Furthermore, the city government has a supply of 105,600 canned goods; 81,600 bottled water; and 6,600 packs of 3 kilograms of rice, that can be distributed to families in need. Vitamin C and B Complex supplements will also be acquired by the city government for senior citizens living in Manila, the city mayor added. Domagoso also said that a P12.9-million fund was allocated to acquire more disinfection equipment for hospitals in the Philippine capital. Six units of disinfection systems worth P4.2 million, three units of air purification machines worth P7.5 million, and 196 bottles of disinfection solution worth P1.2 million were purchased by the city government, the local chief executive said. The Manila Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (MDRRMO) regularly conducts misting operations in places with heavy foot traffic in the city for airborne and pavement disinfection. So far, the MDRRMO has led misting operations in the Manila City Hall, along the University belt, public hospitals, 16 out of 17 public markets, and Quiapo Church. In Taguig The local government unit (LGU) of Taguig City urged its residents to limit their movements in a bid to stop the spread of the virus. “We are asking all citizens and stakeholders of the city to limit movements to essential travel and emergencies. Limiting movement is not mandatory but it is highly suggested as we believe that the National Capital Region is ultimately interlinked as families often have one member working or studying in a nearby city. This infection, in one National Capital Region (NCR) city, affects all cities,” the city government said. Citing the data of the Department of Health (DOH), Taguig said it has only one confirmed case of COVID-19. Read more: Taguig LGU calls on residents to limit movements It also urged those working in Taguig but living outside the city to make arrangements with their employers “as entry and exit to NCR will be limited based on President Duterte’s orders on the suspension of travel to and from Metro Manila.” “For businesses, offices, and workspaces based in the city, we ask that you prepare work-from-home options and other flexible arrangements that would keep your workers from interacting with other people. Keep your workers interacting at a minimal level.” Sanitizing motorbancas, lifejackets Meanwhile, the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) is preparing to disinfect passenger ships, including life jackets to keep travelers safe against the virus. All district units under the organization were directed to implement massive sanitation of motorbancas, passenger ships, and lifejackets as a precautionary measure against the dreaded disease. “We receive concerns from regular motorbanca passengers about the cleanliness and safety of lifejackets handed over to them for usage. Hence, we directed our personnel to ensure that lifejackets are sanitized before and after usage to protect the health of the riding public,” said Commodore Armando Balilo, Cast Guard spokesman. Daily sanitation of motorbancas, as well as the availability of hand sanitizers or alcohol at port terminals will also be monitored by Coast Guard men on site. PCG safety inspectors were also directed to implement regular sanitation of passenger ships, specifically on areas that are usually occupied by the riding public and crew members. Port state control officers, on the other hand, had been instructed to continue massive monitoring of foreign vessels coming from China, Macau, Hong Kong, and other COVID-19 infected countries. ‘Put our trust in God’ The faithful were urged yesterday to put their “trust in God more” amid the lockdown imposed in Metro Manila. In his homily during a mass held at the Our Lady of Veritas Chapel in Quezon City, Rev. Fr. Arlo Yap cited the need for the public to heed the advice of the experts on protecting oneself from the viral disease. “The best thing to do in these times is to trust in God’s merciful heart more as we listen to the recommendations of the expert against COVID-19,” the priest said. “Let us wash our hands often. Use 70 percent alcohol or hand sanitizer, and follow the guidelines set by the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of the Philippines for churchgoers,” Yap added. “Let us raise our hopes and put our trust in our loving God. Don’t give up your faith,” he said. The priest urged the faithful to follow the orders of the authorities and to pray more for the safety and protection of the Filipino people.

Risa Hontiveros, Senate Minority Leader Franklin M. Drilon, Sen. Leila de Lima, and Sen. Francis N. Pangilinan (MANILA BULLETIN) 1. Food supply — What about the entry and exit of trucks carrying food and other supplies to and from NCR ports, and wet markets, supermarkets, and other retail outlets? What happens to the scheduled arrival of semi-perishable and perishable goods estimated at billions of pesos during the lockdown period? Will these goods be diverted? Will these shipping entries be exempt from the lockdown? 2. COVID updates — How many have been monitored through contact tracing of those who have tested positive for COVID? What is the status of the travel ban to and from China, given reports that flights from China continue and that Bacolod has allowed all vessels from China, Hong Kong, and Macau to dock at its seaports? 3. Jobs — If entry to and exit from NCR is restricted, what happens to the estimated four million non-Metro Manila residents from Laguna, Cavite, Rizal, Bulacan, and even Pampanga who work in Metro Manila? DILG Secretary Año has made some exceptions in the media after the President’s announcement on the lockdown but protocols for these should be made clear. 4. Informal settlements — How do we address the issue of close contact among people in informal settlements? 5. Intra-NCR travel and mass transit — If Metro Manila is locked down, can residents move freely within the metropolis? What are the protocols for MRT and LRT riders? For padyak, tricycle, Angkas/habal-habal, jeepney, van, and bus riders? Will the government deploy more trains? Ease permits and franchises for other modes of transport? 6. Hazmat suits for military and police — 40,000 troops who do not have hazmat suits are reported to be deployed to enforce the lockdown. How will they be protected from the virus? How will their deployment cut the transmission of the virus? 7. Economy — What is NEDA’s plan to make the economy resilient and able to immediately bounce back from the economic shocks brought by the pandemic? “The challenge is to minimize the infection. We must do everything we can to prevent the situation where the growing number of COVID-19 patients overwhelms our entire healthcare workforce, ‘’ the bloc said. “The rate at which the COVID-19 cases multiply each day poses a very serious threat. If we fail to arrest the increase, our healthcare system, no matter how equipped it is, will face difficulty in dealing with COVID-19 cases,” it added. “With the increasing cases of COVID infections, we are willing to help work with the administration to enact emergency legislation needed so that government can respond more quickly to the crisis, as well as propose science-based and multi-sectoral, and people-centered and vulnerable-focused actions on these areas: 1. Communication 2. Necessities Buy from local farmers and producers. 3. Medical services Prioritize the safety of our frontline health workers, both in government and private sector, by ensuring that they are given the support and protection they need. We acknowledge and deeply appreciate their dedication. All hospitals, private and public, including rural health units, should be empowered to respond to COVID-19 case. We also laud the quick action by the PhilHealth in shouldering the testing and hospitalization of COVID-19 patients and persons under investigation. 4. Enforce, expand, and encourage social distancing Business establishments should allow telecommuting, work-from-home, and other means that can help minimize the risk of spreading the virus. Provide additional medical leaves and other support for self-quarantine of government and private employees. No penalty for COVID-vulnerable doing self-quarantine. Consider additional leaves as donation similar to during a disaster. 5. Budget and other resources Similar to Italy, help small entrepreneurs cope with diminished economic activity. For example, commercial space owners may give rent discounts to mall stall owners; and government may extend deadlines for BIR, SSS employer contributions, and other government payments; and/or partly subsidize these payments. 6.

She added DTI was continuously monitoring the inventory level of big supermarkets. “The level of prime and basic commodities in supermarkets can sustain requirements of consumers for at least 30 days, 15 days for medium scale and three days for the small scale. “It is also been observed that there’s an immediate replenishment of goods” she added.

President Duterte’s issuance of a proclamation on March 8, declaring the country under a state of the public health emergency meant that the price of basic commodities has been automatically frozen. Persons or store owners who plan to hoard goods and resell these at higher prices will be tagged as violators of law and shall be punished accordingly, according to Ordonio. Governor Dennis “Delta” Pineda announced that there was still enough supply of commodities in the province and that there was nothing to worry about. “Panic buying is a non-essential reaction of people that should be addressed in public,” he said. “Wag muna po kayong mag worry, wag muna po kayong mag panic-buying nakikiusap po ako sa inyo” [Don’t worry, no need to panic-buying, I am pleading withyou],” he added.

The pads, plasters, and tape protect their faces from painful sores that can develop as they tend to coronavirus patients for hours on end.

He also did not say if the new case was included in the latest tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 announced by the Department of Health (DOH). As of 4 p.m. Friday, there were 52 cases of COVID-19 in the Philippines after the DOH announced three more cases on Thursday. Meanwhile, Zamora issued a statement Friday after reports of a 51-year-old woman with COVID-19 allegedly tried to escape treatment after she found out she tested positive for the disease. The reports, which cited a police official, said that authorities chased after the female patient for two hours before she was convinced to allow herself to be confined in an another hospital. Asked for a confirmation, San Juan City Police chief Col. Jaime Santos said he will not answer questions about the matter because the mayor has released a statement about it. In his statement, the mayor said the woman went to a private hospital she preferred to be confined in when it was confirmed that she tested positive for COVID-19. Zamora said the woman was included in the earlier eight confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the city. “However, the hospital could not accommodate her anymore so the City Health Office and the PNP (Philippine National Police) escorted her to a different hospital for immediate treatment,” he said. In a separate phone interview, the mayor said it took a while for the city health personnel and police officers to convince the patient to come with them because she insisted on being admitted to the hospital she preferred. “The personnel who accompanied the patient were wearing personal protective equipment so they would not be infected with the disease,” Zamora told the Manila Bulletin. He said the patient is “now in stable condition and receiving proper care and treatment.” The mayor added that the patient is currently confined at a government hospital outside the city.

With cases falling in China and soaring abroad, Beijing is now rejecting the widely held assessment that the city of Wuhan is the birthplace of the outbreak. (AFP / STR / MANILA BULLETIN) The spat comes as China tries to deflect blame for the contagion and reframe itself as a country that took decisive steps to buy the world time by placing huge swathes of its population under quarantine. With cases falling in China and soaring abroad, Beijing is now rejecting the widely held assessment that the city of Wuhan is the birthplace of the outbreak. Foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian went a step further on Thursday, saying on Twitter that “it might be US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan” — without providing evidence. He doubled down on his claim on Friday by posting a link to an article from a website known for publishing conspiracy theories about the 9/11 attacks. Censors usually vigilant against rumours have also allowed Chinese social media users to spread similar claims about the US being behind the virus. A video showing a US health official saying some flu victims were posthumously diagnosed as having had COVID-19 was among the top searched items on China’s Twitter-like Weibo this week, with some users saying it was evidence the virus originated in the US. Zhao posted the clip on Twitter. Dali Yang, a political science professor at the University of Chicago, said he believes Zhao was “tweeting in his official capacity”. China’s intention in promoting the conspiracy theory is “to divert from domestic discontent” over the handling of the outbreak, which has killed more than 3,100 people in the country. The push to question the origin of the disease contradicts China’s own initial assessment about the source of the virus, which has now killed nearly 5,000 people worldwide. Gao Fu, head of China’s Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said in January “we now know the source of the virus is wild animals sold at the seafood market” in Wuhan. Chinese authorities themselves saw Wuhan and the rest of Hubei province as a threat as they placed the region of 56 million people under strict quarantine to contain the epidemic. But Beijing began sowing doubts in late February, when Zhong Nanshan, a respected expert affiliated with the National Health Commission, told reporters “the epidemic first appeared in China, but didn’t necessarily originate in China.” Scientists, however, have long suspected that the virus jumped from an animal at the Wuhan market to a human before spreading globally. The World Health Organization has said that while the exact path the virus took between its animal source and humans is still unclear, COVID-19 was “unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019”. Christl Donnelly, a professor of statistical epidemiology at Imperial College London, said genetic analysis of coronavirus samples collected from around the world shows a common ancestor in China, “This is not in any way blaming a particular country,” she told AFP. The United States, meanwhile, has angered China by using language to directly link the virus to the country. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has called it the “Wuhan virus”, prompting China’s foreign ministry to reject the term as “despicable” and “disrespecting science”. Despite the protests, US President Donald Trump started a televised address to his nation on Wednesday by speaking about the outbreak “that started in China”. The WHO warns against naming infectious diseases in a way that encourages discrimination against ethnic groups. The Trump administration’s emphasis on the virus’ origin in China is “part of his dog-whistling politics,” said Australian National University researcher Yun Jiang. Robert O’Brien, the US national security adviser, on Wednesday insisted that the virus originated in Wuhan. Blaming the pandemic on an initial lack of cooperation from Chinese officials and a cover-up when the outbreak first emerged, O’Brien said this had “cost the world community two months to respond” to the threat. Beijing called his remarks “extremely immoral and also irresponsible”. China’s objections have extended to criticising anyone suggesting the virus originated in the country. Zhao said last week that journalists using the term “China virus” were “suggesting its origin without any supporting facts or evidence” and had “ulterior motives.” Jiang, the researcher, said that “by sowing doubts into people’s mind about where the virus originated, they’re trying to deflect part of the blame for the outbreak”.

Senate President Vicente “Tito” Sotto III(Ali Vicoy / MANILA BULLETIN) Senate President Vicente Sotto III said on Friday that work shall continue in the Upper Chamber, although employees will be on skeletal schedule. “I wish to assure our people that the Senate will continue to function and there will be no disruption in our mandate as public officials,” Sotto said. He ordered the heads of departments to ensure the continued operations of their respective offices and finish all pending works at “the fastest time.” Sotto said Senate employees will have to strictly comply with the precautionary measures set in place to ensure that their premises will stay COVID-19-free. He added that committee hearings will remain suspended until Metro Manila restrictions are lifted. President Duterte on Thursday night said local land, sea, and air travel to and from the National Capital Region shall be suspended starting March 15 to April 14 due to the local transmission of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), and the increasing number of positive cases and deaths due to the disease. The interagency task force formed by the government shall conduct a review of the lockdown on a daily basis. While saying he respects Duterte’s decision, Sotto admitted not being in favor of implementing a lockdown to address the COVID-19. “Preventing travel to and from Metro Manila with only 52 cases as this point is a textbook case of overreaction. This drastic measure will only result in panic and hoarding of goods,” Sotto said in a statement issued while the IATF was meeting Duterte Thursday night. “The poor and the vulnerable sectors will be heavily-disadvantaged under this scenario, as they don’t have the resources to cope with any shortage of food and other necessities, and the resulting inflation, if any,” he added.

Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles (Photo from Karlo Nograles / Facebook page / MANILA BULLETIN) Cabinet Secretary Carlos Nograles maintained that the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIAI) will stay open but travelers flying in from abroad will have to stay in Metro Manila until the domestic travel ban is lifted next month. President Duterte has placed Metro Manila on month-long community quarantine and imposed a domestic air, sea, and land travel ban starting March 15. The travel restrictions are among the latest government measures to curb the surging cases of the new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the National Capital Region (NCR). “Anyone flying in from abroad via NAIA (Ninoy Aquino International Airport) will remain in Metro Manila until the domestic travel ban is lifted, and again that begins on March 15,” Nograles said during a Palace press being. “If the ultimate destination is in the provinces, we suggest that you fly in via Clark, Cebu, and other airports not under quarantine. They can proceed to their ultimate destination in the provinces,” he added. The government also prohibited travelers from countries with local transmission of the virus from entering the country except for Filipinos and their families, permanent residents, and holders of diplomatic visas. The travel restrictions were announced by President Duterte during his public address on Thursday night. Nograles made it clear that “very strict and stringent travel restrictions” will be imposed on travelers coming from coronavirus-hit countries. He said Filipino citizens, including their foreign spouse and children, holders of permanent resident visas, and holders of diplomatic visas issued by the Philippine Government, are “welcome to the Philippines.” On international flights passing Metro Manila, the Palace official said those flights going to and coming from abroad will be allowed subject to the government’s travel restrictions. “If you are a Filipino citizen and you are coming from abroad, you will be allowed to come home, subject to strict quarantine guidelines,” he said. “On the other hand, foreign nationals who want to fly home from Metro Manila to their respective countries will be allowed to do so,” he added. The suspension of domestic travel will be reviewed on a daily basis and may be lifted earlier if the situation allows it, or extended further if the situation requires it, Nograles said. He said the government’s policy for international travelers will be fleshed out during the meeting of the interagency task force on the management of emerging infectious diseases. The country earlier banned foreign visitors from China, Hong Kong, Macau, and the South Korean province of North Gyeongsang as a precaution against the coronavirus. In his televised message on Thursday, the President assured that Filipinos from virus-hit countries will be allowed to return home. “Ang Pilipino, pati ‘yung pamilya niya (Filipinos and their families) — because they are Filipinos and this is their country, they are very much welcome to come back lalo na sa panahong ito (especially at this time) if they want a more secure, comfortable place,” he said. The President urged foreign diplomats to limit their travel to avoid infection, saying he does not want any headache from foreigners. “With regards to itong mga diplomat, ah hindi naman kailangang-kailangang papasukin ‘yan sila. Tutal kung sabihin lang rin sa kanila ‘wag kayong lumabas diyan sa embassy ninyo, ‘wag kayong magpasyal-pasyal, diyan lang kayo (With regards to the diplomats, they don’t have to be allowed entry. Besides, if they are told not to leave their embassies, then don’t travel and instead stay there),” Duterte said. “Kasi baka kayo pa ang magdala ng sakit ng ulo sa aking bayan (Because you just might give headache to my country). I don’t mind Filipinos giving me a headache. But I certainly do not want anybody other than Filipinos to be giving me headaches,” he added. Tags: ncov"

In a text message on Friday, Vega said the government hospital, which is the only medical facility recognized by the National Reference Laboratory as a satellite laboratory for Mindanao, was just waiting for the arrival of “reagent kits” from the Department of Health (DOH). “These (reagent kits) are the things needed to test the virus. That’s what we need,” he said. He explained that SPMC was the only hospital in Mindanao equipped with a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) machine that allows real-time diagnosis of COVID-19 and other infectious diseases. “Any time it (reagent kits) will arrive from Manila, it’s given to us. We are ready,” he said. He said that, once these reagents arrive, hospitals all over Mindanao could “send swabs” taken from suspected COVID-19 patients to SPMC, instead of the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) in Manila, for diagnosis. He said it usually takes 48 to 72 hours before they get laboratory results from the RITM, but once SPMC becomes capable hospitals could expect immediate results since diagnosis using the PCR machine was “real-time.” “It’s easier because it’s in Mindanao; it becomes easier to transmit the data. It’s difficult when testing is centralized at the RITM because you have to send it via a courier. It takes a long process to do that 48 to 72 before results would come out,” he said. He added that if testing is done in Mindanao, the “diagnosis and identification” of COVID-19 positive patients would be more “efficient.” Vega added the SPMC was capable of handling PUIs, noting that the state-owned tertiary hospital was equipped with “depressurized” containment facility that could hold a maximum of 10 patients, materials, and trained personnel to take care of the patients.

Housing and Urban Development Coordinating Council (HUDCC) chair Eduardo del Rosario(PCOO / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN) “There will be continuing public service, normal functions of the department will be done with adequate workforce to address the concerns of our stakeholders,” Secretary Del Rosario assured. In the emergency meeting, it was agreed upon that DHSUD officials and employees will be reporting for work at least two days per week starting Monday until April 12. It means that at least 50% of the total DHSUD workforce will render service anytime four days a week except on Wednesday. Officials with the rank of directors and up are obliged to report on Mondays and Thursdays while Division Chiefs are encouraged to work on Tuesdays and Fridays during the period while the rank and file employees will be distributed accordingly to provide support to their respective officials. Secretary Del Rosario directed DHSUD officials to divide their respective personnel in the four-day workweek set up to ensure the physical presence of manpower. Wednesday was designated as fumigation day, apart from the weekend to ensure that the DHSUD premises are disinfected regularly. Secretary Del Rosario, however, stressed that DHSUD personnel are tasked to work from home during their three-day physical absence from their respective offices and be ready on-call to render services if the need arises. Meanwhile, all employees showing symptoms of COVID-19 are highly advised to go on immediate emergency leave and seek medical treatment. The emergency meeting followed President Rodrigo Roa Duterte’s pronouncement on Thursday night to place the entire National Capital Region under community quarantine in line with efforts to further prevent the spread of COVID-19, which the World Health Organization had declared a pandemic. President Duterte announced the extended suspension of classes as well as work in the Executive Branch of the government and travel to and from Metro Manila as per the advice of the Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases led by the Department of Health.

(DCCCII), on Friday, issued a call to all banks to postpone the payment of business loans for at least two months to businesses affected by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The government earlier posted restrictions on domestic travels, cancellation of meetings, exhibits, conferences, parties, and classes of all levels due to the rising cases of COVID-2019. Businesses will also be affected by this order. In line with this, the DCCCII has issued a position paper on the impact of COVID-19 on the business sector. The DCCCII said that calling on all the banks to allow postponement of business loan payments for two months could cushion the blow to businesses like hotels and tourist establishments. “Several businesses have experienced losses since the end of 2019, which saw successive earthquakes causing the cancellation of hotel bookings,” the DCCCII said. It added that these effects were compounded by the COVID–19 pandemic which has resulted in more than 50 confirmed cases in the country, causing even more cancellation of events. The DCCCII also called on the Department of Trade (DOT) and Department of Agriculture (DA) to monitor prices and basic commodities and when necessary, impose price controls on critical commodities and supplies. All employers, employees and the general public, as well, were encouraged to practice health habits and cooperate with the government’s effort to control the spread of the disease. Tags: ncov"

Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau  (REUTERS/Blair Gable/MANILA BULLETIN FILE PHOTO) Sophie Gregoire Trudeau recently returned from London and experienced flu-like symptoms, so she was tested for the coronavirus, the prime minister’s office said earlier on Thursday. The test came back positive, it said in the evening. “The Prime Minister is in good health with no symptoms. As a precautionary measure and following the advice of doctors, he will be in isolation for a planned period of 14 days,” an official statement said. Sophie will be in quarantine for 14 days. “The Prime Minister will continue to fully assume his duties and will address Canadians tomorrow.” In a personal note, Sophie said she was “experiencing uncomfortable symptoms of the virus,” adding that she “will be back on my feet soon”. Canada reported 145 new case of the virus, a three-fold gain from a week ago. There has been one death. Seven of Canada’s 10 provinces have recorded infections. Ontario, the most populous province, reported 17 new cases overnight, a 40% jump. To contain the virus, authorities ordered all schools to close from Saturday to April 5. Globally, more than 127,000 people have been infected by the sometimes deadly respiratory illness COVID-19. In a blow to hockey-obsessed Canadians, the National Hockey League suspended its season because of the outbreak, although it said its goal was to resume play “as soon as it is appropriate and prudent,” so teams can compete for the Stanley Cup championship. With the Canadian dollar at a four-year low against its US counterpart and stocks plunging, the Bank of Canada announced measures to inject liquidity into the market. Working from home on Thursday, Trudeau spoke with US President Donald Trump, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte and joined a special cabinet meeting on the coronavirus by phone, his spokesman said on Twitter. The Pacific province of British Columbia, north of Washington state, advised against all non-essential foreign travel, including to the United States. Washington is one of the worst-affected states. Any warning that involves the United States is politically sensitive, given the two countries’ 5,525-mile (8,890-km) shared border and Canada’s overwhelming reliance on bilateral trade. “This is really important … the evolving situation both in the United States and globally is a risk for all of us,” British Columbia’s provincial chief medical officer, Bonnie Henry, told reporters. Alberta’s chief medical officer, Deena Hinshaw, banned gatherings of more than 250 people and canceled all international events. Hinshaw also discouraged foreign travel. Quebec, which has recorded 13 cases, has banned all indoor events with more than 250 people and said people returning from any foreign country should self-isolate for 14 days. Health and education public-sector workers who travel abroad will be required to self-isolate. Separately, Canadian authorities canceled the JUNO music awards, Canada’s version of the Grammys, and Toronto’s annual St. Patrick’s Day parade was suspended. Ottawa committed C$1 billion ($723 million) on Wednesday toward bolstering the healthcare system and limiting the impact of the virus, while Ontario said on Thursday it had set aside C$100 million in “contingency funding.” On Thursday, Alberta Premier Jason Kenney said the public health crisis alone would cost the country “well north of C$10 billion.” Tags: ncov"

These alternatives, he said, must be explored and utilized in the interim.

Princess Cruises, the operator of two ocean liners that were quarantined after they became hotbeds for coronavirus infections, said on Thursday it would suspend the voyages of all its 18 ships for two months.(REUTERS / MANILA BULLETIN) The suspension upends an industry already struggling with cancellations following the outbreak, and comes after Finland’s Viking Line temporarily paused operations of its river ships and ocean liners around the world. “Never … in the 20 years I have served in this company, have we been tested in ways we have been tested over the past 40 days,” Jan Swartz, president of Princess Cruises, said bit.ly/2TIdFyT on the operator’s official YouTube channel, addressing the decision to suspend operations. “This is perhaps the most difficult decision in our history.” Shares of parent Carnival Corp, which have already lost over half their value since the start of the year, tumbled a further 18%. Rivals Royal Caribbean Corp and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings were also down. Chad Wolf, acting head of the US Department of Homeland Security, commended the two cruise lines’ decisions and called on others in a statement to do the same “until appropriate safety measures are put in place.” The crisis at Princess Cruises deepened last week after one of its ships, The Grand Princess, was denied entry to San Francisco Bay en route back from Hawaii as authorities learned some passengers and crew had developed flu-like symptoms. An initial round of testing found that 21 people, mostly crew, had been infected. At least one couple who took the cruise has sued the company, seeking over $1 million in damages for emotional trauma. Passengers from an earlier cruise to Mexico aboard the same ship had also tested positive for coronavirus. In February, the company’s Diamond Princess cruise ship was in the spotlight when hundreds onboard were infected in what was then the biggest concentration of confirmed cases outside China. About 700 people onboard were infected and six died. The suspension set off alarm bells among those responsible for booking cruise holidays. “We’re playing musical phones trying to get answers from the different cruise operators and airlines we work with … that’s really what our day-in-day-out life looks like right now,” said a travel agent in Wisconsin who handles bookings for Princess Cruises. The agent said he still had vacationers interested, however, in booking a Princess cruise in June. Princess voyages that are under way will carry on as planned, while those that extend beyond Tuesday will be ended at the “most convenient location for guests,” the company said. Analysts at SunTrust Robinson estimated the suspension would reduce Carnival’s full-year earnings by about 50 cents per share. The company earned $4.40 per share last year. Tags: ncov"

Seen from south of the border though, the greater risk is infection from the much bigger outbreak in the United States.  A man rides his bicycle near the border wall that divides San Diego County California, US and Tijuana (foreground), Mexico, January 3, 2019. (REUTERS/Mohammed Salem / File photo / MANILA BULLETIN) Residents of the city of Tijuana, just across from San Diego, California, have for years crossed back and forth daily to reach jobs and schools. Many say they are now wary of bringing back the contagious disease from the US side. Perla Macias, a Tijuana resident who heads into California to tend a make-up concession in a mall, now sees her commute as a daily risk, but an unavoidable one. “I don’t want to get sick, but I don’t have a choice,” she said. “I work over there.” In Mexico, authorities have detected 12 cases of the virus so far and no deaths, a fraction of the more than 1,000 confirmed cases in the United States, where there have been dozens of fatalities. In California alone 50 cases and four deaths have been confirmed. In Tijuana’s state of Baja California, no cases have been confirmed. Last week, Trump wrote on Twitter that his signature border wall is needed “more than ever,” citing coronavirus as a new argument for the barrier. The overwhelming majority of Mexicans oppose the wall, dating back to Trump’s campaign for president in which he routinely lashed out at Mexico and its migrants. Across social media though, Mexicans joked on Thursday that the wall had taken on new purpose – to stop US citizens infecting Mexicans. Wisecracks aside, Julian Palombo, a Tijuana business chamber official said what was needed was much tougher measures to check for infections coming from San Diego. “It makes sense to build a wall, but a public health wall from over there to here to avoid the risk of possible infections,” he said. Like others consulted by Reuters, Palombo bemoaned the lack of checks at busy land crossings into Tijuana, or in nearby airports. He added that face masks and hand sanitizer were in short supply on both sides of the border. Coronavirus has infected more than 126,000 people globally according to a Reuters tally, most of them in China. In Italy there are 15,000 cases. Some experts speculate that the outbreak is more acute in both Mexico and the United States than the relatively low number of confirmed cases suggests, due to insufficient testing for the virus. Mexican authorities say they have a clear containment strategy. Tijuana Mayor Arturo Gonzalez Cruz has said that he is working with Baja California state officials to implement better health checks on persons crossing on foot each day. Dulce Molina, whose husband works in a San Diego hotel, supported tougher sanitation measures at the border but said a physical barrier was not a solution to keeping the virus out. “It’s all over the world,” she said.

In a pastoral letter, Bishop Broderick Pabillo, Apostolic Administrator of Manila, said this is for the good of all to avert the further spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). He said this was also in response to the call of the government to avoid large gatherings of people amid the rise in the number of COVID cases in the country. “We heed this call not with panic but with care for charity to others and the common good. Hence in the Archdiocese of Manila I dispense all the faithful from the obligation of going to Mass this Sunday,” said Pabillo. “I recognize that this may impact many faithful and priests but let us do this with the spirit of sacrifice for the good of all,” he added. Pabillo said those who wish to hear Mass may use the social media or tune in to Radio Veritas 846 and TV Maria for their regular broadcasts of Masses and other religious activities. He said although there will be no public celebration of Holy Mass, the faithful should strive to be in touch with the Lord by fervently praying. “Thus from March 14 onwards let all the bells of our churches be rung every 12 noon and 8 PM to call all people to pray the ‘Oratio Imperata’ (mandatory prayer) to fight this virus. Let us join in this prayer,” he said. “The fervent prayers of all the people of God will draw us closer to him and away from the scourge of this disease,” added Pabillo. He enjoined parishes and places of prayer to be open all day so that people may come and find solace in silent prayer. But, Pabillo said sanitizers should be available at the entrances and churches should be regularly cleaned. The prelate also discouraged the holding of Kumpisalang Bayan but priests were instructed to give definite time to hear individual confessions during the day to be of service to the penitents who come. Pabillo also asked priests to be available to visit the sick and minister to them to show God’s presence to His people. “In time of crisis people need the Lord, and the priests show God’s nearness by their presence among the people,” he said. On Thursday, President Duterte said Metro Manila will be placed under “community quarantine” from March 15 to April 14 due to the COVID-19 outbreak which is now under Code Red Sub-Level 2.

The ordinance aims to impose “restrictions on the buying capacity of individuals and retail establishments on some basic and prime commodities,” in line with the “Presidential Proclamation No. 922…enjoining all national agencies and local government units to render full assistance and cooperation, and to mobilize the necessary resources to undertake critical, urgent, and appropriate response and measure to curtail and eliminate the virus.” Under the ordinance, individual consumers and registered retailers and/or sari-sari store customers may only purchase limited number of goods per day.

Senator Risa Hontiveros(Senate of the Philippines / MANILA BULLETIN) Hontiveros made the call in light of President Duterte’s announcement of putting Metro Manila under community quarantine starting March 15 to April 14. The senator said the government should release these guidelines early for the benefit of Filipinos who work within the metro but reside elsewhere. “There is a lot to clarify…our public health and local government authorities must be at the helm of this community quarantine, subject to proper parameters and regular review, in order to guide and assure the worried public,” Hontiveros said. At the same time, Hontivero slammed the government’s incoherent plans on the imposition of the community quarantine. “Tama na ang pagiging magulo. The people have the right to a coherent government,” she said. “The Filipino people have been expecting a cohesive plan from our leaders. They deserve and need the government to exercise competent leadership in order to shepherd us out of the COVID-19 pandemic,” she pointed out. As much as possible, Hontiveros said the government must strive to express clear communication of its policies and guidelines surrounding its efforts to contain the pandemic. She also urged the government not to forget the needs of daily wage earners who would be direly affected by the community quarantine. “We must not forget those who are most vulnerable and who have the least among us: the daily wage-earning poor and the loss of jobs that is already following in the wake of this pandemic,” the senator said. At the same time, Hontiveros said the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) and our local government units to ensure sufficient food supply through local food banks. “There must be food in every table. Likewise, I am urging the Department of Labor and Employment to facilitate immediate cash flow to families who will lose their livelihood in the same light due to COVID-19,” she said. The lawmaker said she has full trust in the capacity of the country’s health professionals to carry out the necessary measures to contain the virus’ transmission. She said the country’s health workers deserve protection too and the government must also prioritize their welfare. “They must have ample protective gear, compensation, and other forms of support in the conduct of their duties,” she pointed out. “I thank our frontline health workers who have been working tirelessly in the name of public health and safety. You are the real heroes and I am thankful for your service to our people,” she said. “This pandemic is a test of our humanity and institutions. Getting our act together means life or death to many Filipinos. A difficult path to recovery lies ahead. But I have faith in the strength of our people; that as one nation, we will overcome, as we Filipinos always have,” Hontiveros said. Read more: Metro Manila under 30-day lockdown Tags: ncov"

Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) arrives for a briefing on Capitol Hill in Washington, US, March 12, 2020. (REUTERS/Joshua Roberts /MANILA BULLETIN) The Democratic-controlled House of Representatives and the Republican-controlled Senate have been at odds over the legislation. Pelosi, a Democrat, spent much of Thursday haggling with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who was handling the negotiations for the President Donald Trump’s Republican administration. Pelosi and Mnuchin spoke by telephone eight times, Pelosi spokesman Drew Hammill said. They were “close to an agreement subject to an exchange of paper and we hope to have an agreement tomorrow,” Pelosi told reporters Thursday evening, vowing to bring the matter to a vote in the House on Friday. “We’ve resolved most of our differences,” Pelosi said. It was not clear whether some important disagreements still had to be worked out. Pelosi repeatedly stressed that the bill must encourage Americans to be tested for the coronavirus and not have to be worried about the cost. “It’s about testing, testing, testing,” she said. A House Republican aide said Republicans were not opposed to free testing, but that some technical aspects of the legislation needed to be fixed. Pelosi and her fellow Democrats on Wednesday evening made a 124-page proposal to expand paid sick leave, unemployment insurance, funding for child nutrition and other food programs, and introduce other sweeping steps to address economic hardships that the growing coronavirus outbreak could wreak on Americans. On Thursday morning Republicans rejected the Democratic bill, called the “Families First Coronavirus Response Act.” House minority leader Kevin McCarthy called the initiative “unworkable.” Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell called the Democrats’ proposal “an ideological wish list” that would create burdensome programs and regulations. Republicans particularly voiced concerns over the extent of a paid leave program. McConnell urged bipartisan efforts at passing “smaller, non-controversial pieces of legislation.” But when the day dragged on and no deal emerged from the Pelosi-Mnuchin telephone negotiations, McConnell closed up the Senate for the week, announcing it would return on Monday. As a result, even if the House passes a deal on Friday it is not expected to be considered by the Senate until next week. Last week, Congress displayed unusual bipartisanship when it passed an $8.3 billion coronavirus response bill that attracted only a few “no” votes. But this week, the partisan atmosphere returned, as the US government wrestled with responding to the biggest health crisis it has faced in years. Members of both parties in Congress have been frustrated that the United States was ill-prepared to conduct widespread testing for the coronavirus. That was underscored early on Thursday when senators emerged from a closed briefing with top US health officials. Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal told reporters the attending physician of Congress, Dr. Brian Monahan, estimated that 70 million to 150 million people would contract the coronavirus in the United States. Blumenthal said he thought the estimates were guesswork because of “insufficient testing” for the disease so far. Republican Senator Mike Rounds said the health officials were having trouble giving them details on how many test kits were needed, and “there was lots of frustration that we were not getting the numbers we were hoping to get.” Several senators also said there was an issue with the supply chain for items needed to administer the tests, such as cotton swabs and protective gloves. Meanwhile, a crisis atmosphere enveloped the Capitol. Tourist visits were suspended at least until April 1, and several Senate offices were shuttered over worries about possible infections. Senator Bill Cassidy, a medical doctor, told reporters he favors allowing senators to cast votes on legislation remotely in emergency situations, an idea congressional leaders have been resisting.

National security adviser Robert O’Brien attends a briefing on the situation with Iran in the Brady Press Briefing Room of the White House in Washington, U.S., January 10, 2020. (REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque / File photo / MANILA BULLETIN) The editorial follows comments from a spokesman for China’s Foreign Ministry, who tweeted on Thursday that the US lacked transparency and suggested that the US military might have brought the coronavirus to the Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak. US National Security Adviser Robert O’Brien had remarked that China reacted slowly to the emergence of the coronavirus, probably costing the world two months when it could have been preparing for the outbreak. China Daily said that China was an example “worth heeding” because of its effective pandemic control measures, offers of foreign aid, transparent information sharing and international cooperation. “That US politicians feel no qualms about putting their political schemes above global public health has served to expose how deeply they have fallen into the abyss of inhumanity,” said the editorial. “In seeking to derive gain from China’s coronavirus woes, they have not only opened the doors of the US to the disease but also hindered the unity of purpose the world needs to treat the pandemic and its effects.” The coronavirus first emerged in December in the central Chinese city of Wuhan and surrounding Hubei province, where around two-thirds of global cases so far have been recorded. Authorities there initially responded to the outbreak by detaining doctors who discovered the novel coronavirus. One of them, Li Wenliang, later died. The coronavirus has since spread globally, with new cases rising rapidly, but its progress in China has slowed in the past seven days. In recent weeks the vast majority of new cases have been outside China. “The stark contrast between the fast increase of infections outside of China, including in the US, and the sharp decrease in the number of cases in China should awaken other countries to the dangers created by the China-bashing orchestrated by a handful of US politicians,” said the China Daily editorial.

Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG) Secretary Eduardo Año(PCOO / MANILA BULLETIN) Various militant groups earlier expressed fears that the region-wide lockdown imposed in the National Capital Region (NCR) will affect the poor residing outside the area especially the daily wage workers who are accorded the “no work, no pay’’policy. Allaying such fears, Año said that employees from other areas will be allowed entry in Metro Manila if they can present their identification cards (ID) showing the addresses of their workplaces in NCR. He said the total lockdown imposed in other countries affected by the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-2019) cannot be applied in the Philippines as the government had considered the predicament of millions of workers living in adjacent areas but are employed in the Metro Manila workplaces. During the 30-day Metro Manila quarantine which starts on March 15 and ends on April 14, Año said personnel from the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) and the Philippine National Police (PNP) had organized the checkpoints in and out of Metro Manila. Año stressed the government is not imposing a lockdown but is merely restricting movement coming in and out of Metro Manila to contain the spread of COVID-2019. In appealing for public understanding, Año explained the goal is to prevent the spread of COVID-2019 from Metro Manila to other regions citing it is still more difficult to contain the disease if it reaches other regions. The said the community quarantine would be enforced by its forces “through checkpoints and other lawful means in coordination with the LGUs starting from barangays and other agencies like the AFP.” Meanwhile, the AFP will provide assistance to the police manning the checkpoints.

But 177 fully recovered patients were released the same day, it added. South Korea has an advanced medical system widely available to all, and has embarked on a huge coronavirus testing drive. But its stock market was caught up in the global economic concerns over the pandemic, with trading briefly halted on the Korea stock exchange six minutes after the opening when the benchmark KOSPI index fell to 1707.90, down 6.8 percent or 126.43 points. It was the second consecutive day trading had been halted on the main bourse, the first time that had happened since the US credit rating was downgraded in 2011. The number of new cases in Daegu, the southern city at the centre of the outbreak, and the neighboring province of North Gyeongsang had declined “dramatically”, officials said. So far, nearly 90 percent of South Korea’s cases have been in the two regions. But Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun, who is leading the response in Daegu, warned the government “should not be complacent even a bit”. “The battle against the coronavirus has now become a global fight going far beyond Daegu,” he said. Each morning the government announces how many cases were diagnosed the previous day, and recent figures have been well below the 500-600 increases the country was confirming in early March, raising hopes the outbreak is being brought under control. The 110 new cases announced by the KCDC was the lowest such figure since February 21. One more person had died, it said, with the toll rising to 67. Tags: ncov"

And while under quarantine, Florido said, his newly-arrived town mates will be monitored by the local municipal health office and will be prohibited to mingle in big crowds. They must stay in their homes, avoid having drinking sessions with relatives and friends and attending events such as weddings, and parties, according to the mayor.
For parents, since the classes are suspended, he urged them not to allow their students to leave or go elsewhere.

In its COVID – 19 Situational Report No. 28, the DOH 13-Center for Health Development (CHD) also reported that there were 58 persons under monitoring (PUMs) spread out in the five provinces and six cities in Caraga region. But of this number of PUMs, DOH 13 said 53 have already completed 14-day isolations and were already cleared. In an exclusive interview with The Manila Bulletin early Thursday evening, DOH 13 Regional Director Dr. Jose R. Llacuna Jr. emphasized that the PUIs were now in isolation in three government hospitals in the region. “Our health staff and personnel are now attending the latest cases of PUIs case in the region and we are closely monitoring them (PUIs),” stressed the region’s top DOH 13 official. He said the samples taken from them (PUIs) were immediately sent to the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) in Manila for testing. “We will just wait the result of the samples taken from them (PUIs),” Llacuna said.
In its No 28 Advisory, the DOH 13-CHD said two of the PUIs are now admitted in government hospitals in Tandag City, Surigao del Sur and Caraga Regional Hospital in Surigao City.
All of the patients had histories of travel in countries with cases of Covid-19, and have exhibited flu-like symptoms that include cough, colds, and fever, it said.
But Llacuna clarified and emphasized that Caraga region continued to remain COVID-19, and that there is no cause for the public to panic. “I ask Caraganons instead to constantly monitor and listen to updates from correct sources of information such as the DOH through the agency’s massive information campaigns on COVID-19,” the region’s top health official said. “I also appeal to the general public not to panic, always practice cleanliness, especially frequent proper hand washing, eat healthy foods and take vitamins,” appealed Director Llacuna. It can be recalled that the first case of PUI in the Caraga region was recorded in February this year but results turned out negative for Covid-19. Meanwhile, Butuan City Mayor Engr. Ronnie Vicente C. Lagnada Friday declared the suspension of classes in all levels of government and public schools in this region’s premier and capital city of Butuan starting March 13 until further notice. “This is for the safety of students, faculty and staff, and everybody,” said the city chief executive in his executive order. Meanwhile, among the LGUs that came out with the same order included Cantilan, Carmen, and Carrascal in Surigao del Sur; San Francisco and Bayugan City in Agusan del Sur; and Tubay and Cabadbaran City in Agusan del Norte; and Surigao City.

Following the declaration of a national public health emergency due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, the regional office of DTI reminded all retailers and consumers in Northeastern Mindanao or Caraga region to be responsible amid the price freeze. DTI 13 Caraga Regional Director Brielgo O. Pagaran reminded retailers that there should be no increase in the prices of basic necessities and prime commodities, particularly medical supplies, including alcohol and face masks, while the freeze is in effect. “The public must be reminded of their consumer rights and responsibilities especially in this emergency situation,” said the region’s top DTI official, in an exclusive interview with The Manila Bulletin on Friday. “Retailers must also be reminded of their responsibilities and obligations to the consumers. The latter, on one hand, should also be more responsible and mindful of other consumers when they buy basic necessities,” Pagaran pointed out. The region’s DTI 13 Caraga top official said that consumers must not engage in panic buying and must also consider their fellow buyers to avoid problems on stock shortage. “Everybody must be responsible in these hard times,” stressed Pagaran. Pursuant to Republic Act No. 7581 or the Price Act, prices of basic necessities shall remain frozen at their present levels for 60 days, or until sooner lifted by the President whenever there is a declaration of a state of emergency, calamity, or other similar conditions. Basic necessities that are under the jurisdiction of the DTI include canned fish and other marine products, locally manufactured instant noodles, bottled water, bread, processed milk, coffee, candles, and laundry soap, detergent, and salt. Department of Agriculture (DA) covers basic agricultural goods such as rice, corn, cooking oil, fresh, dried and other marine products, fresh eggs, fresh pork, beef and poultry meat, fresh milk, fresh vegetables, root crops, sugar, and fresh fruits. Essential drugs are under the regulation of the Department of Health (DOH), while firewood and charcoal are under the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR). Household LPG and kerosene, on the other hand, are under the Department of Energy (DOE). Business establishments found to have violated the price freeze shall be imposed with a fine amounting to P5,000 up to P1 million and/or imprisonment for a period of one year up to10 years. Meanwhile Trade Secretary Ramon Lopez, in a press release, warned that he will be filing criminal charges against those who would be found overpricing and hoarding medical devices and products like alcohol, medicines, N-88, N-95 masks, other similar face masks, alcohol/sanitizers, and medical devices.

(Taguig LGU / MANILA BULLETIN) “We are asking all citizens and stakeholders of the city to limit movements to essential travel and emergencies. Limiting movement is not mandatory but it is highly suggested as we believe that the National Capital Region is ultimately interlinked as families often have one member working or studying in a nearby city. This infection, in one National Capital Region (NCR) city, affects all cities,” the city government said. Citing the data of the Department of Health (DOH), Taguig said it has only one confirmed case of COVID-19. It also urged those working in Taguig but living outside the city to make arrangements with their employers “as entry and exit to NCR will be limited based on President Duterte’s orders on the suspension of travel to and from Metro Manila.” “For businesses, offices, and workspaces based in the city, we ask that you prepare work-from-home options and other flexible arrangements that would keep your workers from interacting with other people. Keep your workers interacting at a minimal level.” Parents and guardians of students were asked to keep their children at home, especially now that the government has suspended classes. “We appeal to parents and guardians to keep your children at home. Students’ visit to malls and high-traffic areas will not be allowed,” it said. It also ordered commercial establishments in the city to observe social distancing protocols “If this is not possible, consider temporarily closing your facilities and seek immediate assistance from the LGU so we can assist you,” the LGU said. Social distancing means keeping customers at 1 meter apart. This is essential in the fight against the spread of the disease,” it added. The local government urged the public to not panic saying there is an established framework for stopping the spread of COVID-19. “Our city subscribes to the whole-of-government approach and will work tirelessly to keep the people of Taguig safe from the coronavirus.” Tags: ncov"

We are assuming that all of us have been infected,” wrote Philippines acting UN Ambassador Kira Azucena in a message seen by Reuters. According to the online UN directory of diplomatic staff, there are about 12 diplomats at the Filipino mission, which is on 5th Avenue in Midtown Manhattan. The sick diplomat represented the Philippines in the UN General Assembly’s legal affairs committees. Azucena said the diplomat was last at UN headquarters on Monday for about half an hour when she was asymptomatic. She came down with flu-like symptoms on Tuesday and visited her doctor. “She got the call today that she tested positive for COVID-19,” Azucena wrote on Thursday. The United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the case. The 193-member world body began implementing coronavirus prevention measures at its Manhattan headquarters this week. A two-week conference on women’s rights was cut to one day, several other planned large conferences canceled, most smaller meetings cut, UN missions asked to limit the number of diplomats they send to meetings, and at least half the several thousand UN staff who normally work in the building will be working from home by next week. The World Health Organization has described the coronavirus outbreak as a pandemic. The virus, which has been deadly for some people, broke out in China’s Wuhan city late last year and has so far infected some 125,000 people from 118 countries and territories. According to a Reuters tally it has killed 4,700. Tags: ncov"

Degamo stated in the order that the national government has already reported the rise of locally transmitted cases of COVID-19 in the country. He said the suspension of classes will prevent the possible spread of the virus, especially in schools. Degamo also ordered the local police to ensure that during the suspension of classes, all school children and students must stay at home, and call the attention of parents or guardians to keep their wards at home. Bimbo Miraflor, public information officer of the provincial government, said in a press conference on Thursday, that March 17 will the 14th day of quarantine period of the last contact of the 62-year-old patient who was tested positive for COVID-19. The patient with confirmed case was a councilor from Tayasan town who attended a Philippine Councilor’s League (PCL) meeting in Manila on February 26 to 28. Miraflor said that the patient was still in serious condition at a hospital, dismissing rumors that the patient died on Wednesday night. “He is fighting for his life,” the public information officer added. Meanwhile, Miraflor said that seven more persons under monitoring (PUMs) were added to the initial 13 patients, who are being closely monitored by the local health officials for suspected infection of the viral disease. The seven additional PUMs had travel history from HongKong, South Korea, and China, he added. For the three other PUIs, Miraflor said that their medical condition was improving. For her part, Dr. Liland Estacion, provincial health officer, said that they were expecting four more possible PUIs who had close contact with the patient with confirmed case of COVID-19.”They are his family members” she added.

Dr. Julius Drilon, medical chief of Corazon Locsin Montelibano Memorial Regional Hospital, in a press conference at Bacolod City Government Center Thursday. (GLAZYL MASCULINO/MANILA BULLETIN) Dr. Grace Tan, spokesperson of Bacolod City Task Force against COVID-19, said on Thursday that the three PUIs were all Filipinas who had travel history to Taiwan, Singapore, and Pasay City. The three PUIs were confined, and currently under isolation at the Corazon Locsin Montelibano Memorial Regional Hospital (CLMMRH) here while waiting for the results of their swab tests from the Research Institute of Tropical Medicine (RITM). Dr. Julius Drilon, medical chief of CLMMRH, said that one of the PUIs was a staff of the Provincial Capitol who attended a Philippine Councilor’s League (PCL) national congress in Pasay City. On Thursday, Negros Occidental Governor Eugenio Jose Lacson has authorized the staff of the Vice Governor’s Office and the Sangguniang Panlalawigan (SP) to leave their respective offices early that day, after a Technical Assistant was identified as a PUM.
As a precautionary measure, these offices were closed for sanitation and disinfection, while other transactions were entertained at the Capitol that day. Although the patient did not exhibit flu-like symptoms, Drilon said she was considered a PUI because of her travel to a COVID-19-affected area in Manila. “She was not allowed to be discharged from the hospital because she had to be observed based on the protocol,” Drilon said. She was complaining of an itchiness in her throat, he added. Due to the public’s concern on the disease, Drilon said they were on heightened alert and have already intensified their protective mechanism. Drilon said they even started to limit the number of hours and days of visitation at the hospital since Wednesday. We’re doing this not for ourselves but this is for everybody, he said. He also said that the hospital can accommodate 15 PUIs, and was continuously preparing their equipment and supplies in the event of a worst case scenario. He said they were also targeting to train 600 medical health workers next week for them to be equipped on the proper handling of PUIs and other basic procedures. “Do not panic because we’re not dying,” he said. He added that those people who may have been infected with the virus can survive, provided they have strong immune system. He advised the public to maintain a healthy lifestyle by getting enough rest, doing proper hygiene and sanitation, eating healthy food, and taking vitamins (if necessary). “We expect that people will cooperate especially in times like this,” he said. Meanwhile, Tan also said that they were closely monitoring a total of 19 PUMs who were all in good stable condition while undergoing self quarantine. Tan said that persons who may have travel history or contact with these people should submit themselves for self quarantine to lessen the exposure. A female teenager from E.B. Magalona town, who was earlier identified as PUI was now classified as a PUM, after medical results showed that her fever was due to a urinary tract infection (UTI). She, however, underwent more tests for confirmatory. Her mother and sister whom she had a close contact, were also advised to undergo a self-quarantine. Tan said that Bacolod and Negros Occidental have no confirmed case of COVID-19. Tags: ncov"

House of the Representatives (Facebook/ MANILA BULLETIN) Speaker Alan Peter Cayetano is expected to declare a two-week or longer holiday for all employees not  only as a result of this development but also to heed the appeal of President Duterte who declared a community quarantine in Metro Manila Thursday night. “I just received word that an employee from our Printing Service tested positive for COVID-19. In compliance with the protocols, we will require ALL personnel of the Printing Service to undergo self-quarantine,” Secretary General Jose Luis Montales said in a text message to all House members and employees yesterday. Several sources, including congressmen, told Manila Bulletin that the said employee also has siblings who work in different departments of the chamber. The same sources revealed that the patient was first admitted at an undisclosed hospital in November 2019 and was diagnosed with a lung ailment. Since then, the patient has had several hospital confinements. The COVID-19 diagnosis was released only recently. Montales said the Department of Health will start conducting contact tracing of “all other persons, including employees of other departments of the House of Representatives, who had been in contact with him.” “To recall, our said employee has been in and out of the hospital since last year for various ailments. He was recently confined for community-acquired pneumonia,” said Montales. The House official added: “He has no history of travel to any country with confirmed COVID-19 case. He has also no known history of exposure to a confirmed case of COVID-19.” Four House members are currently undergoing self-quarantine for various reasons. Reps. Julienne Baronda (PDP-Laban, Iloilo City), John Reynald Tiangco (NP, Navotas City), and Eric Martinez (NPC, Valenzuela City) have decided to go on a 14-day isolation after attending official events where CoVID-19 infected persons attended. Davao City Rep. Isidro Ungab earlier went on self-quarantine after accompanying Davao City Mayor Sara Duterte to the Senate where they both had interaction with Senator Sherwin Gatchalian.

Global shutdown Global stock markets suffered historic falls as panic spread Friday over the spiraling coronavirus crisis that has killed nearly 5,000 and infected sport, schools and society across the planet. The virus has affected all areas of life, sealing off entire countries, sparking draconian government measures not seen in peacetime, and forcing the cancellation of global sporting and cultural events from Broadway to basketball. Japan’s stock market fell more than 10 percent on Friday, following the worst day on Wall Street since the crash of 1987 as traders scrambled to sell everything on fears the virus will catapult the world into a deep recession. Markets shrugged off emergency big-bang measures by central banks in the United States and eurozone, and government fiscal stimulus packages, with fears escalating over the tightening noose on the global economy. “In mere weeks, the market has shifted gears from a transitory health scare to a full-blown global recession,” said Stephen Innes, chief market strategist at AxiCorp. “Global supply chains are no longer just ‘disrupted’ but are now in the process of shutting down completely.” ‘Worst in a century’  The human toll also continued to rise, with nearly 131,500 people infected across 116 countries and territories, and 4,925 dead, according to an AFP tally. The virus, which first emerged in China in December, has quickly spread around the world even as cases in Asia have leveled out in recent days. Kenya announced its first confirmed case of coronavirus on Friday — a woman who returned from the United States tested positive for the illness in Nairobi. China claimed “the peak” of the pandemic had passed its shores, but infections and deaths jumped dramatically in Italy, Spain and Iran, which announced 75 new deaths on Thursday. French President Emmanuel Macron said it was “the worst health crisis in France in a century” as he ordered schools and universities closed “until further notice” — following similar moves in many other countries. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson issued a grim warning to the public over the virus, which has predominantly killed the elderly and other people with already weakened immune systems. “More families, many more families are going to lose loved ones before their time,” Johnson said, as he urged people with symptoms to stay at home. With countries imposing travel bans, global tourism has ground to a halt, and many people have been left stranded as dream holidays turned to nightmares. The chaos extended to Europe’s airports, where confused passengers scrambled to redraw their plans after US President Donald Trump this week banned all travelers from mainland Europe for the next 30 days. “We just got off our plane and we’re going to go straight back — we can’t believe it,” said 29-year-old Tiara Streng, queueing with three friends at London’s Heathrow Airport for a return flight to Colorado. Everest shut down Nepal on Friday suspended permits to climb Everest over the coronavirus pandemic, closing off the world’s biggest mountain a day after China halted access from its side. Nepal has halted climbing on all mountains in the country and stopped issuing tourist visas, Yogesh Bhattarai, Minister for Culture Tourism and Civil Aviation told AFP. The Himalayan country earns millions of dollars a year from Everest permits. “The government has decided to suspend all spring expeditions and scrap permits for the time being. The decision can be reviewed after analyzing the global scenario over the coming month,” Bhattarai said. Last year’s spring window saw a record 885 people summit Everest, 644 of them from Nepal and 241 from the northern flank in Tibet. Across Rome, all Catholic churches have been closed to stem the spread of a coronavirus pandemic that has killed more than 1,000 people across Italy. The churches will reopen when a broader Italian government crackdown on public gatherings expires on April 3, Cardinal Angelo De Donatis, the papal vicar for Rome, said in a statement. Catholic faithful have been exempted from the obligation to attend Sunday Mass. The Vatican had spent days resisting having to take the drastic measure of shuttering places of worship in the overwhelmingly Catholic country. It closed its museums and even the Saint Peter’s Basilica — parts of its soaring dome designed by Michelangelo — to tourists as the death toll continued to mount. All masses, weddings and funerals across the country have also been called off. But some church buildings in the country will stay open as long as the faithful follow government regulations and remain a meter (three feet) apart while inside. The closures come with the pope himself suffering from a cold and communicating with the faithful by livestream as a safety precaution. Pope Francis complained of feeling “caged” while reading his traditional Sunday Angelus Prayer into a camera from a Vatican library instead of his usual window overlooking crowds on Saint Peter’s Square. The 83-year-old was also forced to miss his weekly Wednesday appearance on the square that he often uses to hug and shake hands with the faithful from across the world. The new regulations cover the Italian capital and not the Vatican City statelet located entirely within Rome. The Holy See has recorded one COVID-19 infection and is awaiting the results of another person who attended one of its functions at the start of the month. Tags: ncov"

Neighbouring Slovakia, which has 21 confirmed cases, said it would close its borders starting Friday to all foreigners except those with a residence permit. All Slovaks who return from abroad will meanwhile have to be quarantined for two weeks. Polish citizens will still be allowed to enter Slovakia at border crossings with Poland. Many Poles work in Slovak factories and mines or go on skiing vacations in the Slovak part of the Tatra mountains. Slovakia said it was banning international bus and train transport and closing international airports. It is also closing schools, which the Czech Republic had already done earlier this week. Both countries announced Thursday they would ban mass cultural and sports events. The Czech Republic has banned gatherings of more than 30 people and closed all gyms, swimming pools, clubs and libraries. Slovakia announced that wellness centres, aqua parks and bars would close for two weeks but restaurants and cafes will remain open. Baltic state Latvia, which has 16 confirmed cases of the coronavirus and no deaths, declared a state of emergency starting Friday until April 14. But Latvia’s borders remain open and there is no ban on flights or maritime traffic. All Latvian schools and universities will close. Public gatherings of more than 200 people, as well as sports and rehearsals for cultural events, will be banned during the emergency period. Hospitals will permit only medical personnel and patients to enter their buildings with no visitors or family members allowed. “Our goal is to make people engage in some ‘social distancing’ from each other,” Latvian Prime Minister Krisjanis Karins told reporters. Fellow Baltic state Lithuania, which has three confirmed cases, also closed all schools, universities and kindergartens and banned mass gatherings with more than 100 participants. The measures are in effect until at least March 27, according to Prime Minister Saulius Skvernelis. He added that Lithuania will ban flights from Italy starting Monday.

The statement added that monasteries would remain open to “communities that habitually use them as residents”. “This provision is for the common good,” De Donatis wrote. The Italian government on Wednesday announced a comprehensive crackdown that shuttered all retail stores except for pharmacies and groceries. De Donatis said he was finally moved to close Roman churches by “the even more binding restrictions placed on the ordinary movement of people” on Wednesday. “At this time, even more than ever, our houses are domestic churches,” the Rome cardinal wrote.

By comparison German Chancellor Angela Merkel warned this week that up to 70 percent of her country’s population could get the virus. Asked by Tlaib whether he believed the projection was accurate, Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), told the hearing: “We really need to be careful with those kinds of predictions because that’s based on a model.” He added that “all models are as good as the assumptions that you put into the model” and that with containment and mitigation the upper end of the projection could be avoided. About 80 percent of coronavirus cases are mild, and the overall mortality rate is around one percent, according to the latest estimate provided by Fauci to Congress on Wednesday. At the low end of the projection this would mean about 700,000 deaths. At the high end it would mean 1.5 million deaths. Heart disease was the leading cause of death for Americans in 2018, with just over 650,000 deaths in 2018. The flu and pneumonia caused around 60,000 deaths. As of Thursday, there had been more than 1,300 cases and 38 deaths, according to a tracker maintained by Johns Hopkins University. Risk from coronavirus starts to increase for people who are over 60 and is heightened more for those over 80, as well as for people with conditions like diabetes, heart disease or lung disease, or whose immune systems are compromised. Fauci noted that a 2014 model by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) projected the African Ebola outbreak could affect more than a million people. But this was eventually not the case and the final number was under 30,000. Fauci also responded to a query about people having difficulty getting access to tests, for which US authorities have come under severe criticism. “The system is not really geared to what we need right now, what you are asking for. That is a failing,” said Fauci. “Let’s admit it.” “The idea of anybody getting it easily, the way people in other countries are doing it, we’re not set up for that. Do I think we should be? Yes, but we’re not.” Vice President Mike Pence, the White House’s pointman for the crisis, claimed earlier this week that “a million tests are in the field” and four million would be going out soon. But the CDC’s director Robert Redfield said that the kits were not operational because there was a shortage of substances that activated them, called re-agents, and they also required more nasal swabs and trained staff.

,"March 13, 2020, 8:22 AM",nCov,Italy and South Korea virus outbreaks reveal disparity in deaths and tactics,By Reuters ,"By Reuters  In Italy, millions are locked down and more than 1,000 people have died from the coronavirus. In South Korea, hit by the disease at about the same time, only a few thousand are quarantined and 67 people have died. As the virus courses through the world, the story of two outbreaks illustrates a coming problem for countries now grappling with an explosion in cases.  (REUTERS / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN) It’s impractical to test every potential patient, but unless the authorities can find a way to see how widespread infection is, their best answer is lockdown. Italy started out testing widely, then narrowed the focus so that now, the authorities don’t have to process hundreds of thousands of tests. But there’s a trade-off: They can’t see what’s coming and are trying to curb the movements of the country’s entire population of 60 million people to contain the disease. Even Pope Francis, who has a cold and delivered his Sunday blessing over the internet from inside the Vatican, said he felt “caged in the library.” Thousands of miles away in South Korea, authorities have a different response to a similar-sized outbreak. They are testing hundreds of thousands of people for infections and tracking potential carriers like detectives, using cell phone and satellite technology. Both countries saw their first cases of the disease called COVID-19 in late January. South Korea has since reported 67 deaths out of nearly 8,000 confirmed cases, after testing more than 222,000 people. In contrast, Italy has had 1,016 deaths and identified more than 15,000 cases after carrying out more than 73,000 tests on an unspecified number of people. Epidemiologists say it is not possible to compare the numbers directly. But some say the dramatically different outcomes point to an important insight: Aggressive and sustained testing is a powerful tool for fighting the virus. Jeremy Konyndyk, a senior policy fellow at the Center for Global Development in Washington, said extensive testing can give countries a better picture of the extent of an outbreak. When testing in a country is limited, he said, the authorities have to take bolder actions to limit movement of people. “I’m uncomfortable with enforced lockdown-type movement restrictions,” he said. “China did that, but China is able to do that. China has a population that will comply with that.” The democracies of Italy and South Korea are useful case studies for countries such as America, which have had problems setting up testing systems and are weeks behind on the infection curve. So far, in Japan and the United States particularly, the full scale of the problem is not yet visible. Germany has not experienced significant testing constraints, but Chancellor Angela Merkel warned her people on Wednesday that since 60% to 70% of the populace is likely to be infected, the only option is containment. South Korea, which has a slightly smaller population than Italy at about 50 million people, has around 29,000 people in self-quarantine. It has imposed lockdowns on some facilities and at least one apartment complex hit hardest by outbreaks. But so far no entire regions have been cut off. Seoul says it is building on lessons learned from an outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in 2015 and working to make as much information available as possible to the public. It has embarked on a massive testing program, including people who have very mild illness, or perhaps don’t even have symptoms, but who may be able to infect others. This includes enforcing a law that grants the government wide authority to access data: CCTV footage, GPS tracking data from phones and cars, credit card transactions, immigration entry information, and other personal details of people confirmed to have an infectious disease. The authorities can then make some of this public, so anyone who may have been exposed can get themselves – or their friends and family members – tested. In addition to helping work out who to test, South Korea’s data-driven system helps hospitals manage their pipeline of cases. People found positive are placed in self-quarantine and monitored remotely through a smartphone app, or checked regularly in telephone calls, until a hospital bed becomes available. When a bed is available, an ambulance picks the person up and takes the patient to a hospital with air-sealed isolation rooms. All of this, including hospitalization, is free of charge. South Korea’s response is not perfect. While more than 209,000 people have tested negative there, results are still pending on about 18,000 others – an information gap that means there are likely more cases in the pipeline. The rate of newly confirmed cases has dropped since a peak in mid-February, but the system’s greatest test may still be ahead as authorities try to track and contain new clusters. South Korea does not have enough protective masks – it has started rationing them – and it is trying to hire more trained staff to process tests and map cases. And the approach comes at the cost of some privacy. South Korea’s system is an intrusive mandatory measure that depends on people surrendering what, for many in Europe and America, would be a fundamental right of privacy. Unlike China and the island-state of Singapore, which have used similar methods, South Korea is a large democracy with a population that is quick to protest policies it does not like. “Disclosing information about patients always comes with privacy infringement issues,” said Choi Jaewook, a preventive medicine professor at Korea University and a senior official at the Korean Medical Association. Disclosures “should be strictly limited” to patients’ movements, and “it shouldn’t be about their age, their sex, or their employers.” Traditional responses such as locking down affected areas and isolating patients can be only modestly effective, and may cause problems in open societies, says South Korea’s Deputy Minister for Health and Welfare Kim Gang-lip. In South Korea’s experience, he told reporters on Monday, lockdowns mean people participate less in tracing contacts they may have had. “Such an approach,” he said, “is close-minded, coercive, and inflexible.” Italy and South Korea are more than 5,000 miles apart, but there are several similarities when it comes to coronavirus. Both countries’ main outbreaks were initially clustered in smaller cities or towns, rather than in a major metropolis – which meant the disease quickly threatened local health services. And both involved doctors who decided to ignore testing guidelines. Italy’s epidemic kicked off last month. A local man with flu symptoms was diagnosed after he had told medical staff he had not been to China and discharged himself, said Massimo Lombardo, head of local hospital services in Lodi. The diagnosis was only made after the 38-year-old, whose name has only been given as Mattia, returned to the hospital. Testing guidelines at the time said it was not necessary to test people who had no link to China or other affected areas. But an anaesthetist pushed the protocols and decided to go ahead and test for COVID-19 anyway, Lombardo said. Now, some experts in Italy believe Mattia may have been infected through Germany, rather than China. Decisions about testing hinge partly on what can be done with people who test positive, at a time when the healthcare system is already under stress. In Italy at first, regional authorities tested widely and counted all positive results in the published total, even if people did not have symptoms. Then, a few days after the patient known as Mattia was found to have COVID-19, Italy changed tack, only testing and announcing cases of people with symptoms. The authorities said this was the most effective use of resources: The risk of contagion seemed lower from patients with no symptoms, and limited tests help produce reliable results more quickly. The approach carried risks: People with no symptoms still can be infected and spread the virus. On the other hand, the more you test the more you find, so testing in large numbers can put hospital systems under strain, said Massimo Antonelli, director of intensive care at the Fondazione Policlinico Universitario Agostino Gemelli IRCCS in Rome. Testing involves elaborate medical processes and follow-up. “The problem is actively searching for cases,” he said. “It means simply the numbers are big.” Italy has a generally efficient health system, according to international studies. Its universal healthcare receives funding below the European Union average but is comparable with South Korea’s, at 8.9% of GDP against 7.3% in South Korea, according to the World Health Organization. Now, that system has been knocked off balance. Staff are being brought into accident and emergency departments, holidays have been canceled and doctors say they are delaying non-urgent operations to free up intensive care beds. Pier Luigi Viale, head of the infectious disease unit at Sant’ Orsola-Malpighi hospital in Bologna, is working around the clock – in three jobs. His hospital is handling multiple coronavirus cases. His doctors are shuttling to other hospitals and clinics in the area to lend their expertise and help out with cases. In addition, his doctors also have to deal with patients with other contagious diseases who are struggling to survive. “If it drags on for weeks or months we’ll need more reinforcements,” he told Reuters. Last week, the mayor of Castiglione d’Adda, a town of about 5,000 people in Lombardy’s “red zone” which was the first to be locked down, made an urgent online appeal for help. He said his small town had had to close its hospital and was left with one doctor to treat more than 100 coronavirus patients. Three of the town’s four doctors were sick or in self quarantine. “Doctors and nurses are at the limit,” said a nurse from the hospital where Mattia was taken in. “If you have to manage people under artificial respiration you have to be watching them constantly, you can’t look after the new cases that come in.” Studies so far suggest that every positive case of coronavirus can infect two other people, so local authorities in Lombardy have warned that the region’s hospitals face a serious crisis if the spread continues – not just for COVID-19 patients but also for others whose treatment has been delayed or disrupted. As the crisis spreads into Italy’s less prosperous south, the problems will be magnified. Intensive care facilities face the most intense pressure. They require specialist staff and expensive equipment and are not set up for mass epidemics. In total, Italy has around 5,000 intensive care beds. In the winter months, some of these are already occupied by patients with respiratory problems. Lombardy and Veneto have just over 1,800 intensive care beds between public and private systems, only some of which can be set aside for COVID-19 patients. The government has asked regional authorities to increase the number of intensive care places by 50% and to double the number of beds for respiratory and contagious diseases, while reorganizing staff rosters to ensure adequate staffing. Some 5,000 respirators have been acquired for intensive care stations, the first of which are due to arrive on Friday, deputy Economy Minister Laura Castelli said. The region has already asked nursing institutes to allow students to bring forward their graduation to get more nurses into the system early. Pools of intensive care specialists and anaesthetists are to be set up, including staff from outside the worst affected regions. To add to the burden, hospitals in Italy depend on medical personnel to try to trace the contacts that people who test positive have had with others. One doctor in Bologna, who asked not to be named, said he had spent a 12-hour day tracing people who had been in contact with just one positive patient, to ensure those who next need testing are found. “You can do that if the number of cases remains two to three,” the doctor said. “But if they grow, something has to give. The system will implode if we continue to test everyone actively and then have to do all this.” In South Korea as in Italy, an early case of COVID-19 was identified when a medical officer followed their intuition, rather than the official guidelines, on testing. The country’s first case was a 35-year-old Chinese woman who tested positive on Jan. 20. But the largest outbreak was detected after the 31st patient, a 61-year-old woman from South Korea’s southeastern city of Daegu, was diagnosed on Feb. 18. Like the patient named Mattia in Italy, the woman had no known links to Wuhan, the Chinese province where the disease was first identified. And as in Italy, the doctors’ decision to recommend a test went against guidelines at the time to test people who had been to China or been in contact with a confirmed case, said Korea Medical Association’s Choi Jaewook. “Patient 31,” as she became known, was a member of a secretive church which Deputy Minister for Health and Welfare Kim Gang-lip said has since linked to 61% of cases. Infections spread beyond the congregation after the funeral of a relative of the church’s founder was held at a nearby hospital, and there were several other smaller clusters around the country. Once the church cluster was identified, South Korea opened around 50 drive-through testing facilities around the country. In empty parking lots, medical staff in protective clothing lean into cars to check their passengers for fever or breathing difficulties, and if needed, collect samples. The process usually takes about 10 minutes, and people usually receive the results in a text reminding them to wash their hands regularly and wear face masks. A total of 117 institutions in South Korea have equipment to conduct the tests, according to the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC). The numbers fluctuate daily, but an average of 12,000 is possible, and maximum capacity is 20,000 tests a day. The government pays for tests of people with symptoms, if referred by a doctor. Otherwise, people who want to be tested can pay up to 170,000 won ($140), said an official at a company called Seegene Inc, which supplies 80% of the country’s kits and says it can test 96 samples at once. There are also 130 quarantine officers like Kim Jeong-hwan, who focus on minute details to track potential patients. The 28-year-old public health doctor spends his whole working days remotely checking up on people who have tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus. Kim, who is doing military service, is one of a small army of quarantine officers who track the movements of any potential carriers of the disease by phone, app or the signals sent by cell phones or the black boxes in automobiles. Their goal: To trace all the contacts people may have had, so they too can be tested. “I haven’t seen anyone telling bad lies,” Kim said. “But lots of people generally don’t remember exactly what they did.” Underlining their determination, quarantine officers told Reuters they located five cases after a worker in a small town caught the virus and went to work in a “coin karaoke,” a bar where a machine lets people sing a few songs for a dollar. At first, the woman, who was showing symptoms, did not tell the officers where she worked, local officials told Reuters. But they put the puzzle together after questioning her acquaintances and obtaining GPS locations on her mobile device. “Now, quarantine officers have maximum power and authority,” said Kim Jun-geun, an official at Changnyeong County who collects information from quarantine officers. South Korea’s government also uses location data to customize mass messages sent to cellphones, notifying every resident when and where a nearby case is confirmed. “Until we fix this,” Lee said, “explosions like this can keep blowing up anywhere.” Tags: ncov"

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (Photo by Jack GUEZ / AFP / MANILA BULLETIN) Netanyahu issued the call as he ordered the closure of schools. In a live television address, the premier said it was necessary to form a government “to save the lives of numerous citizens”. “I call for the formation of an emergency government for a limited time, from this evening,” he said. Final results of the March 2 elections showed the prime minister’s right-wing Likud party and its allies falling short of the 61 seats required to form a government. Gantz, who heads the centrist Blue and White party, had also been aiming to form a government in alliance with the centre-left and with the support of the mainly Arab Joint List. Following Netanyahu’s announcement, Gantz said “in light of the situation, we would be willing discuss the establishment of a broad, national emergency government.” Gantz said such a government should include representatives from “all parties” represented in the parliament. It was not immediately clear when talks on forming such a government would begin or who would lead it. The nationalist Yisrael Beitenu, which won seven seats and holds the balance of power, also called on Thursday for a unity government to respond to the coronavirus crisis. President Reuven Rivlin, a largely ceremonial figure tasked with selecting a candidate to lead a government, said he had spoken to both Netanyahu and Gantz on Thursday. The president offered “his support for the formation of a government as soon as possible to deal with the national crisis,” Rivlin’s office said in a statement. The March 2 election was Israel’s third inconclusive vote in less than a year. Netanyahu also ordered the immediate closure of Israeli schools and universities. Authorities have banned assemblies of more than 100 people. The Israeli Rabbinate have called for faithful to accept official instructions as “a religious obligation”. Entry to Israel has been barred for all foreigners except those who can prove they can remain in isolation. Everyone arriving in the country must be quarantined for two weeks, Netanyahu announced Monday. Israel’s health ministry has reported 109 COVID-19 cases in Israel and says more than 32,000 people are in quarantine. Tags: ncov"

President Emmanuel Macron (AFP / MANILA BULLETIN FILE PHOTO) In an address to the nation on the fight against COVID-19, which has already killed 61 people and infected almost 2,900 in France, Macron made clear it can no longer be business as usual. Creches, schools and universities would close from Monday “until further notice”, he said, describing the novel coronavirus as France’s most serious health crisis in a century. But the president also announced that nationwide local elections scheduled for Sunday will not be postponed. “We are just at the beginning of this crisis,” Macron said. “In spite of all our efforts to brake it, this virus is continuing to propagate and to accelerate.” Macron asked people older than 70, those who suffer chronic diseases, respiratory troubles, and the handicapped, “to stay at home” in as far as possible. This is the group of people most at risk of serious consequences from the virus that has swept the world and caused markets to crash. “They can, of course, leave home to do the shopping, to take some air, but they should limit their contacts (with other people) as much as possible,” said the president. As for the elections, Macron said he had consulted experts who were of the opinion that “there is nothing to prevent the French, even the most vulnerable, from going to the ballot box” as long as everyone observes basic infection-prevention rules, including observing a safe personal distance from others. Municipal officials have announced a string of protection measures, including providing hand sanitiser at polling stations. “It is important at this time… to assure the continuity of our democratic life and that of our institutions,” said Macron. The president acknowledged the anxiety of small business owners and the tourism and culture industries that form such a large part of the French economy. In this regard, he said the state would “take charge of the compensation of employees forced to stay at home.” Furthermore, companies can opt to delay, without penalty, the payment of taxes and other public contributions due in March. Those employers that can, should allow their staff to work from home, the president added. Public transport will not be interrupted, said the head of state, “because to stop it would be to block everything, including the possibility to provide health care” where needed. But those who can limit their use of trains, metros and buses, should do so. Non-essential medical procedures will be postponed to free up space and personnel needed to care for those in urgent need. In a rare comment by a eurozone head of state on monetary policy, Macron indicated the European Central Bank should do more to bolster the European economy at this time. “The ECB has announced its first decisions. Will they be sufficient? I don’t think so,” he said. The ECB had launched a flurry of measures to cushion the impact of the virus but surprised observers by leaving interest rates unchanged. Macron said Europe will have to react “fast, and strongly” to “relaunch” the economy in the wake of the epidemic. Any steps to close borders, he added, will have to be jointly decided “at the European level”. Tags: ncov"

Mas mabuti ng handa tayo dahil itong virus na ‘to ay nakakamatay talaga. I’m not saying this for us to panic, but in a way, we panic but we do things correctly to prevent the spread (of the virus),” he explained. The executive order also aims “to give time and opportunity for school officials to study and formulate preventive measures, infection control and response systems within their respective institutions.” Public and private school officials were also ordered to undertake sanitation and disinfection of their respective school premises, in coordination or with the assistance of the City Government. He also called on barangay officials to provide schools with thermal scanners for them to monitor and report any symptoms, as well as any travelers who came from abroad for monitoring. Although he was confident that school officials were doing everything they could to prevent the virus from spreading, the mayor said that he was more concerned of the students while traveling to and from their schools. “Our children are vulnerable. We are also concerned that they use public utility vehicles (PUVs), and many of them eat their lunch outside (their schools). It’s also difficult because most students come from various provinces,” he added. According to him, the order was also in anticipation of the possible extension of suspension of classes in the National Capital Region (NCR) where students may go home to their provinces considering that Tacloban has only 17 flights daily. “I would recommend that they go home first to their provinces and stay indoors until this passes. If this clears up within a month, then everything will go back to normal, those activities would push through,” he said reffering to activities that were postponed because of the virus such as the Eastern Visayas Regional Athletic Associations (EVRAA) Meet. He likewise urged establishments to exercise caution because of the possibility that some students would take advantage of the class suspension to go to malls or computer shops. Meanwhile, the official said that it was just his initial announcement as they were still monitoring the situation in NCR, but he also clarified that he was not considering a full lockdown of the city. “I am sad that it will affect the economy of Tacloban but I don’t want to risk it. We’ve already suffered enough,” he said. The official also disclosed that they were monitoring a patient under investigation (PUI) who is a teacher. According to him, the patient’s husband who works in Europe came and left again for Europe in February. She has shown symptoms such as fever for a week now. Tags: ncov"

That is what we are doing,” said DOH 11 director Annabelle Yumang in an interview with the City Government’s radio station – Davao City Disaster Radio (DCDR 87.5 FM) on Thursday. “As of now, even though we only have PUIs here, we are urging the commitment of our hospitals in care there will be an increase in the cases that they will have to accept these cases.” The regional director said what was really needed right now was the cooperation from everyone in the community. “From our private sectors, government sectors, all of us must help. Because if it is going to be done by one or just the local government alone, it’s difficult. What we need is the cooperation and commitment of each agency,” Yumang said. Meanwhile, the DOH also called for the public to observe the preventive measures issued by the Department amid the confirmation of a positive case for coronavirus in Cagayan de Oro. “As of now, we do not have any additional advisories, apart from that, we just have to really intensify our preventive measures,” said Yumang. Yumang said the preventive measures being implemented will play a big role in keeping everyone from infections, commending the local government officials for initiating precautionary measures following the threat on the local transmission of the COVID-19. “Thanks to our local officials that they are doing their part in preventing the possible threat of COVID here,” she said. Yumang said, should there also be a case here in the region they will be intensifying the implementation of contact tracing. “This contact tracing means it will trace the history of the person positive of coronavirus of who were the persons he or she had direct communication with, the places that he visited will also be inspected to also check the other persons in the area so as for them to be monitored for them not to get sick,” she said.

,"March 12, 2020, 9:59 PM",nCov,Chemistry professor explains how soap–not alcohol–annihilates coronavirus,By Gabriela Baron,"By Gabriela Baron Alcohol-based disinfectants are also effective, but soap still reigns supreme when beating the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) responsible for coronavirus disease 2010 (COVID-19). According to chemistry professor Palli Thordarson, soap works well on COVID-19 and most viruses because the virus is a self-assembled nanoparticle in which the weakest link is the lipid (fatty) bilayer. “The soap dissolves the fat membrane and the virus falls apart like a house of cards and ‘dies’, or rather, we should say it becomes inactive as viruses aren’t really alive,” the professor said. Thordarson explained that while alcohol-based disinfectants have similar effects, they are not really quite as good as normal soap. “The antibacterial agents in these products don’t affect the virus structure much at all.” Soapy water is totally different, Thordarson said, because it “competes” with the lipids in the virus membrane. The soap is effective in dissolving the glue that holds the virus together. It also outcompetes the interactions between the virus and the skin surface because soap contains fat-like substances known as amphiphiles structurally similar to the lipids in the virus membrane. Most viruses consist of three key building blocks: RNA, proteins, and lipids. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also recommends washing hands with soap and water. “Hand washing reduces the amounts of all types of germs and chemicals on hands,” CDC said. Thordarson also reminded people to thoroughly rub and soak the hands. “The skin is quite rough and wrinkly which is why you do need a fair amount of rubbing and soaking to ensure the soap reaches every crook and cranny on the skin surface that could be hiding active viruses.” With that being said, you may now stop hoarding alcohol and start washing your hands with soap.

,"March 12, 2020, 9:50 PM",nCov,Spraying alcohol all over your body to kill coronavirus and other myths,MYTH: Spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body will kill COVID-19,"As the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) continues to spread globally, news articles and social media posts about the outbreak continue to circulate online. Unfortunately, some information contains fiction — and during a viral outbreak, rumors and misinformation can be dangerous.  (Keith Bacongco / MANILA BULLETIN) MYTH: Spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body will kill COVID-19 FACT: According to the World Health Organization (WHO), spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body will not kill viruses that have already entered your body. “Spraying such substances can be harmful to clothes or mucous membranes (eyes, mouth). Be aware that both alcohol and chlorine can be useful to disinfect surfaces, but they need to be used under appropriate recommendations.” MYTH: Cold weather can kill COVID-19 FACT: There is no reason to believe that cold weather can kill COVID-19. The normal human body temperature remains 36.5C to 76C, regardless of external temperature or weather. MYTH: COVID-19 can be transmitted through mosquito bites FACT: The new coronavirus is a respiratory virus that spreads primarily through droplets generated when an infected person coughs or sneezes, or through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose. To date, there has been no information or evidence that COVID-19 can be transmitted through mosquitoes. MYTH: Pets at home can spread COVID-19 FACT: The WHO reiterated that there is no evidence that companion animals or pets such as dogs or cats can be infected with the new coronavirus. MYTH: Vaccines against pneumonia can protect you against COVID-19 FACT: Vaccines against pneumonia, such as pneumococcal vaccine and haemophilus influenza type B (Hib) vaccine, do not provide protection against the new coronavirus. “The virus is so new and different that it needs its own vaccine. Researchers are trying to develop a vaccine against COVID-19, and WHO is supporting their efforts.” MYTH: COVID-19 only affects old people FACT: WHO underscored that people of all ages can be infected by the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). Older people, and people with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease) appear to be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virus. MYTH: Antibiotics prevent and treat COVID-19 FACT: Antibiotics only work against bacteria, not viruses. COVID-19 is a virus; therefore, antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment. MYTH: There are medicines to prevent COVID-19 FACT: To date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat COVID-19. “However, those infected with the virus should receive appropriate care to relieve and treat symptoms, and those with severe illness should receive optimized supportive care. Some specific treatments are under investigation, and will be tested through clinical trials,” the WHO noted. (Prepared by Gabriela Baron) Tags: ncov"

(Photo courtesy of Sen. Bong Go / MANILA BULLETIN) In his address to the public following his meeting with the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Disease, Duterte said domestic land, air, and sea travel to and from Metro Manila shall be suspended from March 15 to April 14. Duterte likewise told Metro Manila residents not fear the word “lockdown” since it is only implemented to keep them safe from the disease. “It’s just a matter of protecting and defending you from COVID-19. That’s about it. It has nothing to do with the power of the military or the police, nor my power or these guys beside me. It’s just an issue of protecting public interest,” he said. The President added that the public should not just brush the issue of COVID-19 aside. He, however, appealed for their cooperation. “It’s a serious one. It is true, ‘wag ninyong maliitin (do not belittle it). Do not minimize it. But as I said, do not kill yourself with worry because as I said, the government is doing everything to make it at least controllable,” he said. Public places He said mass gatherings, where the number of people attending could strain the planning and response resources of the community hosting the event, shall be prohibited during the community quarantine period. Mass public transports such as the Light Rail Transits (LRT), Metro Rail Transit (MRT), and the Philippine National Railways (PNR) shall continue their operations. The Department of Transportation shall issue guidelines to ensure social distancing in public transports. Class suspension Meanwhile, classes in all levels in Metro Manila shall remain until April 12, 2020 but all students are still required to fulfill their educational requirements during the period. Local government units, under the supervision of the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG), shall be responsible for implementing measures to ensure that students remain in their homes during the class suspension. President Duterte said students should stay at home and study but doubts they will follow his advice since he knows schoolchildren will just play with their phones. “Avoid trouble with the law, avoid trouble with anybody. Just follow. Better just stay home and study,” he said. “Kung ayaw niyong sundin (If you don’t want to follow), you stick with your cellphone, ang ga-graduate niyan yung cellphone niyo, hindi ikaw (your phones will be the ones graduating, not you),” he added. Localized community quarantines Meanwhile, Duterte laid down the guidelines local government units in other areas should follow in imposing localized community quarantines: Duterte left to the discretion of LGUs outside Metro Manila to suspend classes but warned they should not do so over trivial reasons. “It is only done because you have to protect them (students) from the COVID-19. ‘Yan lang talaga (That’s it). Do not do it just to please everybody,” he said. Work arrangement Work in the Executive Branch shall be suspended for the next 30 days without prejudice to the formation of skeletal workforces by government agencies to maintain the unimpeded delivery of services to the public. However, health and emergency frontline services shall remain in full operation. The private sector, on the other hand, is encouraged to implement flexible work arrangements following the guidelines that will be issued by the Departments of Labor and Employment (DOLE), and of Trade and Industry (DTI) for the welfare of workers. Meanwhile, all manufacturing, retail, and service establishments are advised to remain in full operation during the period of the community quarantine. However, they should implement strict social distancing measures. President Duterte said private company owners should make sure that their employees are taken care of if they would require them to come to work. “See to it that they are taken care of, ‘yang mga management, ‘wag ninyong pabayaan ang mga trabahante ninyo (the management, do not forsake your employees),” he said. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the COVID-19 a pandemic,  saying it was now a crisis that will touch every sector. The WHO pointed out that there were already 118,000 cases of the disease in over 110 countries Wednesday.

The SARS COV-2 detection kit being manufactured and stockpiled by Manila HealthTek, Inc. as the GenAmplify COVID-19 detection kit will cost around P1,320 per test, in contrast to the foreign kit which costs around P8,500 per test.  A Manila Healthek Inc. staff shows the COVID-19 test kit developed by experts from the Philippine Genome Center and the National Institute of Health of the University of the Philippines- Manila at a press conference at the University of the Philippines Diliman yesterday. The kit, which was recently allowed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), is aimed to rapidly detect the presence of the coronavirus in an individual. (ALVIN KASIBAN / MANILA BULLETIN) “Around 200 GenAmplify™ kits can be produced in a week, and enough kits are in stock now for around 6,000 tests, with more orders for around 20,000 tests already expected,” Concepcion said. The detection kit was developed by UP Philippine Genome Center (PGC) Deputy Director Dr. Raul Destura and other scientists and researchers from the UP Manila National Institutes of Health and the PGC. It was funded by the Department of Science and Technology through its Philippine Council for Health Research and Development. Destura said countries all over the world have the “same starting point” and “same timeline” in developing specific diagnostic kits for COVID-19. This was after China made the genome sequencing of novel coronavirus publicly available last Jan. 12. “We have the responsibility to help the government in providing technology for the country. It was not easy but we did our best because we want to show (other countries) that we can also do it here to address the needs of our country,” Destura said. “We are one with the government in providing this technology to make it accessible to all.” “We just need two to three weeks of field validation for the testing kit to be released to a full commercial platform. We just need a little patience. Our main intention is public safety and service to the community and our country,” he explained. Concepcion said the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) issuance of a certificate of exemption for the kit will ensure that the locally produced technology will be made available to a greater number of Filipinos at much less cost. “With the increased availability of testing, we can expect that the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 will likely grow in our country and perhaps in our university community. This might become a source of anxiety and concern, even fear,” he said. “However, we assure you that the UP administration is taking immediate and appropriate action in response to this outbreak, with the guidance of our experts from the PGC, PGH (Philippine General Hospital), and UP Manila.” Concepcion said the PGH has protocols in place to respond to the possible increase in the number of patients infected through local transmission. This includes the setting up of a hospital response to assure the readiness and safety of health staff to triage, diagnose, and manage patients suspected and confirmed to have COVID-19, including the creation of an incident command system or COVID task force. He added that they will be training front-liners and paramedical staff to address technical proficiency and emotional/occupational concerns related to COVID-19.

(MANILA BULLETIN) “We are protecting everyone,” said DepEd Undersecretary and Spokesperson Nepomuceno Malaluan when asked about the status of teachers when classes are declared suspended. Teachers Dignity Coalition (TDC) National Chairperson Benjo Basas, in a separate statement also issued on Thursday, reiterated the group’s appeal for DepEd to clarify whether teachers are “obliged” to report for duty when classes are suspended or not. Based on the provision of DepEd Order No. 43, s. 2012, Basas noted that teachers are not required to report for work when classes are cancelled. The provision specifically cites that “teaching personnel handling cancelled or suspended classes are likewise allowed to leave their stations in consideration of the work they will need to undertake during make-up classes.” “This is very clear but we don’t understand why some DepEd officials in the region and the principals in some schools do not recognize this directive and still require their teachers to report to school even when classes are suspended,” Basas said. Since the class suspension was announced early this week, Basas revealed that the TDC has been receiving reports from its chapter officials on the field that some school officials require teachers to go to school to perform clean-up activities and “disinfect” their respective classrooms. Basas noted that many regional officials initially required teachers to go to school during class suspension to do cleaning tasks. But when their attention to this was called out, these local DepEd officials pulled out their directives. “If we are protecting our learners, we need to protect our teachers too because if they get infected with the virus, they can pass this on to the learners and even their family members,” he said. Malaluan earlier noted that the “major disinfecting” related to COVID-19 is mainly being done by local government units (LGUs). However, he noted that “within the classroom, the person supervising the observance of the health precautions is the teacher” and this “includes minor disinfecting within classroom, such as commonly-held objects such door knobs, etc.” In response to TDC’s latest statement, Malaluan noted that “dichotomizing the DepEd community” and “divisive posturing” are not needed “at this time of great need.” Tags: ncov"

Mayor Evelio Leonardia, in a press briefing on Thursday, said that the basis for the declaration was President Duterte’s Proclamation No. 922, declaring a state of national health emergency all over the country, and the World Health Organization (WHO) declaration that the disease was already a public health emergency of international concern. Leonardia said there was no need for him to issue an Executive Order because the resolution of the City Council and the position of the President were enough basis for the local declaration. For his part, Sangguniang Panlungsod (SP) majority floor leader Councilor Renecito Novero, who authored Resolution No. 282, said the declaration will enhance the city government’s preventive measures and justify the utilization of the calamity fund to battle the disease. The Bacolod City Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (CDRRMC) has passed a resolution last January, requesting for a P10-million budget that will be utilized by the inter-agency task force for the prevention and control of COVID-19.

Senator Risa Hontiveros (JAY GANZON / MANILA BULLETIN) Hontiveros said the ongoing water shortage in Metro Manila is putting entire communities at grave risk, denying many Filipinos the ability to protect themselves against the COVID-19 outbreak. “Paano tayo maghuhugas ng kamay kung wala namang tubig (How are we going to wash our hands if there is no water)?” Hontiveros asked. The number of infected individuals who have contracted the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), climbed to 49 cases as of last night. Against this backdrop, water concessionaires Manila Water Company and Maynilad Water Services has said they will implement rotational water service interruptions starting this month. Hontiveros said the supply interruptions will have a “severely disastrous effect” on efforts to contain the rapid spread of COVID-19 in the metro. “There is only one thing more important than face masks or alcohol in our fight to prevent the virus, and that is running water,” she said. “Proper hand washing with soap and running water is the most effective way to kill viruses and avoid getting infected.” “Kapag mahina ang tulo ng tubig, hihina din ang laban natin sa COVID-19. Nilalagay natin sa peligro ang mismong buhay at kalusugan ng ating mga kababayan, (If water flow is weak, our defense against COVID-19 will also weaken. We are putting the lives and health of our people at risk),” Hontiveros said. People living in poor and densely-populated communities where social distancing can be impossible are especially vulnerable, the senator said. Hontiveros then urged the government, especially the National Water Resources Board (NWRB) and the Metropolitan Waterworks Sewerage System (MWSS), to step up their efforts to boost the water supply in communities in the upcoming weeks. She said a steady water supply should be particularly provided to urban poor neighborhoods and areas where there is a heavy concentration of people. “Magpadala na po kayo ng water trucks, para kumpleto ang tulog ng mga tao, imbes na pumipila o naghihintay ng tulo ng gripo sa hating gabi o madaling araw, (Please start sending water trucks so people can sleep, instead of waiting for hours to wait for water to come),” she urged the water concessionaires. “We should not allow poor public services to worsen the already terrible COVID-19 outbreak into a deadly health crisis,” she said.

Infectious disease specialist Dr. Leonel Quitos said the patient had been suffering fever, cough, and breathing difficulty for two weeks before he was confined at AMC. The patient was referred Quitos on March 7, when PH40 was no longer responding to antibiotics. On March 8, PH40 was transported to Northern Mindanao Medical Center in Cagayan de Oro City where he was confirmed positive for COVID-19 on March 11. Dr. Quitos, per advice from NMMC doctors, said PH40 is improving and his immediate relatives are asymptomatic.

President Rodrigo Roa Duterte and Ambassador of the People’s Republic of China to the Philippines Huang Xilian (KING RODRIGUEZ/PRESIDENTIAL PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN FILE PHOTO) Chinese Ambassador to the Philippines Huang Xilian made the offer after President Duterte cited Chinese President Xi Jinping’s handling of the health emergency during their meeting at the Palace last Wednesday. “President Rodrigo Roa Duterte on Wednesday received China Ambassador Huang Xilian, stressing the importance of continued economic cooperation as well as working together to addresses challenges posed by the spread of COVID-19,” a Palace press statement read. “Huang expressed solidarity with the Philippine government in its efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19. The Chinese ambassador also conveyed China’s readiness to extend assistance,” it said. In the meeting with the Chinese envoy, President Duterte also offered the country’s sympathy and solidarity with the people of China affected by the coronavirus outbreak. The government recently donated 52 boxes containing emergency medical and food supplies for the people of virus-hit Wuhan in Hubei province. “He extended the Philippines’ solidarity with China and the international community in addressing the global public health emergency,” the Palace said. “President Duterte has noted President Xi Jinping’s handling of the health emergency,” it added. The World Health Organization has recently declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic after it rapidly spread from Wuhan to more than 100 countries in recent weeks. The number of worldwide cases has reached more than 100,000 while the deaths have surpassed the 4,000 mark. More than 3,000 people have died due to the virus in China, mostly in Hubei province. As of Wednesday, the Philippines has recorded 49 cases of infections, including two fatalities. A public health emergency has been declared over the country to intensify efforts to contain the spread of the disease. Closer Philippines-China economic cooperation The Philippines and China have also agreed to sustain economic cooperation, including the area of infrastructure development. According to the Palace, the President recognized China’s “continued support to the socio-economic agenda of his administration.” As the two nations mark the 45th year of diplomatic relations this June, Duterte expressed hope that “China will continue to extend support and fast track infrastructure development.” “He looks forward to a more robust trade with China, with a greater and improved access for Philippine exports to the Chinese market,” the Palace said. Huang also assured the President about China’s commitment for “a deeper cooperation” with the Philippines especially in infrastructure development, according to the Palace. “He noted the steady progress in the joint infrastructure projects over the past two years,” it said. The President previously declared that the Philippines and China continue to be “two great friends” despite a lingering territorial conflict. He has pursued bilateral dialogue with China to manage the dispute in the West Philippine Sea while seeking closer economic and security ties at the start of his term. Recently, the offshore gaming operations mostly run by Chinese nationals have been under scrutiny over alleged criminal and other illegal activities. The President, however, refused to suspend or shut down these offshore gambling services, insisting they are “clean” and provide huge revenues for the government. Tags: ncov"

Thailand, which has reported a total of 70 cases, put surgical masks and sanitizers under its list of controlled goods last month, as the spread of the coronavirus led to shortages in stores. The shortage of surgical masks prompted the Thai government to approve a 225 million baht ($7 million) budget last week for government agencies to produce 50 million cloth masks in a matter of days for nationwide distribution. Cloth masks are enough to prevent people from catching the virus via droplets from coughing or sneezing, said Panpimon Wipulakorn, Director-General for the Department of Health. “The droplet from coughing and sneezing is around five microns and we have tested already that cloth masks can protect against droplets bigger than one micron,” Panpimon said, adding that the masks needed to be washed daily. The official herself appeared in a public health ministry video teaching people how to make cloth masks at home. Workshops have also been set up nationwide to help produce the masks. Many Thais answered the government’s call by getting together in small groups at community centers around the country to make masks from cloth and distribute them to others for free. It did not take long for Phongsai Kaewvichit, a 63-year-old retiree, to make one. “I’m making these cloth face masks for my family and relatives because I can’t find the surgical masks anymore and the price is very high,” said Phongsai. “I think it is better than nothing because at least it can protect me from people’s saliva in close contact.”m 22 countries and territories, including China.

The province of Bataan plays host to this annual historical milestone. Araw ng Kagitingan is a national holiday commemorating the Fall of Bataan. It pays tribute to the bravery of the Filipino and American soldiers who fought for freedom during World War II. The president of the Philippines is always the special guest in this event. According to Bataan Tourism head Alice Dizon Pizarro, they have decided to cancel several events leading to the Bataan Day rites at Mt. Samat. She said, “these are the following: the awarding  of the Congressional Medal of Honour by a representative of the United States (US) Senate set for April 5, the parade of floats and the awarding of plaques and certificates to veterans also on April 5;   the historical symposium set to happen on March 18; the Historical Quiz Bee set for April 2 and 3; the Padyakan bike enthusiasts event set for April 4 and the trade fair “Galing sa Bataan” set on April 1-6 at the Capitol grounds showcasing Bataan’s products and crafts. The announcement comes in the wake of about 50 percent drop in all tourism-related activities in the province of Bataan because of the COVID-19 threat. Pizarro said, “the decrease is not unique to Bataan. We have received reports of cancellations of reservations for both big and small activities in nearby tourism destinations like Subic and Clark. That has a direct effect on us because most of the time, tourists who flock to Subic and Clark also visit Bataan for tourism purposes.

Bangamoro spokesman and minister of local government Naguib Sinarimbo (Ali Macabalang / MANILA BULLETIN) “Although Minister Sinarimbo feels well and does not have any flu-like symptoms, he opted for self-quarantine since he had a brief meeting with Senator (Sherwin) Gatchalian and other personnel at the Senate last Tuesday,” the MILG said in a statement sent to The Manila Bulletin. Sinarimbo, also a regional spokesman, attended the joint meeting of the Senate committees on Finance and Local Government on March 10 pursuant to a resolution filed earlier by Senator Ralph Recto urging the higher chamber of Congress to get abreast with the implementation of R.A. 11054, also known as the organic law of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM). The MILG echoed news reports that Senators Gatchalian and Nancy Binay declared on Wednesday “to undergo voluntary quarantine after interacting with a resource person during the (Senate) Committee Hearing on Education last March 5 who tested positive for COVID-19.” Sinarimbo, contacted by the Bulletin over the phone Thursday, emphasized that he was “certainly well without any sign of symptom” and “would like to avoid endangering his staff and visitors unduly.” The MILG is one of BARMM ministries registering the most number of daily visitors coming from the component areas of the autonomous region. But he quickly added that self-quarantine will not cause any operation vacuum in his agency because “I interact with my staff from time to time via teleconference calls” from his unspecified area of confinement. Sinarimbo enjoined his staff to “take precautionary measures by constantly disinfecting office equipment and to make available thermal scanners and disinfectants at the entry points (of the MILG building in this city.)” He also appealed to the public, particularly the BARMM constituents to “remain calm and abide by the protocols set by authorities” under the state of national health emergency declared by the President last March 8.

More senators are now following the lead of Senators Sherwin Gatchalian and Nancy Binay and announced Thursday that they will be under self-quarantine after a resource person during a committee hearing tested positive for COVID-19 and is now in critical condition.  Senate of the Philippines building (Senate of the Philippines official Facebook) Sen. Juan Edgardo “Sonny” Angara said he is “physically okay” but may also do self quarantine starting tomorrow. But Angara said he has sent his staff home since Monday afternoon. “I think the Philippines should be more proactive and look at the best practices of South Korea where they have tested a large number and measures have proven effective at lowering the number of cases,” Angara said. “I really don’t know if we are prepared for the worst case scenarios where our hospitals will fill up and people will die without the chance to get treatment. I’m sad to say that but I hope I’m wrong,” Angara said. Sen. Panfilo “Ping” Lacson, likewise, said he has chosen to follow Gatchalian and Binay’s lead. “There is every reason to be concerned as far as the senate is concerned since an invited resource person who has been tested positive for COVID-19 had not only entered the senate premises but even interacted with at least two senators and their staff, and God knows how many among us had close contact with our two colleagues, and so forth and so on, sharing elevators, lounge, and the session hall with them. Lacson added: “Sad to say, the developing events have already showed the inadequate response of government in regard to monitoring and containment.” Save for the breakthrough of the UP scientists in coming up with an FDA approved affordable test kits, Lacson said Filipinos have yet to see a concrete and decisive action to address the problem at hand. “Having said that, government should focus and make available all resources and logistics, both national and local in a consolidated effort to protect our citizens from this scourge, even to the point of implementing a case-to-case lockdown in known vulnerable areas like the NCR and other urban centers,” he stressed. “Further, an efficient and quick mobilization for data base gathering by the concerned agencies like the DICT and PSA should come into the picture, coupled by an equally efficient information dissemination by both public and private sectors,” Lacson added. Sen. Aquilino “Koko” Pimentel III said he would have wanted to do self quarantine but there are still some things that he still needs to do. “I talked to both Senators Gatchalian and Binay yesterday. I don’t think that’s good enough scientific basis to go on self quarantine,” Pimentel said. “But should that be the proper protocol, no problem with me. I would love a two week break from everything!” he stressed. Senate majority leader Juan Miguel “Migz” Zubiri, for his part, suggested that all senators be all tested for Covid19 “as we were exposed yesterday to a number of people.” “I had been warning my colleagues on the conduct of public hearings during these times but obviously some of them did not heed my warning,” Zubiri said. ” I support the SP’s (Senate President Sotto) plan to lockdown the Senate to be able to disinfect the building and I’ve suggested that all the employees work from home under self quarantine to protect our employees from the spread of the virus,” added Zubiri. “This virus is no joke and we should take this seriously. We urge the government, particularly the DOH, to make tens of thousands of testing kits available for our people to use and urge all our people to stop gatherings and unnecessary movements to prevent the spread amongst our people,” Zubiri emphasized. Sen. Richard Gordon, who cancelled his scheduled hearing on the Philippine Offshore Gaming Operations (POGO) scheduled on Thursday, said he will abide by the Senate’s protocol. “Out of our deep concern for the health and well-being of our staff in the Senate, our invited resource persons, media, our constituents, who visit the building and others who may attend the hearing of the Blue Ribbon Committee on POGO operations and money laundering, we have decided to postpone the hearing due to the possibility of the transmission of the COVID-19,” Gordon said in a statement. “With the increasing number of confirmed COVID-19 cases, we deemed it necessary to observe proper precautionary measures,” added Gordon.

It does not reflect the actual situation in the Senate,” he said. “The term lockdown has been misinterpreted and abused,” he pointed out. Certain areas of the building will be cordoned off from Senate employees while disinfection is being conducted. “Officials and their staff who have work to do and complete are required to report for work,” Sotto said in a separate statement. The clarification came following his announcement on Wednesday night that the Senate will be closed to employees and visitors. Sen. Sherwin Gatchalian had earlier bared that one of the resource persons in a hearing by the Senate Basic Education Committee last March 5 was one of the confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the country. Gatchalian, as well as Sen. Nancy Binay, who also attended the hearing, are now on self-quarantine. Despite the COVID-19 scare, Sotto maintained that the Senate has “to continue to function.” “The Filipino people need us today and we cannot let the threat and scare of an infection to distract us from work. However, I have given strict instructions that all employees should exercise extreme preventive practices as they go about their daily tasks,” he said. “It is of utmost importance that everyone observes proper hygiene and follows protocols as a precaution against contamination,” he ordered. The Senate chief said employees who experience symptoms of COVID-19, or those who have recently travelled to countries with high contamination rates, or those who had exposure to local patients, should go on self-quarantine but continue to work from home. Sotto said others who wish to enter the Senate’s premises during this time would first have to seek permission from Senate Sergeant-at-Arms Rene Samonte. Samonte will recommend to Sotto when the Senate can resume hearings and open to the public. “‘Til the disinfection is 100 percent [complete]. The Sergeant-at-Arms, Gen.

DILG Undersecretary Jonathan Malaya,(PCOO / MANILA BULLETIN) DILG Undersecretary Jonathan Malaya made the call stressing the word “lockdown’’ has struck public fear and panic even if “there are no compelling reasons to implement it now’’. He explained “that when you use the word lockdown it means that people are confined in one area or place and they are not allowed to leave by authorities’’. “That’s why the word lockdown is usually used with relation to prisoners. So when China declared a lockdown in Wuhan, their citizens are not allowed to leave those cities and the highways were closed. That’s a lockdown,” Malaya said. Explaining further, Malaya said a lockdown is an extreme measure which may be adopted “if we are already on Code Red Sublevel 2 when we have contained community transmission’’. But since these conditions are absent, Malaya noted “there is no compelling reason to place any place under lockdown”. He added that when a building or compound is closed for disinfecting or for other purposes, that’s not a lockdown. “That only means that the building, compound or place is closed and therefore we should accurately describe it as such. It’s just closed,” Malaya insisted. Malaya called on the media to be responsible enough to use the proper terms since facts should be relayed “and not add to the infodemic that’s currently gripping the world’’. “People watch the news of lockdowns in China and Italy so they know what it means. So when we use the word lockdown improperly in the local setting, it causes panic and fear,” he noted. He said that the constant use of the word lockdown has forced people to do panic buying and other unnecessary acts brought about by fear.

,"March 12, 2020, 3:41 PM",nCov,Australia unveils $11bn stimulus to avert virus downturn,By Agence France-Presse,"  By Agence France-Presse Australia on Thursday unveiled a massive US$11 billion spending plan designed to curb the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic and avert the country’s first recession in 29 years.  (REUTERS/ MANILA BULLETIN) Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced the nearly Aus$18 billion package — equivalent to just under one percent of GDP — which will primarily be targeted at businesses. “This plan is about keeping Australians in jobs. This plan is about keeping a business in business,” said Morrison. “This plan is about ensuring the Australian economy bounces back stronger on the other side of this.” Much of the money is expected to be distributed by the end of June, the country’s treasurer said. Australia has seen 136 confirmed cases of coronavirus, and three deaths. Morrison acknowledged the stimulus would mean he will not meet an election pledge to balance the country’s budget — a key plank of the party’s pitch to voters last year. Australia’s economy had already been limping before the coronavirus hit — with raging bushfires and drought slowing growth to a stall. The central bank has repeatedly cut rates to historic lows while warning that the coronavirus outbreak could have “large and long-lasting” effects. Morrison had on Wednesday announced a separate $1.6 billion war chest to bolster medical services that are likely to come under intense strain as the virus spreads in the coming months. He is expected to make a rare televised address to the country later on Thursday to speak about the broader challenges faced by the COVID-19 outbreak. Tags: ncov"

The Ambassador offered to donate this medicine to the Philippines and should be considered by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Department of Health (DOH) as treatment, according to the country’s procedures and protocols. Khovaev said Cicloferon is an over-the-counter medicine which the Russian medical practitioners precribed to those who were infected with COVID-19 and recovered after taking it. “Our medicine is as potent as our weapons,” he added and reminded Filipinos, particularly the Cebuanos not to panic because Russsia is ready to supply the country with the medicine which is highly-effective for treatment of patients infected with COVID-19. Khovaev said the Philippines must recover from the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) because the tourism potentials of Cebu and the country for Russian tourists is great. “Russia is very safe from the COVID-19and we are encouraging more Filipinos/Cebuanos to visit Russia,” he said. Russia and the Philippines committed to have a robust partnership to help the country in all aspects of security and defense and cyber law enforcement collaboration said Russian Ambassador to the Philippines Igor Anatolyevich Khovaev.

According toKrovaev, Cebu is a dynamic region, a driver for business and tourists’ potentials for Russia. This is why Russia wants to have a partnership with Cebu in terms of more Russians tourists to come to Cebu and more Filipino tourists going to Russia. He said it is easier to get a Russian visa than a US visa. Cebu and Russia plan to have a joint promotional tourism program by November or December this year, said Armi Garcia, honorary consul to the Federation of Russia. “There is a need to improve connectivity between Russia and Cebu because we already have a working system and it is working well. Russians are long staying tourists,” Garcia said. “And we spend a lot of money as tourists in other countries,” Krovaev added With Ambassador Khovaev were Embassy of the Russian Federation’s second secretary Denis Karenin and chairperson, honorary consul to Russia Armi Garcia.

(MANILA BULLETIN) The guidelines were listed under CSC Memorandum Circular (MC) No. 07, s.2020, signed by Chairperson Alicia de la Rosa-Bala. The Manila Bulletin acquired a copy of the document Wednesday night. “Pursuant to CSC Resolution No. 2000481 promulgated March 11, 2020, the Commission resolved to adopt the following Interim Guidelines for Alternative Work Arrangements and Support Mechanisms for Workers in the Government for the Duration of the State of Public Health Emergency Pursuant to Proclamation No. 922,” the memo read. Such alternative work arrangements are the four-day work week and employee shifting, the CSC said in the directive. Under a four-day work week, the individual’s workweek is reduced to four days but the number of work hours per day is increased to 10 hours. This means that the total number of required work hours per week shall not be less than 40 hours. Meanwhile, under shifting, the agencies shall strategize that the shifting of employees shall still meet the required 40 hours per week. For this purpose, shifting refers to the existing 24/7 shifting schedule, and shifting of assignment to perform frontline services. Speaking of frontline service providers like health providers and first responders, the memo instructs agency heads to ensure that they are provided with support mechanisms such as the following: 1.) health interventions, 2.) stress debriefing, and 3. appropriate technologies to minimize face to face contact. All government agencies, namely constitutional bodies, departments, bureaus, and agencies of the national government, government-owned or controlled corporations (GOCC) with original charters, local government units (LGUs), and state universities and colleges (SUCs) are covered by the CSC memo. “Agencies may formulate their internal rules and regulations governing the implementation of the alternative work arrangements in accordance with guidelines, which shall be submitted to the [CSC] through the CSC Regional Offices for records purposes,” it read. “Agencies shall adopt a monitoring mechanism during the implementation of the alternative work arrangements to ensure that public service delivery is not prejudiced,” the memo added. Either or both the four-day work week and shifting may be adopted by government offices, the Commission said. The CSC earlier suspended the conduct of the March 15, 2020 Career Service Examination-Pen and Paper Test (CSE-PPT). This was in compliance with Proclamation No. 922 signed by President Duterte declaring a State of Public Health Emergency throughout the Philippines and calling for the implementation of urgent, critical measures to contain the spread of COVID-19.

He is expected to announce short-term tax breaks or other forms of relief for individuals, as well as a stimulus package to help the economy from entering a negative spin that some fear could end in recession. He did not answer reporters’ questions about whether he was planning to impose new travel restrictions. Earlier, Ken Cuccinelli, the acting deputy secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, said a ban on travelers from Europe was being “considered.” Trump also did not say if he would meet demands from some lawmakers on declaring a national state of emergency, which would free up federal disaster funds. The president has taken fire for what critics say is a slow response to the spread of the virus, which gives flu-like symptoms and has claimed more than 4,500 lives worldwide. He has repeatedly played down the threat, initially claiming that only a handful of Americans were at risk. As of Wednesday, there were more than 1,100 confirmed cases and 32 deaths in the United States, according to a tally collated by Johns Hopkins University, with numbers expected to skyrocket once more testing is done. – ‘Going to get worse’ –
Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said COVID-19 was estimated to be 10 times more deadly than flu and that without aggressive containment and mitigation, “many millions” could potentially contract the virus. “The bottom line: it’s going to get worse,” Fauci said. There is also acute economic damage, with stock markets tanking on fears of recession, multiple cultural and sporting events cancelled, schools and universities closing, and companies scrambling to face the probability of sending many employees home on sick leave or self-quarantine. Even the US presidential election faces disruption, with Democratic candidates Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders canceling rallies and questions mounting over the future of Trump’s own usually frequent rallies. For Trump, steadying market jitters is a must if he is to maintain his reelection message of delivering a booming economy. At a White House meeting with US bank leaders, Trump said “we’ll be doing a lot of additional work with small businesses…, many billions of dollars.” Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said earlier that the White House was “looking at providing substantial relief to certain taxpayers and small businesses who will be able to get extensions on their taxes.” “We think we can provide over $200 billion of liquidity into the economy by delaying certain tax payments,” he said. Democratic leaders are cool on the idea of tax cuts and made a competing proposal for compensating workers’ lost wages and sick leave, as well as providing loan forgiveness for individuals. The Democratic proposal also called for disaster loans and grants for small businesses, emergency housing assistance, and loosened requirements for food assistance including continuing to serve meals to children even if schools are closed.

,"March 12, 2020, 7:45 AM",nCov,Lebanon suspends flights after second coronavirus death,By Agence France-Presse,"By Agence France-Presse Lebanon on Wednesday suspended flights from countries hit hardest by the novel coronavirus after announcing its second death from the pandemic in two days.  A Lebanese woman wears a protective mask in the capital Beirut, on March 11 (AFP Photo/JOSEPH EID) The Mediterranean nation has recorded at least 61 cases of COVID-19. Prime Minister Hassan Diab said Lebanon would suspend all trips to and from Italy, South Korea, Iran and China, the hardest hit countries. It would also stop arrivals from France, Egypt, Syria, Iraq, Germany, Spain and the United Kingdom, he said. Lebanese and their families, diplomats, employees of international organisations, as well as UN peacekeepers would still be allowed in, the premier added. After four days, all trips from those countries would be suspended, Diab said, without specifying the precise date. Earlier on Wednesday, the health ministry confirmed several new infections, bringing the total number of diagnosed cases to 61, most of whom had caught the virus from someone infected abroad. It also announced the death of man who had been suffering from a “chronic illness” before he was infected. An official at the ministry said the 55-year-old Lebanese national had not left the country recently but was in contact with infected people who had arrived from abroad. A 56-year-old man who had returned home from Egypt was the first to die on Tuesday. The novel coronavirus is the latest crisis to hit Lebanon, already reeling from economic collapse and anti-government protests. Health Minister Hamad Hassan said last week that the country had moved beyond the phase of “containment” and was bracing for a more serious outbreak. Schools, universities, cafes, bars and other public places have been ordered shut, and on Tuesday Shiite authorities suspended prayers until further notice. But public concern remains high amid fears that the country is ill-equipped to face a mass outbreak. Beirut’s Rafic Hariri state hospital, where the vast majority of cases are being treated, cannot bear the burden on its own, its director Firas al-Abyad said on Tuesday. “If the number of cases grows, then the capacity of the healthcare system to respond needs to be improved,” he said. According to the hospital director, more than seven hospitals have already been equipped to deal with the outbreak and several more are currently being reinforced. Tags: ncov"
,"March 12, 2020, 8:05 AM",nCov,World Health Organization describes coronavirus outbreak as pandemic,By Agence France-Presse,"By Agence France-Presse The World Health Organization called the new coronavirus outbreak a pandemic on Wednesday, issuing a grim warning that the global spread and severity of the illness was due to “alarming levels of inaction”.  WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus (AFP Photo/Fabrice COFFRINI) The call came as Europe faced a mounting number of cases — including a slew of new countries clocking first deaths — prompting governments to roll out increasingly tough measures to slow the rapid spread of the virus. The number of cases across the globe has risen to more than 124,000 with 4,500 deaths, including a jump in fatalities particularly in Iran and Italy, according to an AFP tally. The majority of cases have been in China where the outbreak first emerged in December, but as the number of new infections has steadied in the country, hotspots have emerged elsewhere — namely Italy, Iran and Spain. The head of the UN’s top health body for the first time characterised the outbreak as a pandemic, meaning it is spreading in several regions through local transmission. “We have never before seen a pandemic sparked by a coronavirus,” WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Wednesday, adding that the declaration would not change the organisation’s response to the outbreak. “We’re deeply concerned both by the alarming levels of spread and severity and by the alarming levels of inaction.” He did not single out any nations for not doing enough — or what further measures were needed. He instead called on “countries to take urgent and aggressive action”. – ‘No clients ‘ –
Signs of a widening European crisis emerged Wednesday, with Ireland, Albania, Belgium, Sweden and Bulgaria registering their first deaths, while Italy clocked more than 2,300 new cases in the last 24 hours and infections in Spain jumped by a quarter to more than 2,100. The surge brought Europe’s total number of cases to more than 22,000, with 930 deaths, and the US said it was considering issuing a ban on travellers from the continent. Millions of people in Italy are grappling with a nationwide clampdown that has emptied streets, shuttered shops and disrupted train and air travel. Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said Wednesday that Italy would shut all stores except for pharmacies and food shops to curb the disease. Factories and other big businesses can remain open as long as they adopt “appropriate security measures to prevent contagion,” Conte said His government vowed to spend up to 25 billion euros ($28 billion) to help contain fallout from the pandemic, including cash injections for hard-hit hotels and restaurants and allowing families to suspend some mortgage payments. Even places with no significant outbreaks like Poland and Ukraine announced school closures and other restrictive measures. Austria said it would shut museums and halt train services to and from Italy. In the Middle East, hard-hit Iran reported 63 new deaths, its highest single-day toll which brought total fatalities to 354. It has yet to impose quarantines but has closed schools, universities and hotels and called on people not to travel. WHO’s Tedros said the country, which has 9,000 cases, was “doing its best” to control the spread of the virus, but that it needed more supplies to cope. Elsewhere in the region, Kuwait said it was suspending all commercial flights in and out of the country, after it and other Gulf nations had already adopted travel restrictions. – Sliver of hope –
Offering a sliver of hope to the rest of the world, China again announced negligible new daily infections and only a relatively small number of deaths. Some businesses in China’s Hubei province — where the virus was first detected in December — were told they could restart work, reducing fears of a prolonged disruption of supply chains. But China remains the worst-affected country with more than 80,000 confirmed cases and over 3,000 deaths. Although Panama confirmed its first death Tuesday, Latin America — along with Africa and Oceania — has so far reported only small numbers of cases. And the United States saw its first signs of an emergency footing with the New York city government forming a containment zone around a suburb at the centre of an outbreak. Wall Street stocks suffered another brutal rout Wednesday, pushing the Dow into a “bear market,” or 20 percent from its peak, after the latest series of event cancelations and company warnings rattled investors. – Trump primetime address –
Disruption to supply chains from China, flagging demand and wildly fluctuating stock markets have sparked a series of profit warnings from companies and pushed governments into action. The UK promised a $39 billion fiscal stimulus and the central bank slashed its main interest rate to 0.25 percent following a similar move by the US Federal Reserve last week, intended to make borrowing cheaper and boost economic activity. US President Donald Trump will make a primetime address Wednesday on the coronavirus crisis, his latest attempt to counter criticism of his response to the growing health and economic fallout from the pandemic. While markets remain uneasy, COVID-19 continued to rip up the schedules of musicians, sports stars and cultural figures as governments around the world banned large gatherings. England’s top-flight football league saw its first cancellation with Wednesday’s match between Arsenal and Manchester City postponed, while E3, the world’s premier video game trade show, due to be held in June in Los Angeles, was called off. In an unprecedented move, NCAA officials on Wednesday closed the US national college basketball tournament to paying fans. The first games will be played on Tuesday. Tags: ncov"

The deceased patient was the country’s 35th confirmed case. She was admitted to the Manila Doctors Hospital in Manila. She was the first Filipino national to have died in relation to the virus that originated in Wuhan, China. The woman showed symptoms on Feb. 29 and tested positive for COVID-19 on March 11. The Health department said it is still gathering other information regarding the deceased patient, and added that it will “announce all pertinent details once all data has been transmitted and verified by the Department.” “Meanwhile, everyone is urged to follow DOH’s official accounts and to only source information on the COVID-19 health situation from official DOH channels,” it added. The first recorded death due to COVID-19 in the country involved a 44-year-old Chinese man from Wuhan, China. He was also the Philippines’ second confirmed case of COVID-19.

,"March 11, 2020, 8:40 PM",nCov,Garin bats for conversion of Lung Center into COVID-19 hospital,By Charissa Luci-Atienza and Ben Rosario,"By Charissa Luci-Atienza and Ben Rosario The minority bloc in the House of Representatives is batting for the designation of the Lung Center of the Philippines (LCP) as the government hospital to be dedicated to treating  patients infected with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19). At the same time, Senior Deputy Minority Leader and Iloilo Rep. Janette Garin called on the Department of Health (DOH) to fully implement the law that grants senior citizens free access to anti-flu and anti-pneumonia vaccines.  Deputy Minority Leader and Iloilo 1st district Rep. Janette Garin (KEVIN TRISTAN ESPIRITU / MANILA BULLETIN FILE PHOTO) With Minority Leader and Manila Rep. Bienvenido Abante, Garin told a press conference that designating a single medical facility for COVID9-19 will help prevent the spread of the dreaded disease. “We already conveyed to the DOH (Department of Health) our recommendation.  Let’s take away panic, we strongly recommend that DOH immediately take measures for a COVID-19-dedicated hospital,” said Garin, a former DOH secretary. She said the Lung Center is highly recommended because it is already a lung disease specialty hospital. The opposition lawmaker said that by appointing a single hospital for COVID-19 treatment, government will allow the efforts of its medical specialists and workers, as well as equipment and much-needed treatment facilities, to be focused. She said necessary preparations should be made to prepare LCP to accept patients infected with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), especially if there will be community transmission. “We can probably convert Lung Center as a COVID-19 hospital, while these events are all ongoing, and while we are in the process of knowing the behavior of the virus,” Garin told the House committee on health in a hearing on the measures being undertaken by the Department of Health (DOH) to prevent the spread of the disease. “We can convert Lung Center and prepare it in the event there will be community transmission, and at the same time we are preparing certain newly-built buildings [of the] DOH that are yet [to be] used,” she said. Garin said her proposal is not to build a new hospital for COVID-19 patients, but to convert the 39-year old Lung Center into a COVID-19 hospital. “I do believe that the Lung Center can be converted into a COVID-19 hospital. Its non-COVID patients will be transferred to NKTI (National Kidney Transplant Institute), Heart Center, PCMC (Philippine Children’s Medical Center), and East Avenue Medical Center. In that way, we limit the exposure of heath personnel bringing the virus for one patient to another,” Garin, who is senior deputy minority leader, said. “On the other hand, we also protect the COVID-19 patients because the hospital setting will be full…It is very timely for us now  to prepare a dedicated COVID-19 hospital that actually the DOH has the capacity,” she added. Marikina Rep. Stella Quimbo, a member of the House minority bloc, noted there aren’t enough government and private hospitals capable of addressing the medical needs of patients. Thus there should be a hospital designated for the exclusive treatment of COVID 19 cases.
DOH Secretary Francisco Duque III welcomed Garin’s proposal, which he said will be “assessed” by the DOH’s Health Facility Infrastructure Development Team. “Conceptually, I think that is a very good suggestion. We will have it assessed,” he said. He said the team will also look into the different structures around the country that may accommodate COVID-19 patients. “It warrants, if not merits, a review immediately,” Duque said. Concern over UP COVID-19 test kits  Garin also raised concern over the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) issuance of a certificate of exemption for the use of COVID-19 test kits developed by the University of the Philippines-National Institute of Health (UP-NIH). “I am supporting all Filipino scientists. But, we are very much afraid that in our desire to have testing kits, we forget the safeguards that should be installed,” she said. “They are exempted in passing through the FDA. However, the FDA is actually the only Philipine agency that caters to safety and efficacy of medicines, vaccines, and devices. It gives a me lot of discomfort as a mother, a doctor, and as a legislator that a very important agency, the Food and Drug agency, is waiving its capability and expertise in terms of licensing devices, because this can extend to medicines and vaccines,” Garin said. Garin asked Duque how such an exemption was granted and its basis, to which the latter could not respond. “We can ask the DG (Director General) to write you a letter to respond to your query,” Duque said. Garin explained that a certificate of exemption is given to medicines, vaccines, and devices that are under trial. “Kaya nakakalinlang sa taong bayan (That’s why it is deceiving the people). I think it is not good to be telling the President that we already have a testing kit available. But the President has not been told that this has not been established in terms of specificity, sensitivity, and accuracy,” she said. Duque informed the panel that he received a “verbal report” disclosing that the test kits are “greater than 95 percent in terms of specificity and sensitivity.” “But of course, I want a document to really reflect that this is the level of confidence when it comes to specificity and sensitivity,” he said. In the deliberation, WHO Representative in the Philippines Dr Rabi Abeyasinghe said they have yet to receive details about the testing kits. He also clarified that the WHO does not use the word “pandemic” and treats COVID-19 as a public health emergency of international concern. “Since 2010, we ceased to use the word pandemic. But this appears to meet the criteria of a pandemic of uncontrolled transmission between countries affecting all continents. But we don’t use that classification now,” he said. Caveat vs. lockdown
Abante and Quimbo also warned against the adverse economic effects of the proposal to lock down Metro Manila. “We are ruling out a lockdown of Metro Manila.  It is the main financial and business center of the Philppines; its effect on the economy will be devastating,” Abante said. As an example of what a lockdown can do, Quimbo cited the experience of the Greenhills Shopping Center which was reported to have frequented by a man who was the first person to have local transmission of the coronavirus. Quimbo said the commercial area has turned into a virtual ghost town as a result of the reports of positive COVID -19 cases linked to the place. Tags: ncov"
,"March 11, 2020, 8:09 PM",nCov,Cebu authorities imposed tight screening at seaports for COVID-19,By Minerva Newman,"
 By Minerva Newman CEBU CITY-–  The Cebu Port Authority (CPA) has alerted all seaports in Cebu to implement stringent prevention measures due to the recent Department of Health (DOH) confirmation of new coronavirus disease 2019  (COVID-19) cases bringing the total in the country to 35. CPA General Manager Leonilo Miole instructed all port managers to enforce body temperature check for every passenger who enters the terminal through a non-contact thermometer and to ensure provision of soaps in all port comfort rooms and alcohol-based hand sanitizers in payment counters, main entrances, office doors, passengers terminal walkways, and pre-departure areas. COVID-19 information sheets and other IEC materials from DOH were also installed and posted in Cebu baseport and subports to help raise public awareness about the virus. Miole said that the CPA continues to closely coordinate with partner agencies especially with DOH in putting into place various frontline defense to prevent the possible entry of the virus in Cebu province via our ports. “We already requested DOH-7 to deploy medical officers and provide a standby ambulance in our ports,” Miole added. Miole went on that in addition, temporary isolation rooms and holding areas in ports have already been designated to provide fast assistance and response to identified febrile persons in ports and minimize risk of exposure to other port users. In order to effectively implement port protocol for the denial of entry, Miole bared that detection and prevention of the spread of COVID-19 in the province, no foreign ships have been allowed to dock and crew and passengers are not allowed to disembark unless permitted by the Bureau of Quarantine (BOQ) and the Bureau of Immigration (BI) through verified issuance of free pratique, shore pass or disembarkation permits and other pertinent permits. All visitation privileges extended to seafarers of foreign ships are also suspended and all ships lying alongside a pier, wharf or bulkhead were required to deploy and attach rat guards to prevent the passage of rats between the ship and port, Miole added. On port terminal operations

According to Miole CPA also imposed the strict implementation of guidelines and preventive measures to protect port employees against COVID-19 based on the directive of Transportation Secretary Arthur Tugade to step up safety measures against the COVID-19 in all ports. All frontline port personnel were also directed to wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as surgical or N95 mask, maintain clean hands and use hand sanitizers at all times, avoid close contact and proper disposal of PPE after usage to avoid possible contamination and protect themselves from being infected and deter any possible spread of said virus. All port police were also directed to monitor compliance of port stakeholders with the port protocol. Indiscriminate spitting within the premises of the port shall not be allowed as pathogens of infectious diseases are found in saliva, phlegm and other respiratory droplets, the CPA directives read. Miole requests the public to support CPA efforts, comply with the enforced port protocol and most importantly practice personal protective measures such as hand hygiene, social distancing, and proper cough etiquette to help put a stop or slow down the spread of the virus.

A woman wearing a protective face mask carries a tray on the second day of an unprecedented lockdown across all of the country, imposed to slow the outbreak of coronavirus, in Rome, Italy March 11, 2020. (REUTERS/Yara Nardi/MANILA BULLETIN) Last week the cabinet said it would need just 7.5 billion euros, but since then the emergency has escalated dramatically and the entire nation is under lockdown, freezing much economic activity in a nation that was already flirting with recession. Conte told reporters that already tough restrictions on movement might be tightened further after the northern region of Lombardy, centered on Italy’s financial capital Milan, asked for all shops to shut and public transport to close. “We are ready to listen to requests from Lombardy and other regions,” Conte told a news conference, adding that caution would be needed before deciding to introduce fresh measures. “The main objective is to protect citizens’ health, but we must take into account that there are other interests at stake. We must be aware that there are civil liberties that are being violated, we must always proceed carefully.” Italy is the worst-affected country in the world after China, with some 631 deaths and 10,149 confirmed cases since the contagion came to light in Lombardy on Feb. 21. The extra spending means Italy’s 2020 budget deficit looks certain to climb above 3% of national output, the ceiling set by the European Union’s rules. Economy Minister Roberto Gualtieri, who last week forecast a deficit of 2.5%, declined on Wednesday to give a new target. He said that Rome might need help from European Union funds to take some of the burden off Italy. Tags: ncov"

 By Armando Fenequito  DAVAO CITY – The Southern Philippines Medical Center (SPMC) has two new persons under investigation (PUIs) admitted at its Isolation Facility for possible affliction of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This was confirmed by SPMC Chief of Clinics Dr. Ricardo Audan in phone interview with The Manila Bulletin on Wednesday afternoon. Audan said the two patients were Filipinos who have travel history abroad. This was the reason why they had themselves checked when they started to show the symptoms of COVID-19. However, he said, the two were referred to their facility on March 9, and their medical personnel immediately took throat swab tests from the patients, and sent these to Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM). Audan said the patients were doing while still under observation inside the facility. “For the record, we have already catered many PUI, maybe around 20 that we already discharged. This is not our first time that we handled PUI and none of them were tested positive,” he said. He said the result was expected to be out by Friday, and they were hoping it will be negative for COVID-19 just like the previous 20 patients who were already discharged from their facility.

","By Tara Yap

ILOILO CITY—A local government official and an official of the Department of Health (DOH) are allaying fears of the spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) after a Chinese-flagged vessel was allowed to dock in Ajuy, a coastal town in northern Iloilo province. “The people must stop panicking because it is creating a problem,” said Mayor Jett Rojas of Ajuy town. Rojas appealed for everyone to stay calm and understand the scenario instead of spreading misleading information about the Chinese cargo vessel that already left Wednesday morning after delivering liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). Rojas explained in a phone interview the vessel’s Chinese crew did not even disembark as the LPG was delivered via a pipeline. Rojas also pointed out the Chinese vessel was cleared by the DOH’s Bureau of Quarantine (BOQ-Iloilo Station) before it was allowed to dock. In a separate interview, Dr. Gerardo Gavino of BOQ-Iloilo Station confirmed that he went onboard to check the Chinese cargo vessel, and found that it had proper health and other documentations. Gavino pointed out that he and no one else had contact with the Chinese crew, none of whom exhibited symptoms of COVID-19. Gavino explained that the vessel did not directly come from China.  Instead, its last port was  Thailand.  Gavino added all the Chinese crew have been onboard the vessel since December. Tags: ncov"

(AFP / Roslan RAHMAN / FILE PHOTO /  MANILA BULLETIN) “Now it’s really the fact that there’s a global spread of this virus and therefore we will have to reevaluate certainly the numbers,” Iswaran said in an interview Wednesday. Just last month, Singapore’s tourism chief forecast that tourist arrivals and spending could drop by 25% to 30% this year because of the outbreak, making it worse than the 2003 SARS pandemic. The city-state is losing about 18,000 to 20,000 tourists a day and that could plummet further if the situation persists, Keith Tan, chief executive officer of Singapore Tourism Board, said in mid-February. With the economic fallout expected to grow, Singapore is already mulling another round of aid for businesses. Unveiling its 2020 budget last month, the government pledged S$6.4 billion ($4.6 billion) in dedicated support, including a S$4 billion stabilization package. A second support package may be introduced if necessary, local media has reported, citing Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat. Singapore isn’t ruling out tapping its past reserves for that purpose, the Business Times reported, citing Heng. Iswaran, who is also Minister-in-charge of Trade Relations, declined to elaborate when asked about the scale of any second support package on Wednesday. “We are prepared to do more, but it has to be a response to the situation,” he said.

(MANILA BULLETIN) In the addendum, CHED urged HEIs to coordinate with their partner host training establishment for any adjustment of training hours or to consider alternative modes for OJT, internships, and practicum of affected students. President Duterte earlier announced the suspension of classes in all levels in Metro Manila until March 14 as part of the government’s preventive measure against the disease amid the rising number of cases in the country. CHED Chairperson J. Prospero De Vera III said the Commission’s second set of policy directives regarding COVID-19 is its response to the recently issued presidential proclamation directing all government agencies to render full assistance and cooperation in the mobilization of necessary resources to contain the threat of the disease. Apart from the cancellation of internships, De Vera also encouraged all HEIs to establish protocols based on the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for screening and response. “HEIs should be prepared for the possibility of a community-level transmission and should have an established protocol to stop the spread of COVID-19,” De Vera said. These screening protocols, De Vera added, should include the creation of procedures for students, faculty, staff, and administration who are showing symptoms of the disease, cleaning and disinfection of all buildings especially of frequently touched areas such doorknobs and light switches, and preparing HEI health clinics for immediate triage and isolation of patients potentially infected with COVID-19. For students, faculty, staff, and HEI administrators who are currently in countries with reported and confirmed cases of the disease, they were advised to contact the Philippine Embassy or Consulate nearest to them to confirm their health conditions. CHED also directed HEIs to work closely with the Department of Health (DOH) regional office in establishing plans and procedures should a case of COVID-19 transmission be identified, as well as in determining the need for class suspensions and the postponement or cancellation of any school event to prevent the spread of the disease. “All plans and decisions by the HEIs should be focused on ensuring the safety and health of all students, faculty, staff, and administrators,” De Vera emphasized. “HEIs are advised to regularly inform and update the CHED regional office in their area on activities and development in their campuses to ensure that the Commission can give any necessary support as needed,” he added.

,"March 12, 2020, 11:46 AM",nCov,DOH reports 16 new cases of COVID-19; total cases in PH now 49,By Analou De Vera,"By Analou De Vera The Department of Health (DOH) said they recorded 16 new cases of COVID-19 in the Philippines, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in the country to 49.  Health Assistant Secretary Maria Vergeire (Facebook) “The DOH deployed surveillance teams and are now conducting extensive information-gathering and contact tracing activities on the new cases. DOH will provide further details as soon as the information is available,” said Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire in a press briefing on Wednesday. Vergeire said three patients are in critical condition. “PH (Patient) 29, a known contact of PH9, is intubated and has underlying cardiovascular and endocrine conditions,” Vergeire said. Patient 29 is an 82-year-old Filipina currently admitted at the Medical City. The two other patients who are in critical condition were the 5th confirmed case, a 62-year-old man, and the 9th confirmed case, an 86-year-old American. Both patients have underlying medical conditions. “DOH is continuously monitoring the statuses of all patients to ensure that no complications arise throughout their recovery,” Vergeire said. Private rooms into isolation rooms Vergeire said the DOH has ordered all government hospitals to turn their private rooms to isolation rooms as part of their preparation for the potential spread of COVID-19 in the communities. “As part of our initial stages of preparation for community transmission, we have ordered all government hospitals to stop accepting private patients temporarily,” she said. “In turn, they should reserve the private rooms of government hospitals to serve as isolation rooms. This is part of our hospital preparedness, wherein in case of a surge capacity where the original bed capacity is exceeded, we will still have enough isolation rooms.” Meanwhile, Vergeire noted that all level 2 and 3 hospitals “are mandated to accept patients under investigation” as well as confirmed cases of COVID- 19, amid reports that some hospitals are refusing to admit patients with symptoms of the disease. Local testing kits Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Director-General Rolando Enrique Domingo said that there is still a “selection process” on who will be tested for COVID-19 using the test kits developed by University of the Philippines- National Institute of Health (UP-NIH) scientists. “Medyo may selection pa rin kung sino ang ite-test, hindi pa rin pwedeng widely available to the public (There is still a selection on who will be tested, it is still not widely available to the public],” Domingo said. “Kasi (Because) even when the test kits are available, ang pinakamaraming maximum na magagawa nun ng (The maximum that can be manufactured by) UP-NIH is about 1,000 tests per week,” he added. The Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) in Muntinlupa City handles an average of 300 tests per day. Domingo said they can start using the testing kits by next week, which ” is still going to be done at the UP-NIH.” He noted that the test kits are still not available for commercial sale because they only have a “certificate of exemption” and are still not approved by the World Health Organization. NCC repatriates The DOH already sent home 442 of the 445 repatriates from the M/V Diamond Princess quarantined at New Clark City (NCC), in Capas, Tarlac after they completed their 14-day quarantine period. Of that figure, 437 were crew members and five were passengers. “All repatriates, together with the teams that attended to them, were all tested for COVID-19 to ensure their safety,” Vergeire said. Meanwhile, two crew members tested positive and are currently admitted at Jose B. Lingad Memorial Regional Hospital. The remaining repatriate is left in NCC awaiting lab results, Vergeire said. “From the beginning, DOH was aware of the risk that some of the repatriates might test positive for COVID-19. This is why strict infection prevention and control measures were enforced during the quarantine period to protect our kababayans (compatriots) and the health workers attending to them,” Vergeire said, quoting Health Secretary Francisco Duque III.

Sen. Risa Hontiveros (Senator Risa Hontiveros / Facebook / MANILA BULLETIN) Hontiveros said contracting the illness is a daily risk for the working and commuting public, so they should be given priority in the government’s efforts to contain the virus. “Marami pa rin sa atin ang kailangan pumasok araw-araw (Many of us still need to go to work everyday). The working and commuting public need access to working lavatories in our train and transport stations,” Hontiveros said. “For those na imposible ang sinasabing social distancing, kailangan natin i-minimize ang risk (who find it impossible to maintain social distancing, we need to minimize their risk),” she said. The senator said those in the frontlines of the transport sector must be given protective gear like masks and hand sanitizers to protect themselves from the coronavirus. “The risk is high for jeepney and bus drivers, and those who man our train stations. Every day, they are exposed to hundreds, if not thousands, of people,” Hontiveros said. “DOTr (Department of Transportation) and our transport operators should come up with a mechanism to ensure that our drivers and conductors have access to these protective gear.” Aside from this, Hontiveros said comfort rooms in transport terminals should be working and thoroughly disinfected daily. “Clean lavatories with ample supply of soap and water in our train, bus, and transport stations should be part of our response against COVID.” Hontiveros said that although hand sanitizers help, public health experts still advocate frequent hand washing. “Hindi na pwede ang mga saradong palikuran sa mga transport terminals at train stations (Closed lavatories in our transport terminals and train stations are no longer acceptable),” she said. “[That the] working and commuting public need to wash their hands frequently with soap and water is now a matter of public health,” she added. “Public transport is a public health issue.

Sen. Francis Tolentino (Rokey Desingano / MANILA BULLETIN) Tolentino on Wednesday filed Senate Bill No. 1408, which seeks to amend the Quarantine Act of 2004 (Republic Act No. 9271) to further strengthen the jurisdiction of the DOH and the BOQ in preventing the spread of infectious diseases from foreign countries. Under his proposed Health Emergency Lockdown Act, Tolentino said the BOQ shall also have the power to impose a lockdown of infected areas and class suspensions to contain the disease. The bill also proposes to expand the bureau’s authority over local government units, schools, and hospitals during health emergencies. “This is so we can contain the spread of infectious diseases wherever these may have occurred and not just limited to those who travelled. Sa panahon ngayon, kailangan natin palakasin ang kakayahan ng DOH para agad nilang maiwasan ang pagkalat ng sakit at matugunan ang pangangailangan ng mga taong may sakit, kung saan man sila naroroon (In these times, we need to strengthen the DOH’s functions so it could immediately prevent the outbreak of diseases and respond to the needs of those who are sick, wherever they are),” Tolentino said. In an interview at the Senate on Wednesday, the administration lawmaker maintained his reservations against the suggestion to place Metro Manila under a lockdown due to the increasing cases of COVID-19 in the country. “I am not recommending that, which I believe will be detrimental to the economy of the Philippines. I don’t agree kung ganoon ka-widespread na ang contamination (that the contamination is widespread),” he told reporters. He said that in his bill, the DOH could recommend a lockdown only of certain areas with evident community transmission of a disease. The DOH and the BOQ will coordinate with the Department of Interior and Local Government in promulgating and enforcing rules necessary for the lockdown, and other measures for the prevention of diseases. The DOH could also designate private hospitals as quarantine centers for persons under investigation of having contracted infectious diseases in times of public health emergencies, Tolentino added. President Duterte recently declared a State of Public Health Emergency in the country due to the spike in the number of positive COVID-19 cases, which are mostly Metro Manila. As of Tuesday, there were 33 cases of COVID-19 in the Philippines. The bill would have to undergo committee deliberations before being approved in Senate plenary.

Asked if the Department would be providing necessary equipment for this kind of monitoring, Atillo said, they do not have the capacity to provide for all. “But if the schools can look for ways and means they are actually allowed,” he said. He also added that schools, given the circumstances, “they can use their maintenance and other operating expenses or the MOOE, which is a school fund to procure for something which they can utilize just to make sure that everybody is well and alive. “But if they cannot, we urge and encourage them to really look for ways and means,” Atillo said. He also noted that school’s information system must be intensified so that they can encourage students and individuals to engage with concerned school personnel, and “tell them the truth about their health conditions to avoid further problems should there be any students who will exhibit flu-like symptoms”.

Sangguniang Panlalawigan member Jose G. Peralta, who is also Liga ng mga Barangay Provincial Federation President, authored Provincial Resolution No. 314-2020, “calling on all local government units more particularly Barangay and SK officials to be united in helping the national and provincial governments to combat the acute respiratory diseases by suspending activities that could draw crowd in their respective localities.” The resolution also states: “The Sangguniang Panlalawigan expresses grave concern over the sudden rise of COVID-19 cases in the country, not to mention the reported isolated case in the province.” Earlier this week, the Department of Health (DOH) said that among the COVID-19 positive patients was a visitor from Australia who participated in a high school reunion. The subject, a female, visited the province on February 22 to 23. The “balikbayan”, along with her husband, departed to Manila in the afternoon of February 23 and returned to Sydney, Australia on March 2 where she reportedly developed cough. On March 3, the New South Wales government in Australia confirmed the Fil-Australian to be positive for COVID-19. However, DOH Region 1 Director Valeriano Lopez said the 14-day incubation period has already lapsed on March 8, noting that the subject and her husband left Lingayen on February 23. The DOH-Region 1 also assured that, as of Wednesday, March 11, Pangasinan remained free of the disease, and that no person among the attendees of the reunion showed signs and symptoms of severe of respiratory ailment.

US scientists announced Wednesday they had created the first 3D atomic-scale map of the part of the novel coronavirus that attaches to and infects human cells. (AFP/ MANILA BULLETIN FILE PHOTO) Interviewed on Deutschlandfunk radio, Spahn said the focus of Germany’s current approach to the epidemic was to slow the virus’s spread to minimize the peak burden on the country’s health system. “The virus is in Germany, it is in Europe. That’s the thought we have to get used to,” he said. “It will still spread even if you close all the borders. Sooner or later you have to let people in or out and then it starts spreading again.” Experts estimate the virus’s mortality rate in an advanced healthcare system like Germany’s at between 0.1% and 0.7%, he said. Though Germany has the most intensive care beds per capita in Europe, its healthcare system could quickly be overwhelmed if the virus spread too quickly. To avoid that, large events like football matches must be called off, he said. Individuals should be mindful of the disease’s spread in their behavior, whether by doing without concerts or cinema trips, or in greeting parents or grandparents who are more vulnerable because of their age. He described as “astonishing” the decision not to call off a football match between Union Berlin and Bayern Munich scheduled to take place in Berlin on Saturday. Tags: ncov"

Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth) (MANILA BULLETIN) The House panel chairperson, Quezon 4th district Rep.  Angelina “Helen” Tan, approved the motion made by Anakalusugan party-list Rep. Mike Defensor in its hearing on the measures being undertaken by the government to prevent the spread of COVID-19. “I think…in this emergency situation, we allow the maximum utilization of Philhealth because from the national government, we were able to allocate P60 billion that is given by the national government, aside from our contribution. This should have no limit,” said Defensor, vice chairperson of the House health committee. PhilHealth Memorandum Circular No. 2020-0004 provides that patients under investigation (PUIs) for COVID-19 and those with confirmed cases of the coronavirus with mild symptoms may avail of an isolation package with a case rate amount of P14,000. “If it goes severe, lalo na sa mahihirap na hindi nila kayang bayaran ang gamutan, it should be an open-ended case scenario. Huwag na po maglimit ang Philhealth, talagang itodo po natin,” Defensor said. (If it goes severe, especially for our poor who can’t pay for the medical expenses, it should be an open-ended case scenario. Philhealth should not impose limits, we should make this fully available.) Philhealth’s Dr. Marvin Galvez said they increase case rates for PUIs and those who will be admitted to isolation rooms to P14,000. “We do have case rates for patients. We are reviewing the rate for those patients,” he told the panel. Tan agreed with Defensor that Philhealth should do away with its case rates “We are in a public health emergency. Kelangan ba natin mag case rates this time (Do we still need case rates this time)?” She also asked Galvez “to bring up the issue to the higher ups.” Supplemental budget for DOH Defensor also asked his colleagues to grant a bigger supplemental budget to the Department of Health (DOH) to augment government’s response against COVID-19. “We need to increase the supplemental budget of the DOH so they can have isolation rooms,  they have negative pressure rooms, and also the required support for that purpose,” he said. IRR for new health law Lawmakers also asked the DOH to immediately issue the implementing rules and regulations (IRR) of a law providing policies and procedures on surveillance of and response to notifiable diseases, epidemics, and health events of public health concern. Tan and Bayan Muna party-list Rep. Carlos Isagani Zarate cited the urgency to issue the IRR of Republic Act (RA) No. 11332 to strengthen the country’s response system against COVID-19. “I was informed that until now, we don’t have the IRR. Under Section 7 of the law, you are required to prepare and establish a response system,  which we can use this time. When are you going to issue the IRR?” Tan, the principal author of the law, asked. Duque said the IRR was completed and it is being reviewed by their Legal Department to make sure that “there are no inconsistencies with the provisions of law.” RA 11332 provides that the “Secretary of Health shall have the authority to declare epidemics of national and/or international concerns except when the same threatens national security.” Face mask shortage In the deliberation, Philippine Hospital Association president Jaime Almora relayed to the panel that they are “resorting” to turning old linen into cloth masks due to the lack of supply of face masks. “There’s grave deficit in the number of PPEs (personal protective equipment).  We are resorting actually to improvising, like we turn our old linen into cloth masks,” he said. DOH Undersecretary for Procurement and Supply Chain Carolina Vidak Taiño said they have a one-month supply stock of N-95 masks for public health workers. She said the DOH has 59,000 N-95 masks and Bataan-based Philippine International Trading Corp.  (PITC)  has pledged to provide them with at least 30,000 masks every week. “We will have continued supply from PITC,” she assured the panel. Lockdown In the deliberation, Duque said a localized lockdown will be decided by the DOH, adding that they will declare a lockdown if there is sustained community transmission. Tags: ncov"

 A man shot three times by an armed attacker who stormed a mosque in New Zealand last year says the incident has left him physically and mentally damaged for life.  Armed police officers stand guard outside Al Noor mosque where more than 40 people were killed by a suspected white supremacist during Friday prayers on March 15, in Christchurch, New Zealand April 1, 2019. (REUTERS/Edgar Su / MANILA BULLETIN FILE PHOTO) Sheikh Hasan Rubel, 35, was offering prayers at the Al Noor mosque in Christchurch on March 15 last year when the gunman burst in and started shooting. The attack, streamed live of Facebook, killed 51 Muslim worshippers and injured dozens of others in New Zealand’s worst mass shooting. Two bullets ripped through Rubel’s pelvis while another one went through his leg. As New Zealand prepares to mark the one-year anniversary of the attack, Rubel says he is getting really anxious as the memories flood back. “As 15th of March is approaching it’s a really shaky feeling for me,” he said in an interview with Reuters. “That (attack) has damaged me physically a little bit but mostly it damaged my inside. Even nowadays when I remember that moment, how scared I was … how helpless I was,” he said. “I still remember the feeling when I was getting shot by one after one bullet … at one point I was thinking that at any time I can get shot anywhere and I’ll be dead,” Rubel said. Throughout the attack, Rubel said he was thinking of his wife and young daughters. Plans are underway for a prayer event in Christchurch on Friday and a national remembrance ceremony on Sunday, expected to be attended by Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern. The events will be held under tight security following recent threats against Al Noor mosque. The attack took away all his confidence and he lives in fear now, Rubel said. “I get really afraid for small things. Nowadays I think any incident can happen anytime.” Rubel, who moved to New Zealand from Bangladesh in 2015, says he has faith in New Zealand’s justice systems and hopes the culprit is punished. It would be hard, however, to ever forgive his attacker, he said. “I’m not going to say that I forgive … it’s a big word to say,” he said.

Korea’s response to COVID-19",By Hannah Torregoza,"By Hannah Torregoza Senator Sherwin Gatchalian on Wednesday urged the government to study South Korea’s model in containing the COVID-19 disease, saying implementing a lockdown will be difficult for the Philippines, especially in Metro Manila.  Sen. Sherwin Gatchalian(Senate of the Philippines / MANILA BULLETIN) Gatchalian said there are many entry and exit points in the country, thus, resorting to a lockdown would be difficult. “Lockdown is difficult to implement unless you are like China which can really flex its muscles and lockdown the entire provinces,” Gatchalian said in an interview over ANC Headstart. Citing Italy’s situation, Gatchalian noted that the lockdown enforced in the European country was met with much confusion and questions. “If you see the experience of Italy, when they locked down the entire country, it is very difficult to implement because you have a lot of entry and exit points,” Gatchalian stressed. “I want to urge the DOH to study the Korean model wherein they didn’t lockdown Korea but they implemented a massive testing activity wherein they already tested 140,000 patients there,” “Meaning, if you already feel something, whether you have history of traveling abroad or just within Korea, you have to be tested,” Gatchalian said. Health officials have earlier told a Senate panel that the agency only has 2,000 testing kits for COVID-19. But Health Secretary Francisco Duque III assured that the Department of Health (DOH) has ordered 40,000 testing kits for the new coronavirus disease and has asked for an additional budget of P139-million to procure additional testing kits. Gatchalian believes that the locally invented testing kits from University of the Philippines, which the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has just approved will be a “game changer.” “The locally invented testing kits from UP is a game changer in terms of curving COVID-19 in our country. Game changer, meaning, because it is affordable, it’s locally available, and can be given to local governments,” he said. He said these testing kits should be distributed to local government units (LGUs) and test it as fast as possible. “Implement that Korean model where they test everyone who feels that they are sick and they can contain the disease in their homes, limiting their movement within the community,” he advised. The lawmaker said he believes the government has the capability to fund such massive testing of COVID-19 cases. “One, the kits should be very affordable. It can be given to the local governments. They can be tasked to do this. Of course, subject to very strict protocols and guidelines of the DOH,” he said. “Two, this is where Congress will come in to allocate additional budget to buy these testing kits and also additional budget to make sure that protocols will be followed. But the protocols are very costly because you need to buy protective suits, specialized vehicles, additional power, and training,” Gatchalian said.

One of the officers was among a team leading health screenings of Thai returnees from South Korea — which has reported the second most COVID-19 infections in Asia after China. “They were not working at the same spots,” Sopon Iamsirithaworn of the Disease Control Department said. “There is a chance they came into contact with foreigners or touched passports,” he added.

All affected visitors must apply for visas at Thai embassies in their own countries and present a medical certificate. Thailand’s economy is heavily reliant on tourism. The deadly virus has hammered the sector costing the country billions of dollars, mainly after Chinese tourists were quarantined on the mainland or stayed at home. Many western visitors have also cancelled holidays or deferred bookings as Thai authorities issue a baffling barrage of advice. After days drip-feeding conflicting information to holidaymakers, health authorities said on Friday there will be no compulsory quarantine for people from countries hardest hit by the virus. Thailand has reported 59 cases of the new coronavirus, but there are concerns the low figure may be a reflection of very limited testing programme.

(MANILA BULLETIN) DepEd said in a statement that it has come up with directives for “all DepEd schools to follow” amid class suspensions declared in areas with confirmed cases of the COVID-19, particularly in Metro Manila and other provinces. With the end of the current school year 2019-2020 just a few weeks away, DepEd instructed public schools to implement several measures to ensure that required learning competencies are achieved by learners across all basic education levels. Should the public health situation prevent coming to school, DepEd said that it “shall issue a guideline for the evaluation of the final grades of all learners.” DepEd also gave the assurance that it will “continue to closely monitor the situation and shall continue to take informed, coordinated and proportionate decisions” in close consultation with Department of Health (DOH) and other members of the Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF) on the matter, to “contribute to meeting the challenge of containing and managing COVID-19.” Continued learning DepEd said its executive committee has already discussed the implementation of the school suspension in the National Capital Region (NCR) from March 10 to 14 as declared by President Duterte. The officials of DepEd also tackled “broader options” in light of the latest developments and information on COVID-19, as well as its assessment of the remaining school requirements for this school year. The department has also decided to adopt “social distancing measures” for DepEd schools effective for the remainder of the school year. DepEd said the school year is “already about to end,” with only final examinations left. “Our feedback from the field is that the essential competencies specified in the curriculum are expected to have been covered,” DepEd noted. Revised dates for exams, activities Based on the school calendar, the 4th quarter examinations for the graduating levels of Grades 6 and 12 are scheduled on March 12 to 13 while the 4th quarter examinations for all other grade levels are scheduled on March 19 to 20. DepEd noted that the President’s suspension of classes this week in NCR constitutes a “social distancing measure” intended to mitigate or slow down community transmission. Given these considerations, DepEd directed affected schools to adjust their activities in the coming weeks. For instance, in NCR, all teachers with the supervision of the Regional, Schools Division and School officials were directed to “schedule all remaining 4th quarter examinations in the week of March 16 to 20 on a staggered basis to reduce the number of students in the school per day.” Teachers, DepEd said, shall “communicate with their students on pointers for review for examination and may opt to work from home.” Students, it added, shall “come to school next week (March 16 to 20) on the day of their respective examination schedules.” Outside NCR, DepEd noted that all teachers shall schedule on March 11 to 13 any 4th quarter examinations already scheduled, or to catch up with all remaining class requirements, and to schedule all remaining 4th quarter examinations for the week of March 16 to 20 on similar staggered basis. DepEd noted that after the 4th quarter examinations are conducted, “any further school requirements shall as far as practicable be done as home-based assignments” while “any compelling need to come to school shall observe all applicable COVID-19 precautions.” Meanwhile, Education Secretary Leonor Briones said this social distancing measure for schools “will only be effective” if students, parents, and the local governments will “do their part” to ensure that students avoid places like malls, movie houses, markets, and similar crowded places to minimize the risk of being infected with the virus.

Close contacts include persons with a travel history in the last 14 days to countries with local transmission or those who have a history of exposure to COVID-19 patients including those who provided direct care for a COVID-19 patient or those working together, staying in the same close environment, traveling together, or living in the same household with a COVID-19 patient within the 14-day incubation period. President Duterte has placed the entire country under a State of Public Health Emergency following the confirmation of local transmission of COVID-19. He, likewise, ordered the suspension of classes in all levels in Metro Manila until March 14. On Tuesday, the DOH reported that the number of COVID-19 cases reached 33.

Education Secretary Leonor Magtolis Briones(DepEd / MANILA BULLETIN FILE PHOTO) DepEd Secretary Leonor Briones said in a statement that regarding moving-up and graduation rites, “each school shall have the discretion to elect the date for the holding of their rites” within the week of April 13 to 17. Based on the calendar for school year (SY) 2019-2020, the last day of school was originally scheduled on April 3. DepEd noted that these end-of-school-year rites will be conducted “taking into consideration the applicable guidelines” by the Department of Health (DOH) and to “conduct the same consistent” with the DOH guidelines on mass gatherings. “Should the public health situation prevent the holding of the graduation and moving-up rites within the said week, the schools, in consultation with the PTA (Parents-Teachers Association) leadership, may choose to reschedule or forego the holding of graduation and moving up rites,” DepEd said. Meanwhile, DepEd noted that private schools in the basic education level are “highly encouraged” to adopt the guidelines set by the department for the remaining period of the school year. Earlier, Sen. Sherwin Gatchalian urged DepEd to “postpone” the scheduled graduation rites this school year as a precautionary measure against the further spread of COVID-19. Gatchalian noted that DepEd should suspend graduation and moving-up exercises in kinder, elementary, junior high school, and senior high school high school to minimize the chances of contacting the disease. As of March 10, DOH said there are 33 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the country. Over the weekend, DOH also confirmed local transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and raised the alert level to Code Red, sub-level 1.

,"March 11, 2020, 3:41 PM",nCov,Coronavirus: Can S. Korea be a model for virus-hit countries?,By Agence France-Presse,"By Agence France-Presse A rapid surge in coronavirus cases saw South Korea become one of the world’s worst-affected countries outside China, but it has since cut infection rates significantly and has one of the lowest fatality rates anywhere.  Instead of taking the Chinese approach of locking down affected cities, South Korea has embraced a model of open information, public participation and widespread testing (AFP Photo/Jung Yeon-je) As of Wednesday, it had 7,755 confirmed cases — the fourth-highest total in the world — but only 60 deaths, well below the World Health Organisation’s global average. What has South Korea done and can it set an example? AFP takes a look. How has South Korea handled the epidemic?
Instead of taking the Chinese approach of locking down affected cities, South Korea has embraced a model of open information, public participation and widespread testing. Each confirmed coronavirus patient’s contacts are traced and offered tests. The infected person’s movements over the preceeding 14 days — determined through credit card use, CCTV footage and mobile phone tracking — are also posted on government websites, with text message alerts sent to people when a new infection emerges in the area where they live or work. The tactic has raised privacy concerns, but enables people to come forward for checks. Testing fees are around 160,000 won (US$134), but free for suspected patients — people linked to confirmed cases — or those who test positive, encouraging participation. That helps with early detection and tackling the spread of infection. South Korea has conducted more diagnostic tests faster than any other country — around 10,000 per day — which specialists say has helped the country with early detection of patients and tackling the infection’s epicentre. How has it tested so many people?
South Korea can carry out more than 15,000 diagnostic tests a day, and had conducted 220,000 as of Wednesday. It has more than 500 designated testing clinics, including over 40 drive-through facilities that minimise contact between patients and medical workers. The South has had the benefit of experience: it struggled with a lack of testing kits during the 2015 outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), prompting it to create a system to expedite approvals. Within weeks of the outbreak emerging in China, newly-developed COVID-19 testing kits which show results in just six hours received emergency government approval and were made available for clinics. How have people reacted to government instructions?
Authorities have urged people to stay indoors, avoid meetings and minimise contact with others, in a so-called “social distancing” campaign, resulting in quiet streets and half-empty stores and restaurants, even in normally busy parts of Seoul. Scores of events — from K-pop concerts and sports games — have been cancelled and most people wear masks, according to government recommendations. The South is a democracy but also has a disciplined civil society, something analysts point to as a factor: “In democracies, we often are a little dismissive of whichever government is in power and take their advice with a grain of salt,” said Marylouise McLaws of the University of New South Wales, an epidemiologist and advisor to the World Health Organisation. Why is the death rate so low?
Several factors are behind the South’s unusually low death rate — 0.77 percent against a global average of 3.4 percent. Early detection enables early treatment, and widespread testing means mild or asymptomatic cases are more likely to be identified, driving up the total number of cases so the proportion dying goes down. In addition, the infected population in the South has a unique profile: most of the country’s infections are in women, and nearly half are in people aged below 40. Officials say that is driven by the fact that more than 60 percent of its cases are linked to the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, a secretive religious group often condemned as a cult. Most of its members are women and many are in their 20s and 30s. But global figures show the virus is most deadly among older generations, and men in particular. Should South Korea be seen as an example?
Japan — where nearly 600 people have been infected, with 12 deaths — has not undertaken widespread testing and could learn from South Korea’s response, said Masahiro Kami, head of the Tokyo-based Medical Governance Research Institute. “Testing is a crucial initial step to control the virus,” Kami said, adding: “It’s a good model for every country.” South Korea had “gone in hard and fast”, said McLaws of the University of New South Wales, contrasting its approach with that of Italy, where she said the outbreak could have taken a different course if containment measures had been imposed earlier. “It’s very hard for the authorities — the government — to take the plunge in doing that. So it’s often done late.” Tags: ncov"

A man wearing a protective face mask, following an outbreak of the coronavirus, prays before the start of a memorial service preceding a moment of silence at 2:46 p.m. (0546 GMT), the time when the magnitude 9.0 earthquake struck off Japan’s coast in 2011, at Hibiya Park in Tokyo, Japan, March 11, 2020, to mark the nine-year anniversary of the earthquake and tsunami that killed thousands and set off a nuclear crisis. (REUTERS/Stoyan Nenov/MANILA BULLETIN) The March 11, 2011, earthquake and tsunami triggered the worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl at Tokyo Electric Power Co’s (9501.T) Fukushima Daiichi plant, 220 kilometers (130 miles) northeast of Tokyo. The natural disasters and meltdowns at the Fukushima plant forced hundreds of thousands of residents to flee their homes. Japan’s Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga on Wednesday lauded the recovery efforts under way in Japan’s northeast, but acknowledged the challenges that remained in providing psychological care and other services to evacuees. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will hold a small memorial ceremony in the afternoon and observe a moment of silence at the time the 2011 disaster struck. “I think there were other ways to handle (the memorial),” said Natsumi Hoshi, a 42-year old Tokyo resident, who was among a group of people gathered in a city park to lay flowers. “I think people are still hurting,” he said. Despite the many signs of recovery in Japan’s northeast, some residents are still unable to live in the areas closest to the Fukushima plant. Radiation levels in such areas remain high despite repeated decontamination efforts. “I think the memory (of the disaster) is fading away,” said Masahiko Sano, a 47-year old company owner, who also joined the event at the park. The government called off a memorial event that was scheduled for Wednesday as Japan sought to contain a widening outbreak of the coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. The country has closed schools, theme parks and zoos, as part of its wider effort to scale back public events and mass gatherings to slow the transmission of the virus. Japan has nearly 1,300 cases, including about 700 from the Diamond Princess cruise ship that was quarantined near Tokyo last month.

Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles (Photo from Karlo Nograles / Facebook page / MANILA BULLETIN) Nograles said the move was part of President Duterte’s directives to address concerns involving the disease so that the public will not have to worry about the expenses that could be incurred. According to Nograles, COVID-19 tests in hospitals would be covered by Philhealth on top of coverage for quarantine and isolation costs. “The President recognizes that everyone in the country is concerned about COVID-19 and the threat this poses to the health and lives of our loved ones, especially vulnerable individuals like senior citizens,” he said Wednesday. “Given this, the last thing we want is for our citizens to worry about medical costs and expenses. Their only concern should be their well-being and the well-being of their families,” he added. Nograles said PhilHealth was already formalizing and operationalizing the new benefit. He added that the government is now working overtime to ensure that there will be an adequate number of testing kits to quickly identify and isolate those who are infected with COVID-19. “We are fast-tracking the deployment of these kits so these can be used at the soonest possible time. Per Dr. Destura of Manila Healthtek, the rapid diagnostic test kit for COVID-19 is set for field validation study, and that UP PGH and the National Institute for Health have agreed to support the study,” Nograles said. Nograles said they just need to conduct validation of 500 tests for COVID-19 to enable them to conduct clinical sensitivity analysis as a pre-condition set by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). “Once it passes the clinical tests, the FDA will grant full access by all hospitals, as guided by the DOH (Department of Health),” he said. Private hospitals have signified their intention to join the field validation and that the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is hoping to secure approval by the ethics committee for field validation testing by Friday. President Duterte placed the entire country under a State of Public Health Emergency following the confirmation of local transmission of COVID-19.

A host of air and rail services to Italy’s neighbours have been cancelled after the government imposed drastic nationwide quarantine measures to contain the coronavirus (AFP Photo/Marco BERTORELLO ) Spain and Portugal suspended air traffic from Italy for two weeks while Austria ordered a halt to flights and trains from its neighbour and Slovenia said it would impose controls at its border with the country. As British Airways cancelled Italian flights on Tuesday, Air France and low-cost carriers Ryanair, Easyjet and Wizz Air said they would scrap flights from Italian airports until early April. Air Canada took even more drastic measures, suspending flights to Italy until at least May 1. However, at Rome’s main Fiumicino airport there were still services running to destinations in Europe and beyond on Tuesday afternoon, as well domestic flights. Flights were also still taking off from the smaller Ciampino airport, used mostly by budget airlines. Tourists welcomed the remaining opportunities to leave. “We have people saying they will put us on a flight back,” Mina, a 58-year-old Indian national, told AFP next to Rome’s deserted Colosseum, adding she and her family were “waiting for a call.” The ADR company which runs Rome’s airports said all arriving passengers and all those heading for destinations outside the Schengen zone “will undergo health checks” and go through thermal scanners. Australia on Wednesday said it would bar entry to foreign nationals who had been to the Mediterranean country in the last 14 days — measures already in place for arrivals from China and South Korea. Mask-wearing police at Rome’s main Termini train station were checking passengers’ reasons for travel and making sure everybody kept the recommended distance of one metre away from each other. But the departures board was showing no sign of any cancellations. Klemen Gartner, a 22-year-old seminarian from Slovenia, said that he was trying to get back home, “somewhere I can understand the language”. He said that when station staff realised he wasn’t Italian, he was told: “You’re foreign? Go, go!” and waved through. The rail service for Venice via Florence was only sparsely occupied but running nonetheless, with no checks for passengers disembarking at Florence, an AFP journalist said. But some rail links with neighbouring countries have taken a hit. The Thello company has cancelled its night services between Paris and Venice, as well as daytime trains between Milan and Marseille, until early April. France’s national train company SNCF said on Tuesday it was “waiting for advice” about how to proceed regarding services to Italy. Since late February, French staff on cross-border SNCF trains have been getting off before the Italian border and being replaced by Italian colleagues. Some train services between Italy and Austria were still running Tuesday but that was expected to change, a spokeswoman for Austrian rail operator OeBB told AFP. A spokeswoman for Germany’s Deutsche Bahn said that the only service it had linking it to Italy, between Munich and Venice, has been suspended. On Italy’s road links to other countries seemed more relaxed on Tuesday afternoon. Cars crossed the border with neighbouring Slovenia in both directions, an AFP journalist reported. Italians in the area around the city of Trieste often make the short journey into Slovenia to do their shopping and buy cheaper fuel. But late Tuesday, Slovenia’s government announced it would close the border, with controls put in place “as soon as possible”, although cargo transport would not be affected. “It is not a hermetic closure… It is a necessary move if we want to contain the virus,” Slovenia’s outgoing prime minister Marjan Sarec told reporters. Also exempted from Austria’s travel ban are cargo transporters, people with a doctor’s certificate, and returning Austrians who agree to a two-week quarantine, the Austrian government announced. The wave of cancelled trips is raising fears for Italy’s tourism sector, which accounts for 13 percent of the country’s gross domestic product.   Tags: ncov"

Prisoners in Taiwan have been called up to help combat the coronavirus and are working overtime to churn out protective face masks (AFP Photo/Sam Yeh) Usually the men would be making prison uniforms in the bright-lit sewing factory in the city of Taoyuan. But after the coronavirus spread to Taiwan they switched to making masks, putting together some 52,000 face coverings since mid-February. Sporting a grey face mask himself, a 50-year-old inmate surnamed Yuh said he was keeping his family close to heart as he worked. “When they came to see me, they said it was very difficult to buy face mask out there. I said to them ‘Daddy is making face masks here, and that maybe you will have the benefit and the opportunity to use it’,” he told AFP. “Every time I sew face masks, I think to myself that it can bring some security to my family.” Yuh is currently ten years into a 23-year sentence for possession of drugs and firearms. “This little face mask not only lets us contribute to society, it also gives us self-esteem,” he said. The inmates — who have volunteered for the job — work quickly with machines they have clearly come to know well. After stitching the fabric with the sewing machines, they carefully trim the masks with small scissors before ironing and packaging them. Taiwan’s prisons routinely employ prisoners to make products from food to garments and soaps. The programmes are designed to teach inmates practical skills as well as raise funds for victim compensation and the improvement of facilities. The masks are sold for around Tw$25 (83 cents) each and the inmates are paid a small wage which they can spend within the prison. Correctional facilities across Taiwan are taking part in the new scheme to manufacture cloth face masks and face mask protectors to supply their staff and the public. Taiwan was briefly struck by panic buying of medical face masks earlier this year until the government introduced a rationing system. The island has been held up as an example of how to handle an outbreak, with the government moving fast to reduce overseas arrivals from infected areas and issue clear medical guidance that has been widely adopted by the public. Despite being so close to the original outbreak in mainland China, Taiwan has just 48 confirmed cases of the Covid-19 disease with one death. The wearing of face masks among the public has become fairly widespread. But many Taiwanese say the current rationing of three surgical masks a week is insufficient. As a result the face mask covers that prisons make can come in handy — they are used to cover surgical masks to extend their duration. Yen Chih-hong, a Taipei Prison official who helps run the scheme, said inmates in the prison now make around 1,000 face masks daily, up from an initial 450 as orders keep increasing. “They are very willing to work extra shifts to fill in the orders… sometimes I have to ask them to take a break,” he said. Nearby Hong Kong, which is suffering widespread face masks shortages, has long used prison labour to make surgical masks, primarily for government and healthcare workers. The operation there is far larger with prisoners able to churn out more than a million masks a month. In recent weeks, prison staff have even joined inmates to bolster their ranks. Last week, officials said they would launch an investigation after some of the prison made masks had made their way onto pharmacy shelves for sale. Tags: ncov"

They were first screened at the UP Diliman Health Service (UPHS) where they were declared persons under investigation (PUIs) after showing fever and respiratory symptoms. UPHS Director Jesusa Catabui assured the community that protocols were followed in isolating the patients and disinfecting the premises and the ambulance used to carry them to a referral hospital. The UP System, composed of all UP campuses nationwide, has been following a general protocol since early February. UP administrators said all constituents who “have come into close contact with a confirmed case, or have been exposed to potential infection during travels, should seek consultation with the University Health Service on campus, or at the nearest health facility, and undergo a health assessment before resuming their daily routine.” Under the same protocol, the UPHS and the Quezon City Epidemiology Surveillance Unit have coordinated the monitoring of the persons with whom the PUIs had been in close contact with. Contact tracing resulted in a list of persons for monitoring, meaning they did not manifest any symptoms of the disease. The PUMs are currently under home quarantine. The UPD also assured that all buildings that have been visited by the PUIs are already being disinfected. Tags: ncov"

The death toll rose by one to 60. The daily tally of new cases in South Korea peaked at 909 on Feb. 29, as authorities tested about 200,000 followers of a fringe Christian church at the center of the nation’s epidemic. With that task almost done, the infection rate had slowed in recent days, raising hopes that South Korea might be bringing the virus under control. But new clusters at the call center in Seoul, and among teachers and students of a dance school with classes around the country, have kept authorities on high alert for a fresh spike in infections. Fifty-two of the latest infections were in Seoul but authorities did not say how many of those were linked directly to the call center operated by an insurance company. Authorities say they are testing the 200 staff who worked on the floor where the first cases were discovered, while monitoring others in the center’s workforce of up to 800 people. More than 140 new infections were in the worst-hit city of Daegu, where the church is based, and the nearby province of North Gyeongsang. “There has been a stagnating trend in Daegu cases despite a slight increase today,” said Yoon Tae-ho, director general for public health policy.

In a circular letter, the prelate said each local bishop must “discern” as the health department strongly urged to cancel, postpone, or suspend all gatherings of a great number of people. Since the coronavirus continues to affect a greater number of the population causing fear, anxiety, and genuine concern, Valles said: “We need to take all of these seriously.” “In the face of this worldwide pandemic, we are demanded to exercise vigilance as a Church, lest our churches become venues of transmission of the disease,” he said. The CBCP recommended precautionary measure during this time of crisis such as discouraging the sick and immune-compromised individuals from attending masses and other church activities. “Taking the basic steps of wellness as recommended by the health authorities is not only sensible, but wise and considerate of others. In truth, it is an expression of genuine charity,” Valles said. He said vulnerable populations like the elderly, those who are immune-compromised, may view the celebration of Holy Mass on television and the social media. Liturgical spaces, he said should be disinfected or sanitized after every liturgical service and hand sanitizers should be placed at the doors of churches for the use of churchgoers.

People wait in line to reach TSA immigration process at the John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York, US, March 9, 2020. (REUTERS / Eduardo Munoz / File photo / MANILA BULLETIN) The union, the AFGE TSA Council 100, which represents about 45,000 transportation security officers at airports across the United States, sent an email on Tuesday morning to TSA Administrator David Pekoske calling on the agency to provide the masks to workers. The email has not been previously reported. “Everything we do is for the safety of the passengers, but at the same time you have to safeguard yourself,” said union president Hydrick Thomas. Pekoske rejected the request in an emailed reply later on Tuesday, according to union officials, saying the agency would continue to follow guidance issued by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regarding workforce protection. The call for more effective masks comes as the coronavirus continues to spread in the United States, prompting President Donald Trump’s administration to discuss emergency measures to limit the fallout to public health and the economy. The union wants the transportation agency to provide a type of mask known as an N95 respirator, designed to protect the wearer from smaller pathogens such as coronavirus. The security officers have been provided the option of wearing surgical masks, according to Thomas. But such masks are not designed to block very small particles, according to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). TSA spokesman James Gregory did not comment specifically on the request for N95 masks, but confirmed that the agency permits security officers to wear surgical masks on the job. The spread of the coronavirus, which has now reached more than 110 countries and territories, has triggered a global shortage of N95 respirator masks. Federal medical workers tasked with screening incoming passengers at US airports for exposure to the coronavirus asked their supervisors last week to change official protocols and require stronger masks, Reuters reported on Saturday.. Following the report, the CDC issued new guidance that makes the N95 masks optional for those screeners. Tags: ncov"

Marcos expressed fears on Wednesday that the limited number of support centers of the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) will severely challenge the country’s capacity to conduct coronavirus disease (COVID-19) tests especially when a widespread contagion takes place.  Senator Imee Marcos (Senator Imee Marcos Official Facebook Page / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN) “Hanggang ngayon, hindi pa sinasabi ng DOH (Department of Health) kung ilan ba talaga ang kayang i-testing ng RITM bawat araw, Kahit limpak-limpak pa ang testing kit na bibilhin natin, kung kulang naman sa manpower, wala rin,” Marcos said. (Up to now, the Department of Health (DOH) has not stated how many patients the RITM could test every day. Even if there are many testing kits, if RITM lacks manpower, then it’s useless.) Marcos is calling for a bigger budget to modernize and expand the RITM in Muntinlupa, the country’s main center for Covid-19 testing. “Biruin nyo naman, sa recent hearing namin dito sa Senado, inamin mismo ng DOH na meron lang silang 2,000 testing kits. Tapos, ang population natin over 100 million. Eh paano na ‘yan sakaling lumobo pa ang maapektuhan?” Marcos said. (The DOH admitted during a Senate committee hearing that it only has 2,000 testing kits. What happens when there is a surge in the number of COVID-19 patients in the country which has a population of more than 100 million?). Marcos lamented that more than 30 years of government neglect towards the RITM has left it undermanned and ill-equipped to cope with the sudden appearance of new viruses and the spread of infection on a large scale. “Mag-aapat na dekada na mula nung na-inaugurate ang RITM sa panahon pa ng tatay ko, pero sa mahabang panahon, mukhang dinedma lang ang importansya ng RITM at halos walang nangyaring development,” Marcos said. (It has been four decades since RITM was inaugurated during the presidency of my late father, Ferdinand E. Marcos. But RITM was not given much importance and there has been no development since then.) At present, the RITM only has five sub-national centers that can perform COVID-19 testing: The Lung Center and San Lazaro Hospital in Metro Manila, Baguio City General Hospital, Vicente Sotto Medical Center in Cebu, and Southern Philippine Medical Center in Davao del Sur. Marcos recommended that the RITM’s regional presence be increased as soon as possible, starting with the high-population areas of Regions 3 to 5. “Wala tayong duda sa galing ng Pinoy sa siyensya at kahapon lamang ay balitang may mga dalubhasa ng UP na naka-develop ng sarili nilang testing kits,” Marcos said. (We don’t doubt the capability of our countrymen in the field of science as scientists at the University of the Philippines (UP) have developed testing kits.) “Kapag nalampasan na natin ang pagsubok na ito, dapat na talagang seryosohin ang pag-pondo sa modernong equipment at research ng RITM at karagdagang manpower nito sa iba’t ibang rehiyon,” Marcos added.

Of the new infections, 10 were imported cases, bringing the overall cases from abroad to 79. The Chinese capital of Beijing on Tuesday saw six new cases involving individuals who traveled from Italy and the United States, while Shanghai had two imported infections, Shandong province one and Gansu province one. Taiwan too has begun reporting an uptick in imported cases. The government said on Wednesday the island’s 48th case was a woman in her 30s who had returned from holiday in Britain and had most likely been infected there. As China’s efforts to control the spread of the pathogen at home start to payoff, Beijing is turning its focus on overseas cases as the coronavirus expands its footprint across the globe.

General Filemon Santos Jr., AFP Chief, said the military takes President Duterte’s order of placing the entire Philippines under a State of Public Health Emergency “very seriously and proactively.” “Even before such issuance by the President, I have directed the AFP Health Services Command to institute preventive measures to ensure that military camps have the necessary and stringent safeguards from COVID-19 [infection],” Santos said. President Duterte signed Proclamation No. 922 placing the entire country under a State of Public Health Emergency after the Department of Health (DOH) raised its COVID-19 alert system to Code Red Sub-Level 1. This, after the Health department confirmed the first ever case of a local transmission when the wife of the fifth COVID-19 positive patient — a 62-year-old Filipino from Cainta, Rizal — contracted the disease. Part of the military’s preventive measures include body temperature checking before entering key military camps, establishment of a testing center at the AFP Medical Center or V. Luna General Hospital in Quezon City, and a moratorium on sending its personnel to foreign travels except when necessary, among others. The AFP Chief also encouraged all military personnel and civilian human resource to practice personal hygiene diligently to mitigate the risks of being infected by the disease. “We are preparing for the possibility that AFP facilities and personnel may be tapped to provide assistance in the ‘whole of government’ approach in combating COVID-19 that has raised alarms worldwide,” he noted. Earlier, the Philippine Army said it can provide manpower, mobility, security, and possibly facilities to help the Inter-Agency Task Force on Managing Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-MEID) combat the deadly respiratory disease. The World Health Organization (WHO) reported on Tuesday that there were already 113,702 confirmed cases around the world, including 4,012 deaths. Nearly 81,000 cases were reported in China where the virus originated in the capital city of Wuhan in Hubei province. In the Philippines, there have been 33 confirmed COVID-19 cases so far, according to the Department of Health. The number of patients is expected to rise as the country grapples to implement measures to prevent the spread of the disease much like the rest of the world. This includes the possibility of a lockdown of the entire Metro Manila, according to Interior and Local Government Secretary Eduardo Ano. As to the possible lockdown of Metro Manila, the military expressed readiness to enforce the necessary measures should they be tapped by concerned government agencies to secure key entry and exit points, along with the Philippine National Police. The lockdown may be enforced if the DOH raises its COVID-19 Alert System to Code Red Sub-Level 2, which means that there is a continuous transmission and unlinked clusters of cases. Tags: ncov"

An indoor music venue called Soap Opera Classics Umeda were some people confirmed as infected with the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) after visiting the venue in Osaka. Japan March 4, 2020, in this photo taken by Kyodo. Picture was taken March 4, 2020. (Kyodo via REUTERS / MANILA BULLETIN) Japan has closed schools, zoos and theme parks, and drastically scaled back public events since the outbreak. The annual spring sumo tournament is being held in Osaka without spectators, leaving public broadcaster NHK to televise bouts of wrestlers facing off in an eerily quiet stadium. Despite those steps, and the government’s urging telecommuting, there are signs that smaller crowds – including those at restaurants and tiny “live houses” where fans stand cheek by jowl to hear live music – are spreading the virus. Japan on Tuesday reported the single-biggest number of infections in a day, of 59 cases, according to NHK. Osaka reported its first coronavirus case on Feb. 27. As of Tuesday, it had 73 cases – the third-most among Japan’s 47 prefectures, according to data from the local government. So far, 58 of those could be traced back to four small music venues, Osaka’s daily announcements show. Many of the cases concentrated on three dates: Feb. 15, 16, and 19 – but a possible cluster-type spread wasn’t identified until early March, the data shows. Many of those infected were in their 30s and 40s and showed minimal or no symptoms. As of Tuesday, 40 cases were linked to one venue in particular – Soap opera classics Umeda – and at least another 20 to Live House Arc. About 100 people attended each performance at the clubs. Another 19 people outside Osaka, from as far away as Hokkaido, the northernmost island, and Kumamoto, in the southernmost main island of Kyushu, have also been traced back to those two venues as of Monday. Sushi chain operator Sushiro Global Holdings said on Tuesday it would temporarily close one of its branches in neighboring Hyogo prefecture to disinfect it after an employee who had been to one of the music venues on Feb. 16 tested positive. The worker had displayed no symptoms, it said. Infections have been found in people who had been to two other venues – LIVE HOUSE Rumio and americamura FANJ twice, said the local government. All four clubs, located within a radius of around 3 kms (1.9 miles) of each other in the city center, have since been disinfected under the direction of Osaka health authorities. “The only way to prevent this disease from a very rapid transmission and high infection rate is to reduce person-to-person contact,” said Eyal Leshem, the director of the Center for Travel Medicine and Tropical Diseases at Sheba Medical Center in Israel, which has treated coronavirus patients evacuated from the Diamond Princess cruise liner. “Communities that are experiencing what we call community transmission need to shift to the stage of outbreak response called mitigation,” Leshem said, adding that meant “social distancing” as a means to prevent person-to-person infection. Already, there are signs that the virus is spreading beyond people who were in the clubs. A man in his 30s with no symptoms who had been to Arc on Feb. 15 tested positive on March 8. Two of his family members have also tested positive. The Osaka prefectural government is asking anyone who had been to concerts on seven dates in mid- to late February at the four venues to get tested for the coronavirus, whether or not they have symptoms. On its website, Live House Arc said it was cancelling all of its events for the remainder of the month. “Can it be? The coronavirus has engulfed the underground live house scene!” said local guitar pop trio White Shadow in a blog post this month. The band was on the bill at Live House Rumio on Feb. 18. It said it would postpone all of its performances through mid-month. Japan has nearly 1,300 cases of the virus, including about 700 from the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which was quarantined near Tokyo last month. Nineteen have died, including seven from the liner. The virus has spread around the world, with more than 116,000 confirmed cases and 4,000 deaths. Tags: ncov"

(REUTERS/ Brendan McDermid / MANILA BULLETIN) The dueling rallies – the first major US campaign events to be canceled because of the outbreak – had both been scheduled for Cleveland. Ohio, Florida, Illinois and Arizona hold nominating contests next Tuesday in the Democratic presidential race. On Tuesday, six states, including Michigan and Washington, are holding nominating contests in the race to nominate a challenger to Republican President Donald Trump in the Nov. 3 election. The Democratic race has narrowed to a two-way battle between Biden, the former vice president running as a moderate, and Sanders, a senator from Vermont a self-described democratic socialist. The Democratic National Committee said on Tuesday that its next presidential nominating debate in Arizona on Sunday would not have a live audience because of health concerns. “We are heeding the public warnings from Ohio state officials, who have communicated concern about holding large, indoor events during the coronavirus outbreak,” Mike Casca, the Sanders campaign communications director, said in a statement. Kate Bedingfield, Biden’s communications director, said the rally would be canceled “in accordance with guidance from public officials and out of an abundance of caution.” Biden planned instead to speak to reporters in Philadelphia, where he also was expected to address the coronavirus crisis. Both candidates have criticized the Trump administration over its response to the coronavirus, which causes a highly contagious and sometimes fatal respiratory illness known as COVID-19. The disease has so far sickened almost 1,000 people in the United States and killed 29, mostly in Washington state. Washington also conducts its primary on Tuesday, although voting in that contest occurs by mail. Both campaigns said they would consult with health officials about future events, hours after Ohio Governor Mike DeWine called for all large-scale indoor gatherings to be avoided. While the outbreak has shaken financial markets, forced school closures and prompted organizers to cancel concerts, conferences and sporting events, the candidates until now have largely pressed on as usual, holding events and shaking hands. Trump, who has sought to play down the extent of the threat, has held several campaign rallies in recent weeks aimed at stealing the spotlight from the Democrats. Journalists asked Vice President Mike Pence at a Tuesday news briefing if the Trump campaign’s plans were changing given the coronavirus worries. “That’ll be a decision that’s made literally on a day-by-day basis,” Pence said. “I’m very confident that the campaign will take the very best information and make the very best decision going forward.” Concerns over the virus have had an impact on local election officials, who are preparing for the possibility of absent poll workers, creating long lines at voting locations. A Democratic presidential candidate forum in Florida scheduled for Thursday was canceled. Tags: ncov"

A man wearing a protective mask is seen on the subway on March 10, 2020, in New York City. There are now 20 confirmed coronavirus cases in the city including a 7-year-old girl in the Bronx. (Jeenah Moon/Getty Images/AFP / MANILA BULLETIN) Andrew Cuomo said authorities would set up a one-mile radius “containment zone” around the epicenter of an outbreak in New Rochelle in suburban Westchester County. Cuomo explained that all facilities in the zone that hold large gatherings, such as schools and temples, would be closed for two weeks beginning Thursday. “We’re also going to use the National Guard in the containment area to deliver food to homes, to help with the cleaning of public spaces,” Cuomo said. There have been 173 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in New York state, including 108 in Westchester County, home to New Rochelle where the majority of infections have been detected. Cuomo told reporters that businesses in the containment zone will remain open and that people will be free to come and go as they wish, insisting there is no quarantine. “You’re not containing people, it’s facilities,” he said. “It is a dramatic action, but it is the largest cluster in the country. This is literally a matter of life and death,” Cuomo added. “People are scared, it’s an unusual situation to be in,” Miles Goldberg, who runs a New Rochelle bar, told AFP. “It makes people nervous to be around others, it makes people nervous to get inside into businesses and such,” he said. Tim Eble, who manages a gym, said he intended to keep the facility open but take “extra precautions to keep things clean.” The area is centered on a synagogue in New Rochelle — a city of 80,000 inhabitants just north of New York City — that was attended by a man who was the state’s first case, a lawyer working in Manhattan. His wife, Adina Lewis Garbuz, posted Tuesday on Facebook that it had taken health officials “days” to figure out he was infected. “As many have asked, of course he went to the doctor and did so many times. No one figured it out and it even took the hospital days to figure it out,” she said, reporting that the rest of her family was in good health. At least one of the employees at the hospital where her husband was treated contracted the virus, and others, including doctors, were under quarantine, according to The New York Times. The hospital did not immediately respond for comment when contacted by AFP. The United States has more than 950 confirmed cases of the deadly virus, according to a running tally by Johns Hopkins University.

Justice Secretary Menardo Guevarra (TOTO LOZANO/PRESIDENTIAL PHOTO /MANILA BULLETIN FILE PHOTO) “We all know about the overcrowding problem at the national penitentiary,” Guevarra said. “Just one COVID-19 case inside will produce calamitous effects,” he added. Guevarra said this is the reason why he is supporting the decision of the BuCor to suspend the visiting privileges of inmates for one week. “The BuCor move, like the suspension of classes for this week, is in line with President Duterte’s proclamation of a state of public health emergency,” he said. January statistics of the BuCor show that its prison facilities are overcrowded by 310 percent as 49,114 inmates occupy prisons that can only hold a total capacity of 11,981 persons. On Tuesday, March 10, the BuCor announced that it has suspended the visitation privileges of inmates for one week starting March 11. The BuCor said the move was made due to “the announcement of the Department of Health (DOH) raising the Code Red Alert Sublevel 1 and President Duterte’s declaration of Public Health Emergency over COVID-19.” “Code Red Sublevel 1 is a preventive call to alert all public and private healthcare providers’ readiness if a sudden increase in cases is reported, similar to what happened in Italy and other countries in Asia,” the BuCor added.   Tags: ncov"
,"March 11, 2020, 8:25 AM",nCov,Virus toll soars in locked-down Italy as pace slows in China,By Agence France-Presse ,"By Agence France-Presse  Locked-down Italy on Tuesday recorded its deadliest day of the novel coronavirus outbreak, as airlines halted flights and neighboring countries clamped down on borders of the worst-hit country outside of China.  The Spanish Steps in Rome are deserted after sunset, after Italy imposed unprecedented restrictions to check the spread of the new coronavirus and the death toll soared to 631 people (AFP / Tiziana FABI / MANILA BULLETIN) Chinese leader Xi Jinping meanwhile sought to ease concerns in the country where the virus was first detected in December, making his first visit to the epicenter of Wuhan and declaring the spread in the central city and Hubei province to be “basically curbed.” On the world’s financial markets, stocks and oil bounced back on hopes of US economic stimulus measures, after suffering their biggest one-day losses in more than a decade on Monday. The fallout from the virus has extended across society in countries around the world, with major sports events postponed or called off, cinemas shut and large gatherings banned. On Tuesday, it spilled into US politics, with Democratic presidential hopefuls Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden both canceling campaign rallies. Official figures showed daily infections in China are at their lowest level since record-keeping began in January, with 19 new infections and 17 deaths recorded on Tuesday, after a similar flatlining of cases in South Korea. By contrast, Europe’s outbreak surged, with Italy’s toll rising by 168 to 631 dead from COVID-19 (the official name for the virus), with 10,149 infected in just over two weeks. China remains the hardest-hit overall with more than 80,000 cases and over 3,000 deaths, out of a global total of 117,339 cases and 4,251 deaths across 107 countries and territories, according to an AFP tally. Reflecting the differing stages of the outbreak, China relaxed some of its most severe restrictions in Hubei province at the same moment as several European countries went on full alert mode. A slew of airlines announced they would cut all flights to Italy for the next few weeks, while a number of European countries announced the closure of schools and bans on mass public events. Slovenia said it was closing its border with Italy, while Austria announced bans on trains and flights to the neighboring country. French President Emmanuel Macron said Slovenia and Austria had made “bad decisions” with the drastic measures but warned that his country was “just at the beginning” of its outbreak. Chile said it was would quarantine all travelers arriving from Italy and Spain. In the Middle East, Iran registered 54 new deaths — the highest single-day toll so far in the country with the third-deadliest outbreak in the world. A total of 291 people have now died in the Islamic Republic. Turkey, a major hub linking Europe and western Asia, registered its first case on Tuesday, as did the Democratic Republic of Congo. Strict lockdowns and travel restrictions were apparently successful in China but faced a rocky start in Italy, a country of 60 million people where Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte told residents they should travel only for the most urgent work or health reasons. While squares in Milan and Rome were emptied of their usual bustle and traffic, some residents were confused as to whether they were even allowed to leave their homes for everyday tasks like shopping. The confusion forced the government to clarify its decree and warn against panic-buying. Pope Francis also seemed to muddy the waters, holding a mass in which he urged priests to go out and visit the sick — something specifically discouraged by Conte. Sports schedules have been wrecked across the continent. A day after Italycancelled all domestic sport, France, Spain, Germany, and Portugal announced matches will be played in empty stadia, while some games in the Netherlands were canceled. In a rare glimmer of positive news, the remaining guests at a hotel on lockdown in Spain’s Canary Islands left the building after a 14-day quarantine, to the cheers and applause of hotel workers and medical staff. In the United States, reports have suggested President Donald Trump could be vulnerable after several senior Republicans quarantined themselves because they had been in contact with a virus sufferer. Trump said Tuesday he would be happy to get a coronavirus test but has been told there is no need. “I feel very good but I guess it’s not a big deal to get tested and it’s something I would do,” he told reporters in Washington. But the White House doctor declared there was “no reason to do it,” Trump added. “There’s no symptoms, no anything.” There are concerns that the US could become another hotspot, with at least 26 deaths and 605 confirmed infections so far. Trump had promised to announce “major” economic measures on Tuesday, but no concrete details had emerged by early evening. In New York, the UN closed its headquarters to the public, while major US universities have been forced to cancel classes and move lessons online. On the West Coast — where most of the US deaths have occurred — the Grand Princess cruise ship has docked at California’s port of Oakland, for more than 2,400 passengers to be taken into treatment or placed in quarantine, in a delicate, days-long operation.

The World Health Organization, the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and the UN children’s agency issued downloadable new guidance to help protect children against the virus. While stopping short of recommending that schools be kept open, the guidelines stressed that “education can encourage students to become advocates for disease prevention and control at home, in school, and in their community by talking to others about how to prevent the spread of viruses.” The organisations pointed out that safe school guidelines implemented in west Africa during the 2014-2016 Ebola outbreak helped prevent school-based transmissions of the virus. The guidance provided checklists for schools and advice for authorities on implementing emergency plans. UNICEF urged schools to give students information on hand-washing, avoiding touching the face and coughing or sneezing into a tissue or the elbow. It said children should be kept away from school if they are ill. If schools close, remote learning options such as radio broadcasts of academic content should be considered so children can keep learning at home, the organisations said. Where schools remain open, they should clean and disinfect buildings, especially sanitation and water facilities, and increase ventilation. “Maintaining safe school operations or reopening schools after a closure requires many considerations, but, if done well, can promote public health,” the organisations said in a statement.

They would however have to complete a quarantine before leaving the hospital where they are currently staying, she added, without specifying when it would end. On Monday night, Egypt’s health ministry said the total number of known cases in the country had risen to 59, including three more Egyptians and a foreign woman.

Since February 28, a total of 76 cases have been confirmed on the small North Atlantic island, but no one has died. Last week, the Department of Civil Protection and Emergency Management nonetheless raised the alert level to “emergency phase” after two instances of transmission inside the country were confirmed. On Tuesday the government also announced a plan “to respond to the economic impact of COVID-19,” the disease caused by the virus. Meanwhile, Decode genetics, a human genome research specialist, is to test thousands of Icelanders, including those not showing symptoms. “The lower limit for people screened will be about 5,000,” chief executive Kari Stefansson told AFP. That amounts to about 1.4 percent of the subarctic nation’s entire population of around 357,000 people and Stefansson said screenings would begin by the end of the week. Depending on the results, even more expansive testing could be pursued in the future. Widespread screening, as opposed to just testing people who show symptoms, is meant to help authorities decide on the need for a quarantine or a ban on mass gatherings. Decode genetics offered to help the government, which has been relying on the National University Hospital of Iceland to analyse samples.

The announcement sparked a wave of confusion because churches are supposed to remain open across Italy as a whole during the country’s month-long ban on public gatherings. A Vatican source later clarified to AFP that anyone who expresses a wish to pray at the basilica can still pass through the police barrier and walk onto the main square. Italy’s new nationwide restrictions on social events and travel are designed to curb the spread of a disease that has killed 631 and infected 10,149 in just over two weeks. The Vatican has so far officially confirmed one case of the COVID-19 disease caused by the new virus that was detected in a person who was using one of its public pharmacies. It was also awaiting the results of a second person who came in contact with a virus carrier at an event organised by the Vatican at the start of the month. Pope Francis himself was forced to break with centuries of tradition and deliver his Sunday Angelus Prayer via livestream instead of from his Vatican window to limit crowds on Saint Peter’s Square. Saint Peter’s basilica is one of the world’s most popular tourist attractions. Its dome — the tallest in the world — soars over Rome and is visible across the Italian capital. It is filled with frescos and statues by great Renaissance masters such as Michelangelo. – ‘Go out and see’ –
The 83-old-pontiff is still recovering from a cold he developed about two weeks ago. He spoke with a slight rasp in on Tuesday during a morning prayer in which he urged priests across the world to go out and meet those suffering from the new disease. “Let us pray to the Lord also for our priests, may they have the courage to go out and see the sick, bringing them the strength of the word of God and the Eucharist, and accompany health workers and volunteers in the work they do,” the pope said a video from his residence in the Vatican. He bowed carefully and gingerly kissed the bible before delivering the prayer. “Let us continue to pray together for the sick, the health workers, so many people who are suffering because of this epidemic,” he said. The Argentine-born pope has enjoyed a life of good health and follows a rigorous schedule despite having a part of a lung removed when he was young. His unusual absence during the coronavirus scare prompted immediate speculation that he had contracted COVID-19.

You go to get tested for the novel coronavirus.  A German hospital in the town of Gross-Gerau is offering drive-through testing for the novel coronavirus (AFP Photo/Torsten Silz) Designed to minimise exposure to medical staff and patients, the drive-in at the local hospital is one of several unexpected ways healthcare providers are tackling a fast-spreading outbreak that has killed over 500 people across Europe. “Extraordinary times call for extraordinary solutions,” doctor Roxana Sauer, a medical director at Gross-Gerau District Hospital, told AFP. Since last week, suspected patients have been able to call ahead and consult a physician by phone, who decides whether they should be tested. The person is then assigned a time slot and asked to park outside a side entrance of the hospital, where they are met by a doctor clad head to toe in protective gear. After rolling down the car window, the potential patient is swabbed in the mouth or nostril before driving off again. Their sample is sent to a lab which returns the result within 24 hours, of which the person is notified by phone. Similar drive-through testing sites have sprung up in other German hospitals in recent days, as well as in South Korea, the United States and Britain. “People love that it can be done so quickly and easily,” said Sauer. The hospital’s managing director Erika Raab added: “For Germans, the car is their safe space, it’s where they feel comfortable.” – ‘Pizza pager’ –
Of the 32 tests carried out at the Gross-Gerau drive-through so far, none have come back positive. But the hospital’s coronavirus hotline has been ringing off the hook as residents in the rural area, famed for its asparagus farms, fret about a global epidemic that has sparked panic-buying, school closures and flight cancellations. Germany itself has recorded over 1,100 cases and on Monday announced its first two deaths. While Hesse state, where Gross-Gerau is located, remains relatively untouched with just a few dozen cases, staff at the hospital decided to be proactive and “get creative”, said Raab. The hospital’s next plan is to get an online “tele-doc” system up and running this week, she added. The cyber-consultation will allow patients to talk to doctors without leaving their homes, expected to come in handy if more people have to self-isolate. Since the coronavirus has coincided with a seasonal flu outbreak, the hospital is also creating an outdoor waiting area, to avoid those with flu symptoms sharing a waiting room with others. Patients will wait in their car in the car park where an employee will hand out “pizza pagers”, like those used in restaurants, that vibrate when it’s their turn to be seen, said Raab. “We want to show people that we are taking their concerns seriously,” she said. “So we asked ourselves what simple solutions we can come up with. Hysteria calms down when people see you are doing something.” – Theft –
Other steps taken at the hospital include touchless hand sanitiser dispensers, and black-and-yellow construction tape to remind people to keep a safe distance at the reception desk — after finding that red markings blended in too well with the surroundings and were ignored. Raab said she is convinced the German health system can handle the coronavirus storm, and stressed the collegiality and moments of solidarity that have brightened up a stressful time. After hearing on the radio that toilet paper and sanitising gel were stolen from the hospital, a local woman recently donated over a dozen bottles of disinfectant. The apparently remorseful thief later returned 10 of the stolen bottles, leaving them outside the building, unopened. The hospital thanked the anonymous culprit on Facebook for doing the right thing — and encouraged other “sticky fingers” to do the same. Tags: ncov"

Mayor Jerry Treñas (Mayor Jerry Treñas official Facebook page / MANILA BULLETIN) “I am speaking to the DOH. I think it’s your responsibility to provide test kits to all the different regions and I’m not just talking about Western Visayas,” said Mayor Jerry Treñas. “We demand it as a matter of right,” an irked Treñas emphasized. This comes as the local government unit (LGU) of Iloilo City, the regional of Western Visayas region, braced itself for eventual discovery of COVID-19 positive cases. “We, in the LGU, are acting on our responsibilities and the DOH should act on its own responsibilities,” Treñas added. Aside from lack of COVID-19 test kits, there was no single hospital in Western Visayas accredited by the DOH which could conduct such testing. For the entire Visayas, the only accredited hospital is the Vicente Sotto Memorial Medical Center in Cebu City. Earlier tests for suspected COVID-19 cases were mostly sent to DOH’s Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) in Metro Manila. Meanwhile, Governor Arthur Defensor Jr. of Iloilo province has issued an executive order suspending all public events in the 42 towns and the component city of Passi to avoid the spread of COVID-19’s local transmission.

Parañaque City Public Information Office (PIO) Chief Mar Jimenez said each local government unit was given only two testing kits, but because of the increasing number of persons infected with the disease, the city government must be ready to test more suspected cases.  (Ted ALJIBE / AFP / MANILA BULLETIN FILE PHOTO) Roaming in malls When asked about the suspension of classes, Jimenez said prior to the announcement of President Duterte on the matter, Mayor Edwin Olivarez decided not to suspend the classes in the city for fear that students will only roam around in malls and thus be more susceptible to the disease. “It would be better that students were only inside their schools, but now the President decided to suspend classes in the whole Metro Manila from March 10 to 14, the only thing we could do is to deploy policemen and the barangay (staff) around the city to check whether there are students roaming around especially inside the malls,” Jimenez said. Per a directive of the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG), personnel of local government units (LGUs) were told to ask policemen and barangay watchmen to conduct checks on whether students were roaming around in malls. Jimenez also said the disinfection of schools in the city was already being done every Friday night when there are no classes because the effects of the disinfectant last 24 hours. Couple positive for COVID-19 On the couple who are San Juan residents and who tested positive for the disease, they opted to be confined at the Unihealth Paranaque Hospital and Medical Center because their child works there. In confirming the report, Mayor Olivarez said the pair was transferred last Monday to the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine in Muntinlupa. Olivarez also said they will disinfect the areas visited by the couple before they were confined. Don’t hide information The city chief executive added that he also met with operators of mostly Chinese-run gambling hubs in his city on Monday and urged them to refrain from hiding information on COVID-19 cases. “Ganoon po ang briefing natin sa kanila… dapat po iyong mga data ay hindi wini-withhold, lalong-lalo na kahit private iyan,” Olivarez said.  (That’s how we briefed them: data on the disease should not be withheld, even if it’s private.) The mayor said he also released a memorandum discouraging crowd-drawing activities, and commercial establishments in the city were urged to check the temperature of customers at entrances.

The call was made in the House committee on overseas workers affairs hearing on the current situation of OFWs in countries affected by the outbreak of COVID-19.  (DFA/ MANILA BULLETIN FILE PHOTO) “Can they be gainfully employed, considering they already have a record of being infected?” TUCP party-list Rep. Raymond Democrito Mendoza asked Philippine Overseas Employment Administration (POEA) Administrator Bernard Olalia. “The stigma is another thing that you have to address. Will you find employment, considering that you are positive of coronavirus, people are paranoid,” he added. Responding to Mendoza’s query, Olalia said, “For as long as the seafarers are able to secure a medical certificate that he is COVID-free, then deployment is allowed.” In the hearing, the Department of Health’s (DOH) Dr. Jonathan Buenaventura noted that COVID-19 patients can be infected again with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). “There were some reports that for COVID, it is possible to get re-infected,” he said. Bayan Muna party-list Rep. Ferdinand Gaite agreed with Mendoza that Filipino workers who have recovered from COVID-19 might be discriminated and risk of being denied of employment abroad. “The Chair has a legitimate concern whether COVID patients might be stigmatized, in the sense that, if the employer will discover that he contracted COVID-19, the decision to rehire would be greatly affected,” he said. He asked that if the medical certificate to be issued to the concerned OFW will specifically indicate that he or she is COVID-free. Olalia said the Data Privacy Law prohibits the disclosure of the identities of OFWs who contracted the virus. “According to the Data Privacy Law, we should not disclose the identity of the seafarers or any OFWs who contracted COVID-19. It is against the law. There is no disclosure,” he said. Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) Undersecretary for Migrant Workers’ Affairs Sarah Lou Arriola told the panel there are certain countries that have already banned Filipinos. “Before, we are having a problem of banning certain countries. Aside from Kuwait and Qatar, even Palestine does not allow tourists anymore and now, Israel is also not receiving foreigners and they are asking foreigners to leave their territory,” she said. “The DFA stands ready to assist anyone who gets sick if ever the health system of the country of destination does not pay the medical bills of that person,” Arriola assured the panel. She disclosed that the DFA will be repatriating “within the week” more than 500 Filipinos who are on the coronavirus-hit MV Grand Princess cruise ship, which has been anchored off the coast of San Francisco.

For the private sector, Nograles said the Department of Labor and Employment recently issued a labor advisory that regulates flexi-work arrangement in offices.

Still no community transmission The health official also said there is community transmission yet for COVID-19. “We are awaiting gene sequencing where we analyze the samples from our patients, who are positive, so we can determine if there are epidemiological links to one another,” said Vergeire. “We need to get all information by tonight so that we can readily analyze and conclude whether there is a sustained community transmission,” she added. “We want to analyze the data immediately because we don’t want to be late in declaring a community transmission so that our response will be amplified accordingly,” she furthered. Vergeire said that they will possibly impose a lockdown if a community transmission was already detected in a certain area. “We reach the point of a lockdown when we are already in Code Red Alert Sublevel 2, wherein we have a sustained transmission. That is where a lockdown strategy can be employed,” she said. Tags: ncov"
,"March 10, 2020, 11:31 PM",nCov,COVID-19 cases rise to 33,By Jel Santos and Hanah Tabios,"By Jel Santos and Hanah Tabios The Department of Health (DOH) revealed on Tuesday nine more coronavirus dis- ease (COVID-19) cases, rais-
ing the total number to 33.  DILG Secretary Eduardo Año (Photo from Philippine Information Agency / MANILA BULLETIN) The new virus cases were disclosed as the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) said that it is prepared to enforce a lockdown in Metro Manila in the event the DOH raises the COVID-19 alert level to Code Red-Sublevel 2, Secretary Eduardo Año said. “We are prepared if there would be a lockdown. We have the Philippine National Police (PNP) and the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) to help the LGUs as much as possible because we really need to contain this. That is the wisdom,” Año said in an ambush interview after the Metro Manila Council (MMC) meeting at Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) headquarters on Tuesday. Code Red-Sublevel 2 means that there is a continuous transmission. Currently, the country is placed by the DOH under the Code Red-Sublevel 1 after the agency confirmed the first local transmission of COVID-19. As of press time Tuesday, the DOH was still holding a media briefing on the new COVID-19 cases. “If there is transmission, the best that we can do is really stop the spread of the virus, but how? By ensuring that there is no mass gathering or probably we will impose the lockdown for 14 days. Kasi ‘yun ang incubation time ng virus so with that matitigil mo ‘yung activity ma-pre-prevent mo ‘yung pag-spread,” Año added. “The size of the area for community lockdown will depend on the affectations. Movement will be strictly restricted because the purpose is to contain the virus. The IATF EID (Inter- Agency Task Force on Emerging Infec- tious Diseases) will come up with the protocol containing specific details before the issuance of a lockdown order,” Año said. Año said there are various types of lockdown that can be implemented once the Sublevel 2 is raised by the DOH. MMDA General Manager Jose Arturo Garcia said that all the Metro Manila mayors agree with the idea of lockdown if it becomes Code Red-Sublevel 2. “Our mayors do not have strong apprehension on the lockdown. All our mayors are united on this,” he said in Filipino when asked by reporters. Garcia said there are two types of lockdown, citing Italy’s lockdown of a region, and Wuhan, China’s “home lockdown.” The MMDA general manager affirmed Año’s statement and said that the government is ready to impose a lockdown should the situation call for it after March 14. “Of course, [ang] gobyerno nakaready ‘yan kung ano man ang lalabas after March 14, titingnan natin if mag-spread ito or kayang i-contain (Of course, the government is prepared for that if whatever will happen after March 14, we will check if it will spread or we could contain it),” Garcia told the media when pressed over the possible lockdown. Makati City Mayor Abigail “Abby” Binay thinks that imposing a lockdown is “an extreme measure.” “Wala pa tayo doon (We are not yet there),” she said. For Marikina Mayor Marcy Teodoro, he said he is okay with the idea of lockdown “if it is necessary.” “If necessary, we think we should take that into serious consideration. The lockdown [ay] maaring hindi sa buong Metro Manila, maaring isang barangay, maaring isang siyudad not necessarily to paralyze whole Metro Manila tukuyin lang nang mabuti at magkaroon ng mas maayos na infor- mation kung ilan talaga infected at kung saan talaga,” he told reporters. Asked on his take on the possible lockdown in Metro Manila, Pasig City Mayor Vico Sotto said “it depends on how the situation will progress. We must react proportionately and appropriately.” Valenzuela City Mayor Rex Gatchalian believes that situation of the country now is uncharted territory and they have to “heed the direction set forth by experts in the DOH when making crucial governance decisions.” FDA OKs local test kits  Meanwhile, The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the use of test kits developed by Filipino scientists to aid in the immediate diagnosis of COVID-19. The test kits were developed by local experts at the University of the Philippines-National Institute of Health (UP- NIH), and funded by the Department of Science and Technology (DOST). “The increasing number of reported COVID-19 cases will require immediate diagnosis and monitoring. This will provide our laboratories with technological reinforcement to accommodate the growing number of patients to be tested and aid in early screening of positive cases,” FDA Director General Rolando Enrique Domingo said in a statement released Tuesday. The approval came after the DOH raised Code Red-Sublevel 1 alert. President Duterte has also declared a State of Public Health Emergency amid the rise of coronavirus cases. In an interview, the FDA official said the testing kit is not yet approved by the World Health Organization (WHO) but assured that it is “accurate” in giving results. “Nung nakita naman natin, sinuri natin at talagang very accurate yung test pero meron naman tayong condition na pag ginamit nila ito, kailangan yung mga test result magkakaroon din ng genetic sequencing dito sa Philippine Genome Center (When we reviewed it, the test showed that it’s accurate. But we still have a condition that the test result should have a genetic sequenc- ing at the Philippine Genome Center),” said Domingo. Domingo said the technology will be used for field testing, coupled with gene sequencing at the Philippine Genome Center, which could provide greater access to a less costly diagnostic procedure. “Makakatulong yun para ma-trace kung saan nanggaling yung virus. Yung virus as it travels all over, nagkakaroon sya ng mga konti-konting pagbabago. So halimbawa, nakita mo yung genetic sequencing ng virus – malalaman mo kung nanggaling sa Japan, or China, or nanggaling sa Taiwan halimbawa or nanggaling sa ibang lugar (It can help in
tracing where the virus came from. The virus, as it travels all over, it changes a bit. For example, if you see the genetic sequencing of the virus – you will know if it came from Japan, or China, or Tai- wan, or from other areas),” he said. Domingo said that the testing kit can produce the result after about two hours. To note, it takes 24 to 48 hours before the result comes out in the testing process of the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) in Muntinlupa City. Domingo said that the test kits are expected to be available at the UP-NIH and the Philippine General Hospital. “They will be able to set it up, then train people, and start testing within a week,” he said. Aside from this move, the DOH recently said that five other laboratories have already been accredited to test samples of COVID-19, aside from the RITM. “The five sub-national labs are being provided capacity to do test completed their training on COVID identification and the proficiency test and all of them passed,” said RITM Director Celia Carlos in a previous press conference, adding that “they could start any moment from now” to do the testing. The five laboratories are San Lazaro Hospital and Lung Center of the Philip- pines in Manila; Baguio General Hos- pital and Medical Center in Northern Luzon; Vicente Sotto Memorial Medical Center in the Visayas region; and Southern Philippines Medical Center in Mindanao. “The FDA maintains its mandate in ensuring the safety and efficacy of products and devices to protect public health, and commits to cooperate with all agencies in ensuring a prompt response to this global crisis,” he added. With the increasing number of cases, President Duterte ordered on Monday a week-long suspension of classes in Metro Manila as a measure to prevent the spread of the virus. Media’s help sought Meanwhile, Senator Nancy Binay on Tuesday urged major broadcast networks to collaborate and share their artists to work together on initiatives in creating awareness surrounding COVID-19. With the help of their mother studios, Binay said Filipino showbiz personalities can help in leading the campaign in increasing public health awareness, and encourage their fans to help contain the dreaded virus. The senator noted many people are now holed up in their homes and television, and social media are now practically the most effective medium in creating an impact on people because of its wider reach. “Yung mga major television net- works tulad ng ABS-CBN, GMA-7, TV5, and even faith-based networks, can work together and come up with infomercials of their talents or artists sharing a common mission that would positively impact 100 million lives,” Binay said. She also said that with the guidance of the DOH, these networks can help in improving the public’s understanding of the virus by airing omnibus infomercials on what people can do in the fight against COVID-19. Even social media influencers and TV celebrities can come on board to help even in their own little ways as long as they seek guidance from health specialists on the content. “They could help in raising awareness and make a bigger impact with a simple blog, vlog or DIY video,” Binay pointed out. “Influencers can also maximize their social media accounts and rally support from their fan base,” she said.

,"March 10, 2020, 4:26 PM",nCov,Too much information? Privacy questions over S. Korea virus details,By Agence France-Presse,"By Agence France-Presse Allegations of affairs, revelations of membership of religious sects: South Korea’s openness about infected patients has been key in its fight against the coronavirus but raised uncomfortable questions over privacy and stigmatization.  In South Korea, detailed information on patients infected with the coronavirus is available online, sometimes making it possible to identify individuals (AFP Photo/Jung Yeon-je) South Korea has confirmed more than 7,500 infections, one of the largest totals outside China, where the virus first emerged, although new case numbers have been declining for several days. Officials say that has been made possible by widespread testing of potential contacts — the South has carried out more than 210,000. Across the country, local authorities have been issuing emergency alerts by mobile phone to those living or working in districts where new cases have been confirmed. The text message arrives with a shrieking warning, announcing nearby locations visited by patients before they were diagnosed with the virus and their links to other cases. More information is available on municipal websites, sometimes with breakdowns of individuals’ daily schedules, even down to the minute, and details of their residence and employer — often making them identifiable individually. In a country where virtually everyone owns a smartphone, doxxing — maliciously spreading private information about individuals and businesses online — has long been a problem. And the consequences have been sometimes been embarrassing, even brutal, with the National Human Rights Commission describing them as “human rights violations”. “We can’t help but worry about the situation where the confirmed patients become subject to secondary damages, such as being criticized, ridiculed and abhorred online,” it said in a statement. Two confirmed patients have been accused of having an extra-marital affair, after their travel logs showed similarities. One Samsung Electronics employee who tested positive said she received hateful comments online after a city mayor revealed her boyfriend is a member of Shincheonji, the controversial religious sect linked to more than half the South’s cases. “I am having a hard time mentally, more so than (physical) pain,” she wrote on her Facebook account, which she has since turned private, asking other users not to share her personal information. “I’m so sorry to my family and friends,” she added. Michael Hurt, a sociologist at Korea National University of Arts, said that while the alerts reassure the public that authorities are dealing with the epidemic, they can unintentionally lead to “the stigmatization of areas as infected or ‘dangerous’.” Companies identified as visited by infected people have been hit. “I’m having a very hard time, we are basically getting no customers after an emergency alert went out which included our address,” a restaurant owner in Seoul told AFP. “I understand these alerts are necessary, but at the same time, my business has been virtually destroyed.” South Korea has an advanced medical system, a free press and a strong culture of public accountability, and Seoul’s foreign minister says the government has stressed transparency when tackling the public health crisis. But even a health ministry civil servant could not avoid online bullying after contracting the virus. The municipal government of Sejong — where the ministry is based — revealed that she took gym classes taught by an infected instructor, as well as a detailed breakdown of her daily schedule. Most online comments slammed her as “irresponsible” for going to a gym during the outbreak, but others picked on items such as her lunch hours, saying they were too long for a civil servant and accused her of “slacking off”. The government’s Central Disaster and Safety Countermeasure Headquarters was forced to step in to defend her, saying her gym visits took place before authorities advised people to avoid public gatherings and adopt social distancing. “Excessive attacks and indiscriminate accusations against those infected will not only greatly hurt the individual, but will also impede prevention activities,” it said. A Seoul National University study has since shown South Koreans were more afraid of being “criticized” should they get infected, than the virus itself. There was a “delicate balance” between risk, information, and privacy, said Jason Farley, a nurse practitioner, and professor at the Johns Hopkins University School of Nursing. Simpler releases listing an infected person’s locations between certain dates would be sufficient, he told AFP, but the details being made public were leading to “significant stigma, discrimination and, in some cases, threats to individuals known to have COVID-19. “This behavior is unacceptable and should be discouraged.” Tags: ncov"

Women wearing face masks walk in a public area in Banda Aceh on March 2, 2020.  (Photo by CHAIDEER MAHYUDDIN / AFP /file photo) A woman in Indonesia’s second-biggest city Surabaya was arrested Monday for spreading inaccurate claims on Facebook a patient was being treated for the virus in the city, police said. Five others were also detained for spreading false information on social media, including claims a Muslim woman flying to Saudi Arabia for a religious pilgrimage had died suddenly from the virus at Jakarta’s international airport. All six suspects are accused of violating laws banning the spread of misinformation, which carries as much as six years in prison. “It should serve as a lesson for other people not to spread hoaxes about coronavirus in Indonesia,” senior communications ministry official Semuel Abrijani Pangerapan said. Last month, two Indonesian women were arrested for allegedly posting virus-linked misinformation in a country with some 130 million people online — among the globe’s biggest internet audiences. On Monday, the country reported its confirmed cases had jumped to 19 from six. Scientists have questioned the relatively low number of cases in the world’s fourth most populous country, and suggested there could be many more people with the illness. COVID-19 has killed more than 4,000 people and infected over 110,000 globally since it emerged last year. Police seized some 1.9 million facemasks from a warehouse outside Surabaya on Monday, after coronavirus sparked panic buying and sent prices for prevention products skyrocketing. Tags: ncov"

According to Acting Governor Ignacio Villa, he has met with concerned agencies and other stakeholders to tackle concerns and recommendations about the steps to be taken to deal with the coronavirus. It was in these deliberations that the provincial government decided not to impose any travel ban or restriction for the meantime. But according to the Provincial Information Desk, the provincial government will continue to make sure that it will be implementing mechanisms to protect the health of every Ivatan. It was also agreed upon that  a provincial task force on COVID-19 be created so that it could draft the procedures and protocols in handling cases related to the coronavirus disease. The provincial government also said it has established coordination among the Department of Health (DOH), Provincial Health Office, Batanese General Hospital, and all local government units to intensify information dissemination drives in local schools, offices, establishments, and to the general public. The provincial government also called on the  Ivatan public to observe proper hygiene, hand washing and proper coughing etiquette to prevent transmission of the coronavirus. It also advised the local community to postpone or to cancel travels to mainland Luzon and other areas currently affected by the disease. Tags: ncov"

The Grand Princess cruise ship carrying passengers who have tested positive for coronavirus docked at the Port of Oakland in Oakland, California, US March 9, 2020. (REUTERS/Kate Munsch / MANILA BULLETIN) The 2,400 passengers, who have been largely confined to their staterooms since Thursday, were to begin disembarking on Monday for transport to quarantine stations or hospitals, depending on whether they are well or need immediate medical attention. Except for those with acute illness, the 1,100 crew members are to remain aboard the Grand Princess, which will depart the Port of Oakland as soon as possible to be quarantined for two weeks in an as-yet-undisclosed location outside San Francisco Bay, officials said. Video footage shot by one of the arriving cruise guests and shared with Reuters showed jubilant passengers cheering from their stateroom balconies and open windows, some shouting, “We’re home!” as the vessel passed beneath the Golden Gate Bridge into the bay. Twenty-one people aboard the ship, mostly crew, tested positive on Friday for coronavirus, which causes the respiratory disease known as COVID-19, in an initial round of diagnostic screenings performed on about 45 people with symptoms. The remaining passengers are to be tested and monitored for signs and symptoms of the illness that can lead to pneumonia once they reach their designated quarantine sites. Denise Stoneham, 52, a Bay area resident on the cruise with her husband, seemed to take the ordeal in stride as she spoke to Reuters by Facetime while the ship glided into the port. “It hasn’t been too much of a hardship for us; it’s just been more of an inconvenience, I guess,” she said. “We’re just anxious to get home.” Princess Cruises, owner-operator of the ship, announced that passengers would receive a full refund for the price of the cruise, including air travel, hotel, ground transportation and pre-paid shore excursions. The company also offered patrons credit for a future cruise equal to the fare paid for the voyage. But at least one couple aboard the Grand Princess were seeking more than a refund. In what was believed to be the first civil case stemming from the cruise outbreak, Ronald and Eva Weissberger of Broward County, Florida, sued the cruise line for more than $1 million, saying they were traumatized by the fear of developing coronavirus. Parent company Carnival Corp (CCL.N), the world’s leading cruise operator, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Grand Princess was first denied entry to San Francisco Bay on Wednesday as it sailed back from Hawaii after state and local health authorities learned that some passengers and crew had developed flu-like symptoms, and that guests from an earlier cruise to Mexico aboard the same ship later tested positive for coronavirus. Health authorities have said at least two, including a California man who died, probably contracted the virus aboard the vessel. Since then, a total of 12 coronavirus cases have been linked to the previous Mexico trip. California Governor Gavin Newsom had insisted the current cruise be halted and the ship kept at sea until individuals aboard who were sick could be tested, and diagnostic kits were flown to the ocean liner by helicopter on Thursday. But it took federal, state and local authorities until Sunday to decide on a return-to-port strategy and quarantine plan for the ship, and to work out logistics of keeping the ship and everyone board isolated from the general public. The US Coast Guard flew medical teams to the vessel on Sunday to assess the health of passengers and crew ahead of their arrival. Under plans announced on Sunday, California residents were to go to two existing quarantine sites near Sacramento and San Diego. Out-of-state residents will be transported to two quarantine stations in Texas and Georgia. Newsom said on Sunday the government was arranging to repatriate foreign cruise passengers by charter flights to their home countries. He said they would be ferried on special buses to a non-commercial terminal at Oakland International Airport. The Port of Oakland, located across San Francisco Bay from the vessel’s home berth, was chosen because it was one of the few in the region able to accommodate a large cruise liner and was deemed relatively easy to seal off while passengers are unloaded and moved elsewhere, Newsom said. Princess Cruises also owns the Diamond Princess, which was quarantined off Japan in February and was for a time the largest cluster of coronavirus cases outside of China, where the outbreak originated. About 700 people aboard that ship became infected, and six have died. Tags: ncov"

On Monday morning, the Department of Health (DOH) disclosed that an 86-year-old American man with a travel history to the U.S.A. and South Korea was confined at TMC. A few hours later, TMC said another elderly patient who tested positive for COVID-19 has been confined at their facility. “All staff who had close contact with the patient have been accounted for, provided full healthcare support, and are currently undergoing a mandatory 14-day home quarantine,” TMC said in a statement. “We assure our patients and hospital visitors that safeguards are enforced to prevent the spread of the virus, and to ensure the safety of everyone—our patients, their companions and visitors, and our entire hospital staff.” Likewise, the hospital said it is ready to collaborate with its neighboring communities and other health institutions “to limit the number of cases.” “It is everyone’s responsibility to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 through the simple practice of personal protective measures such as hand hygiene, social distancing, and proper cough etiquette,” TMC said. Late Monday afternoon, the DOH updated its confirmed cases of COVID-19 and disclosed that a 72-year-old Filipino man with no history of travel abroad has been confined at the TMC. The patient is one of the 10 new cases of COVID-19 announced by the DOH that day, on top of the four new cases the department announced late Sunday night. Meanwhile, the TriCity Medical Center said a couple who tested positive for COVID-19 was admitted to their facility. The hospital management said in a statement that one of the patients has a travel history to Taiwan. According to the DOH, a 41-year-old Filipino man who recently traveled to Taiwan and a 46-year-old Filipino woman with no travel history were confined at the hospital. “We assured the public that TriCity Medical Center will continue to take all necessary measures to ensure the safety and care of all patients and healthcare workers,” the hospital management said.

(FACEBOOK / MANILA BULLETIN) In an interview, DepEd 11 Spokesperson Genielito Atillo said that, with the recent guidelines, they were not inclined to order the suspension of classes “because the situation does not merit (the action)”. “What we have from the DOH (Department of Health) is the raising of the alert system to Code Red Sublevel 1. What we need at least to have in order to suspend classes is code red scenario (Sublevel) 2,” he said. President Duterte announced the suspension of classes in all levels in Metro Manila from March 10 to 14 following an intera-gency meeting on the coronavirus outbreak as most of the confirmed recorded cases in the country were from the region (NCR). He said, however, the department was still monitoring the situation every now and then because their actions will be dependent on the future developments on “the problem of this COVID-19”. Meanwhile, the DepEd 11 official also confirmed that activities which have been given a go signal last month were also suspended. One of which was the Davao Regional Athletic Association (DAVRAA) meet which was scheduled on April 1 to 7, 2020 at Davao de Oro.

Atillo said the DepEd was hoping that the situation will normalize soon. “In the previous months, the situation seem to have settled down. Which is why we lifted some suspension of the declaration of cancellations but again, we are now doing it back because we have a worsening kind of situation,” he said. It can be recalled that the department had previously issued a memorandum suspending all national and regional activities, but was again lifted so long as the schools are compliant with the DOH’s issued guidelines in conducting activities gathering huge number of people. Atillo said the DepEd’s move and plans will all be dependent on how things will go in the later days with this issue of the local transmission of COVID-19. “I urge the public that what might we have announced today might change tomorrow, either for the good or not so good depending on the situation of COVID-19. While we are suspending or cancelling some activities today (March 10), we might lift the suspension or continue what we have cancelled. That will all depend as we go on with our monitoring on this COVID-19 scare,” he said. Tags: ncov"

Mayor Joy Belmonte (Mayor Joy Belmonte Official Facebook Page / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN) She issued the call after confirming that three of the country’s 24 confirmed cases of COVID-19 are from Quezon City. As of Tuesday afternoon, the Department of Health (DOH) has confirmed 11 more cases of COIVD-19, bring the total number of cases in the country to 35. Belmonte said city health officials are conducting intense contact tracing linking to the confirmed cases. Urging the public not to panic in the midst of the COVID-19 scare, Belmonte appealed to local residents to take all precautionary measures to prevent contacting the dreaded disease. The first patient from Quezon City is a man, 57, who lives on Baler Street and has been confined at a hospital. Belmonte said the first victim’s family has been quarantined at their home, saying that no members of his family were tested positive for the COVID-19 disease. Even if the first patient had not traveled abroad, it was confirmed that he had visitors from China, the United States, and Davao. On a positive note, Belmonte said it was actually good that the patient had not left his home for the past two weeks because he was feeling ill, saying it meant that he only met a few people.

A homemade sign and flowers from community members are seen near the entrance to the Life Care Center of Kirkland, the long-term care facility linked to several confirmed coronavirus cases in the state, in Kirkland, Washington, US March 9, 2020. (REUTERS/David Ryder / MANILA BULLETIN) The staff in question, representing more than a third of the Life Care Center’s 180 employees, are out sick with symptoms consistent with coronavirus, and a federal strike team of nurses and doctors is helping to care for 53 patients remaining in the center. With the facility in the Seattle suburb of Kirkland accounting for more than half of the known US coronavirus deaths, and all its patients tested, it was unclear why Life Care lacked diagnostic kits for staff, even as the University of Washington offered to process test samples for them. “We would like more kits to test employees,” Life Care Center spokesman Tim Killian told reporters, adding he did not know why they had not been forthcoming. “We’ve been asking the various government agencies that have been supplying us with test kits.” Twenty-six of 120 patients who were residing at the nursing home as of Feb. 19 have since died, with 13 of 15 autopsies carried conducted to date confirming coronavirus was the cause, Life Care officials said on Monday. Among 53 residents still in the facility as of Monday, results for 31 out of 35 tested have so far come back positive for the coronavirus, they said. The Seattle-King County Public Health agency on Monday reported three more Life Care residents had died from coronavirus infections at local hospitals in recent days, raising the statewide total to 22. But it was not immediately clear whether those fatalities were already included in Life Care’s own latest figures. Washington as a whole has documented 162 confirmed cases, one of the largest tally of any single US state. The nationwide number has surpassed 600. The outbreak has shown how quickly coronavirus can spread through elderly residents with weak immune systems and underlying health conditions living in close quarters. “We’ve had patients who, within an hour’s time, show no symptoms to going to acute symptoms and being transferred to the hospital,” Killian told a news conference on Sunday. “And we’ve had patients die relatively quickly under those circumstances.” Two other nursing homes in the greater Seattle area have reported that at least two residents and one staff member have the virus. Killian said he was not sure whether nurses who worked at Life Care Center Kirkland also worked shifts at other nursing homes in the Seattle area before the outbreak came to light over a week ago. The University of Washington School of Medicine said on Monday it could test all Life Care staff. The lab’s current testing is running at about 500 specimens a day, but it has capacity for over 1,000 tests a day. “We’re happy to perform testing if they can get samples and send them through the University of Washington Department of Laboratory Medicine,” said Alex Greninger, assistant director of UW Medicine Clinical Virology Laboratories. He did not know why Life Care had not received kits, but said a general reason why testing was not higher was a shortage of people to pick up specimens and bring them to his university lab.

This after President Duterte, in his speech declaring a State of Public Health Emergency on Monday, mentioned Santa Maria, Bulacan as among the areas with known cases of COVID-19. Bulacan PHO Chief Dra. Joy Gomez said they were unaware that there was any confirmed COVID-19 case in the municipality.

As of 12 noon of March 10, Davao City remains Covid-19 free after the two persons under investigation (PUI) have been tested negative at the isolation facility of the Southern Philippines Medical Center (SPMC),. (Keith Bacongco / MANILA BULLETIN) This came following President Duterte’s declaration of a public health emergency through an executive order on March 8, and the subsequent issuances of the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) and the Inter Agency Task Force, after the coronavirus infected more patients in the country. In a press statement Tuesday, the Kilusang Mayo Uno (KMU) bared that the daily wages and the worker’s job security “should not be affected” even with the adjustments measure that will be be imposed by companies. “Production is necessarily a social activity and concentrated in workplace. The guidelines set forth by the Inter-Agency are ambiguous and may be subject to abuse,” KMU said, pointing out the guidelines provided do not indicate clear measures on how secured are workers on their workplaces. “We urge all employers to guarantee the health and safety of workers from the virus at the factory floor,” said KMU in its statement. The government’s effort, it said, “is simply not enough and sorely lacking.” KMU also noted that it was also the responsibility of employers to provide emergency medical care and facilities for workers afflicted with the virus, and that the “flexible working hours’ being recommended by the DOLE must not affect the income and job security of workers, “as they need livelihood most in this time of crisis.” “We view that resolutions on social distancing which include alternative arrangement for workers remain vague, as long as there’s no commitment from companies and agencies for workers’ and health security,” KMU added. “Concern on business losses must include the losses incurred if workers would lose their livelihood. Sufficient funds should be allotted by employers and government institutions aside from the PhilHealth and SSS benefits which we all know are being siphoned off for private gains. Strict compliance on Occupational Health and Safety Law must be observed,” the KMU said. KMU also said that the workers health fund must be able to provide them with masks, screening, and other precautionary measures necessary for the prevention of the spread of the disease. The health fund, it added, should also cover proper quarantine measures and medical attention of the workers. “Daily wages during the 14-day mandatory quarantine of patients must not be charged from the sick leave benefits of workers,” the KMU said.

A soldier (R) wearing a face mask controls passengers arriving at the Milan Centrale railway station on March 9, 2020 as Italy is battling the world’s second-most deadly virus outbreak after China and has imposed a virtual lockdown on the north of the country. (Photo by Miguel MEDINA / AFP) The outbreak, combined with a crash in oil prices, has caused carnage on financial markets, erasing billions of dollars globally. The World Health Organization warned there is a “very real” threat of a pandemic, but its chief said the planet was “not at the mercy” of an illness that has killed more than 4,000 people so far. In China, where the virus emerged, the outbreak appeared to be coming under control, with authorities announcing just 17 deaths on Tuesday and the lowest number of new infections since reporting began in late January. But elsewhere, COVID-19 has been spreading rapidly, particularly in Italy, where more than 9,000 cases and 463 deaths have been reported. In a desperate bid to stem the spread, Italy’s Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte went on television to announce the entire country would effectively be placed on lockdown from Tuesday. “I am going to sign a decree that can be summarised as follows: I stay at home,” Conte said. “Travel must be avoided across the entire peninsula unless it is justified by professional reasons, by cases of need or for health reasons,” he told Italians. The measures extend a quarantine zone that Italy had imposed for its industrial northern heartland around Milan and Venice on Sunday. The national restrictions will run until April 3 and mean that schools and universities will all immediately close. Serie A football matches and all other sporting events are also being suspended for the coming month. But it was not immediately clear how the measures would be enforced. Trains and numerous flights continued to operate into and out of Milan on Monday despite the earlier set of restrictions for its Lombardy region. Since COVID-19 first emerged in China late last year, Italy has become Europe’s hardest-hit country. An AFP count showed the country had recorded more than half of the 862 deaths reported outside China as of Monday night. Worldwide more than 110,000 cases have been recorded in over 100 countries. It has disrupted global travel, cancelled sporting events and sent markets into meltdown. In Washington, President Donald Trump said he would propose “very substantial” economic measures to Congress on Tuesday, adding that the coronavirus has “blindsided the world.” However, some epidemiologists have accused the White House of a strategy concerned more with the political narrative than domestic readiness. Chief among the complaints has been the lack of testing caused by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) developing its own flawed kits. Uncertainty over the spread of the virus, coupled with a collapse in oil prices, created panic on the markets during what some dubbed “Black Monday,” with the Dow Jones index losing more than 2,000 points. There were signs of a slight recovery on Tuesday morning trade in Asia, with oil making back some of its losses. The run on stock market prices has robbed Trump of one of his main talking points ahead of the November presidential election. And there was further alarm after at least two Republican lawmakers who recently met with the president announced they were going into self-quarantine, fearing that they were exposed to the virus at a conservative conference. There are concerns that the United States could become another hotspot for the virus, with at least 26 deaths and 605 confirmed infections so far. On Monday, passengers were taken ashore from a cruise ship docked in California after at least 21 people on board were diagnosed with the virus. WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has warned that “the threat of a pandemic has become very real.” But he told reporters Monday that “even if we call it a pandemic, still we can contain it and control it. “It would be the first pandemic in history that can be controlled,” he said. “We are not at the mercy of the virus.” He said China appeared to be bringing the epidemic under control, but warned that “the disease has not run its course.” Tags: ncov"

(FACEBOOK / MANILA BULLETIN) This was announced by the provincial government, posted through DAVRAA-Davao de Oro 2020 official Facebook Page on Monday night. It stated the suspension came after the Department of Education (DepEd) released the Memorandum No. 34, series of 2020 or the “Fifth Set of Policy Directives of DepEd Task Force COVID-19.” The memorandum of postponement covers all regional activities involving learners and teachers requiring travel and congregation of various schools or divisions, including Regional Athletic Meets. The statement said that the suspension of the annual regional sporting meet will be indefinite, and remain suspended until further notice. DAVRAA 2000 was first supposed to be staged March 15 to 22 but was put off to April 1 to 7 until the provincial government postponed it anew. DepEd 11 Spokesperson Jenielito Atillo clarified that indefinite suspension does not mean cancellation of this year’s event. Atillo said the event will still be staged, but only after the situation on Covid-19 will be placed under control. “Primordial to us is the safety of all particularly the children,” he said. He said DepEd 11 salutes the efforts of the Province of Davao De Oro and its people hoping that this suspension will be lifted the soonest in order for the Province to showcase its Golden Moment. Last month, Davao de Oro Governor Jayvee Tyrone L.

Visayas reeled from P2.18-B lost revenues from aborted Chinese tourist arrivals,By Minerva BC Newman,"By Minerva BC Newman CEBU CITY – Central Visayas will most likely lose more than P2.18 billion in tourism receipts from arriving Chinese tourists alone in February 2020 due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).  (REUTERS/DEPARTMENT OF TOURISM/MANILA BULLETIN) This was disclosed by the Department of Tourism in Region 7 (DOT-7 as it noted that the spread of the coronavirus has resulted in travel bans and cancellation of travel plans. DOT-7 regional director Shalimar Hofer Tamano, in a media briefing over the weekend, said that foregone tourism revenues for February this year did not even include those cancelled travels from Korea, Japan and other countries to the various tourists’ destinations here in Central Visayas. “Remember that top tourist markets in Central Visayas in 2019 included the Koreans as our number 1 visitors at 1,579,189, followed by China and Japan tourists at 762,583 and 548,627, respectively, with Americans, 275,161; and Taiwan with 135,126 travelers,” Tamano said. Australians at 78,464; United Kingdom nationals at 64,860, and Germans at 59,786 composed the top eight countries that visited various tourism sites in the region last year, Tamano added. She noted that 2019 was a good year for tourism in the region because Central Visayas registered over P97 billion tourism revenues from the 5,116,084 domestic, and 4,308,226 foreign tourists that visited the region.
They had average daily expenses of P1,200 for domestic and P6,597 for foreign visitors, and stayed for an average of three nights in various tourism sites in Central Visayas. The P97-billion tourism revenue in the region last year did not even include the receipts from AirBnb and ESL activities here. “AirBnB and ESL visitors/tourists are long-term stay from one week to about three months and Cebu is the biggest center/hub for ESL in the Philippines,” Tamano added. He said that if we include the revenues from AirBnb and ESL contributions, receipts could have reached more than P100 billion from the tourism sector. According to Tamano Cebu controls about 79 percent of the region’s tourism pie in 2019, Bohol with 17 percent, while Negros Oriental and Siquijor accounted for two percent each in tourism for the region’s economy. Due to the COVID-19 outbreak room occupancy in Cebu dove down to about 23 percent for February, while Bohol experienced negative 35 percent compared to the same period last year, Tamano bared. Tamano revealed that because of the setback in the country’s tourism sector due to COVID-19 outbreak, DOT put in place sets of recovery programs shifting its paradigm to a more localized promotion of travel and tourists’ sites. “In Central Visayas, we had been holding series of meetings with various tourism industry stakeholders to find ways and mitigating measures to promote domestic tourism and we are looking at a budget of P61 million from the six billion pesos overall DOT masterplan budget,” Tamano bared.

DILG Secretary Eduardo Año (Philippine Information Agency / MANILA BULLETIN) The DILG issued the directive following President Duterte’s declaration of class suspension in the entire Metro Manila from March 10-14. “The President has directed all local officials in NCR from mayor down to punong barangays as well as all units of the Philippine National Police (PNP) to ensure that no children are seen loitering around and, if they are seen, they are to be immediately sent home to do their homework,” said DILG Secretary Eduardo M. Año. He appealed for the cooperation of all parents to discipline and closely supervise their children and ensure that they stay home and do their homework instead of going out to gallivant. “In the Task Force Meeting last night in Malacañang, the DepEd said it will give home assignments or performance tasks to all students so that they will have something productive to do during this period,” Año said. He explained that allowing students to roam in public places will defeat the very purpose of the class suspension which is preemptive social distancing to slow down the spread of the virus. “Our police officers and the barangay officials will serve as truant officers to ensure that kids stay at home. I have also directed all our Metro Manila Mayors to personally direct their respective Chiefs of Police to implement the presidential directive so that local governments and the police will jointly implement this policy of the government,” he added. He also instructed all Metro Manila LGUs to suspend or postpone all mass gatherings in the meantime as another pre-emptive social distancing measure. “I cannot overemphasize the role of the punong barangays in NCR. They have to be pro-active in their respective barangays,” he said. “We have no choice but to undertake these measures because public health demands it. Together with sustained hygiene (like regular hand washing, coughing etiquette, thermo scans and face masks), suspensions of classes, and mass gathering will enable us to defeat this virus faster,” he noted. He said the DILG and the LGUs will strictly enforce the home quarantine measures for those suspected of having contracted the virus. DILG Undersecretary and spokesman Jonathan Malaya said the decision to suspend classes and mass gatherings this week was recommended by the DOH Expert Advisory Group to the President as a pre-emptive social distancing measure to lower the number of people exposed to the virus, lower risk of transmission per contact, and to lower the average viral load. He explained that under Code Red Alert Sublevel 1, there is no need for a lock-down. “We are still at Sublevel 1 and this type of alert level does not require a lockdown but only enhanced hygiene and pre-emptive social distancing measures,” Malaya said. He added that these measures are applicable only in NCR. “There is no decision yet about other places in the country. That would be dependent on the findings and recommendations of the DOH,” he added. Malaya said all these measures were discussed during the meeting Monday night of the Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases presided by the President and attended by Metro Manila mayors. “We are now under a Public Health Emergency. All Filipino citizens, residents, and tourists should comply with the lawful directives and advisories of the DOH and other government agencies to ensure the safety and well-being of all,” he said.

A hospital personnel delivers oxygen tanks inside the isolation facility of the Southern Philippines Medical Center (SPMC), where persons under investigation due to suspected Covid-19 are admitted in Davao City. As of March 10 noon, the city remains Covid-19 free after the two PUIs have been tested negative. (Keith Bacongco / MANILA BULLETIN) “Result is negative for PUI (person under investigation),” Vega said in a text message. Department of Health (DOH)-Davao director Annabelle Yumang said the test swab was brought to RITM last Saturday for testing. She said the patient, a foreigner, would be discharged immediately. “The PUIs are being admitted and stringent precautions are undertaken. There is no time for complacency, measures have been undertaken as we are preparing for the worst and hoping for the best,” she added. According to Yumang, a patient is considered PUI when he manifests symptoms of the new coronavirus such as cough, fever, and difficulty of breathing; has traveled to restricted countries with a high number of COVID-19 cases; or had direct contact with patients positive for COVID-19. She said DOH-Davao previously recorded a total of 24 PUIs who have all been cleared. “We should be very clear that there is a risk that people might be incubating the virus, so we isolate and monitor them to protect the rest of the public. That is why, PUIs are being admitted and stringent precautions are being taken. This is no time for complacency,” she said. The Philippine government restricted travel to China, including Hong Kong and Macau, and South Korea, and imposed a selective travel ban to travelers from North Gyeongsang Province, including city of Daegu, the center of the COVID-19 outbreak in South Korea. Yumang did not disclose the nationality of the patient and his travel history, but said the country where he came from was not among the restricted countries. The patient arrived in the city last March 2. Vega added the SPMC was capable of handling PUIs, noting that the state-owned tertiary hospital was equipped with “depressurize” containment facility that can hold a maximum of 10 patients, materials, and trained personnel to take care of the patients. On Saturday, the DOH raised its alert system to Code Red after it confirmed another two cases of COVID-19, one of them with no known travel history abroad. Code Red is a “preemptive call to ensure national and local government and public and private healthcare providers can prepare for a possible increase in suspected and confirmed cases.” Yumang said the alert level was raised as a “pre-emptive call to ensure that national and local governments, public and private health care providers can prepare for the possible increase in suspected and confirmed cases.” She urged the public to avoid crowded places, and continue to practice “hygiene by frequently washing their hands with soap and water very frequently, practice proper coughing and sneezing etiquette and proper disposal of used tissue.” Tags: ncov"

Sen. Grace Poe(Senate of the Philippines / MANILA BULLETIN) Poe filed a resolution seeking to call on the Department of Health (DOH), in coordination with the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) and cellphone service providers to disseminate regular updates on the COVID-19. Poe said the public mobile alerts will help create awareness among the people on how to stop the spread of the disease. “The initial step to contain a virus is to make information on it viral through all available means. Improving the spread of information will help counter inaccurate reports and prevent mass hysteria,” Poe said on Tuesday. In Resolution No. 349, the chair of the Senate Committee on Public Services said mobile phone service providers are mandated under under Republic Act No. 10639, the Free Mobile Disaster Alerts Act, to send out alerts at regular intervals during calamities. She said this requirement should apply to the potentially deadly virus that has affected over 100 countries to date. “There is no doubt that COVID-19 is a disaster or a calamity under the applicable laws, especially after it was declared a health emergency by the WHO and the President, respectively,” Poe said. The text alerts, she proposed, should contain a regularly-updated summary of confirmed COVID-19 cases, the affected areas of recent cases for contact tracing, and a 24/7 hotline to the DOH to report suspected cases. These should also include relevant information on preventing the spread of COVID-19, its known symptoms, and when to seek medical attention. The number of confirmed coronavirus infections in the Philippines rose to 24, with President Duterte announcing on Monday night four more cases in addition to those earlier reported by health officials. The spike in the number of infections in a span of a few days prompted local governments to suspend classes, followed by President Duterte declaring a metro-wide suspension of classes from March 10 to March 14. Lawmakers have also appealed to companies and employers to allow workers to work from home under the Telecommuting Law. The President declared the COVID-19 outbreak as a public health emergency a day after the DOH confirmed the country’s first case of local transmission last Saturday. Tags: ncov"

Next to the robot, there are scenes crafted by the younger students showing various situations that require the washing of hands: an operating table in a hospital, a toilet and a flower garden. One year after the Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan in 2011, teachers at the Linyuan Elementary School decided the students should learn about the basic principals of robotics. The school is situated in an industrial area, dominated by the petrochemical sector. Teachers wanted to teach the children to be able to solve problems in their hometown in the future – such as fire, air pollution and gas explosions. Since then, the school has represented Taiwan in many international competitions abroad and won several prizes with its robotics club.

This, after the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) overruled his previous Executive Order (E.O.) No. 11, Series of 2020, banning the entry of any vessels from the said countries to any ports here.  Mayor Evelio Leonardia(GLAZYL MASCULINO / MANILA BULLETIN) In a letter dated March 6, DILG Secretary Eduardo Año said “the department acknowledges and commends your effort to stay true to your responsibility as the chief executive of the city to protect the health and welfare of your constituents.” However, Año also noted in his letter-directive to Leonardia that it contradicts the recent issuance of the Department of Health (DOH) Circular No. 2020-0034 dated February 4 entitled “guidelines at all seaports for prevention and spread of CoVid -19.” Año said that the outright ban of all cargo vessels under E.O. No. 11 does not also stand to the position of the DILG. Año said that Leonardia should adhere to the executive order in accordance with national government issuances. Thus, Leonardia said he issued E.O. No. 12, Series of 2020 on March 7, modifying E.O. No. 11 which he issued on February 26. “While we are concerned about the disease, we have left with no choice but to follow orders,” he said, adding that the DILG is a superior government agency that exercises supervisory powers and authority over local government units. Leonardia said that they added stricter guidelines on the new order to really protect the health and welfare of the public from the spread of CoVid-19, despite giving permission to cargo vessels from these CoVid-19 affected countries to dock here. In E.O. No. 12, Leonardia stated that no disembarkation of any crew of the subject vessels may be allowed at any time. The local chief executive also said that no embarkation or boarding of the subject vessels by any person shall be allowed at any time for whatever purpose. Duly authorized officials/personnel of the local or national government agencies performing functions to the business operation of the vessel or under special task in monitoring the health security and safety, harbor pilot and assisting personnel, cargo handlers, crane operators, and stevedores should be wearing personal protective equipment at all times and will be allowed to embark or board the vessel whether on anchorage or vessel-at-berth provided the quarantine clearance from the Bureau of Quarantine, the mayor also stated in the order. He said that the new order was issued with consultations from the concerned government agencies. Meanwhile, the MV Unicorn Bravo from Xiamen, China, which was earlier prohibited to dock at Bacolod Real Estate Development Corp. (Bredco) port, was able to unload its cargo here on Monday. Lt. Commander Jansen Benjamin, head of Philippine Coast Guard (PCG)-Negros Occidental, said the vessel loaded with 3.2 metric tons of fertilizer arrived at Bredco port on Sunday afternoon. Benjamin said that the vessel will stay at the port for three days to unload the cargo, adding that only one metric ton per day is allowed to be unloaded from any cargo vessel. The vessel was boarded by 15 Chinese and four Burmese, who were not allowed to disembark. He said they have not received any notice of arrival of any vessel from China to Bacolod, as of press time.   Tags: ncov"

This was after a total of 40 Filipino workers were displaced from their Hong Kong jobs, as of March 2, due to outbreak of the coronavirus. In a detailed report furnished by the POLO-OWWA, the contracts of 16 OFWs were terminated due to the decision of the employers to relocate to China, United States, Australia, and other countries. The other 12 cases of termination were due to the insistence of the OFWs to take their days off to attend church services, go to remittance centers, or attend to personal commitments, despite the prohibition of their employers for fear of contracting the virus. The remaining 12 OFWs were sacked from their jobs when they failed to return to their employers on time due to the imposition of travel ban, health condition, being quarantined for 14 days, passport and visa issues, and purposeful refusal to return to the employer. According to the POLO-OWWA, describing the occurrence of termination of employment contract initiated either by the employer or the OFW as a normal, regular incident in Hong Kong, the agency assured to help the OFWs in the computation of their salary, service and other benefit claims against the employers. POLO-OWWA said the workers with complaints on the availment of days-off were advised to file cases to the Labour Relations Division or Equal Opportunities Commission. Meanwhile, the terminated OFWs due to the employers’ relocation were assisted by the Hong Kong Immigration Department that will enable them to transfer to a new employer, process the new contract and work visa, while in Hong Kong. “However, some of the terminated OFWs issued with ID 522 opted to return home while waiting for their new job visas,” the POLO-OWWA said. OWWA Administrator Hans Leo Cacdac, on the other hand, said in his Twitter account that his agency will provide livelihood or employment assistance to displaced OFWs deciding to permanently come home. As of March 9, the OWWA has already released P87.4 million in cash assistance to 8,477 OFWs who were affected by the COVID 19-related temporary travel ban. Except for China, the travel ban of OFWs to Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan has been lifted since February 18. Tags: ncov"

Dapat laging handa,” Go reminded government.  Senator Christopher Lawrence “Bong” Go (MALACAÑANG PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN) In his statement in a public hearing of the committee on economic affairs held jointly with the committee on health and demography, Go said he and the President will meet the IATF to further discuss the government’s response to the COVID-19 situation following Duterte’s declaration of a State of Public Health Emergency. Sen. Go and the Department of Health (DOH) had earlier recommended such a declaration. “As Health committee chair, I am also invited to assess the situation. All hands on deck po ang lahat ng agencies sa situation ngayon,” Go said. Go also said he will ask DOH to give updates on the confirmed cases, contact tracing, and availability of testing kits. “Minsan, sa probinsya, ang tagal ipinapadala, ilang araw pa makakabalik. Ang problema doon, marami na ang maaaring mahawa sa tagal ng resulta, lalung lalo na sa Mindanao at Visayas.” (Sometimes, in the provinces, it takes days for the results to come back. The problem with that is meanwhile, many can catch the disease, especially in Mindanao and the Visayas.) He also advised that the availability of testing kits should be more dispersed throughout the country to allow more people to access them. “Dapat nakakalat ang ating testing kits at ‘yung pinakamabilis na paraan na makumpirma kaagad kung positive po ba. Mag-cause ng panic ‘yun kung matatagalan po ang resulta. Kindly check on that. I’m sure pag-uusapan ‘yun mamaya,” he said. (The testing kits should be spread across the country, and confirmation should be done quickly. A delay in the results will cause panic. Kindly check on that. I am sure that will be discussed later.) Safeguarding the economy from COVID-19 In 2019, more than half of Philippine exports to China were shipments of electronic parts. The current situation might cause a decline in exports, particularly in electronics, according to Go. “I call on the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) to work closely with the affected industries and provide assistance to them to ensure that their operations and businesses would not take a serious blow,” he added. As for workers who may be displaced by the health emergency, Go said that he will also ask the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) to provide assistance to these workers. Go has expressed his concerns over the possible impact of the disease on the country’s economy, particularly on the tourism sector. “According to the Asian Development Bank, in a worst-case scenario, the Philippines may lose US$1.9 billion due to declines in domestic demand, lower tourism, and business travel,” he said, sharing his experience in going to Aklan and witnessing firsthand the impact of COVID-19 on the tourism industry of the province. “Galing lang po ako sa Aklan, ang daming nawalan ng trabaho doon. ‘Yung flights, one-fourth na lang ang lumilipad. From 240 daily flights, naging 60 na lang po yata. Ang daming nagsaradong mga establishments po doon sa Boracay,” he said. Go added that the President plans to visit the province on Thursday to encourage local tourism. (I just came from Aklan, so many lost jobs there. Only one-fourth of the flights are flying. From 240 daily flights, it’s down to 60, I think. Many establishments in Boracay have closed.) Upon learning there will be a hearing in Congress tomorrow on the proposed supplemental budget to address the COVID-19 situation, Go expressed his support for allocating more resources if necessary. “Buhay ng Pilipino ang nakataya dito. Kung hindi man po ma-certify ng Department of Finance (DOF) ‘yung availability of funds, marami naman pong gustong tumulong,” he said. (Filipino lives are at stake here. If the DOF can’t certify the availability of funds, there are many who want to help.) Go added that he already talked to Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation (PAGCOR) Chairperson Andrea Domingo on the possible provision of additional budget. Proactive, whole-of-society approach In the hearing, Go also detailed how the declaration of a public health emergency can help the country combat the spread of the disease. “The declaration will allow for the utilization of local disaster funds, procurement of needed equipment, mandatory reporting, prepositioning of necessary logistics, mandatory quarantine and travel restrictions, among others. “The declaration also serves as basis for a possible price freeze under RA (Republic Act No.) 7581 or the Price Act. This will also expand the membership of the Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases to include other instrumentalities of the government,” the senator added. Go emphasized that the country needs “a whole-of-society and proactive approach in preventing the further spread of the virus in the country.” “All government agencies and LGUs must render full assistance and cooperation as well as mobilize the necessary resources to undertake critical, urgent, and appropriate response measures in a timely manner to curtail and eliminate the COVID-19 threat.” Go called on Filipinos to help the government in its fight against the disease. “Let me also take this opportunity to emphasize that defeating COVID-19 cannot be achieved by the government alone. “Preventing [the] further spread of the virus begins in us — in ourselves. We can do this by washing our hands frequently, observing proper cough etiquette, keeping ourselves healthy with plenty of sleep, [and] refraining from spreading and believing in fake news, among others,” he said. Go also urged the public to listen to guidelines issued by health authorities. “Makinig po tayo sa lahat ng mga alituntunin at tamang impormasyon na galing lamang sa ating mga otoridad. Iwasan din po natin ang mag-panic. Wala po itong maidudulot na mabuti at mas lalong pinapalala lang nito ang ating sitwasyon.” (Let us listen to the guidelines and correct information coming only from our authorities. Let us not panic. This will contribute nothing good and worsen our situation.) Commends health workers, calls for bayanihan Expressing his gratitude to the country’s frontliners and health workers in the face of the virus, Go expressed his optimism that the country can overcome the present public health concern with the spirit of bayanihan (collective cooperation) and unity. “Marami nang sakuna at kalamidad ang sumubok sa katatagan nating mga Pilipino. Ngunit nalagpasan natin ang lahat ng ito dahil nagtulungan tayo at nagtiwala tayo sa isa’t-isa. Kaya pairalin natin ngayon ang tunay na pagkakaisa at bayanihan,” he ended. (Many accidents and disasters have tested the fortitude of us Filipinos. But we will get past all these because we help and trust each other. So let us now show true unity and bayanihan.) Measures to protect President’s health Meanwhile, Go said doctors have advised the President to adopt serious precautionary measures to protect his own health. The Presidential Security Group has imposed a “no touch policy” to protect the President from the risk of the virus. Despite safety measures in place, Go insisted that this will not affect the President’s work. “Sinabihan kami ng doctor na huwag masyado lumabas at magpakita sa tao. Importante daw na wag i-expose ang Pangulo sa sakit,” Go said. (The doctor told us to avoid going out often and meeting people. It is important, they said, to prevent exposing the President to illness.) “Sabi ko, hindi naman po pwede iyon. Inihalal kami ng tao para magserbisyo. Hindi pwede na kami pa ang unang magtatago kasi mas matatakot ang tao. Pinasok namin ito, handa kami mamatay para magserbisyo sa kapwa namin Pilipino.” (I said, that’s not possible. We were elected by the people to serve. We can’t be the first to hide because that will alarm people. We went into this, and we are prepared to die to serve our fellow Filipinos.) Tags: ncov"

Singapore will allow the Costa Fortuna to dock after the cruise ship was turned away from ports in Thailand and Malaysia (AFP Photo/ROSLAN RAHMAN/MANILA BULLETIN) Costa Fortuna departed from Singapore, where it is home-ported, on March 3. Italian cruise line Costa Crociere said there were no suspected virus cases among its guests, which includes Italians. Italy has the largest number of cases of the virus outside China with 7,375 infections. The operator said the ship was not allowed to enter Penang port in Malaysia due to restrictions on Italian travellers and it was not allowed to stop in Thailand due to unspecified travel restrictions. “The decision was deemed necessary on the basis of the restrictive measures currently applied by ports included in the ship’s itinerary,” said Eunice Lee, a spokeswoman for the cruise line. However, the ship, which can carry up to 3,470 guests and 1,027 crew, did make a first stop in Langkawi, Malaysia last week, local media reported. Costa Crociere did not say how many people were onboard the ship. Another cruise due to depart from Singapore on March 10 would be cancelled, said the firm. All passengers entering Singapore would have to undergo temperature screening, while some may have to do a swab test for the virus, the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore and Singapore Tourism Board said in a joint statement. Singapore’s cruise terminals remain open to scheduled cruise calls out of Singapore. Unscheduled calls have not been allowed since Feb. 24, the authorities said. In recent weeks, journeys on other cruise ships have also been disrupted due to worries over the spread of the virus. MS Westerdam, operated by Carnival Corp’s Holland America Line, was allowed to dock in Cambodia’s Sihanoukville in mid-February having been turned away at five other ports after it set sail from Hong Kong on Feb. 1.

This developed after a husband and his wife, residents of a subdivision here, were considered as the fifth and sixth COVID-19 positive cases in the country. Using firetrucks to flash out pressured water and chlorine mixture as disinfectant, personnel of the Bureau of Fire Protection (BFP) and the General Services Office (GSO) of the local government went from one place to the other for a major cleanup as part of measures initiated by the local government to stop the transmission of the dreaded disease which has brought to 10 the number of persons afflicted in the country. Mayor Johnielle Keith Nieto has ordered the suspension of classes until Tuesday to allow the local authorities and school heads to conduct sanitation and clean-up procedures in their respective premises. A town-wide thermal screening of all residents was also being conducted in all the villages, including subdivisions since Sunday. Residents with fever were also beingescorted by local health workers to the People’s Center, a covered and permanent structure in front of the town hall, to undergo further medical examination. Nieto told The Manila Bulletin Monday afternoon that there were some residents who were brought to the People’s Center, but they were eventually sent home as doctors found out that those with fever had either urinary tract infection or simple colds. Surgical face masks, alcohols and disinfectant sprays, vitamin C tablets and syrups were also distributed to communities and schools as part of the preventive measures being undertaken by the municipal government here. A 62-year old male was the first case of local transmission of COVID-19 in the country and was the same person initially tagged by the Department of Health (DOH) as the person who frequented the Moslem prayer community in Greenhills in San Juan. His wife apparently got the virus from him. Nieto earlier said that the couple’s four children were still under home quarantine in their residence Food and other daily needs of these persons are being provided by the local government. Drivers of public utility vehicles (PUVs) entering the town or those with terminals in the municipality were being required to wear face mask as among the measures by the local government, to contain the spread of the dreaded virus.

Empty shelves are seen on the Pasta aisle inside a Tesco supermarket in Manchester, Britain, March 9, 2020. (REUTERS/Phil Noble/MANILA BULLETIN) As the worries about the coronavirus outbreak hammered markets, Prime Minister Boris Johnson was preparing to chair an emergency meeting at which more stringent measures to tackle the outbreak will be considered. The FTSE 100 .FTSE plunged to a three-year low after Saudi Arabia crashed the oil prices by slashing its own selling prices and raising output. Yields on benchmark British government bonds turned negative for the first time ever as panicked investors rushed to the safety of gilts to hedge against the feared economic shock of the coronavirus. The 2-year gilt yield GB2YT=RR last stood at -0.032%, down 12.6 basis points on the day.

The country’s biggest retailer, Tesco, has restricted bulk buying of products such as anti-bacterial gels and wipes, dried pasta and long-life milk. “The number of coronavirus cases continues to rise in the UK and around the world,” Johnson said. “We are well prepared and will continue to make decisions to protect the public based on the latest scientific advice.” The new coronavirus, which emerged in China in December, causes a disease called COVID-19.

The inter-agency task force is composed of the officials of the Baguio City Government, headed by the mayor, the BFFFI, Department of Health (DOH) Cordillera, Department of Education (DepEd) Cordillera, Baguio City Police Office and other concerned agencies and individuals. The task force convened Monday morning at the DOH Cordillera Training Center to assess the present situation and developments in relation to the COVID-19 infection in the country.

Concern Baguio folks raised calls for the cancellation of Panagbenga as they fear that the virus could enter the city as tourists with different travel histories and unknown medical backgrounds could be possible carriers of the virus. The possibility of transmission could become more possible in the heavily-attended events like the Grand Street Dancing and Grand Float Parade, which was supposed to be staged March 28 and 29 on Session Road.

Finding the right animal as a research model for the new and deadly coronavirus is crucial for learning how to treat it.  A baboon on the campus of Texas Biomedical Research Institute. One could show the way to a vaccine. (Source: Texas Biomedical Research Institute via Bloomberg / MANILA BULLETIN) The ideal subject is a non-human primate that shows similar symptoms: coughing, sneezing, fever and chest congestion. The hunt is on in the U.S., tightly coordinated among a small coalition of labs authorized to raise monkeys for research. High hopes are riding on a troop of Texas baboons. Covid-19 has infected at least 101,000 people and killed almost 3,500 since the world began keeping track in December, and academics, companies and governments are racing to arrest its rapid spread. Officials have said finding a therapy or vaccine could take months or years, and cost more than $1 billion. Animal experiments can discover how the virus functions and which treatments are most effective. “It’s the only way to understand it,” said Jean Patterson, a virologist at Texas BioMedical Research Institute, a private nonprofit in San Antonio devoted to eliminating infectious diseases. Study animals are scarce, so labs avoid duplicating efforts on the same species. The University of Wisconsin’s primate center is starting with marmosets. Rocky Mountain Laboratories in Montana is working with rhesus macaques. Then there is the unique colony of baboons at Texas BioMedical. After eight generations of breeding, they number near 1,000, housed in zoo-like cages and a 6-acre indoor/outdoor habitat on the research campus. It’s outfitted with swings, tunnels, rock features and toys to keep the animals occupied. Baby baboons are raised by their mothers in separate harems. Twelve veterinarians and nine animal behavior experts tend to them. No animals leave the premises, but the center’s researchers regularly partner on projects with colleagues elsewhere. Its animals were used to test Ebola medicines now being deployed in Africa. “Any scientist from around the world can call us,” said spokeswoman Lisa Cruz. For researchers hunting a coronavirus cure, the first, most difficult challenge is to find a creature that gets sick like humans do when infected. Labs launched a similar urgent effort for the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome outbreak in 2003, inoculating rhesus macaques, marmosets and howler, green and squirrel monkeys. None got consistently sick enough with human-like symptoms, Patterson said. Patterson first heard about the new virus spreading in China like anyone else — in December news reports. By mid-January, Texas BioMedical researchers were discussing how they could help. “It’s basically why we exist,” said Chief Executive Officer Larry Schlesinger. As an independent nonprofit, Texas BioMedical is a rarity in U.S. research, which is dominated by university and government labs. Established by a science-minded philanthropist in 1941, the center has a Biosafety Level 4 lab — required for working with lethal pathogens that have no cure — and three active BSL3 rated labs, which is the level required for the new virus. It gets 80% of its annual $60 million budget from the federal National Institutes of Health.
Critical role Animal studies are an essential — but fraught — part of scientists’ campaign against human disease. Labs are frequently targeted by animal-rights activists and the work can take an emotional toll on everyone who works with the primates, Cruz said. Federal law governs the research, mandating that primates be spared undue suffering and that veterinarians oversee all procedures. Scientists must consider the physical and psychological well-being of their charges. Detailed proposals laying out every experiment are reviewed by federal panels. One primary consideration: to make sure the fewest animals as possible are used to get meaningful data. “Animal research has played a critical role in virtually every medical advance over the last century,” said Matthew R. Bailey, president of the Foundation for Biomedical Research. Scientists can only get so much information from studying a virus in a petri dish, said John Schoggins, a researcher and microbiology professor at University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas. “You can’t recreate the disease in the dish,” said Schoggins, who uses mice to study mammals’ immune response to viruses such as influenza and zika. Only in animals can you answer the question, “How does this virus actually cause a disease in a living organism?” he said. Primates can tell researchers even more, since with 98% genetic similarity, they are closely related to humans. Texas BioMedical began breeding baboons on the western fringes of San Antonio in the 1950s. The center also has macaques and marmosets, whose frailty and shorter lives make them ideal for studying age-related disease such as arthritis. But baboons, which can grow as big as 75 pounds and live into their early 20s, are vulnerable to the same kind of “lifestyle” diseases experienced by humans, such as arteriosclerosis, osteoporosis and diabetes. Virologist Luis Giavedoni is leading the baboon project. He’s assembled a team of about 20 that comprises researchers, animal caretakers, veterinarians and a pulmonologist from a medical school. The lab hopes to get federal clearance to begin growing the virus by next week, and the animal studies would start by April, Giavedoni said. The colony manager will select baboons for the research — probably about 10 to start. They’ll be inoculated with a large dose of virus. While Covid-19 has had its deadliest impact on sick or elderly humans, the baboons will be young by necessity. Older baboons are too big to accommodate in the lab. The inoculated baboons will be closely monitored. Their body temperatures will be taken several times a day, and blood work will show whether the virus is multiplying. X-rays and CT scans will look for compromised lung function. If the baboons get sick as humans do, then medicines can be tried in the search for a therapy. The best outcome would be a monkey that gets pneumonia, just as the disease manifests in more severe form in humans. Even milder symptoms, or none, could be useful in understanding how the pathogen is transmitted, especially by asymptomatic people. Is the virus passed through urine, feces or semen, and if so, is it infectious at that point? A recent report that a family dog was found to carry the virus in Hong Kong raises the question of whether there could be other human-animal transmission. One critical question: How long is a person contagious? Testing has found virus levels can drop below detectable levels but surge again. And antibodies from the infected monkeys, even after recovery, could aid the search for a vaccine. There’s no guarantee an effective animal model will be found. The coronavirus could mutate, keeping scientists in catch-up mode. Or it could weaken and fade away before a model is perfected. But there will inevitably be another coronavirus, and researchers will have to respond again. If funding can be sustained, scientists could develop a more permanent solution, perhaps even a universal vaccine that could put the menace to rest. “We need to finish the job,” Schlesinger said.

(We appeal to our LGUs to be vigilant in the face of the new cases of COVID-19 in the country.) The neophyte lawmaker, who was a former Tagaytay mayor, said the full cooperation of LGUs with the national government is “crucial” in solving any crisis. He said LGUs should mobilize all of their concerned offices and barangays to effectively monitor and address possible cases of the disease in their areas. The Department of Health (DOH) reported Sunday night four more confirmed cases of COVID-19, bringing the total of coronavirus infections in the country to 10. Local governments then issued separate statements confirming the cases within their jurisdictions, saying they are now implementing precautionary measures to contain the disease. Others have also declared class suspensions in fear of COVID-19. Meanwhile, Tolentino urged the provision of an emergency stimulus financial package for the local tourism industry that is affected by the global coronavirus outbreak. He recently filed Senate Resolution No. 335 seeking a Senate inquiry into the need to assist the tourism sector. In the measure, he pointed out that micro, small, and medium enterprises, like tour operators, travel agencies, and small hotels, comprise 80 percent of the industry, “which may be able to survive” the tourism slump due to COVID-19. “There is a need to assist the tourism industry not just to support the affected establishments, employers, and employees to maintain the country’s economic growth, but also to ensure that safety measures are in place to prevent the spread of the virus,” the resolution read. “Before it becomes too late, the time to act is now.” Tags: ncov"

Duque said these hospitals must attend to the needs of the people, adding that only confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients with severe and critical condition will be moved to the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) and two other government hospitals.  Department of Health Secretary Francisco Duque III (Facebook) “All levels two and three hospitals are reminded to not refuse patients suspected or diagnosed with COVID–19,” he said in a Palace press briefing Monday. “Refusal to provide care to said patients shall be considered a violation of the signed Performance Commitment and shall be dealt with by PhilHealth accordingly,” he added. General hospitals are classified into three levels — Level 1 with minimum healthcare services, Level 2 that offer extra facilities like intensive care unit and specialist doctors, and Level 3 hospitals that have training programs for doctors, rehabilitation, and dialysis units, among others. Duque has recommended the establishment of a triage area in the emergency rooms of level 2 and 3 hospitals for screening suspected COVID–19 patients. “All levels 2 and 3 hospitals are directed to attend to all patients suspected to have the COVID-19 and those confirmed COVID-19 with mild symptoms,” he said. “Only confirmed COVID-19 patients that are severe and critical shall be referred to the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM), the San Lazaro Hospital, and Lung Center of the Philippines.” The health department earlier announced four new cases of the coronavirus in the country, bringing the total to 10. According to Duque, at least 80 percent of the coronavirus cases are “mild.” At least 41 patients under investigation are admitted to hospitals, he said. Duque said the health department will disclose the names of the hospitals after coordination to combat unverified or fake news. He also urged the public to visit a hospital if they feel any respiratory illness. “We would like to take this opportunity to reassure the public that our hospitals have infection prevention and control practices in place, so there is no need to avoid going to these hospitals especially if you feel unwell. For example, hospitals are already performing quarantine of their health workers, among others,” he said. He said people who visited places frequented by confirmed cases of COVID-19 are not required to seek medical consultation and subject themselves to testing. Instead, he advised these people to self-monitor their condition. “If with symptoms, consult health center or rural health units for appropriate management monitoring,” he said. Tags: ncov"
,"March 9, 2020, 4:21 PM",nCov,Expert says gov’t should implement social distancing to prevent COVID-19 spread,By Hanah Tabios,"By Hanah Tabios An infectious disease expert suggested Monday that government authorities must consider implementing drastic measures in order to contain the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the country.  Dr. Edsel Maurise Salvana(FACEBOOK / MANILA BULLETIN) In an interview aired over ANC Early Edition, Dr. Edsel Maurise Salvana, director of the Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology at the University of the Philippines-Manila, said social distancing measures include the temporary shutdown of schools, cancellation of crowd-attracting gatherings, as well as the closure of theaters and suspension of large-scale sports events “to stop the spread of COVID-19 sooner rather than later.” Although there is no enough evidence of sustained community transmission after the localized transmission of the virus in the country, he said the government must seriously consider some options in a short span of time. Community transmission is another form of viral transfer where infections within a population are not imported from another virus-hit area. “If you look at the four new cases that came, the two of them had travel and the two of them had epidemiologic case of confirmed cases. Then, at this time, we don’t really have good evidence of sustained community transmission and so we might have that small window where we can initiate social distancing measures that can hopefully help lessen the bulk [of infections],” he said. Salvana said the Chinese government had implemented the same measure in Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the epidemic. However, the implementation was late, so China had a hard time containing the virus where it originated. “For a country like ours where we have limited resources and our hospitals can have a problem if there’s a lot of cases, I think we really should think about applying these very early on so that we can flatten — in what we say in epidemiology — we can flatten the epidemiologic curve so the number of cases will not overwhelm,” he said. By doing this, Salvana said a smaller number of people will be affected by the virus. Meanwhile, the country’s education department has already announced the suspension of national and regional events involving students from different localities, such as the Palarong Pambansa 2020.

(JUN RYAN ARAÑAS / MANILA BULLETIN FILE PHOTO) “CBCP (Catholic Bishops’ Conference of the Philippines) can only recommend but final decision is up to the bishops,” he said in an interview. But in his diocese, Santos said they will not cancel masses. “We will continue with the tradition of procession, kumpisalang bayan, and parochial stations of the cross every Friday with street masses,” he said. But Santos said they have provided necessary precautions such as providing alcohol, extra covering cloth at the confession boxes, using face masks during confessions, spoken words of blessing instead of “pagmamano” and taking communion by one’s hand. He asked the faithful in his diocese to pray and turn to God at this time. “Always fold your hands in prayer. Turn to God, and trust Him. God is always in control of everything. Pray always our Diocesan prayer against coronavirus,” said Santos. The prelate also reminded the faithful to always wash their hands and observe proper hygiene. “Make use of handkerchiefs when sneezing, or coughing,” Santos said. “As much as possible, avoid handshake, or kissing of hands. Spoken words of “God bless you’ are more than enough instead of ‘Mano po.’ Bowing, kind gestures are also signs of respect,” he added. The health department raised the COVID-19 Alert System to Code Red Sublevel 1 over the weekend after a local transmission was declared. DOH Secretary Francisco Duque III has said that the declaration of Code Red Sublevel 1 is actually a preemptive move to ensure that national and local governments as well as public and private health care providers can prepare for possible increase in suspected and confirmed cases.

Epping Boys High School, the site of Australia’s first ordered school closure after a 16-year-old pupil tested positive for the coronavirus, is pictured in Sydney, Australia, March 6, 2020. (REUTERS/Jaimi Joy / MANILA BULLETIN) Australia has seen a worrying increase in coronavirus cases in the past couple of days, though Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy said the majority were travelers who caught the virus abroad, with only one instance of community transmission. Two year-10 students at Sydney’s St Patrick’s Marist College Dundas had tested positive for the virus while a year-7 pupil tested positive at the Willoughby Girls High School. “This is likely to be the new norm,” said Brad Hazzard the minister of health for New South Wales state. The school closures come days after another high school in Sydney shut down when a 16-year-old there tested positive. Epping Boys High School reopened on Monday though nearly 70 students and staff who had close contact with the infected student remained in self-isolation. The coronavirus has infected 107,000 people around the world in an ever-growing list of countries and caused hefty economic damage, prompting central banks to ease monetary policies. Three people have died in Australia. “This is a public health emergency of an unprecedented nature that our nation and that the entire global community is facing,” the health minister of Victoria state, Jenny Mikakos, told a televised briefing. Her state also recorded a jump in the number of cases after two people who recently arrived from the United States and one who returned from Iran were diagnosed as infected with the virus. “We do anticipate that this likely pandemic will have significant impacts on our health system. This has been my absolute focus, making sure that our system is prepared to respond,” Mikakos said. Worries about the hit to the economy saw nearly A$108 billion ($70.5 billion) wiped off Australian shares in yet another day of panic selling in global financial markets. FISCAL RE-THINK? The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) last week became the first in the developed world to ease monetary policy to fight the economic fallout. The government is finalizing a fiscal stimulus package though the size of the measure is not known. An announcement on the likely A$10 billion package is expected this week, media reported. Economists are less optimistic about the scale of the stimulus. Citi economist Josh Williamson expects an initial package of A$3 billion to A$5 billion, or about 0.1% of Australia’s gross domestic product. “Such a package would be designed to offset the expected loss of output, rather than deliver a material boost to activity that closes the negative output gap that existed prior to COVID-19,” he added, referring to the illness caused by the virus. “If the broader economy is impacted more severely than currently assumed, then the government could be forced to rethink its fiscal strategy in May, that is, abandon hopes of a near-term budget surplus and bring forward other stimulatory measures.” Tags: ncov"

The premier said his coalition government was studying various initiatives, without giving further details, and that between today and tomorrow he would meet representatives of the opposition to discuss the new economic measures. Rome on Sunday approved unprecedented quarantine measures with a virtual lockdown across most of its wealthy north, including the financial capital Milan, in a drastic new attempt to rein in an outbreak of the illness. So far Italy has been hit harder by the crisis than anywhere else in Europe, with the number of deaths leaping sharply again to 366 and the total amount of cases jumping by 25% to 7,375. Economy Minister Roberto Gualtieri last week pledged some 7.5 billion euros ($8.55 billion) in measures to help the economy withstand the effects of the epidemic, raising this year’s budget deficit goal to 2.5% of national output from its current 2.2%. The European Commission told Italy on Saturday that its planned extra spending in response to the coronavirus would not be counted in considering its compliance with European Union budget rules. EU rules allow a temporary deviation from the deficit goals in case of exceptional events, including severe economic recession and major natural disasters.

Department of Health Secretary Dr. Francisco Duque III(PCOO / MANILA BULLETIN) Health Secretary Francisco Duque III made the statement after Albay 2nd district Rep. Joey Salceda proposed that Metro Manila should be locked down to slow down the transmission of the disease. In a press briefing in Malacañang, Duque said their protocol suggests that it is not yet the time to place Metro Manila on lockdown. “The protocol, in fact, includes that it might be premature to do it at this point. So we will have to wait until evidence of sustained community transmission is presented,” he said Monday. According to Salceda, classes should be suspended in the National Capital Region (NCR), because Metro Manila was were all the COVID-19 cases are. He added that work should be stopped for one week, no bus trips, no domestic flights, and no grand staycations. He likewise proposed the closure of the North Luzon and South Luzon expressways (NLEX and SLEX) and railways; and that food, medicines, and health professionals are the only ones that should be allowed to enter Metro Manila during the temporary entry ban. “A lockdown of NCR should not be off the table if needed to slow down the transmission of COVID-19,” Salceda said. “The costs of mass community transmission far outweigh the economic losses arising from preemptive actions. Zero casualty doctrine should extend to all emergencies, especially health emergencies.” Measures In the press briefing in Malacañang, Duque said it was up to the local government units to suspend classes and work and their decision regarding the matter should be followed and requested. He added there was also an option to ensure that there was augmentation or preparedness on the part of unaffected regions and local governments. He said they can also tap the military and the police to complement the efforts of local chief executives and local health officials in the affected communities. “These are some of the options being considered. But it might be premature at this point,” Duque said. “However, let me just reiterate, that we have to respect the local chief executives’ decision to suspend classes and that must be followed by all concerned.” Meanwhile, Duque said he would personally, on behalf of the Philippine government, request Chinese Ambassador to the Philippines Huang Xilian to provide as many as testing kits as they can to the Philippines. “This would be very good, provided that there’s going to be the WHO (World Health Organization) experts [who] will validate the effectiveness of such a testing kit. There’s very little or limited knowledge we know about the testing kits being used by China, South Korea,” he said. The Health Secretary said it was important to validate the effectiveness of the testing kits because it would be a “scary” to have false negatives. “You say a person is negative, ‘yun pala (but he’s really) positive.

Currently, cases of COVID-19 are confirmed in some parts of the National Capital Region (NCR) particularly Taguig City and San Juan City. “All division and district activities that involve the gathering/congregation of various schools in all other cities and municipalities are highly discouraged,” DepEd said. “Organizers are advised to seek the recommendation of local health authorities should the activities push through,” it added. Likewise, DepEd said that “all off-campus activities are suspended effective immediately.” Heightened precaution Meanwhile, DepEd clarified that activities involving congregation of learners “within the school may proceed” – provided that all personnel and learners exhibiting respiratory infections “must not attend” and that the applicable guidelines are “strictly observed.” “Personnel and learners exhibiting respiratory infections shall be referred to appropriate health personnel for proper evaluation and/or referral to a hospital if needed,” DepEd explained. As part of initiatives on COVID-19, DepEd also reminded all of its personnel and learners to “use and share only verified and up-to-date information from reliable and official sources” such as the World Health Organization (WHO), the DOH, DepEd, and other concerned government agencies. “All DepEd schools and offices are instructed to share only from these sources when disseminating information on social media and other platforms,” Briones said in the latest COVID-19 directives. As of March 8, Sunday, DOH reported that there are 10 confirmed COVID-19 cases in the Philippines. Tags: ncov"
,"March 9, 2020, 3:01 PM",nCov,WHO: Summer season won’t kill coronavirus,By Argyll Cyrus Geducos,"By Argyll Cyrus Geducos The World Health Organization (WHO) debunked the popular belief that the forthcoming summer season in the Philippines will kill the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), saying there was no evidence to back such claim.  Dr. Rabindra Abeyasinghe (WHO Philippines official facebook page/ MANILA BULLETIN FILE PHOTO) In a press briefing in Malacañang, WHO representative in the Philippines Dr. Rabindra Abeyasinghe said SARS-CoV 2 is not similar to the SARS-CoV identified in 2003 that disappeared with the increase in ambient temperatures. “What we have seen more recently is not supportive of that. We are seeing continuing transmission in very tropical countries like Singapore, Malaysia. And so, the evidence we have at this point is not supportive,” he said. However, he said that while the longevity of the virus in warmer countries with high humidity was less compared to cold temperatures and low humid circumstances, there were still other factors that can contribute to an increase in the transmission. “This could work in favor of lower levels of transmissions, but there are other factors such as overcrowding that could work negatively and contribute to increase transmission,” Abeyasinghe said. “So the actual outcome will depend on each country’s situation.” Health Secretary Francisco Duque III likewise said it would be better if claims that the virus will die in high temperatures were true. “Sana po totoo (I wish it were true). If that is true, then we should rejoice that summer is just around the corner. It will mean more sweats, more perspiration, but we don’t mind. The trade-off is well worth it,” he said. “Ang masasabi lang po natin (What we can say) from the literature, from the journals that we read, that the virus is very difficult to inactivate when the temperature is low and when the humidity is dry. When there are low humidity and low temperature, it’s very difficult to neutralize the virus,” he added. The Philippines is under a State of Public Health Emergency following the confirmation of local transmission of COVID-19. The Department of Health (DOH) has raised the country’s COVID-19 alert system to Code Red Sublevel 1, a “preemptive call” to ensure that the entire government and its agents, along with its healthcare providers, can prepare for possible COVID-19 upticks.

According to the agency’s official statement, the Filipino tourist, who came to the island-province, was a nurse at one of the hospitals in Singapore from which she traveled and arrived in the Philippines on February 26. Given the situation, the authority added, the tourist not need be quarantined because, aside from being asymptomatic, she was not exposed to the disease because she did not provide direct care to any COVID-19 patient in the hospital. Moreover, the health authorities also cited that Singapore was currently not among the countries that have been issued with travel ban and restrictions as determined by the Inter-Agency Task Force on COVID-19. The statement came after the presence of the group of tourists that visited Batanes reportedly caused concerns as some residents even claimed that the disease may have already reached their province. But the DOH was quick to assure the public that the government was “proactively handling the urgent concern and continuously working to protect the people of Cagayan Valley from a possible infection brought about by the COVID-19.” Tags: ncov"

Under the advisory,  travelers, including local residents and persons with official business to conduct in the area who are symptomatic, with travel history to any of the countries affected by COVID-19 within the past 14 days, or may have been exposed to the disease, shall be considered as person under investigation (PUI) and will not be allowed to enter the municipality until cleared and discharged by admitting hospital or quarantined facility. Those who are asymptomatic but have  travel history in countries afflicted by the disease in the last 14 days or have had an exposure to a confirmed case shall be automatically considered persons under monitoring (PUM), and will be advised to undergo self-quarantine for 14 days before travelling to Itbayat. On the other hand, travelers with official business to conduct who have been determined as non-PUI or non-PUM by the authorities in Basco airport and seaport will be allowed to proceed provided there is prior coordination with the Office of the Municipal Mayor. Local residents who are non-PUI and non-PUM will be allowed to proceed even without medical certification from the Provincial Health Office, but will subject to screening and recording upon their arrival in said area. Crews of cargo ships plying the Manila-Basvo-Itbayat route to deliver commodities and aggregates will be allowed entry subject to screening at their port of entry in Basco or Itbayat. Travelers solely for tourism are temporarily not allowed to enter the area until further notice from the local government unit. This travel ban and restrictions came due to limited health facilities in the area after the destruction of 5.9-earthquake in Itbayat last July 2019 killing nine local residents and destroying most of the infrastructure in the municipality. Currently, Itbayat, Batanes is the only area in the Philippines that imposes travel ban amidst the threat of  COVID-19 in the country. Tags: ncov"

Gov.  Amado Espino III said, in an ambush interview at the Capitol Resort Hotel, that the province was now facing an emergency situation when reports came out that a Filipino-Australian had tested positive for the coronavirus after attending a high school reunion in Dagupan City. He also denied that the venue of the reunion was the Sison Auditorium because the provincial government has long disallowed the use of its facilities. As of Monday, the Department of Health Region 1 (DOH 1) Director Valeriano Jesus Lopez said no one among the 250 persons under monitoring (PUMs) was showing any sign of COVID-19. On Sunday night,  Mayor Leopoldo Bataoil said proper contact tracing was being established to determine where a Fil-Australian may have contracted the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) who visited the province. In a statement, Bataoil said “with reference to the recent news of a kababayan from Australia who attended a wedding in Manila, a high school reunion and other activities in Pangasinan in mid-Feb and reported positive of COVID-19 on her return to Australia last March 2, 2020, coordination is being done with appropriate agencies for proper contact tracing. ” Likewise, Bataoil said the Lingayen local government has been conducting measures since reports of the coronavirus outbreak started late 2019. Bataoil noted that in the market, and municipal hall, as well as in public gatherings, they have instituted thermal monitoring, and ( cleansing, and encouraged the use of facemasks, among others. The mayor also urged the public to continue observing all the prescribed measures, and refrain from posting and spreading unverified reports to avoid panic and pray for everyone. It has been three weeks since the provincial government started to postpone public events and temporarily closed public facilities. Tags: ncov"

Navotas Mayor Toby Tiangco (NAVOTAS PIO/ MANILA BULLETIN) During the weekly flag ceremony at Navotas City Hall, Tiangco said that he announced the suspension of classes as early as Saturday to be on the “safe side.” “Wala namang perpekto sa desisyon na ito. Ang sinasabi ko lang, alin ba ang mas mabuti,” he said.  (There’s no perfect decision. But what I want to say is, which is better) “Hindi ko naman sinasabi na ‘pag di ka papasok, di ka mahahawa. Kaya lang nakikita natin yung classroom, dikit dikit yung mga estudyante,” he added. (I’m not saying that if you don’t go to school, you won’t get infected. But if you see the situation of students inside their classrooms, they’re close to each other) Cases of COVID-19 in the country rose to 10 on Sunday evening. Tiangco said that he does not want to just suspend classes when it is already late. “[Kunware] papapasukin ‘yung mga estudyante, at kung meron lang isang magkaroon doon, saka pa ba tayo magkakansela ng klase, matapos ma-expose na yung kaklase nya doon sa classroom?” he asked. (Would you only suspend classes if one student already tests positive and his classmates get exposed to him?) “Mas gusto ko na doon  tayo sa safe side,” he added. (I prefer to be on the safe side) Tiangco received various reactions from social media users when he was the first Metro Manila mayor to suspend classes after the Health department confirmed the first locally-transmitted COVID-19 case in the country. One social media user sarcastically said: “Navotas suspends classes on Monday, because Covid will disappear for sure by Tuesday.” But when asked why classes were suspended only for Monday, the Navotas public information office said, “further decisions will be made on a day to day basis.” ‘Pass students automatically’ Shortly after he declared the suspension, Tiangco also called on the Department of Education (DepEd) to just automatically pass the students for school year 2019-2020. “I urge DepEd to automatically grant passing grades to all students so they do not have to attend classes anymore. We must take all necessary precautions to protect our people, especially our children, from this disease,” he said. But he made clear that: “Ang aking gustong ipropose sa DepEd ay mass promotion. Ang ibig sabihin ng mass promotion kung anong standing o general average ng bata ngayon, ‘yun nalang ang magiging grado.” (What I want to propose to DepEd is mass promotion. This means, students will be given a grade based on their current standing or general average) With only 10 school days left for Navotas students, the mayor said that he would be meeting with the city school superintendents and principals to seek for their suggestions on what to do with the remaining days. “Kaya nga kami magmemeeting ngayon at ako’y susulat ng pormal sa DepEd kung sakaling payagan,” he said. (That is why we will be meeting today. And I will write a letter to DepEd if they could allow us to suspend the remaining days of classes and give students passing grades) “[Pero kung hindi] wala tayong magagawa kung hindi papasukin na rin yung mga bata,” Tiango added.

PCOO Secretary Martin Andanar made the commitment of round-the-clock work after Senator Nancy Binay took a swipe at the department when she said that the PCOO should focus on the anti-coronavirus information campaign than embark on foreign travels.  Presidential Communications Secretary Martin Andanar (PCOO / FACEBOOK / MANILA BULLETIN) “We will continue to be the lead communications arm of the government which has been at the forefront in delivering timely, accurate, and reliable information about the COVID-2019,” Andanar said during a Palace press briefing Monday. Andanar recognized that much work needs to be done to further enhance the public information drive especially after health authorities raised the alert level on the coronavirus. “We do not work in a vacuum. Challenges continue to mount. While we have exerted a lot of man-hours and resources in information production and dissemination, much more needs to be done in reaching out to the rest of our people, especially now that we are in Code Red,” he said. “Rest assured that we will give a strong and united message, in coordination with IATF (inter-agency task force) members, and ensure to double if not multiply our interventions for the needed information of the public,” he added. He said even before the country’s first local COVID case, the PCOO in coordination with concerned agencies have been “working round the clock 24/7 in providing regular updates disseminated across all media, such as television, radio, print, digital and on-ground, with Laging Handa as our dedicated platform for COVID-2019.” Andanar said he respects Binay’s pronouncement and intends to submit a report on the department’s efforts to spread information in combating the disease. “With regard to the comment of Senator Binay, that’s the vibrancy of democracy but we assure the good senator that the PCOO is coordinating with the IATF (inter-agency task force) members since day one and we will forward a departmental report to the office of the senator,” he said. Binay earlier called on the PCOO to get its priorities straight by stepping up the information drive on dealing with the latest public health emergency. She said the PCOO should not waste time on its road shows in Europe, citing the need to give focus on the country’s current needs. Andanar earlier led a PCOO team in traveling to several countries in Europe to defend the country’s human rights record and dispel the alleged false information about the war on drugs. The Palace also spoke before the United Nations Human Rights Council to highlight the government’s commitment to media freedom and human rights. Andanar, on Monday, gave a rundown of the PCOO’s information materials on the coronavirus disease in recent weeks. He noted that it was President Duterte who ordered that the regular updates, news and public service announcements on the coronavirus be aired on government broadcast stations, print, and online platforms. “From the latter weeks of January to February 29, 2020, the PCOO has made approximately 70 informational videos, more than five radio plugs, more than 1,250 social cards and approximately 20 infographics on the COVID-2019,” he said. He said they also provided more than 750 online news articles, more than 400 broadcast news items, close to 30 print articles, more than 500 situational reports, more than 450 text blasts, more than 280 news tweets, more than 70 radio live interviews, approximately 350 flyers in English and 350 flyers in Filipino about the coronavirus. He said PCOO’s on-ground events included five Laging Handa press briefings in Malacañang, more than 25 regional and provincial press briefings, close to 15 TV and radio guestings and kapihans, 44 regional inter-agency meetings, and 1 strategic communication workshop for key departments and agencies. “These, among others, we have done not including our action items for the month of  March,” he said.

Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe listens to IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi at the prime minister’s official residence in Tokyo, Japan, February 25, 2020. (Kimimasa Mayama/Pool via REUTERS / File photo / MANILA BULLETIN) In perhaps his biggest test since returning to office in 2012, Japan’s longest-serving premier has come under fire for what critics have called an initial lack of leadership, followed by abrupt steps like school closures that left parents and employers scrambling. Japan more than 1,000 cases of the virus including about 700 from a cruise ship quarantined near Tokyo last month. Fourteen people have died, including seven from the liner. The virus has spread rapidly around the world, with more than 100,000 confirmed cases and 3,600 deaths. Among criticisms is that Abe’s government was too slow to put curbs on visitors from China – a key source of economic growth – after the outbreak originated there late last year. In a recent opinion poll, 50% said they didn’t approve of Abe’s handling of the outbreak, versus 37% who said they did. Commentators have also said Japan has lacked sufficient capacity to test for the virus, while failing to mobilize what capacity it has, leading to suspicions that the virus is spreading faster than data show. Vigorous testing programs in countries like South Korea have detected high numbers of infections. Speculation – denied by organizers – is swirling that the global outbreak will scupper Japan’s dream of hosting the Tokyo Olympics, an outcome that could become more likely if a state of emergency is declared. “I want the Olympics to succeed more than anyone, but the negative factors are increasing,” Yoichi Masuzoe, a former Tokyo governor who was health minister during a 2009 influenza epidemic, told Reuters. In its latest move, the government plans on Tuesday to submit to parliament a bill to revise a 2012 law, enacted after the 2009 epidemic, so it can be applied to the coronavirus if necessary. Parliament is expected to sign off on Friday. The 2012 law was enacted while Abe’s Liberal Democratic Party was in opposition. Officials have said it could not be applied to the coronavirus without changes, although opposition parties and other critics say reinterpreting it is enough. The law would let the prime minister declare an official state of emergency if the disease poses a “grave danger” to lives and if its rapid spread could have a huge impact on the economy. The impact of the virus outbreak is already increasing Japan’s risk of recession. Governors in hard-hit regions could then ask residents to stay inside, close public facilities, expropriate land and buildings for medical facilities and request or order emergency transport of goods. The state of emergency could last up to two years with a possible one year-extension. In the virus-hit northern island of Hokkaido, the governor declared a state of emergency late last month, although he acknowledged there was no legal basis to do so. Abe has already requested that schools nationwide close and large-scale events be pared back or canceled. “Abe could apply the law by re-interpreting it. He’s good at that,” said Masahiro Kami, head of the Medical Governance Research Institute and a critic of the government’s response. Abe’s government in 2014 controversially reinterpreted the post-war, pacifist constitution to let troops fight abroad. “He wants to appeal (to the public) because things are not going well,” Kami said. He added the most urgent issue was not further limits on public activities, but beefing up virus testing and early treatment of elderly and other high-risk patients. Abe has not made clear what exactly would trigger a state of emergency, repeating on Monday that the revision was to prepare for a “worst-case scenario”. That has left some analysts thinking he is reluctant to do so for fear of scuppering the Olympics. “I suspect Abe doesn’t want to declare a state of emergency because it would be killing the Olympics himself,” said Koichi Nakano, political science professor at Sophia University.

Germany has scrapped several huge fairs over virus fears (AFP Photo/John MACDOUGALL) As the number of cases in Germany pushed beyond 900, Health Minister Jens Spahn said gatherings of more than 1,000 people should be scrapped. “After many discussions with those responsible, I emphatically encourage the cancellation of events with more than 1,000 participants until further notice,” he wrote on Twitter. Acknowledging the financial hit to organizers of such events in Europe’s biggest economy, Spahn said the government would help cushion the blow. But he also appealed to individuals to “consider what is so important in your daily life that you cannot miss in the next two to three months — be it a visit to the club, a birthday party among family members or an association meeting.” Germany has over the last week scrapped several huge fairs, including Berlin’s travel fest ITB, industrial show Hannover Messe and the Leipzig book fair. But Spahn’s latest recommendation could lead to the postponement of many more events, including Bundesliga football matches and rock concerts. German Football League chief Christian Seifert warned however that “the season must end by mid-May” in order for promotion and relegation clubs to be determined and to give participants in international competitions time to prepare. With measures taken to halt the virus hitting the economy hard, leaders of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s right-left coalition agreed on new aid measures after late-night talks. The coalition “is taking action in the corona-crisis. Besides medical protection measures, we have agreed on a big aid package for the German economy,” tweeted Markus Soeder, leader of Merkel’s Bavarian allies CSU, calling the package “comprehensive”. Rules governing compensation for workers forced to cut working hours because of the crisis will be eased, said the government in a statement after late-night talks. The relaxed criteria will apply from April and will be valid up to the end of the year. Berlin also pledged to draw up proposals on offering liquidity support for companies hardest hit by the impact of the outbreak. Talks with key representatives of the German economy as well as trade unions will be held shortly on the proposals. Separately, the government said it will also boost investments by 3.1 billion euros per year between 2021 and 2024. The total hike in investments totalling 12.4 billion euros will be entirely funded by 2019’s budget surplus. Tags: ncov"

A woman gestures from the Grand Princess cruise ship, being held off the coast of San Francisco after 21 people on board tested positive for the new coronavirus (AFP Photo/Josh Edelson / MANILA BULLETIN) The surge came as President Donald Trump defended his administration’s “perfectly coordinated” response to the epidemic, after heavy criticism over health cuts and strategic blunders that have failed to stem its rapid spread. Some 30 US states have been hit by the novel coronavirus, with Oregon the latest to declare an emergency, and 60 million people in California and New York are under crisis measures. Two more deaths linked to a virus-hit care home near Seattle were reported Sunday, bringing the nationwide toll to at least 21. A Johns Hopkins tally put the number of confirmed US cases at 554 by Sunday evening, with newly diagnosed patients in states including Pennsylvania, Illinois, Massachusetts, Connecticut and New Jersey. Medical officers headed for a virus-hit cruise ship stranded off San Francisco to begin screening passengers for an “unprecedented and difficult” landing operation. The Grand Princess, with 21 confirmed coronavirus infections among 3,500 people on board, is due to dock in nearby Oakland Monday. The operation to move passengers ashore will take two to three days, said Governor Gavin Newsom. Carolyn Wright, a passenger on the ship, told AFP that people without symptoms were allowed to leave their cabins for the first time since Thursday. Once ashore, ill passengers will be moved to hospitals, while Americans not requiring treatment will be quarantined at military bases in California, Texas and Georgia for 14 days. Foreign passengers will be repatriated, while crew will remain quarantined on board. The State Department warned vulnerable people including the elderly “should not travel by cruise ship.” Several public events have been canceled across the US in an effort to contain the epidemic. The ATP and WTA tennis tournament in Indian Wells was called off on Sunday just days before it was due to begin. Officials said they opted to cancel after the health department of California’s Riverside County declared a public health emergency for the Coachella Valley — in the desert east of Los Angeles — after a confirmed case of COVID-19 locally. The tournament is one of the biggest outside the four Grand Slams and draws more than 400,000 fans each year. Trump has defended his record after accusations he peddled misinformation on the outbreak, blaming the media for trying to make his government “look bad.” “We have a perfectly coordinated and fine tuned plan at the White House for our attack on CoronaVirus,” he tweeted. “We moved VERY early to close borders to certain areas, which was a Godsend. V.P. is doing a great job. The Fake News Media is doing everything possible to make us look bad. Sad!” But Larry Hogan, the Republican governor of Maryland, criticized Trump, telling NBC the president “hasn’t communicated the way I would, and the way I might like him to.” Fellow Republican Ted Cruz, a US senator, revealed he had shaken hands at a conservative conference with a person who later tested positive. “I have decided to remain at my home in Texas this week, until a full 14 days have passed,” he wrote on Facebook, adding he had no symptoms. Trump and Vice President Mike Pence also attended the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) near Washington last month. Trump has been heavily rebuked for repeatedly contradicting the advice of his administration’s experts in his public pronouncements about the coronavirus. He has downplayed the threat posed by the epidemic, which has killed more than 3,500 people since emerging in China, suggesting cases were “going very substantially down, not up.” New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said federal health authorities had been “caught flat-footed” and had “handcuffed” the ability of individual states to respond. “Their messages are all over the place, frankly,” he told Fox News. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told Fox News that the possibility of following Italy’s example in locking down large sections of the population could not be ruled out. “You don’t want to alarm people but, given the spread we’ve seen, anything is possible,” he said.

President Rodrigo Roa Duterte(KING RODRIGUEZ/PRESIDENTIAL PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN) This developed as the Department of Health (DOH) revealed Monday afternoon that the total number of COVID-19 cases in the Philippines has increased to 20. Four of the new cases were announced late Sunday night, while the 10 other cases were announced Monday afternoon. Based on Proclamation No. 922, signed by President Duterte on March 8, the declaration of a State of Public Health Emergency was made to mobilize governmental and non-governmental agencies to respond to the threat. “The outbreak of COVID-19 constitutes an emergency that threatens national security which requires a whole-of-government response aligned with the Four-Door Framework for COVID-19 of the DOH and the efforts of all concerned government agencies and LGUs,” the President said in his Proclamation. Duterte added that such declaration would address the COVID-19 threat, including but not limited to mandatory reporting, intensify government response and measures, and enforce quarantine and disease control prevention measures. It would also capacitate agencies and local government units (LGUs) to immediately act to prevent loss of life, utilize appropriate resources to implement urgent and critical measures to contain or prevent the spread of COVID-19, mitigate its effects and impact to the community, and prevent serious disruption of the functioning of the government and the community.  Roles Under the Proclamation, all government agencies and LGUs were enjoined to render full assistance and cooperation and mobilize the necessary resources to undertake critical, urgent, and appropriate response and measures in a timely manner to curtail and eliminate the COVID-19 threat. Health Secretary Francisco Duque III was also authorized to call upon the Philippine National Police (PNP) and other law enforcement agencies to provide assistance in addressing the disease. Meanwhile, all citizens, residents, tourists, and establishments owners were urged to follow the law and comply with directives and advisories to be issued by the DOH and other appropriate government agencies to prevent further transmission of COVID-19 and ensure the safety and well-being of all. In a press briefing Monday, Presidential spokesman Salvador Panelo urged the media to publish all government announcements regarding the COVID-19. “May we request and urge all media outlets to kindly publish all the statements made by Secretary Duque and all the bulletins issued by (the DOH) so that our countrymen will know how to react to the present crisis,” he said. “All media outlets, which means all television stations, radio stations, and newspapers,” he added. According to Communications Secretary Martin Andanar, the Kapisanan ng mga Brodkaster ng Pilipinas has agreed to air the government’s COVID-19 infomercials and public service announcements both over radio and TV. New cases On Friday, the DOH confirmed the first case of local transmission of COVID-19 with the confirmation of the first Filipino who tested positive despite not having a history of travel to countries with confirmed cases, nor exposure to a patient. A day later, Duque raised the country’s COVID-19 alert level to Code Red-Sublevel 1, a “pre-emptive call” to ensure that the entire government and its agents, along with its healthcare providers, can prepare for possible COVID-19 upticks. On Sunday evening, the number of positive COVID-19 cases in the Philippines jumped to 10. The DOH said the four new cases were tested on Saturday, March 7, and the results came out on Sunday, March 8. The DOH said the 7th case involves a 38-year-old Taiwanese man. “The patient has a history of contact with a Taiwanese foreign national who visited the Philippines and tested positive for COVID-19 in Taiwan. The patient has no history of travel outside of the country and his symptoms started last March 3,” the DOH said. Makati contact-tracing Mayor Abigail “Abby” Binay said all the people who may have come in contact with the Taiwanese man are all asymptomatic. Over the weekend, Binay ordered city health personnel to locate the hotel staff, associates, and all others whom he may have come in contact with during his stay in Makati City. “Thankfully, with the exception of the Taiwanese national who was confirmed positive with COVID-19, all the rest did not show symptoms,” she said in a statement. “However, they have been instructed to undergo strict home quarantine. The MHD continues to monitor their conditions.” Binay said the pro-active measures were taken over the weekend to determine if there was extensive contamination. According to the local government, the Taiwanese man with COVID-19 was previously confined at a private facility, and has since been transferred to the RITM. Binay said she has ordered the city’s COVID-19 Task Force to ensure that all residents, visitors, and establishments in the city will follow the preventive measures enumerated by the DOH and the World Health Organization (WHO).

Foreign Affairs Assistant Secretary Eduardo Meñez gave the latest breakdown on the Filipinos who tested positive for the coronavirus abroad while releasing information on the travel restrictions imposed by some nations on virus-hit places. “We also received information that two Filipinos have also been identified in Lebanon,” he said in a Palace press briefing, adding the patients are under quarantine at a hospital in Beirut. The country has so far recorded 91 Filipinos who have tested positive for the new coronavirus, including the two cases in Lebanon. Meñez said four Filipinos in Hong Kong, three in Singapore, and two in the United Arab Emirates have tested positive for the coronavirus disease. At least 40 of the 80 COVID-19 Filipino patients in Japan have recovered from the illness. “Out of the 80, 40 have recovered and 21 out of the 40 have already in fact returned to the Philippines, and the other 19 are progressing well as far as their health is concerned,” the DFA official said. “Hopefully they will also soon be repatriated to the Philippines.” Travel restrictions Meantime, a number of countries have imposed travel restrictions on visitors from coronavirus-affected countries like the Philippines. Meñez said Cook Islands restricted travel from certain COVID-affected countries. He said the government of Qatar has also imposed temporary travel restriction on Doha-bound passengers who traveled from 14 identified countries, including the Philippines. “This covers all travelers who have been in those countries within the last 14 days,” he said. He said the Palestinian authorities and Israeli government have decided to restrict travels to the West Bank in Bethlehem in Israel. “We already advised all Filipinos considering travel on pilgrimage in particular to check with their travel agencies and act accordingly. We have already assisted a number of Filipinos who were caught in that area when the travel restrictions were announced,” Meñez said. He said Nepal has suspended its visa-on-arrival facility for all tourists. In Fiji, he said all cruise ships entering Fijian waters will require to berth at certain ports and all passengers on board are required to undergo medical and travel history checks. In the Seychelles, he said all foreign workers currently in COVID-hit countries should postpone their return travel until their further notice. “We also have unconfirmed reports as of the moment that there have been COVID cases identified in the Maldives and some resorts have been locked down. So we will be updating our information as developments arise,” Meñez added. “All our foreign service posts are constantly reporting to the home office and also informing the public through their own web pages and social media platforms about the constantly changing requirements with regard to the COVID situation.” (With a report from MB Online) Tags: ncov"

The local chief executive said the male patient is a resident of Barangay Marikina Heights in the city, but noted that the case is not one of local transmission, because the patient has a travel history to South Korea. “Around 11 kagabi, nakatanggap ako ng impormasyon na galing sa Department of Health (DOH) na kinokompirma nila na may positive case dito sa Marikina,” the mayor told reporters. “Itong kaso na ito ay hindi naman local transmission kasi may travel history siya kaya malaki ang posibilidad na nakuha niya sa kanyang pinaggalingan na bansa.” (Around 11 last night, I received information from DOH confirming a positive case in Marikina.

A group of people carrying medical scrubs arrive at the Life Care Center of Kirkland, a long-term care facility linked to several confirmed coronavirus cases, in Kirkland, Washington, US March 8, 2020. (REUTERS/Lindsey Wasson) Anthony Fauci, the head of the infectious diseases unit at the National Institutes of Health, said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” that after initial missteps distributing tests, there should be 400,000 more tests available by Monday and 4 million by the end of the week. In the United States, 19 people have died out of about 450 reported cases of coronavirus, which originated in China last year and causes the sometimes deadly respiratory illness COVID-19. The outbreak has killed more than 3,600 globally. More than half of the 50 US states have reported cases, including the first cases in Virginia and Connecticut on Sunday. As the outbreak spreads, daily life has been increasingly disrupted, with concerts and conferences canceled and universities telling students to stay home and take classes online. To contain the outbreak in China, the government quarantined millions of people for weeks. Italy has announced similar measures, locking down 16 million people in the north of the country. As recently as Saturday, US President Donald Trump said he would continue to hold his political rallies, which sometimes draw up to 20,000 people. The Democrats competing to challenge him in the Nov. 3 presidential election, US Senator Bernie Sanders and former Vice President Joe Biden, have not canceled any campaign events so far. Germany, which has nearly 1,000 cases, on Sunday urged the cancellation of all events with more than 1,000 people. Fauci said authorities in the United States may also need to consider steps to keep people out of crowded places if the virus continued to spread. Still, he downplayed the likelihood of the type of large-scale quarantines put in place in China and Italy, while saying nothing could be ruled out. “I don’t imagine that the degree of the draconian nature of what the Chinese did would ever be either feasible, applicable, doable or whatever you want to call it in the United States,” he said in an interview on CBS’ “60 Minutes” that will air on Sunday night. “But the idea of social distancing, I mean, obviously, that’s something that will be seriously considered.” He urged those most at risk to limit travel. “If you’re a person with an underlying condition and you are particularly an elderly person with an underlying condition you need to think twice about getting on a plane, on a long trip, and not only think twice, just don’t get on a cruise ship,” Fauci said on “Meet the Press.” US Surgeon General Jerome Adams told CNN cases would rise, adding that the average age of death for people with the virus was 80, and the average age of those needing medical attention was 60. “Unfortunately, you are going to see more deaths, but that doesn’t mean that we should panic,” he said. Communities need to “prepare for more cases so we can prevent more deaths,” Adams said. In financial markets, talk about recessions and bear markets was growing as investors try to assess how badly the outbreak will damage global growth. Many strategists have turned more pessimistic in recent days and are anticipating further market drops and a possible end to the longest economic expansion in US history. The hardest hit place in the United States has been a nursing home in a suburb of Seattle and Washington state is considering mandatory measures such as banning large gatherings but not necessarily imposing massive quarantines, the governor said. The cruise ship Grand Princess, barred from returning to San Francisco last week due to a coronavirus outbreak on board, will send its 2,400 passengers to at least four quarantine centers. The crew of 1,100 will be quarantined and treated on board the ship. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said the number of cases in New York is now 105 and he expects that to rise as testing expands. “What we are really trying to do here is avoid the massive disruption of closing everything down for two weeks the way China did, the way Italy is doing,” he said. Cuomo said a lawyer from Westchester County who is believed to be at the center of the outbreak there had attended a number of large gatherings, contributing to the roughly 70 people in Westchester who have tested positive. “It’s these large gatherings where you can expose a number of people in a very short period of time and then it’s like dominoes, right, then the tree continues to expand with branches.” Tags: ncov"

SPD Party leader Norbert Walter Borjans looks on at the SPD headquarters in Berlin, Germany, February 24, 2020. (REUTERS/Michele Tantussi / MANILA BULLETIN / FILE PHOTO) The virus could sever the supply chains and disrupt the trading links on which Europe’s largest economy relies. Merkel’s conservatives and the center-left Social Democrats sit down later on Sunday for a regular meeting, with the epidemic, the refugee crisis on the Greek-Turkish border and the slowing economy expected to be key themes. In an interview with Deutschlandfunk public radio, Norbert Walter-Borjans said that rather than “sprinkling” stimulus spending, support should be targeted at affected sectors, including state support to prop up wages for those whose working hours have been cut. “Companies with supply chains dependent on China, or events or transport companies – they could very quickly face liquidity problems,” he said. “We want the possibility of up to two years’ wage support.” He declined to speculate on how much this would cost, though Finance Minister Olaf Scholz has previously said money is available for stimulus spending. Currently, workers on reduced hours can receive wage support for up to six months. The coronavirus epidemic, which began in the Chinese province of Hubei, with which many German companies have manufacturing ties, has already had a dramatic impact in Germany. The flag carrier Lufthansa has cut half its flights and the carmaker Daimler has said both sales and production are taking a hit. Merkel’s Christian Democrats, in the midst of a succession battle that will determine who stands as the party’s candidate to succeed Merkel next year, are likely to be open to some form of extended wage support. The parties may be further apart on what to do with refugees from Syria’s war stranded on the Turkish-Greek border. Some in the Christian Democrats are sympathetic to calls for Germany to take children and the most vulnerable from Greek reception camps, but others are more focused on sealing the European Union’s frontiers.

,"March 8, 2020, 6:48 PM",nCov,Unemployment to worsen after Code Red raised in response to COVID-19 threat – TUCP,By Leslie Ann Aquino,"By Leslie Ann Aquino  The Trade Union Congress of the Philippines (TUCP) has warned of bigger unemployment of workers in the agri-food export business and manufacturing sectors following the government’s declaration of COVID-19 alert to Code Red level 1.  TUCP President Raymond Mendoza(TUCP Party-List / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN) “We are anticipating significant job losses among workers working in the export of agri-food and its by-products and those in manufacturing industry with traditional markets in Asia, Europe and North America will try to avoid, reduce, or put more stringent bio-security measure to screen our products to ensure these are virus-free,” TUCP president Raymond Mendoza said in a statement. To be directly hit by the code red level 1 implication, he said are the micro, small and medium enterprises engaged in agri-business industry, along with the businesses in their supply chains in the cooperatives and the community-based barangay micro business enterprises. Mendoza said the TUCP is looking at cancellation of orders of our traditional agricultural products such as bananas, mangoes, pineapples, coconut and coconut water, and sugar, and marine products such as sea weed, sea cucumber, sea urchins, tuna, other fish, and shrimp including natural health and beauty products. Also to be impacted, he said, are workers in the export supply chains involving transport, storage, logistics such as arrastre, wharfage, trucking and warehousing. “Stringent quarantine protocols to minimize COVID19 outbreak crisis will also cause major delays in imported raw materials, key and spare parts products from China and other neighboring countries needed by local industries to complete its products,” Mendoza said.

He cited Saudi Arabia and Kuwait as examples. “In Saudi Arabia lack of demand for skilled, professional and semi-skilled workers have forced many recruitment companies to slash their workforce and only the household service sector was seen as surviving the slow down however with COVID 19 even Saudi Arabia may restrict the entry of more workers,” said Geslani. “Kuwait deployment has suffered a deployment ban earlier this year and was only lifted three weeks ago but due to the COVID 19 has banned entry of flights coming from the Philippines for a period of one week adding to the woes new hires and re-hires to enter the Kuwait job market,” he added. Geslani said even sea-based OFWs are also expected to suffer since several cruise ships have already cancelled their scheduled trips such as Princess Cruises and Royal Caribbean. “That simply means Filipinos who have been recruited to board these cruise ships will have to wait to embark on the ships since their contracts will have to be on hold until the cruise companies decided to start their cruises,” he said. Geslani said: “If economic developments in major markets for OFW in 2019 are to be studied, then there is basis to declare that 2020 deployment will not increase any further and spiral downward with the COVID 19.” READ MORE: Duterte to declare state of emergency Tags: ncov"

Ana hospital,By Minka Klaudia Tiangco ,"By Minka Klaudia Tiangco  The Manila City government launched the Manila Center for Infectious Disease Control (MCIDC) to augment national health facilities amid the threat of 2019-novel coronavirus (COVID-19). The MCIDC is located on the 10th floor of the Sta. Ana Hospital on New Panaderos St. in Sta. Ana, Manila.  Additional isolation tents and mobile temporary holding facilities could also be found in the hospital. It will be another holding area for patients suspected of carrying the COVID-19 virus, aside from the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine in Muntinlupa and San Lazaro Hospital in Manila. Six hospital physicians, who are experts on infectious diseases, were pooled to man the MCIDC. The city government opened the new health facility after the Department of Health (DOH) raised the Philippines’ COVID-19 alert system to Code Red, Sub-level 1, following the confirmation of the first local transmission case. READ MORE: PH reports 1st local COVID-19 case “As you can see, the city of Manila has prepared ahead of time,” said Manila City Mayor Francisco “Isko Moreno” Domagoso after inspecting the MCIDC on Saturday evening. “Should they need it, the city of Manila has additional rooms and isolation areas. We cannot quantify the local transmission cases yet, but we’re just preparing our city,” he added. Each ward has a single bed, an air conditioning unit, a set of drawers, and a bathroom. Separate changing rooms and decontamination rooms were also opened. The changing rooms contain personal protective equipment, including goggles and face masks, for health staff. During a directional and consultative meeting with city government officials on Saturday night, Domagoso said additional medical equipment will be procured should the COVID-19 situation in the country worsen.

,"March 8, 2020, 6:12 PM",nCov,Tech lifestyles in the time of COVID-19,By Agence France-Presse,"By Agence France-Presse SAN FRANCISCO – For people hunkering down due to the coronavirus epidemic, the tech sector has become their new best friend with an array of lifestyle solutions making “social distancing” easier.  (PIXABAY / MANILA BULLETIN) Those wanting to avoid crowds can have meals delivered from restaurants, stream blockbuster films, socialize online with friends, and work remotely. The latest tech-inspired lifestyle solutions are gaining traction as more people are advised to work from home, and many conferences and gatherings are cancelled. Anyone with an internet connection can use Amazon or e-commerce rivals to deliver provisions from groceries to toilet paper and over-the-counter medicine. “We can have anything and everything delivered to our homes including hard and soft goods, doctor visits, laundry services, and even pet services,” said Moor Insights and Strategy principal analyst Patrick Moorhead. “The irony is that many of the items criticized about technology have become a ‘safe’ place to escape to in the wake of coronavirus.” Checking on mom Creative Strategies analyst Carolina Milanesi has been checking in daily with her mother, who lives close to Milan in a part of Italy hit by coronavirus cases and has kept to her home. Video calling services like FaceTime have also helped with virtual doctor visits — or telemedicine — so patients can consult with physicians online and avoid visits to hospitals, she noted. Milanesi told of a friend using online shopping tools to find coveted supplies such as sanitizing gel and wipes. She also shared a news video clip of someone in China using a remote-controlled toy truck mounted with a GoPro camera to fetch supplies. “When it comes to technology, there are different things that make isolation easier; from streaming video to digital books to gaming,” Milanesi said. “We have also seen how social media has helped getting coverage from areas where press might have not been allowed.” In a note to investors, analyst firm Needham said it expected people to grow increasingly uncomfortable going to gyms to work out, in a trend that should benefit the connected cycling maker Peloton. Peloton has had a hit selling stationary exercise bicycles along with memberships to streaming online workout sessions that people can take part in from home. In on nights out Rivals in the increasingly competitive streaming television market also stand to benefit as people opt for home entertainment instead of risking contagion in public spaces, according to analysts. More people could also start getting restaurant meals delivered from services such as Uber Eats and DoorDash instead of going out to restaurants. “None of this undermines the horror of the virus but for those who want to stay home and not venture outside it works,” Moorhead said. Software, services and the infrastructure needed to support them are in the best position ever to allow people to feel less deprived while distancing themselves socially, according to Consumer Technology Association research senior vice president Brian Markwalter. Internet speeds have climbed in the past decades, and smartphones are ubiquitous, Markwalter noted. Telemedicine has made gains in recent years, and health monitoring is getting an added boost from smartwatches and fitness bands that can detect irregular heartbeats or whether some has taken a hard fall, he added. Digital health innovation has been among the fastest growing sections of the association’s annual Consumer Electronics Show gadget extravaganza in Las Vegas. Working smart People in China, Silicon Valley, Japan and Italy are all adopting remote working at various degrees to limit the spreading of the virus, according to Milanesi, pointing to services like the teleconferencing app Zoom. “There is such excitement around remote work that brands like Zoom have seen their stock value climb up,” Milanesi said in an online post. “On paper, now is the time!” She wondered, though, whether the promise of working remotely will run into a wall due to a need to update employment regulations as well as “trust issues of managers who need to feel they are in control.” “One would think that in 2020, productivity should be measured in output and not in hours,” Milanesi said. “Ultimately, remote working should be seen as a business asset at any time, not just when we are under the threat of a pandemic.” Tags: ncov"

But now, it’s apparently too risky. The World Health Organization’s Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the official leading the charge against the coronavirus outbreak, said on Twitter Saturday he favors a more distant sort of salute. – When greeting people, best to avoid elbow bumps because they put you within 1 meter of the other person. I like to put my hand on my heart when I greet people these days. — Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus (@DrTedros) Experts say limiting physical contacts should help slow the march of a disease that’s turned up in more than 80 countries in just over two months and killed almost 3,500 people. The WHO advises keeping at least 1 meter (3 feet) of social distance, among with other measures such as frequent hand-washing and resisting the urge to often touch one’s face.

Both chambers of Congress (House and Senate) are scheduled to go on a lengthy recess starting March 11. Committee on Public Accounts chairman and Anakalusugan Party-List Rep. Mike Defensor also acknowledged the lawmakers’ crucial role in ensuring that the country is capable in addressing the situation. “Yes we will support [the President]. One critical role of Congress is the budget, and to ensure that labs for check- up will be available. Also we need to participate on the SOPs as regards people suspected [with infection] and preventive measures not only in the airports but now even in public areas,” he said. “We will support him (President Duterte) in Congress by prioritizing urgent legislative measures he might need and are necessary in mitigating the risks associated with COVID-19,” added Cebu fifth district Rep.

The neophyte solon added: “Congress should approve all measures for immediate funding and support to fight this global health emergency.” For his part, House Minority Leader, Manila sixth district Rep. Benny Abante urged DOH officials to be more transparent in its updates to the public regarding COVID-19, which is an acute respiratory disease that currently has no known treatment. “The virus is not the only enemy here––widespread panic is also something we must guard against as this will only make a bad situation worse,” said the pastor-turned-lawmaker. “One way the DOH can address the fear and anxiety felt by the public is by providing them with as much helpful information as they can. The more gaps there are in the information they provide, the greater the chance that those gaps will be filled by unfounded rumors, fake news, and speculation,” stressed Abante.

FILE PHOTO: Pope Francis waves during the weekly general audience at Vatican, February 26, 2020. REUTERS/Remo Casilli The 83-year-old pontiff broke with centuries of tradition by enlisting the help of technology to keep crowds from descending on Saint Peter’s Square for the traditional Angelus Prayer. “The prayer will be broadcast via livestream by Vatican News and on screens in Saint Peter’s Square,” the Vatican said in a statement. It had originally promised to review the Argentine-born pope’s schedule “to avoid the dissemination” of the COVID-19 disease. The Vatican appears to believe that the pope’s absence from his traditional spot at the window will keep the crowds on the vast square down and the threat of contagion low. The pope himself has been out of action for more than a week with a cold. The Vatican is in the process of unrolling unprecedented health precautions designed to keep the city state’s 450 mostly elderly residents safe. It recorded its first infection on Thursday and was awaiting the results of a test on another person who appeared at a Vatican-organized event last month. That conference was also attended by Microsoft President Brad Smith and European Parliament President David Sassoli. The Vatican said all those present were being notified about the test as a precaution.

Ministers decided at an all-night emergency meeting to call in retired doctors as part of an effort to bolster the strained healthcare system with 20,000 additional staff. Italy recorded 36 more deaths on Saturday and has now seen 233 die from COVID-19 in two weeks.

Lacambra  Department of Labor and Employment (MANILA BULLETIN) Lacambra cited as guidelines in his offer were the contents of the Labor Advisory No. 09, series of 2020 issued on Wednesday by Labor Secretary Silvestre H. Bello III regarding the implementation of various FWAs as alternative coping mechanisms and remedial measures. He said the intent of the labor advisory was to protect workers and employers from COVID-19, spare businesses from income losses or closure and prevent termination of employee services. FWAs refer to alternative arrangements or schedules other than the traditional or standard work hours, work days and work week. The labor advisory proposes the following FWAs that companies may adopt: (1) Reduction of work hours and/or workdays, where the normal work hours or workdays per week are reduced; (2) Rotation of workers where employees are rotated or alternately provided work within the week; and (3) Forced Leave where the employees are required to go on leave for several days or weeks utilizing their leave credits, if there are any. Employers and workers, however, are encouraged to explore other alternative work arrangements in order to cushion and mitigate the effect of the loss of income of the latter, the labor advisory said. The labor advisory further provides that differences in interpretation of the FWA shall be treated as grievances under the applicable mechanism of the company, or if grievance mechanism is inadequate, the grievance shall be referred to the DOLE Regional Office which has jurisdiction over the workplace for conciliation. Employers are required to keep and maintain the documentary requirements proving that the FWA was adopted to facilitate the resolution of grievances. Establishments implementing FWAs are likewise required to post a copy of the labor advisory in a conspicuous location in the workplace. He said that he DOLE regional office or field office having jurisdiction over the workplace shall monitor the proper implementation of FWAs. READ MORE: PH reports 1st local COVID-19 case Tags: ncov"

Italy’s quarantine zones are home to more than 15 million people and include the regions around Venice and financial capital Milan (AFP / ANDREA PATTARO / MANILA BULLETIN) The unprecedented restrictions, which will impact some 16 million people and stay in force until April 3, were signed into law overnight by Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte. The new measures say people should not enter or leave Lombardy, Italy’s richest region, as well as 14 provinces in four other regions, including the cities of Venice, Modena, Parma, Piacenza, Reggio Emilia and Rimini. “There will be no movement in or out of these areas, or within them, unless for proven, work-related reasons, emergencies or health reasons,” Conte told a news conference in the middle of the night after hours of confusion over his plans. “We have to limit the spread of the virus and prevent our hospitals from being overwhelmed,” he added. However, it was not immediately clear how fiercely the order would be policed and at first light on Sunday, flights appeared to be operating normally out of Milan’s two airports and Venice airport, while rail operators were still selling train tickets. According to the decree, all museums, gyms, cultural centers, ski resorts and swimming pools will be shut in the targeted zones, while leave was cancelled for health workers as Italy’s hospitals sag under the pressure of the virus. Restaurants and bars will be allowed to open from 6:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. (0500-1700 GMT) and only if they can guarantee that customers are at least one meter (yard) apart. The government enacted the draft just hours after officials had announced that the number of coronavirus cases had leapt by more than 1,200 in a 24-hour period – the biggest daily rise since the epidemic began in the country two weeks ago. Deaths due to the infectious virus had also risen, by 36 to 233, while the number of patients in intensive care climbed to 567, up 23% from the day before. Of the 5,883 Italians originally infected, 589 have fully recovered. The northern regions of Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna and Veneto represent 85% of all cases and 92% of recorded deaths.

Last month, Vega assured that the SPMC has the “capability and expertise” in handling patients with COVID-19. “In terms of medical centers, we are now very capable of handling this especially in trying to isolate patients because aside from laboratory, we have isolation facilities. These isolation facilities can protect the health workers from getting contaminated because this is negative pressure, and also help patients’ watchers so they don’t get communicated,” Vega said. He added the government had capacitated these two public hospitals following the reported occurrence of A(H1N1), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus (MERS-COV), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), and Ebola Virus in the previous years prompting the Department of Health and Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) to upgrade their facilities and laboratories for any eventualities. “We should understand that emerging infections are always here.

DILG Secretary Eduardo Año (Photo from Philippine Information Agency / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN) DILG Secretary Eduardo Año issued the order in a bid for them to aid all concerned agencies and groups in monitoring and preventing the spread of the disease to communities. He explained that the Local COVID-19 Task Force of the National Capital Region (NCR) “must work double-time to ensure that further spread of the virus will be halted.” “Local transmissions pose greater chances for the virus to spread and that’s the last thing we want to happen. Kaya naman inaatasan ko ang mga LGU ng NCR to activate their LCTF o Local COVID-19 Task Force to prevent the situation from escalating,” Año said. The LCTF shall direct the Local Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Office and Local City Health Office, upon receiving the referrals from the DOH-Emergency Operations Center, to coordinate directly with, and convey or transport, the symptomatic persons to the nearest DOH referral facility for COVID-19 testing. Año noted that at the DOH referral facility, the symptomatic persons will immediately undergo triage which will determine if the person is a severe case or a mild case. If found to be a mild case, Año said, the ambulance will be directed to bring the patient confirmed as Person Under Investigation (PUI) to the nearest DOH-designated hospital for treatment and isolation, or be admitted, if found to be a severe case. The DILG has also directed all its city directors to coordinate closely with their local chief executives (LCEs). The LCEs were ordered to work closely with the DOH regional office. “It is only through cooperation and vigilance can we guarantee that this virus will not be a greater threat in our country,’’ Año said. BHERTs Año reported that 60.51 percent or 25,411 barangays have already organized their Barangay Health Emergency Response Team (BHERT) which can aid in controlling further community transmissions of COVID-19 in the barangays. The DILG chief revealed that now that there is a verified local transmission case in the country, establishment of BHERTs in barangays can help the government in monitoring and containing the virus. “Sixty point fifty-one percent or 25,411 of the total number of barangays nationwide is already a huge number but we are talking about a virus that has wreaked panic worldwide,’’ Año said. He also urged the remaining barangays to follow suit and establish their own BHERTs “as the DILG targets to have the said emergency response team in every barangay.” Based on the latest data of the DILG-National Barangay Operations Office, Bicol Region registered 100 percent compliance rate translating to a total of 3,471 barangays with organized BHERTs while Region III came in second with 99.42 percent rate corresponding to 3,084 barangays. Region XII and XIII also registered high compliance rates with 96.9 percent and 90.47 percent respectively. Region VI was able to establish BHERTs in 3,615 barangays registering a 89.24 percent compliance rate followed by Region VII with 83.85 percent; CALABARZON (81.19 percent); Metro Manila (78 percent); Region IX (63.71 percent); MIMAROPA (52.74 percent); Region 1 (35.29 percent) and Region X (5.29 percent).

Presidential spokesman Salvador Panelo said the government is ready to respond to the needs of the public and health workers, with additional funding to address the disease. On Saturday, President Duterte agreed to the recommendation of the DOH to declare a State of Public Health Emergency after Health Secretary Francisco Duque III confirmed the sixth COVID-19 case in the country. Panelo said a copy of the Executive Order on Duterte’s declaration will be released Monday. The DOH raised the country’s COVID-19 alert system to Code Red, Sub-level 1 after the first case of local transmission was confirmed. This alert level is a “preemptive call to ensure national and local government and public and private healthcare providers can prepare for a possible increase in suspected and confirmed cases.” Panelo said President Duterte’s economic managers are doing their best to address the economic effects of COVID-19 after the Asian Development Bank (ADB) said the Philippines could lose at least $669 million and at least 87,000 jobs across five sectors due to the outbreak.

Presidential Spokesman Salvador Panelo(OPS / MANILA BULLETIN) Presidential Spokesman Salvador Panelo made the statement after several LGUs announced the suspension of classes on Monday due to the COVID-19 outbreak. In a radio interview, Panelo said LGUs are free to suspend classes if they feel it would guarantee the safety of students. “Discretion sa kanila yun (It’s their discretion). If they feel schoolchildren are safe, they can do that,” he said Sunday. “Discretionary sa school authorities yun. Siyempre, sila ang nagde-decide nun. Sila ang administrador (It’s up to the school authorities. They will be the ones deciding because they are the administrators), eh. They can suspend and then they can make another schedule to make up for the absences,” he added. However, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III earlier said that while the cancelation of classes was the right of LGUs, it was not recommended. On Saturday, President Duterte agreed to the recommendation of the DOH to declare a State of Public Health Emergency after Duque confirmed the sixth COVID-19 case in the country. The Department of Health (DOH) likewise raised the country’s COVID-19 alert system to Code Red, Sub-level 1 after the first case of local transmission was confirmed. Government work suspension Panelo, meanwhile, said a suspension of government work was unlikely since government offices were not crowded areas. He added that the Malacañang was likewise unlikely to be placed on lockdown by the Presidential Security Group (PSG) over the COVID-19 outbreak. “Bakit naman magla-lockdown sa Malacañang? Hindi naman crowded area yun. Ang nila-lockdown lang nila yung mga (Why would the PSG lock Malacañang down? That’s not a crowded area. They only do that on public) gatherings, where people conglomerate,” Panelo said. Last month, the PSG recommended to Malacañang’s Internal House Affairs Office (IHAO) the suspension of Palace tours to secure Malacañang from the threat of COVID-19. Duterte’s schedule to push through The Palace official added that there were no changes made in President Duterte’s schedule following the COVID-19 local transmission. “Marami pa rin siyang naka-schedule, eh (The President still has a lot in his schedule),” Panelo said. He added that President Duterte was following the same protocol everyone else is following to not get the disease. “Lahat ng protocols na applicable sa ordinaryong tao, applicable din sa Presidente (The same protocols applicable to the oridinary people are also applicable to the President),” Panelo said. The DOH has encouraged the public to avoid crowded places, regular handwashing, and proper coughing etiquette, among others. Tags: ncov"

On Saturday, President Duterte agreed to the recommendation of the DOH to declare a State of Public Health Emergency after Health Secretary Francisco Duque III confirmed the sixth COVID-19 case in the country. Panelo said a copy of the Executive Order on Duterte’s declaration will be released Monday. Panelo, however, asked the public not to believe reports circulating online that the Duque recommended for the declaration of the State of Public Health Emergency as early as February 21. “Walang sinasabi si Secretary Duque, otherwise sinabi niya na yun. Hanggang walang sinasabi si Secretary Duque, ‘wag kayo maniniwala. (Secretary Duque never said anything like that, otherwise he would have announced that already. Until such time that he said something, don’t believe what you see),” he said. The DOH raised the country’s COVID-19 alert system to Code Red, Sub-level 1 after the first case of local transmission was confirmed. The said alert level is a “preemptive call to ensure national and local government and public and private healthcare providers can prepare for a possible increase in suspected and confirmed cases.” The alert level likewise ensures that “all human and material resources must be made available for duty and deployment.” Duque the declaration of the State of Public Health Emergency to facilitate the sufficient and immediate access to funding, particularly for local government units, and ease processes on procurement, mandatory reporting, mandatory quarantine, and travel restrictions, among others. Economic effects Meanwhile, Panelo said President Duterte’s economic managers are doing their best to address the economic effects of COVID-19 after the Asian Development Bank (ADB) said the Philippines could lose at least $669 million and at least 87,000 jobs across five sectors due to the outbreak. Panelo said that the government would just have to take it and do something about it even though he believed that ADB’s projection was international and not for the Philippines only. “We have to take it. Ganyan talaga ang realidad (That’s the reality). The economic managers are trying to do something about it. Ganoon lang. (That’s what we can do),” he said. “Pero sabihin mo na (But if you’ll say that) we can stop the losses, I don’t think we can,” he added. Tags: ncov"

(REUTERS/David Ryder / MANILA BULLETIN) More than half of all U.S. states have reported cases of the coronavirus, which originated in China last year and causes the sometimes deadly respiratory illness COVID-19. As the outbreak takes root, daily life has become increasingly disrupted, with concerts and conferences canceled and universities telling students to stay home and take classes online. Organizers of the Conservative Political Action Conference, a high-profile annual gathering that took place in Maryland last month, said on Saturday one of their attendees had tested positive for the virus after exposure prior to the event. The person had no interactions with President Donald Trump or Vice President Mike Pence, who were in attendance, the American Conservative Union said in a statement. The two latest deaths were in Washington’s King County, the hardest hit area in the United States after the virus spread among residents at a nursing facility in the Seattle suburb of Kirkland. The first deaths on the East Coast were announced late Friday, with two people succumbing in Florida. In New York, the number of confirmed cases rose by 13 on Saturday to a statewide total of 89 people, Governor Andrew Cuomo said. He issued a declaration of emergency. “It allows expedited purchasing and expedited hiring, which is what we need right now,” Cuomo told a news conference. Kansas, Missouri and Washington DC announced their first cases. In international waters off California, passengers on a cruise ship that was barred from docking in San Francisco after some aboard tested positive for the novel coronavirus did not know on Saturday when they might be able to step ashore. Trump said on Friday he would prefer the Grand Princess’s 2,400 passengers and 1,100 crew remain out at sea, but that he would let others decide where she should dock. After 19 crew and two passengers out of 46 tested on the Grand Princess were found to have the virus, Pence said the ocean liner will be taken to an unspecified non-commercial port where everyone on board will be tested again, and that those “who need to be quarantined will be quarantined” and those who need medical care will receive it.

U.S. officials also began tracking another cruise ship that may have shared crew with the Grand Princess or the Diamond Princess, another ship where the coronavirus spread onboard, Pence said. One Grand Princess passenger described a dull and sometimes queasy wait for news of when their limbo would end. “It bugs me that my relatives in the Bay Area know what’s going to happen with us before I do,” Elizabeth Aleteanu of Colorado Springs said in an interview conducted via Facebook. She turned 35 on Wednesday in a small, windowless cabin shared with her husband and two young children, where the rocking of the vessel sometimes left her nauseated. Tags: ncov"

(REUTERS/Taehoon Kim/MANILA BULLETIN) The two residents at Lynn Valley Care Centre in North Vancouver tested positive after a health worker at the facility was detected with the coronavirus, prompting authorities to conduct extended tests, British Columbia health officer Bonnie Henry told reporters. “This is one of the scenarios.. we have been most concerned about,” Henry said. “We know that the risk for elderly people, having this disease, is very concerning and they are likely to have more severe disease. Particularly older people with underlying chronic illness.” An outbreak protocol is curtailing movement of people in and out of Lynn Valley as authorities conduct a detailed investigation to detect other potential cases there and people who could have been exposed to the healthcare worker, Henry said. Virus outbreaks are especially problematic in nursing homes because residents live in close quarters, so infections can spread easily. Older residents also tend to have weaker immune systems and underlying health conditions, making illnesses easier to catch and more dangerous if contracted. In the United States, an outbreak of the coronavirus at a long-term care facility in Kirkland, Washington, has resulted in at least six deaths. Lynn Valley has over 200 residents, British Columbia’s health minister, Adrian Dix, said.

Senate of the Philippines (MANILA BULLETIN FILE PHOTO) They made the call after Department of Health (DOH) announced on Friday two new confirmed cases of the coronavirus infection, who are both Filipinos, one of whom have no travel history to any of the countries affected by COVID-19. On Saturday afternoon, the DOH reported the Philippines’ sixth COVID-19 case, who is the wife of the patient with no travel history, thus declaring a local transmission of the virus. With this development, Senator Joel Villanueva said the Department of Labor and Employment should beef up its efforts in encouraging employers to finally adopt telecommuting, or work-from-home arrangements in their organizations to help prevent the COVID-19 from further spreading. “While it’s not for all workers because some need to be physically present in their places of work, telecommuting will also help minimize work disruption and stem the projected economic impact of the disease,” Villanueva, chair of the Senate labor committee, said in a statement sent to the Manila Bulletin. The senator also reiterated that employers are mandated under the country’s Occupational Safety and Health Standards (OSH) Law to maintain a “safe working environment for workers”. “Companies are expected to vet the safety of their workplace through designated safety officers who can call for a work stoppage if an imminent danger for workers has been determined,” he said. “Non-compliance to our occupational safety and health standards is against our laws, not to mention, morally reprehensible because it puts the lives of workers at risk. There will always be a way to maintain worker productivity, like putting in place telecommuting work arrangements to make sure office operations continue without a hitch,” he added. Senator Risa Hontiveros also issued the same appeal on Saturday. “The people need a ‘work-from-home’ option,” she said. “Kung pwede namang hindi araw-araw pumasok at mag-commute, mas maiiwasan natin ang risk of transmission (If we can allow our workers not be physically present at work and commute everyday, we could prevent further the risk of transmission),} she said. Hontiveros also aired concern about the safety of workers doing frontline services and of those in the service sector, who she said, has “higher risks” of being infected. “Extra protective measures should be provided by employers,” she appealed. The Telecommuting Law (Republic Act No. 11165) institutionalizes work-from-home as a work arrangement and harmonizes its principles with the Labor Code. On Wednesday, the DOLE issued an advisory laying out the guidelines on the implementation of flexible work arrangements amid the COVID-19 outbreak. While the DOLE encourages the adoption of a work-from-home set-up, Labor Secretary Silvestre Bello, on the other hand, maintained on Saturday that such work arrangement, under the law, is not mandatory and could only be implemented if employers and workers mutually agree on it. “It should be an arrangement between the employer and employee. Hindi puwede na employee lang o employer lang (It should not be decided upon by the employee alone, or the employer alone). May consensus dapat (There should be a consensus). Walang sapilitan ‘yan (It is not mandatory),” Bello said in an interview over radio DZBB. Villanueva, meanwhile, repeated his call for the DOH “to be more ‘forthcoming’ in disclosing COVID-19 cases to allow the public, especially workers, to be more discerning as they make their day-to-day decisions like commuting to their places of work.” Tags: ncov"

Her efforts galvanized individuals and companies to send more than 600,000 sanitary pads and period-proof underwear, which can be worn for longer, to frontline workers. Not essential  China ordered fast-track routes for emergency supplies entering Hubei province — but sanitary products weren’t initially considered necessities. Some hospital officials have turned the donations away, Jiang said, because they didn’t have “sufficient awareness of this issue”. “The leaders are all male comrades,” one nurse in Hubei’s Shiyan city told AFP, who asked to remain anonymous. While the provincial leaders are overwhelmingly male, women account for the majority of nurses and doctors on the frontline, according to the official All-China Women’s Federation. Jiang also had to face trolling from online critics. “Even human lives can’t be protected, why care about that issue in the crotch of your pants?” one wrote in response to her campaign. But Jiang and her volunteers remain unfazed. “We’re very happy that we can do a little work for women’s rights,” she told AFP. ‘Unspeakable’ periods  The portrayal of women fighting the virus has prompted a rare wave of criticism in a country where online discussion is usually tightly restricted. A Shanghai university hospital, which praised the “woman warriors” that made up 79 percent of its reinforcement team to Hubei, said it was donating 200 bottles of pills to “postpone female team members’ ‘unspeakable’ special periods.” The hospital later defended itself, saying the women took the medication voluntarily, but the hospital was slammed by Weibo users who accused officials of depriving women of control over their bodies. “In order to avoid providing sanitary pads, you have created this kind of volunteering!” said one. “Of course they would rather take progesterone than stain their protective suits with blood.” Propaganda videos of female medical workers having their heads shaved — supposedly to improve hygiene — have also backfired, with many doubting that the women, some of whom were weeping, had participated willingly. “Stop using women’s bodies as tools for propaganda,” read one widely-shared essay responding to the videos on a WeChat-based blog. The essay was later removed from the platform for “illegal” content. A social media post from state broadcaster CCTV which described unnamed workers posing in oversized hazmat suits as “cute” drew similar ire. Weibo users pointed out that they were likely to be female workers given the ill-fitting suits. “Fat lot of good being cute does when it comes to safety!!” wrote one user, whose comments were reposted more than 27,000 times. The strength of online debate shows that public awareness of gender equality has grown, said activist Feng Yuan, who co-founded a Beijing-based non-profit focusing on women. But stereotypes and propaganda “erase” women by portraying them as “recipients of help, or as long-suffering caregivers, or eulogized victims or self-sacrificers,” she said. “Instead of living people, this kind of propaganda conversely strengthens gender stereotypes.” Tags: ncov"

South Korea has reported the largest number of coronavirus infections outside China, with more than 6,000 cases (AFP Photo/MANILA BULLETIN) The two countries have close economic ties and are both major US allies, democracies and market economies faced with a rising China and nuclear-armed North Korea. But their relationship continues to be heavily affected by Japan’s colonial rule of the Korean peninsula from 1910 to 1945 — a dispute that escalated into a trade and security row last year. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Thursday announced that foreign arrivals who have recently been in China or South Korea would be required to spend 14 days in quarantine. The South’s two biggest airlines Korean Air and Asiana on Friday announced the cancellations of most or all of their flights to Japan once the measure comes into force, and K-pop band Super Junior indefinitely postponed their upcoming shows in the country. Seoul responded Friday evening by announcing a suspension of its visa-waiver scheme for Japanese visitors starting Monday and said it would also invalidate any travel permits already issued. Vice-foreign minister Cho Sei-young said South Korea would also impose a health check process on Japanese travellers, who may be asked to submit a medical certificate. South Korea has reported more than 6,500 coronavirus cases — the highest total outside China — and around 60 countries and regions have imposed travel bans or quarantine on arrivals from the world’s 12th-largest economy. But it has taken particular issue with Japan’s restrictions, with the presidential office calling the decision “irrational” and contrasting its “scientific and transparent” outbreak control campaign with Tokyo’s “opaque and passive” efforts. Seoul summoned the ambassador to protest, with foreign minister Kang Kyung-wha telling him: “Japan’s action this time was not only unfriendly but also unscientific.” Her ministry accused Tokyo of ulterior motives, saying in a statement: “We can’t help but question whether Japan has other motives than containing the outbreak.” The South’s total reported infections — the largest figure outside China, where the virus first emerged — rose to 6,593 on Friday, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. It announced seven more deaths, taking the toll to 42. Japan has reported 360 confirmed cases and six deaths from the illness, and a handful of countries have blocked arrivals from it or imposed restrictions. Around 40 countries and regions have banned entry to foreigners who have recently been in the South, while more than 20 require quarantine, as do several parts of China. Seoul has not protested to Beijing over those decisions, despite facing domestic criticism itself for not banning all arrivals from China, rather than only those from Hubei, the province at the centre of the epidemic. Over 90 percent of South Korea’s cases are in the southern city of Daegu and the neighbouring North Gyeongsang province. Most of the country’s infections are linked to the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, a religious sect often condemned as a cult, one of whose members attended at least four services before being diagnosed. Scores of events — from K-pop concerts to sports seasons — have been cancelled or postponed over the contagion, with school and kindergarten breaks extended by three weeks nationwide.   Tags: ncov"

(Photo by Ed JONES / AFP/ MANILA BULLETIN) The move comes as the country, which has the highest number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the world outside China, reported 174 new infections, taking its total to 6,767. Another two deaths were reported by the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, bringing the toll to 44. The apartment complex in Daegu — the country’s fourth-largest city and epicentre of its outbreak — was placed under lockdown after 46 residents were confirmed to have the virus, mayor Kwon Young-jin said. More than 140 people live in the two buildings, including 94 members of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, which is often accused of being a cult and is linked to most of South Korea’s infections. It is the first residential community to be isolated over the outbreak, Kwon said. The property is owned by the city government and only single women aged 35 or under can apply to live there. Over 5,000 cases have now been confirmed in Daegu — where the outbreak among Shincheonji members began with a 61-year-old woman, who developed symptoms on February 10 and attended at least four worship services in the city. Authorities are carrying out checks on more than 260,000 people associated with the religious group. Kwon urged followers to come forward and be tested after more than 30 percent of the 709 members checked on Friday returned positive results. The members’ cooperation is crucial to “prevent further infections in our community”, Kwon said. Tags: ncov"

,"March 7, 2020, 7:50 PM",nCov,Duterte to declare state of emergency,By Argyll Geducos and Analou De Vera ,"By Argyll Geducos and Analou De Vera  President Duterte has agreed to declare a State of Public Health Emergency after considering all critical factors regarding the resurgence of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases in the country and the confirmation of its local transmission.  President Rodrigo Roa Duterte (ALFRED FRIAS/PRESIDENTIAL PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN) Presidential spokesman Salvador Panelo and Sen. Christopher “Bong” Go announced this Saturday after Health Secretary Francisco Duque III raised the health alert level to “Code Red, Sublevel 1” on Saturday and recommended the declaration of a State of Public Health Emergency to the President following the confirmation of the local transmission of the disease. “The said proposal has been raised to the attention of the President who has agreed to issue such declaration after considering all critical factors with the aim of safeguarding the health of the Filipino public,” Panelo said Saturday afternoon. Go, chairman of the Senate Committee on Health and Demography, had likewise recommended the declaration of a State of Public Health Emergency. READ MORE: Gov’t should stay a step ahead in addressing COVID-19 crisis – Go Duque said raising the alert level to Code Red “is a preemptive call to ensure that national and local governments and public and private health care providers can prepare for possible increase in suspected and confirmed cases.” “At this stage of localized transmission, intensified contact tracing and home quarantine of close contacts of confirmed cases, improved hospital preparedness, enhanced Severe Acute Respiratory Illness surveillance, and activation of other laboratories outside of RITM to increase capacity to diagnose are now being implemented,” he said. Duque, in a press conference Saturday, said the first local transmission was made official after the Bureau of Immigration confirmed that the fifth COVID-19 case in the country – the 62-year-old man who regularly goes to a Muslim prayer hall in Greenhills, San Juan – had no recent travel history to any of the countries with cases of COVID-19. The DOH chief also revealed that the 62-year-old patient’s 59-year-old wife was also tested positive for the disease, making her the 6th confirmed case of COVID-19 in the country. She first manifested cough and was admitted at the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) on March 5. RITM Director Dr. Celia Carlos reported the 59-year-old woman as well as the country’s 4th confirmed case of COVID-19 – a 48-year-old Filipino lawyer – are both in stable condition. Both have “mild respiratory symptoms.” However, the 62-year-old man is in a “guarded condition,” Carlos said without elaborating. “He still has severe pneumonia plus other medical problems like diabetes and hypertension – and the recently identified other medical problem which is acute kidney injury which may be due to multiple factors present in the patient,” Carlos added. State of Public Health Emergency Duque said that despite having “only two cases constituting localized transmission,” they recommended to the Office of the President the declaration of a State of Public Health Emergency. “This will facilitate mobilization of resources, ease processes, including procurement of critical logistics and supplies, and intensifying reporting,” said Duque. The DOH said that they are already improving the testing capacity of subnational laboratories in the country. “DOH is determined to expand our testing capacity for COVID-19 to immediately ascertain that cases are identified and dealt with. We are studying these proposals to ensure that they are accurate and safe for the public’s use,” said Duque. “Enhanced testing capacity is a prerequisite to prevention and containment, hence DOH is placing expansion of testing centers as its topmost priority,” he added. Access to funding Go said that the declaration of a State of Public Health Emergency facilitates immediate access to funding to respond to the issue, particularly for the LGUs. “Under Republic Act (RA) 10121, such declaration allows the LGUs to utilize their local disaster risk reduction management funds,” he said. “The declaration eases processes on procurement, mandatory reporting, mandatory quarantine and travel restrictions, among others,” Go added. If the President pushes through with the declaration, it will also serve as basis for possible price freeze under RA 7581 or the Price Act, the senator said. Go also urged all citizens, residents, tourists and establishment owners to act within the bounds of the law and to comply with the lawful directives and advisories to be issued to prevent further spread of COVID-19. He added that he will also recommend to the President the creation of a crisis committee through an expansion of the membership of the Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF) to include other instrumentalities of the government, including LGUs, to fight the possible disease spread more effectively. “We need a whole-of-society and proactive approach in preventing further spread of the virus,” Go said citing that this is consistent with DOH’s pronouncement raising the alert level to Code Red, sub-level 1. Presidential spokesman Salvador Panelo said that President Duterte has already instructed all relevant agencies to be absolutely transparent to the public. In a statement Saturday morning, Panelo said the President recognizes that the people have every right to be informed about the situation. “At the very outset of the surge of news reports concerning COVID-19, the President has categorically mandated relevant instrumentalities of the government to be absolutely transparent to the Filipino people as regards this health issue, aware that we have the right to be informed of the conditions surrounding us,” he said. Contact tracing Duque said the DOH is currently “exhausting all its efforts to identify others who may have come in contact with the confirmed cases to ensure that this localized transmission does not progress to community spread.” World Health Organization Country Representative Dr. Rabindra Abeyasinghe said health authorities are now trying to define the “parameters” of the local transmission of COVID-19 in the country. “What we have now is localized transmission and what the DOH is trying to do is to define the parameters by means [of] contacting the close contacts – testing them during the case investigations to define what the parameters of these clusters are,” he said. “We want to clearly define who is affected – is there a transmission beyond these two cases that we have confirmed – we need to identify who could be at risk,” he added. Abeyasinghe emphasized that the public should be conscious that anybody in Metro Manila or any parts of the country who has a respiratory tract infection does not signify that they are having the coronavirus disease. “The mere fact that you have respiratory tract infection does not mean that you need to be tested for COVID-19 unless you have been in close contact with these cases,” he said. “We urge you to still be rational and not demand that every single respiratory tract infection that anybody contracts needs to be checked for COVID-19 – that is not a possibility for any country. Every country practices contact tracing and if you have suspected exposure or travel history –only those people are tested. You cannot test everybody. We have to be realistic about the test,” said Abeyasinghe.

Nieto, in his text message to this reporter, said health measures are in place since Friday night to ensure that health protocols are being followed in relation to the incident that involves a resident who has been tested positive for COVID-19.

US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, speaking to reporters on March 5, has referred to the novel coronavirus as the “Wuhan virus” (AFP Photo/Eric BARADAT / MANILA BULLETIN) For the second day in a row, Pompeo on Friday publicly referred to COVID-19 as the “Wuhan virus” or “Wuhan coronavirus,” a reference to the central Chinese metropolis that is hardest hit. Asked in a CNBC interview about the success of Beijing’s response to the outbreak, Pompeo said, “I’m happy you complimented the Chinese Communist Party today, but remember this is the Wuhan coronavirus that’s caused this.” And in a news conference on Thursday, Pompeo highlighted $37 million in US aid for countries hit by “the Wuhan virus’s spread.” Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian, asked in a briefing this week about the terms “Wuhan virus” or “China virus,” said it was “highly irresponsible” for media to use them. “By calling it ‘China virus’ and thus suggesting its origin without any supporting facts or evidence, some media clearly want China to take the blame and their ulterior motives are laid bare. The epidemic is a global challenge,” he said. Zhao insisted that no conclusion has been made on whether the virus originated in China. COVID-19 cases were first reported — and initially suppressed by authorities — in late December in Wuhan, where scientists believe the virus was transmitted to humans at a market that sold exotic animals for consumption. Pompeo rejected Chinese statements that the virus may have originated elsewhere and said it was “incredibly frustrating” that Beijing has not shared more information. “I’m happy about the efforts that they have taken, but no less authority than the Chinese Communist Party said it came from Wuhan,” he said in the CNBC interview. “So don’t take Mike Pompeo’s word for it. We have pretty high confidence that we know where this began, and we have high confidence too that there was information that could have been made available more quickly.” The World Health Organization, in guidelines issued in February aimed at governments and media, warned that terms such as “Wuhan virus” could stigmatize people of Chinese origin and also discourage people from getting tested. “The official name for the disease was deliberately chosen to avoid stigmatization – the ‘co’ stands for Corona, ‘vi’ for virus and ‘d’ for disease; 19 is because the disease emerged in 2019,” it said. The virus outbreak, which has battered global economic confidence and markets, comes at a time of friction between the world’s two largest economies, with the United States criticizing China on a host of issues from trade to human rights to military assertiveness. The rest of President Donald Trump’s administration has largely stuck to the term coronavirus. It has killed more than 3,400 people and infected more than 100,000 in 91 countries, according to an AFP tally. China accounts for an overwhelming majority of the cases.   Tags: ncov"

The Iraqi government’s crisis unit said shopping centers will only open three hours a day, schools and universities will be closed until March 21, and public administrations will only open for a few hours a day, effective immediately.  Foreign nationals arriving from France and Spain will be denied entry. Iraq has reported four coronavirus deaths and 38 infections. Authorities had already closed the borders with neighboring Iran, which has seen the world’s second-deadliest outbreak and banned the entry of foreign nationals traveling from there and other badly affected countries. Schools, universities, cinemas, and other public spaces had been closed for the past week, but restaurants, malls and cafes have remained open. On Friday, representatives who usually read Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani’s address at a packed mosque, broadcast live on state television, did not appear. Religious authorities had already closed the shrine of Imam Hussein, grandson of the Prophet Mohammed, where his sermon is usually delivered, to mitigate the risk of contagion. The 89-year-old Sistani is based in the Shiite holy city of Najaf, south of Karbala, and never appears in public. An official at the site in the holy city of Karbala told AFP that “the cancellation of Friday prayers at the Imam Hussein shrine is a first since 2003”, the year an American-led invasion toppled veteran dictator Saddam Hussein. Sources close to Sistani’s office confirmed the unprecedented nature of the decision. Authorities are particularly worried about coronavirus spreading via Shiite holy sites, which attract millions of pilgrims including many from Iran. But on Friday numerous pilgrims flocked to the area near the Karbala mausoleum, and a road linking two shrines in the city was still open to pilgrims, AFP journalists said. Provincial authorities have barred non-residents from entering Karbala province from Friday. Sistani had dedicated part of his last two sermons to the health situation in the country of 40 million. The virus has fuelled panic among Iraqis who say the war-ravaged country’s health system cannot handle the epidemic. In Najaf, the mausoleum of Imam Ali, son-in-law of the Prophet Mohammad, was open to the public on Friday after Shiite cleric Moqtada Sadr personally pushed for it to be re-opened. Hundreds of his supporters gathered for prayers in the nearby town of Kufa — Sadr’s birthplace — on Friday, AFP journalists reported. Sadr did not attend but sent a representative to deliver his sermon. In Samarra, another holy Shiite site north of Baghdad, religious authorities cancelled a second pilgrimage in the space of a week. Iran on Friday announced a surge in coronavirus cases and 17 more deaths, including an advisor to the foreign minister, raising the total number of people killed to 124.   Tags: ncov"

The university, which has a student population of nearly 46,000, is located in Seattle, the area with the largest number of COVID-19 cases recorded so far in the United States. School officials said Friday that they had learned a staff member had received a presumptive positive test for the virus and was in self-isolation at home. They said the campus building where that person worked had been closed for appropriate cleaning. Another school, Boston-based Northeastern University, which has a satellite campus in Seattle, also said its campus will move to online teaching on Monday. In a statement on Friday, it urged all faculty and students — about 1,135 — to stay home. So far, all but one of the 12 coronavirus deaths recorded in the United States have been in Washington state, the majority of them residents of a nursing home in King County, which encompasses Seattle. One person has also died in neighboring Snohomish County. Schools in both districts were ordered shut down earlier this week for up to 14 days. “We are taking this strategic approach not because we think by doing so, we will stop an epidemic; we are simply trying to do our part to slow the spread of COVID-19,” Northshore School District Superintendent Michele Reid said in a letter to families. “We are no longer able to provide quality instruction and maintain an environment that is safe.” Tags: ncov"

A Mauritanian health ministry spokesman told AFP on Wednesday that the group then “made the mistake of attempting to evade” a confinement period the country has imposed on travelers from high-risk countries by setting off for Atar on Sunday. But a diplomat from the Italian embassy in Morocco’s capital Rabat, which is responsible for Mauritania, said the group left for the trip unaware of any confinement period. They only discovered of the new rule’s existence at roadside checks, the diplomat said. The group was brought back to Nouakchott, where they were given two options: spend 14 days in confinement or return to Italy. “All the tourists chose the second option,” the diplomat told AFP.

Among the newly reported deaths was that of a 76-year-old man who frequented a seniors centre in Valdemoro just south of Madrid where 15 other users and staff members have been diagnosed with COVID-19. His death follows that of a 99-year-old woman earlier this week who used another day-care facility for the elderly in Madrid and it prompted health officials to order all 213 such facilities in the region, both daycare and residential, to be shut for a month. “This decision has been taken because users of seniors centers are especially vulnerable to COVID-19,” the regional government of Madrid said in a statement, before adding there was an “extraordinary and imminent threat to public health”. Spain reported its first coronavirus death on Tuesday evening, saying the victim had died on February 13 but was only diagnosed with COVID-19 during a post-mortem analysis in a development which has worried officials.

Senator Christopher “Bong” Go(PRIB Photo by Cesar Tomambo / MANILA BULLETIN FILE PHOTO) Go, chairman of the Senate Health Committee, made the call after attending on Friday the opening of the 69th Malasakit Center in the country at the Talisay District Hospital, a Department of Health (DOH)-operated hospital in Barangay San Isidro, Talisay City, Cebu. Go, in an interview after the launch of the new Malasakit Center, took the opportunity to advise Filipinos not to panic and instead, cooperate with the government in its efforts to address the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) situation through stronger and more proactive measures to prevent the further spread of the virus. Go urged officials to take stronger and more proactive measures to fight the spread of the virus. He also advised those who might be experiencing flu-like symptoms to go to the nearest hospital and consult doctors to get proper medical attention and prevent the further spread of the disease. Go also said that they might also seek assistance from the Malasakit Centers for their hospital bills. “It was announced by the Department of Health (DOH) na merong local case ng COVID-19,” Go said, adding: “Huwag tayo magpanic. Let’s move forward and be one step ahead always. Magtulungan tayo. ‘Wag magspread ng fake news. Sundin natin ang mga advisories mula sa ating health officials.” (We should not panic.

,"March 7, 2020, 9:46 AM",nCov,Gov’t should make immediate assessment of COVID-19’s potential damage on economy,By Mario Casayuran ,"By Mario Casayuran  Senator Sherwin Gatchalian on Saturday urged economic managers to make an immediate assessment of COVID-19’s impact on the country’s economy.  Sen. Sherwin Gatchalian(Senate of the Philippines / MANILA BULLETIN FILE PHOTO) In a resolution he filed, Gatchalian, vice chairman of the Senate Committee on Economic Affairs, said he was alarmed over the potential serious implications of the global outbreak, taking its toll on more possible job losses. Flag carrier Philippine Airlines recently laid off 300 personnel in the wake of the imposed travel ban in certain countries that led to revenue losses. ‘’There are mounting fears that other companies would follow suit especially in several tourism supply chains which includes hotels, restaurants, land transport service, logistics, and catering to name a few,’’ he pointed out. Gatchalian prodded the government to be more proactive and flexible in using economic policy tools, such as a stimulus package to reinvigorate the economy and prevent or reverse a possible economic crisis. Citing his own internal computation, Gatchalian estimated that the government would need P28 billion for the stimulus package that would be extended to the tourism-related subsectors, such as hotels, food and beverages, transportation, and recreation and cultural activities, among others. He suggested a three-pronged inclusive approach to help pump-prime the economy. First, the government could help affected tourism-related businesses, particularly the micro, small, and medium enterprises, by extending property tax discounts and temporary Value-Added Tax (VAT) relief. Second, Gatchalian proposed for the creation of a financing facility that would extend loans and financial support to the subsectors hit by the outbreak. Lastly, Gatchalian said the government might embark on rehabilitating the country’s cultural landmarks and dilapidated heritage sites to boost domestic tourism which can also provide jobs. “At this moment, the global coronavirus outbreak threatens to disrupt the world market. It is only prudent for our economic managers to implement policies that will ensure that the domestic demand will remain strong to counter the effects of slowing global economy due to COVID-19,” he explained. The lawmaker pointed out that with around nine million tourists forecast to arrive in the country this year, the travel restrictions on China and its territories Hong Kong and Macau, Taiwan and North Gyeongsang province in South Korea due to COVID-19 are estimated to push down tourist arrivals to only seven million.

Tourists arrive at a commuter train station in Bangkok on March 2, 2020. – The world has entered uncharted territory in its battle against the deadly coronavirus, the UN health agency warned, as new infections dropped dramatically in China on March 3 but surged abroad with the US death toll rising to six. (Photo by Mladen ANTONOV / AFP) The Madrid-based United Nations body said in a statement that arrivals were now projected to fall by 1.0-3.0 percent in 2020, instead of the growth of 3.0-4.0 percent it forecast in January. This will lead to an estimated loss of $30-50 billion (29-45 billion euros) in international tourism receipts, the Madrid-based body said. If confirmed, this will be the first annual decline in the number of international tourist arrivals since 2009 when the global economic crisis hit the travel and tourism sector hard. “This first assessment expects that Asia and the Pacific will be the worst affected region, with an anticipated fall in arrivals of 9.0 percent to 12.0 percent,” the statement said. “Estimates for other world regions are currently premature in view of the rapidly evolving situation.” The UN body said travel restrictions and flight cancellations had “significantly diminished the supply of travel services while demand continues to retract.” It advised governments against imposing travel restrictions to countries experiencing outbreaks of the deadly disease and called for “financial and political support for recovery measures aimed at tourism”. “Small and medium-sized enterprises make up around 80 percent of the tourism sector and are particularly exposed with millions of livelihoods across the world, including within vulnerable communities, relying on tourism,” the body’s secretary general, Zurab Pololikashvili, said. International tourism arrivals rose by 4.0 percent in 2019 to 1.5 billion, with France the world’s most visited nation, followed by Spain and the United States. They generated around $1.5 trillion in receipts. China, the world’s top source market for international tourists, has imposed draconian quarantines and travel restrictions to keep large swathes of the population indoors to try to stop the spread of the disease. The destinations which will be most affected by a drop in the arrival of Chinese tourists will likely be the United States, Thailand and Japan, according to the UN body. Chinese tourists accounted for over a quarter of all international arrivals in Thailand and Japan last year and about four percent of all arrivals in the United States, it added. Travel and tourism accounts for about 10 percent of total world employment, according to the World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC), a top industry association. Leisure represents almost 80 percent of that total compared with 20 percent for business travel. Many business travellers who normally fill the travel industry’s slack during the winter months are staying home since companies have suspended employee travel globally for the coming weeks and authorities have axed trade fairs. The UNWTO pointed out that while the travel sector also declined in 2003 due to the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) which killed 774 people worldwide, it experienced a “strong and rapid recovery the following years”. The novel coronavirus strain that erupted in China this year and causes the COVID-19 disease has killed more than 3,400 people and infected over 100,000 in about 90 nations. Tags: ncov"

Medical workers (top) walk past empty beds at a makeshift hospital in a stadium in Wuhan. A top official hinted that the quarantine of Hubei could soon be lifted (AFP Photo/STR / MANILA BULLETIN) Asked about the draconian measures taken in central Hubei province to contain the spread of the virus, Ding Xiangyang, deputy secretary-general of China’s State Council, told journalists “the day everyone is waiting for will not be too far away”. But Ding stressed that cases in Hubei — and its capital Wuhan where the virus emerged — still made up a huge proportion of the national toll. Some 56 million people in Hubei have been effectively quarantined since late January, to stop the virus from spreading across the country when people returned to work from their hometowns after the extended Lunar New Year break. But new cases in Hubei and Wuhan have been on a downward trend for several weeks. For the first time since China started publishing cases of new infections, on Friday there were no new cases reported in Hubei outside Wuhan, with 126. “I believe the day everyone is waiting for will not be too far away,” Ding said. As the situation improves, the authorities will make adjustments, he said. His remarks are the latest in a number of signs that life in China may soon begin returning to normal. The small Hubei city of Chibi, south of Wuhan, removed road blocks on Friday after 19 days without new infections, allowing freer movement of traffic inside — but not out of — the city. It also comes as some regions prepare to reopen schools from next week, after more than a month of closures across the country. Qinghai province, spread across the Tibetan Plateau, announced in late February that high schools and vocational schools would resume gradually from March 9 to 13. Middle schools would reopen later in the month. Mountainous Guizhou province in southwest China has also said some students in high school and middle school would resume classes from March 16. Ding said Friday that some have questioned if it was necessary for so many people in Wuhan to be quarantined in their communities. He likened the struggle against the epidemic to “armies fighting in a state of war”, where people have to hide in underground bunkers or risk casualties. The coronavirus has killed over 3,000 people in China and infected more than 80,500. But officials noted the situation was improving and that Hubei now had enough medical protection materials, key treatment drugs and equipment — after facing severe shortages earlier.   Tags: ncov"

(REUTERS/Carlos Barria) Trump canceled his plans to travel to the headquarters to the main U.S. agency fighting the outbreak before signing a bill allocating $8.3 billion to stop the virus from spreading. The bill breezed through the Senate with a passing vote of 96-1 on Thursday. “The CDC has been proactive and prepared since the very beginning and the President does not want to interfere with the CDC’s mission to protect the health and welfare of their people and the agency,” a White House official said, explaining the decision to call off the trip. The death toll from the respiratory illness rose to 14 in the United States on Friday, according to public health data compiled by the Johns Hopkins Center for Systems Science and Engineering. More than 100,000 people have been infected worldwide, including 233 in the United States. More than 3,400 people have died across the world, most of them in China. Twelve of the U.S. fatalities were recorded in King County, Washington, where at least six people have died in an outbreak at a nursing facility in the Seattle suburb of Kirkland. More than $3 billion of the spending bill money is intended for research and development into vaccines, test kits and treatments. There are no so far no approved vaccines or treatments for the illness, which began in China and has spread to some 80 countries and territories. After signing the bill, Trump said he may go to Atlanta after all, without giving any time frame. He said the White House was told someone at the agency had contracted the virus, suggesting that the trip was called off as a precaution. But Trump said the patient later tested negative. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, earlier acknowledged missteps by the administration in failing to get coronavirus test kits out quickly, but said the overall response was going well. “There were certainly some missteps in the beginning regarding getting tests out, some technical issues that slowed down the process,” he told NBC’s Today program. “Although there’s been a delay, in the next couple of weeks we should be ratcheted up to get many more out.” U.S. Vice President Mike Pence, tasked by Trump to lead the coronavirus response, on Thursday said there were not enough tests to meet demand going forward. The virus spread to four more U.S. states on Thursday – Colorado, Maryland, Tennessee and Texas – and the number of cases in New York doubled to 22, eight of which were connected to a Manhattan lawyer who lives in Westchester County, north of the city. On Thursday, a helicopter flew testing kits to a cruise liner idled off the coast of California and barred from docking in San Francisco after at least 35 people developed flu-like symptoms aboard the ship, which has been linked to two other confirmed cases of COVID-19. As in other countries, Americans faced a new reality where they were often asked to stay home from work, schools were closed, large gatherings and sporting events canceled, and stores emptied of staples like toiletries and water. Alphabet Inc’s Google on Thursday joined Amazon.com Inc, Facebook Inc and Microsoft Corp in recommending that its employees in the Seattle area work from home, after some contracted the virus.

A medic prepares a stretcher to transfer a patient into an ambulance at the Life Care Center of Kirkland, the long-term care facility linked to several confirmed coronavirus cases in the state, in Kirkland, Washington, U.S. March 5, 2020. (REUTERS/David Ryder) The death toll from the respiratory illness rose to 12 in the United States, with the latest fatality recorded in King County, Washington, where six people have died in an outbreak at a nursing facility in the Seattle suburb of Kirkland. “President Trump wanted me to be here today to make it crystal clear that we are with you. We are here to help,” Vice President Mike Pence said during a visit to the Seattle area, where he met with Governor Jay Inslee and other state officials. At least 57 new cases of coronavirus were confirmed nationwide on Thursday as the virus struck for the first time in Colorado, Maryland, Tennessee and Texas, as well as the city of San Francisco. At least several people suffering from the virus are said to be gravely ill. A helicopter flew testing kits to a cruise liner idled off the coast of California and barred from docking in San Francisco after at least 35 people developed flu-like symptoms aboard the ship, which has been linked to two other confirmed cases of COVID-19. Twenty new cases were confirmed in King County, which is home to Seattle and has been the site so far of the greatest concentration of coronavirus cases in the country, bringing the total in the county to 51 with 11 deaths. One death has been recorded in California. “This is a critical moment in the growing outbreak of COVID-19 in King County,” the county said in a statement. “All King County residents should follow public health recommendations. Together, we may potentially impact the spread of the disease in our community.” As in other countries, Americans faced a new reality where they were often asked to stay home from work, schools were closed, large gatherings and sporting events canceled, and stores emptied of staples like toiletries and water. Alphabet Inc’s Google on Thursday joined Amazon.com Inc, Facebook Inc and Microsoft Corp in recommending that its employees in the Seattle area work from home, after some contracted the virus. The companies’ work-from-home recommendation will affect more than 100,000 people in the area. One school district in the area has closed. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said the number of cases in that state had doubled to 22 after the federal government approved its use of additional laboratories, boosting testing capacity. Of the new cases in New York, eight are connected to a Manhattan lawyer who lives in Westchester County, north of the city, previously diagnosed with the virus. Texas and Maryland each confirmed three coronavirus cases, and Tennessee and Colorado each reported one, bringing the number of affected states to 17. Pence said that there were at least 150 cases of coronavirus in the country. More than 3,200 people worldwide have died from the respiratory illness that can lead to pneumonia. The U.S. Senate on Thursday passed an $8.3 billion bill to combat the outbreak 96-1, a day after the House of Representatives overwhelmingly approved it. Pence said Trump would sign the bill into law Friday. More than $3 billion of that money is intended for research and development into vaccines, test kits and treatments. There are no so far no approved vaccines or treatments for the illness, which began in China and has infected more than 95,000 people in some 80 countries and territories. California, which has declared a statewide emergency in response to the outbreak, reported six new cases, including two in San Francisco also deemed likely to be a result of “community transmission,” local health officials said. U.S. health officials say they expect to be able to get enough privately manufactured coronavirus tests, around one million, to public laboratories this week with the capacity to test about 400,000 people. CDC official Anne Schuchat said her agency would also supply kits by the end of the week that could test around 75,000 people. “Right now, it is a challenge if you are a doctor wanting to get somebody tested,” U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar told reporters following a briefing with lawmakers. “Unless you are ill, you have no need to buy a mask,” Pence said on a visit to Minnesota’s 3M Co, which has ramped up production of masks in response to the coronavirus. The deepening crisis has hit stocks hard. The main U.S. stock indexes closed down more than 3% on Thursday, with the Dow falling 969 points. Asked if the coronavirus outbreak has hurt the economy, Trump said at a townhall in Scranton, Pennsylvania: “It certainly might have an impact. At the same time, I have to say people are now staying in the United States spending their money in the U.S., and I like that.” Tags: ncov"

A medic prepares a stretcher to transfer a patient into an ambulance at the Life Care Center of Kirkland, the long-term care facility linked to several confirmed coronavirus cases in the state, in Kirkland, Washington, U.S. March 5, 2020. (REUTERS/David Ryder) The U.S. Federal Reserve has begun quarantining physical dollars that it repatriates from Asia before recirculating them in the U.S. financial system as a precautionary measure against spreading the virus, a Fed spokesperson told Reuters. She said regional Fed banks that help manage the money supply will set aside shipments of dollars from Asia for seven to 10 days before processing and redistributing them to financial institutions. The policy, first reported by Reuters, was implemented on Feb. 21, the official said. The outbreak originated in China and more than 100,000 people have been infected in over 85 countries, according to a Reuters tally based on statements from health ministries and government officials. According to the CDC, it “may be possible” to transmit the virus through objects that have had direct contact with it, but person-to-person contact is the main means of spreading the disease. The CDC recommends U.S. residents returning from China and other high-risk countries stay home for 14 days. The World Health Organization, however, has been much more cautious on risks posed by currency notes, advising consumers to use contactless payments whenever possible, according to several British media reports. As the global reserve currency, U.S. dollars are the most widely distributed notes in the world with around $1.75 trillion worth of cash in circulation globally, according to the Fed. Much that is circulated overseas, particularly in Asia where the dollar is often stronger than local currencies. It is also filthy. A 2014 study by researchers at New York University identified 3,000 types of bacteria on dollar bills due to how widely and frequently they change hands. The U.S. central bank has not gone as far as its counterparts in China and Korea, which have ordered local currency notes to be disinfected with ultraviolet light or destroyed altogether. But Fed officials are in regular contact with the CDC and State Department regarding the spread of the virus and are prepared to add other regions to its quarantine list, the spokesperson said. The 12 Fed banks from Richmond, Virginia to San Francisco are responsible for managing the supply of dollars and coins, accepting deposits of excess cash from banks across the world while doling out currency to institutions that request it. Some overseas banks ship their excess dollars back to the United States on commercial flights. The reserve banks process the currency they receive, including removing damaged notes from circulation and identifying counterfeit bills. It takes between five and 60 days for the Fed to process currency, with higher value notes being processed most quickly, the San Francisco Fed says on its website. On average, the Fed distributes $34 billion in paper notes every year, according to the San Francisco Fed. Tags: ncov"

Employees work at a mask factory in Icheon, South Korea, March 6, 2020. (REUTERS/Heo Ran) Last year the Icheon Production Center CNTUS-Sungjin Co. Ltd. manufactured 30 million face masks. Amid this year’s coronavirus outbreak, it has produced 19 million in January and February alone. “We are assuming we will run out of materials in 20 days,” said Kim Kyung-sig, who heads the centre. Across Asia, the spread of the coronavirus has sparked a run on masks in the hardest hit countries, as well as among those afraid that they could be next. Some governments, like those in Australia and Singapore, have urged their citizens not to buy or wear the masks unless they are sick. Other countries, like South Korea, have launched public information campaigns to encourage everyone to wear masks. Kim estimates that manufacturers in South Korea can produce just around 10 million masks a day combined, in a country of 50 million people. Conflicting messages have sowed confusion over how to protect against an epidemic that has claimed over 3,000 lives in China and spread to several dozen countries, with some experts saying wrong handling of masks could even increase infection risk. Regardless of government policies, however, there has been widespread reports of masks selling out, with even some hospitals struggling to procure enough for their staff. In South Korea – which has seen the largest outbreak outside of China, with 6,284 infections and 42 deaths – the government has imposed export restrictions on masks and urged factories to increase production. Masks made at the CNTUS-Sungjin centre have increased in wholesale price from 650 won ($.55) to 1,100 won ($.93). But Kim said the company wasn’t reaping much more money because the factory had hired 130 temporary workers in addition to the usual 70 full-time staff, and was now operating its production lines all day, every day. At one point after the virus began spreading in China, Chinese businessmen came to the factory and offered 5 billion won ($4.2 million) for every face mask they had, but the deal didn’t happen, Kim said. Kim Jae-yong, a 43-year-old facility operator at the factory, said he has been working 12 hour shifts every day of the week. “Every morning when I go to work, it reminds me of how important my job is to the direct safety and survival of the South Korean people,” he said. Other countries are also racing to increase mask supplies. On Tuesday the government in Thailand approved 225 million baht to produce 50 million cloth masks within 10 days. And Singapore has said it is looking to develop its local manufacturing of masks as other countries such as Taiwan banned the exports of masks. Under a new policy going into effect on Monday, people in South Korea will be able to buy two masks per week on certain days of the week based on their birth years. In China the country’s supreme court recently released guidelines saying that any disruptive hoarding or hiking of prices of masks, protection suits, disinfectants and other medical supplies could constitute a crime. Authorities in Thailand, meanwhile, have filed at least 51 criminal cases against shops accused of selling masks at inflated prices, and have placed distribution of newly manufactured masks under the Commerce Ministry. When the first cases of coronavirus emerged in Singapore in mid-January, panic buying of masks and hand sanitizers led the government to ration masks. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said on Thursday the government there will prohibit mask resales. Fourteen packages, containing a total of 620 masks, were on offer on Yahoo Japan’s auction site on Friday, for example, with the highest bid standing at 1,001,000 yen ($9,444). Yahoo Japan said on Wednesday it planned to ban auction-style sales of surgical masks from March 14, while allowing sellers to offer masks at fixed prices. Tags: ncov"

Those that require additional medical attention will receive it,” Pence told reporters at the White House. The outbreak has killed more than 3,400 people and spread across more than 90 nations, with seven countries reporting their first cases on Friday. The economic damage has also intensified, with business districts starting to empty and stock markets continuing to tumble. President Donald Trump on Friday signed a bill to provide $8.3 billion to bolster the capacity to test for coronavirus and fund other measures in the United States. Cases have now been reported in more than half of the 50 U.S. states. Fifteen people have died in the country. In many affected countries, people were being asked to stay home from work, schools were closed, large gatherings and sports and music events were canceled, stores were cleared of staples like toiletries and water, and face masks became a common sight. The World Health Organization (WHO) said every country should make containing the epidemic its top priority, pointing to Iran’s national action plan to combat one of the worst outbreaks after a slow start. Iran’s death toll from the virus jumped to 124, as more than 1,000 new cases were diagnosed over 24 hours. The Vatican reported its first case, a patient in its health services, worsening the prospects of the virus having already spread further in the Italian capital, since most employees in the walled city-state live in Rome, and those who live in the Vatican frequently go in and out to the city that surrounds it. Italy is the worst-hit European country, with a death toll as of Friday of 197.

South Korea on Saturday reported 174 additional cases from late Friday, taking the national tally to 6,767. Mainland China, where the outbreak started, reported 99 new confirmed cases but about a quarter of them came from outside the country, data showed. About 3.4% of confirmed cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, have died, far above seasonal flu’s fatality rate of under 1%, the WHO said this week. Supply chains broken  Moves by some major economies, including the United States, to cut interest rates and pledge funds to fight the epidemic have done little to allay fears about the spread of the disease and the economic fallout. Supply chains have been crippled around the world. “There’s concern that while there has been a response from the Fed, given the nature of the problem, is this something the central bank can really help with?” said John Davies, G10 rates strategist at Standard Chartered Bank in London. In New York, JPMorgan (JPM.N) divided its team between central locations and a secondary site in New Jersey, while Goldman Sachs (GS.N) sent some traders to nearby secondary offices in Greenwich, Connecticut, and Jersey City. Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) is splitting its trading force from Monday and sending 100 New York-based staff to nearby Stamford, Connecticut, sources familiar with the matter said. In London, Europe’s financial capital, the Canary Wharf district was unusually quiet. S&P Global’s large office stood empty after the company sent its 1,200 staff home, and HSBC asked around 100 people to work from home after a worker tested positive for the illness.

Pope Francis has not been seen in public since announcing during his traditional Sunday prayer before crowds on Saint Peter’s Square that he was skipping an annual spiritual refuge south of Rome because of a cold. He had been seen coughing and sniffing since last Wednesday. The pontiff has cut down his schedule and has spent most of his time at his Saint Martha’s guest house in the Vatican.

The employee had recently traveled to Italy, the European country most affected by COVID-19, which has killed more than 3,000 people worldwide, the vast majority in China. NATO said the employee and family members had not visited its Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE) facility in Mons, southern Belgium, since returning from Italy. “There are three confirmed COVID-19 cases within our wider SHAPE community,” NATO said in a statement. “The cases were ‘imported’ to Belgium following foreign travel and the affected individuals have not entered the SHAPE site since returning home.” After testing at hospital, the three were sent home where they are in quarantine, but they are not said to be seriously ill. SHAPE, the seat of NATO’s military commander, US General Tod Wolters, counts some 5,000 people in its “community” — including military and civilian staff and their families. As part of coronavirus precautions, travel by SHAPE officials has been restricted, with some meetings being held by phone or video conference rather than in person. Visitor access to NATO’s civilian headquarters in Brussels had already been limited, and military commanders given advice on preventing the spread of the virus. The news came as the United States and Israel scrapped the remainder of their Juniper Cobra 20 joint military exercise due to the virus outbreak. NATO has so far not cancelled any of the more than 20 exercises it has planned this year, but Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said the alliance was closely monitoring the outbreak. “NATO military medical staff remain vigilant. They are monitoring any potential impact for NATO troops deployed on operations,” an alliance official told AFP. The huge multinational US-led Defender 2020 exercises, involving 37,000 troops — 20,000 of them deploying from the United States to Europe — are also going ahead as planned.   Tags: ncov"

Ibig sabihin, may nagkakahawaan na sa loob ng bansa (This means the infections happen within the country),” Hontiveros declared. “This is a cause for concern and a wake-up call for our health officials. We should not give the public a false sense of security because the danger of local transmission is real,” Hontiveros said.

The World Health Organization (WHO) logo is pictured at the entrance of its headquarters in Geneva, January 25, 2015. (REUTERS / Pierre Albouy / MANILA BULLETIN) WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters in Geneva he was concerned that a “long list” of countries were not showing “the level of political commitment” needed to “match the level of the threat we all face.” “This is not a drill,” he said. More than 95,000 people have been infected and over 3,200 have died worldwide from the virus, which by Thursday had reached more than 80 countries and territories. Most deaths and infections are in China, where the virus first emerged late last year, prompting the country to quarantine entire cities, temporarily shut factories and close schools indefinitely. But it has quickly spread beyond China’s borders. “This epidemic is a threat for every country, rich and poor,” Tedros said, warning that “even the high-income countries should expect surprises.” He lamented that a number of countries did not appear to be taking the threat seriously enough, with many relegating the handling of the crisis to their health ministries. That approach is “wrong”, he said, pointing out that the crisis was affecting all parts of society, calling for a “whole of government approach.” He called on the heads of government in every country to take charge of the response and “coordinate all sectors.” What is needed, he said, is “aggressive preparedness.” Tedros rejected the assertion by some that the outbreak has reached pandemic proportions, insisting: “We are not yet there.” He said containing the outbreak was still possible and that that should be the main focus of the response. “This is not a time to give up. This is not a time for excuses,” he said. “This is a time for pulling out all the stops.” Tags: ncov"

General view of St. Peter’s Square after the Vatican reports its first case of coronavirus, at the Vatican, March 6, 2020. (REUTERS/Remo Casilli/MANILA BULLETIN FILE PHOTO) A Vatican source said the patient had participated in an international conference hosted by the Pontifical Academy of Life last week in a packed theatre several blocks from the Vatican. Participants at the three-day conference on Artificial Intelligence included top executives of US tech giants Microsoft and IBM. The academy issued a separate statement saying it was informing all other participants of the development by email but did not say it was the same person whose case was announced earlier by Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni. The discovery worsened the prospects of the virus having already spread further in the capital of Italy, since most Vatican employees live in Rome and those who live in the Vatican frequently enter and leave the city state. The death toll in Italy, the worst-hit European country, stood at 197 on Friday. The north of the country has been the most heavily hit. Bruni said the case was diagnosed on Thursday and that services in its clinics had been suspended to sanitize the areas. Most Vatican employees who use its health services live in Italy on the other side of the border with the 108-acre city state. Bruni gave no details on whether the person who tested positive was such an employee or among the relatively few clergy or guards who live inside its walls. Italian health authorities said that, as of Friday, 49 people had tested positive for coronavirus in Rome province. Pope Francis cancelled a Lent retreat for the first time in his papacy, but the Vatican has said he is suffering only from a cold that is “without symptoms related to other pathologies.” The Vatican has also said it is studying measures to modify the pope’s activities to avoid the spread of coronavirus in coordination with measures by the Italian government, which include encouraging people not to gather in large numbers. Tens of thousands of people flock to St. Peter’s Square every Sunday to listen to the pope give his weekly blessing and message from a window of the Vatican Apostolic Palace overlooking the square.

The clips, which have been circulating online since Thursday, show occupants of an apartment block in the city of Wuhan yelling “it’s all fake” from windows during an official neighborhood inspection by Vice Premier Sun Chunlan.  Many residents in the virus-hit city of Wuhan, China, are depending on online group-buying services to get food (AFP/File / STR / MANILA BULLETIN) According to Chinese media, the complaints were an outcry against the community’s property management, who were allegedly only pretending to have volunteers deliver vegetables and meat to inhabitants of the towers in the lockdowned city. Surprisingly, China’s censors, usually quick to scrub any criticism of government officials, have allowed the homemade videos to remain on Weibo, the country’s Twitter-like social media platform. But the central government appears to be seizing on the videos to craft a narrative that Beijing is listening to the demands of its people and that local authorities are to blame for the mistakes. State news agency Xinhua reported late Thursday that Sun has asked for “in-depth investigations” to address problems raised by Wuhan residents, although there is no mention of the video. The People’s Daily, the Communist Party mouthpiece, shared an edited version of one clip on Twitter, though it deleted the post on its English account while the Chinese version was still online. With no end in sight to the quarantine, which began in the city of 11 million people on January 23, many residents are depending on online group-buying services to get food. Supermarkets and neighbourhood committees have scrambled to fill orders as demand rocketed, but some residents have told AFP that not everyone has been happy with the price and quality of mass-purchased food. Families have had to depend on themselves for resources, despite official reassurances that supplies were being channeled to the struggling city. The nationalistic Global Times said Friday that the local government in Wuhan has been ordered to “investigate and solve the problem immediately”. It added that a central government guiding group for the epidemic urged local authorities to ensure there are supplies for residents soon after the incident. Meanwhile, Wuhan has launched an investigation in the community of over 3,000 to understand their concerns, added the Global Times. Officials ‘sufficiently worried’  Observers said the edited video tweeted by People’s Daily seemed to be downplaying discontent. Carl Minzner, an expert on Chinese law at Fordham Law School, tweeted Friday that the clip suggested only one resident was shouting, instead of more heard in a longer version of the video circulating online. He added that this suggests Party authorities were “sufficiently worried” about the original clip and suggestions of mass discontent in Wuhan that they came up with an alternative narrative. China has been making rare exceptions to allow for criticism online in the epidemic, but mostly when directed at local officials, as the Communist Party attempts to shield itself from public rage. In February, the death of whistleblowing doctor Li Wenliang, who had contracted the virus, had unleashed a wave of anger at how officials handled the crisis.

Japan has held the memorial ceremony for the 2011 disaster every year (AFP Photo/KAZUHIRO NOGI / MANILA BULLETIN) For the past eight years, the prime minister, lawmakers, and family members who lost loved ones in the disaster have attended the nationally televised ceremony. The move comes a day after Tokyo and Beijing confirmed a state visit by Chinese President Xi Jinping has been postponed, and Tokyo said the country will quarantine people coming from China and South Korea for two weeks on arrival. “We had been exploring ways to hold the commemoration ceremony up to the last minute, for example by downsizing the event,” top government spokesman Yoshihide Suga told reporters on Friday. “However, given the current situation, now is the time that we should do everything we can to prevent the spread of the infection, and we genuinely regret to report that today’s cabinet meeting decided to give up on holding the commemoration ceremony.” More than 18,500 people were killed or left missing after the massive tsunami triggered by a 9.0-magnitude underwater quake on March 11, 2011. The waves also swamped the emergency power supply at the Fukushima Daiichi power plant and sent its reactors into meltdown, sparking the worst global nuclear disaster since Chernobyl in 1986. “My heart is with the bereaved families, relatives, and friends, feeling regret over the loss of many irreplaceable lives,” Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said in a statement on the cancellation. The government will hold a minute of silence at 2:46 pm on March 11, exactly nine years after the massive quake shook seabeds off Japan, Abe said. No deaths were recorded as a direct result of the nuclear accident but more than 3,700 people — most of them from Fukushima — died from illness or suicide linked to the aftermath of the tragedy, according to government data, while tens of thousands remain displaced. The government has lifted evacuation orders for much of the region affected by the meltdown, except for some no-go zones with high radiation levels.   Tags: ncov"

The 70-year-old woman arrived in the Caribbean country on February 25 with her husband, who is not showing symptoms of COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus that first appeared in China late last year. The couple has been transferred from their hotel in Bayahibe, in the eastern part of the country, to a hospital isolation center in the capital Santo Domingo. The first known case of coronavirus infection in the Dominican Republic was discovered Sunday in a 62-year-old Italian tourist, who was also staying in Bayahibe. The man was hospitalized and is recovering, according to authorities. The country established airport and border controls to combat the spread of the virus when the outbreak first took hold in China’s Hubei province and has suspended flights from Milan for 30 days as the virus spreads near the Italian city. There have been nearly 98,000 infections and some 3,300 deaths in 85 countries and territories throughout the world, according to a count by AFP.   Tags: ncov"

(MANILA BULLETIN) San Juan City Mayor Francis Zamora said he had ordered the City Health Office to disinfect, sanitize, and to temporarily close to the public the prayer room in Barangay Greenhills, which the patient regularly visited. The Health department confirmed Friday two more cases of COVID-19 in the Philippines, which brought the total number of confirmed cases to five. Health Secretary Francisco Duque said the new cases involved two Filipinos—one was a 48-year-old man with a travel history to Japan, while the other was a 62-year-old man with no known history of travel overseas. Duque said the 62-year-old has regularly visited a Muslim prayer hall in Barangay Greenhills in San Juan City. “The Department of Health and the City Government of San Juan are now conducting contact tracing to determine who this patient has been in contact with since he displayed symptoms of COVID-19 during the last week of February,” Zamora said in a statement Friday.

(MANILA BULLETIN) DepEd – through its Task Force COVID-19 – has issued its Fourth Set of Policy Guidelines through memorandum no. 31 s. of 2020. Signed by Education Secretary Leonor Briones, the latest set of policy directives was issued to “reiterate and elaborate on previously issued measures” for the guidance of DepEd officials, personnel and staff at the central, regional and division offices and schools nationwide. The recent guidelines stressed that “all personnel are warned against traveling abroad without approved travel authority.” This, DepEd noted, is in compliance with memorandum from Executive Secretary dated January 3, 2018 which provides that “no government official or personnel shall be allowed to depart for any travel abroad, even if such is for a personal or private purposes without cost to the government unless such official or personnel has obtained the appropriate travel authorization.” DepEd noted that the travel measures and restrictions as stipulated in Enclosure No. 2 to DM 15, s. 2020, are “extended for the month of March 2020” and shall “continue to remain in effect” – subject to the latest updates and advisories on travel restrictions by concerned authorities. Briones, in the newly-issued guidelines, noted that the Central Office, Regional Offices, and School Division Offices are “instructed to strictly monitor adherence to these measures.” She also warned that “refusal to submit to these guidelines may result in the filing of administrative actions of misconduct, insubordination, dishonesty, and other related offenses.” Persons Under Monitoring Meanwhile, DepEd continues to monitor learners and personnel for possible cases of COVID-19. Based on the summary of referred suspected cases as cited in its COVID-19 Situational Report No. 35 as of March 5, DepEd is monitoring seven (7) learners, one supervisor, one non-teaching personnel and eight (8) teachers who are under mandatory self-quarantine. As of March 4, DepEd reported that one (1) non-teaching personnel in Calapan – who has travel history from South Korea – is under monitoring despite exhibiting “no signs and symptoms.” A Grade 10 learner in Calapan – who has travel history from Singapore – is also under self-quarantine. The learner, according to the City Health Office, does not exhibit any signs and symptoms of COVID-19. Meanwhile, DepEd is still monitoring 8 teachers, 1 supervisor and 6 learners in Dipolog City who are currently on a mandatory 14-day quarantine since arrival from South Korea on Feb. 26. While the said learners and DepEd personnel have “no signs and symptoms” of COVID-19, they were ordered by the Division Office to “self-quarantine.” DepEd noted that “some of them took the Manila-Dipolog air travel while some landed in Cebu and travelled via ship to Dipolog.” The public was alerted due to “non-compliance in travel protocol” of the personnel in Dipolog. DepEd earlier said that it is investigating the concerned personnel for possible violation of existing travel protocol. To date, DepEd has yet to provide new update regarding the said investigation.

Presidential Spokesperson Salvador Panelo (PCOO / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN) After two more coronavirus cases have been reported in the county, Presidential Spokesperson Salvador Panelo said the government has readied health protocols to contain the spread of the virus in the country. “There will be measures, which are already established protocols. In other words, there is no need for alarm or worry because we are ready. From the very start, we already said that,” he said in an interview with reporters at the Palace. Panelo likewise guaranteed that the government has been transparent in giving updates about the coronavirus situation in the country. He made the comment after Taiwan and Australia first reported about their virus-hit nationals after traveling from the Philippines. “We should all be transparent because it affects all of us,” he said. “We can’t please all people all the time but the government is doing its job.” The country has two new confirmed cases of COVID-19, bringing the total of cases to five. The Department of Health reported that the latest case involved a 48-year-old male Filipino with travel history to Japan. Another case involved a 62-year-old male Filipino with hypertension and diabetes but had no recent travel history. Health authorities have initiated contact tracing for the two cases. According to Panelo, the Palace trusts the competence of Health Secretary Francisco Duque in dealing with the latest health situation. He noted that Duque, who served as Health Secretary during the Arroyo administration, is a “very efficient” public servant. Panelo also said health authorities have managed to keep the virus at bay for a long time while other nations were grappling with the rise of cases of the coronavirus. “’Yung local transmission ngayon lang. Ang tagal din, ah. Samantalang ‘yung iba, ilang daan, libo na nga (The local transmission is only now. We had none for so long while other countries had hundreds, thousands of cases). “Sinabi ng experts hot temperature tayo tapos malinis pa ang Pilipino. Mahilig maligo, mag-wash ng hands, magtakip ng ilong kahit walang sakit (Experts said the country has a hot temperature and Filipinos are known to be cleanly, take frequent baths, wash their hands, and cover their noses even if they are not ill),” he said. He also said the World Health Organization has commended the Philippines’ effort to prevent the coronavirus from further spreading. On any new travel restrictions on coronavirus-hit places, Panelo said this will depend on the decision of the government’s inter-agency task force overseeing efforts to address the health emergency.

A priest closes the Church of the Nativity in the West Bank city of Bethlehem, as it goes into lockdown after virus cases are confirmed (AFP Photo/AHMAD GHARABLI / MANILA BULLETIN) The moves came after Palestinian authorities said seven cases had been confirmed in the Bethlehem area south of Jerusalem on Thursday and announced a 30-day state of emergency and the cancellation of large gatherings. All Israelis and Palestinians “are forbidden from entering or leaving the city”, the Israeli defense ministry said in a statement, adding the lockdown had been imposed “in coordination with the Palestinian Authority”. Israel controls all entrances to the West Bank from the Jewish state but the Palestinian government has limited autonomy in cities. The Church of the Nativity, built on the site that Christians believe was the birthplace of Jesus, was closed on Thursday and is among the sites expected to be shuttered until March 20. “We have decided to prevent the entry of tourists for a period of 14 days and to prevent hotels in all cities from receiving foreigners,” tourism minister Rula Maayah told AFP.
All travel between governorates without permission was now prohibited, Prime Minister Mohammed Shtayyeh told local TV. The Palestinian health ministry said the cases had first been detected at a hotel in the Bethlehem area. All were being treated in quarantine, it added. The head of the local health directorate, Imad Shahadeh, told AFP that a group of Greek tourists had visited the hotel in late February, with two later diagnosed with the virus.
A number of suspected cases have since been identified among hotel workers, he said. Government officials announced a series of measures in the occupied West Bank, also including the cancellation of large sporting events and other major gatherings. Asbed Balian, senior cleric of the Armenian church at the Church of the Nativity, said infected visitors had entered the site. “People affected by corona visited the church,” he told AFP. “It will be closed for 14 days and they are going to spray antiseptic.” Schools, universities and mosques in Bethlehem were also closed Thursday and the Palestine Marathon, scheduled for March 27, has been postponed. COGAT, the Israeli body responsible for civilian activities in the Palestinian Territories, said it was “working closely with the Palestinian Authority” to stem the spread of the virus. Israel, which so far has 16 confirmed cases of the disease, has imposed stringent measures on many European nations in a bid to contain the virus. Israel has also scrapped joint military exercises with the United States in Germany. The Israeli army announced that from noon Friday all forces would be prevented from leaving Israel, whether “on personal trips or on duty”. Tags: ncov"

State media propaganda videos show volunteers in hazmat suits driving pregnant women to hospitals (AFP/File / STR / MANILA BULLETIN) One new mother, surnamed Xie, told AFP she gave birth to her baby girl in Wuhan earlier this month alone, because nobody from her family was allowed to come with her to the hospital in the quarantined city where the outbreak emerged in December. With roads blocked, she had been unable to attend pre-natal checks and was afraid to go to hospitals for fear of cross-infection. “They let you out when you are delivering a baby,” Xie said, saying she had chosen a special gynaecology hospital to give birth. “When I got there, there was only one ward left,” she said. “During my time in the hospital I wore masks and gloves all the time and washed my hands very often. I seldom left my ward.” Some 56 million people in Wuhan and other cities in Hubei province have been under quarantine since late January. State media propaganda videos show volunteers in hazmat suits driving pregnant women to hospitals. But Xu Tingting from Huanggang told AFP she struggled to find a vehicle to get to hospital when she went into labour two weeks before her due date. “I was having contractions every 10 minutes, and asked my parents to take me to the hospital. It took them nearly two hours to find a car and I was panicking, thinking I’d have to deliver at home without assistance,” Xu told AFP. “My husband was in another city and wasn’t allowed to enter the town. It was the grocery store owner in our compound who finally agreed to take me in his delivery van.” Xie and Xu — who had a healthy boy — are also nervous about going out to vaccinate their newborns. “I still don’t know what to do yet. There’s still 20 days left for my baby to get vaccinated, I hope by then the situation is under control,” Xie said. ‘I am afraid’  With some 80,000 infections nationwide and over 2,900 deaths, it isn’t just in the virus epicentre where new mothers are scared. Beijing-based Angelika Fu, whose baby is due in two weeks, has chosen a private hospital despite the cost being 10 times higher. “We opted for a private hospital, although costlier, because we wanted to avoid crowds and feel safe,” she told AFP. She says she’s been trying to remain calm but that she had had “some hysterical moments”. “I think the situation is getting better and better and the risk of being infected in the hospital is much lower than a month ago. At least, that’s what I want to believe,” Fu said. Mental health service providers have also seen an uptick in the number of calls from anxious new mothers. “Over the last month, dozens of pregnant women and new mums have been calling us with stress or anxiety related concerns,” said a volunteer at Beijing International Christian Fellowship, which runs a mental health hotline, who wished to remain anonymous. “The uncertainty and disruption to normal life created by the epidemic was weighing down on many, in addition to the usual baby blues.” Parenting groups and play areas have also been closed. Theresa Ying delivered her baby in Beijing two days after Wuhan was placed in lockdown. “I was very nervous. We didn’t have enough information at the time about this virus and that caused a lot of stress,” she said. “For the baby’s first month vaccination, we asked a friend to buy the vaccine from Singapore and paid a nurse to come home and administer it. “It’s costly, but I am afraid to take my baby out.” Tags: ncov"

PRC said it has chosen to distribute masks to OFWs going to Hong Kong, because of the high number of cases recorded in that city. “The 5,500 OFWs were passengers of Cathay Pacific bound to Hong Kong from NAIA,” PRC said. According to PRC, wearing a mask is one of the effective ways not to get infected of the COVID-19. It has also reminded the public to practice frequent hand washing, and maintain a proper hygiene. As part of its information drive, PRC also placed tarpaulins at the airport containing reminders how to not get infected of the new disease.

History of the disease, its manner of transmission, prevention tips like proper handwashing and cough etiquette, treatment and updates from the Department of Health (DOH)were among the topics discussed during the forum. Lepanto Hospital Medical Director Dr. Zerubabel Patena emphasized that community participation was vital in preventing the virus from spreading, and not to create panic and hysteria among the community members. “As medical practitioners, it is our responsibility to inform the public. Our aim here is for the students, faculty members and parents to be reminded of how we can prevent the transmission of the disease with basic precautionary measures like simple hygiene and eating healthy”, Patena said. Natalie Lagan, principal of Marivic Elementary School in Barangay Sapid, was grateful to the company for reaching out to schools to equip not only their students, but also the teachers and parents with the proper knowledge to keep COVID-19 at bay. “We feel that the company really cares for the health and wellness of our students with activities like this.

Department of Health Secretary Francisco Duque III (Facebook) It likewise reported another coronavirus case, bringing the country’s number of COVID-19 cases to five. Despite the two new cases, Malacañang said there is no cause for alarm as the government is prepared to deal with an outbreak of the coronavirus in the country. Health Secretary Francisco Duque III revealed the two new coronavirus cases in a press briefing Friday. Duque said the 62-year-old man is known to have regularly visited a Muslim prayer hall in Barangay Greenhills in San Juan City. The patient, who already has hypertension and diabetes mellitus, experienced cough with phlegm last February 25. “The patient sought medical consultation at a hospital in Metro Manila last March 1 and was admitted with severe pneumonia. Specimen collected on March 4 tested positive for COVID-19 on March 5,” Duque said of the 62-year-old man currently admitted at the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) in Muntinlupa, City. “Previous visitors to the prayer hall who are presenting fever and/or respiratory symptoms are encouraged to call the DOH hotline (02)8-651-7800 loc. 1149-1150 for proper referral to the appropriate health facility,” Duque said. Health Assistant Secretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said a relative of the patient, who had close contact with the 62-year-old man, has also manifested symptoms of respiratory illness. “We already have one relative, which has been with the patient all throughout, who has experienced symptoms, and is now with him in our referral hospital. The specimen was collected and we’re just awaiting results,” said Vergeire. Contact-tracing in San Juan The local government of San Juan City and the Department of Health (DOH) has started conducting the contact-tracing to identify those who have come in contact with a 62-year-old man that tested positive for COVID-19. San Juan City Mayor Francis Zamora said he has already ordered the City Health Office to disinfect, sanitize, and to temporarily close to the public the prayer room in Barangay Greenhills, which the patient regularly visits. Although the 62-year-old man is the first local COVID-19 case, Duque said that there is still no local transmission of the coronavirus in the Philippines yet. “There is no transmission to speak of as of yet because we only have one. That’s why we are doing contact tracing so as to establish whether or not there are now cases or clustering of cases. But now, it’s premature to say there is local transmission,” said Duque. However, World Health Organization (WHO) Country Representative Dr. Rabindra Abeyasinghe said that there’s likelihood that the country is now “seeing local transmission.” “It may be that you are seeing local transmission but we need to be clear,” said Abeyasinghe in an ambush interview. “We don’t know the point of contact, whether it was from a foreigner, a local contact, or other contaminated source. We also don’t know whether that patient has transmitted the infection to other people. At this point, we are not sure whether we are looking at an isolated case or a cluster of cases. But a cluster of cases doesn’t mean that you are having widespread local transmission,” he said. Meanwhile, the other new COVID-19 case in the Philippines is a 48-year-old Filipino lawyer who has a history of travel to Japan. He returned to the country last February 25 and started experiencing chills and fever on March 3. “The patient sought medical consultation at a hospital and samples were collected for testing. Results tested positive for COVID-19 on March 5. He is currently stable and admitted at the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine,” said Duque. Duque said that they are now conducting contact tracing for the two new cases. “The priority intervention is the contact tracing. We will have to wait for the results of the contact tracing and coordination with local government units,” he said. PH ready – Panelo With the two new coronavirus cases, Presidential spokesman Salvador Panelo said the government has readied health protocols to contain the spread of the virus in the country. “There will be measures, which are already established protocols. In other words, there is no need for alarm or worry because we are ready. From the very start, we already said that,” he said in an interview with reporters at the Palace. Panelo, likewise, guaranteed that the government has been transparent in giving updates about the coronavirus situation in the country. He made the comment after Taiwan and Australia first reported about their virus-hit nationals after traveling from the Philippines. “We should all be transparent because it affects all of us,” he said. “We can’t please all people all the time but the government is doing its job.” Duque said they cannot confirm yet if the three foreigners, who tested positive for COVID-19 abroad, had contracted the disease during their visit to the Philippines. The first case involved a 38-year-old Taiwanese male who visited the Philippines from February 28 to March 3. Duque said the man developed abdominal discomfort and diarrhea on March 2, and experienced sore throat, fever, and malaise on March 3. “The patient consulted at an outpatient clinic in Taiwan on March 4, and was confirmed positive for COVID-19 on March 5. The onset of symptoms on March 2 points to possible infection before the patient traveled to the Philippines,” said Duque. “We recognize that the incubation phase of the disease is known to be two to 14 days. But in the majority of the cases, it’s six to seven days. So it’s very likely that this person got infected before or during travel to Philippines. So the timeline points to possible earlier infection,” Abeyasinghe said of Taiwanese’s case. The second case is a 44-year-old Japanese man who visited the country from February 21 to 28. Prior to visiting the Philippines, he traveled to Cambodia, Vietnam, Thailand, and Japan, the Duque said. Duque said the man had stayed at three different hotels during his visit to Metro Manila. The man flew back to Thailand last February 28 and experienced cough, shortness of breath, and fever which began on February 29. He had a consultation at a clinic in Cambodia on March 3 and was referred to a hospital but no tests were done, said Duque. He flew back to Japan last March 4 and was tested positive for COVID-19. He is currently admitted and is still in isolation at Aichi Prefecture Hospital. “The extensive travel history of the patient suggests possible contraction of the disease in another country,” said Duque. Abeyasinghe agreed, saying the Japanese man “was travelling extensively between many countries for occupational reasons. We need to recognize that he spent several days in Vietnam, Thailand, and he has been going in and out of Japan also. Infection could have actually happened in any of these countries.” The third case is a woman living in Sydney, Australia, who attended a wedding in Manila on February 13 and visited Pangasinan. “The patient left the country for Sydney on March 2, and was confirmed with COVID-19 by the New South Wales government on March 3. As for this case, DOH is still verifying information with the International Health Regulation National Focal Point Australia,” said Duque. Vergeire said they are now also conducting contact tracing for these cases. “We have three foreign nationals who are back in their country already. We will just trace back the places they went to and the people they have been with. We will have different situations but, definitely, the standard protocols will still be the same,” she said. (With a report from Jhon Aldrin Casinas) Tags: ncov"

Medical staff distribute information sheets to Iraqi passengers returning from Iran at Najaf International Airport (AFP / Haidar HAMDANI / MANILA BULLETIN) Global markets tumbled again over concerns about the impact on the economy and as countries took more drastic steps to prevent contagion of a disease that has killed more than 3,300 people and infected nearly 100,000 in about 85 nations. Cases soared in Italy, France, Greece and Iran, while a cruise ship was held off the coast of California to test passengers showing symptoms of the disease — echoing a harrowing episode in Japan several weeks ago that saw hundreds infected on a luxury liner. The epidemic has wreaked havoc on international business, tourism, sports events and schools, with almost 300 million students sent home worldwide. Even religion is affected: The Vatican said Pope Francis may have to change his schedule, Bethlehem was placed under lockdown, and Saudi Arabia emptied Islam’s holiest site in Mecca to sterilize it. China — where the virus emerged late last year — still accounts for the majority of cases and deaths, but infections are now rising faster abroad, with South Korea, Iran and Italy major hotspots. The World Health Organization warned Thursday that a “long list” of countries were not showing “the level of political commitment” needed to “match the level of the threat we all face”. “This is not a drill,” WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters. “This epidemic is a threat for every country, rich and poor.” Tedros called on the heads of government in every country to take charge of the response and “coordinate all sectors”, rather than leaving it to health ministries. What is needed, he said, is “aggressive preparedness”. In the United States, the largest nursing union said a survey of thousands of nurses at hospitals showed “truly disturbing” results. “They show that a large percentage of our nation’s hospitals are unprepared to safely handle COVID-19,” said Jane Thomason, a hygiene specialist with the union. Nurses are working without necessary personal protective equipment and lack education and training for handling the disease, said National Nurses United director Bonnie Castillo. Emergency spending  The US Congress passed an emergency $8.3 billion spending bill to combat the coronavirus Thursday as cases surged in the country’s northwest and deaths reached 12. More than 180 people are infected in the US. But President Donald Trump has downplayed the risk, saying the WHO’s conclusion of a 3.4 percent mortality rate was “false”. Admiral Brett Giroir, the assistant secretary of health, estimated the death rate at “somewhere between 0.1 percent and one percent” — closer to the seasonal flu — due to a high number of unreported cases. A National Guard helicopter dropped test kits on the deck of the Grand Princess cruise ship off the coast of San Francisco to determine if any of the nearly 3,500 guests and crew had contracted the new coronavirus. Health officials sounded the alarm after two passengers who had been on board during a previous voyage later fell ill, and one of them died. The ship belongs to Princess Cruises, the company that operated the Diamond Princess — the coronavirus-stricken ship held off Japan last month from which more than 700 people tested positive and six died.

Despite being cited by the World Health Organization (WHO) on its measures in containing the spread, Andanar said the Philippine government will continue its campaigns and undertakings against COVID-19, including its information drive and the readiness of health facilities to address positive cases of the disease. “These actions are part of our commitment to ensure the health and safety of our citizens and that the Philippines is doing its part in the worldwide effort to fight this viral outbreak,” he said. Andanar urged the public to cooperate and take precautionary measures established by the Department of Health (DOH). “We again ask everyone to continue to cooperate, heed, and observe all precautionary measures by our health department along with other advisories by other concerned agencies,” he said. “Preventing the spread of this health concern is something that cannot be done independently, but one that must be addressed collectively,” he added.

The DFA has yet to confirm if there are Filipino passengers onboard the Bahamas-flagged cruise ship that is supposedly headed to Hawaii. Grand Princess is now being monitored by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Protection (CDC) while testing of samples from some of its passengers and crew members are being conducted in a laboratory in Richmond, California. “As of the moment, there are passengers and crew of unidentified nationalities who are exhibiting symptoms and are being tested accordingly,” Meñez said.   Tags: ncov"

But on a recent weekday, many lunchtime tables were empty, a sign of the toll that the coronavirus is taking on tourism.  FILE PHOTO: Tourists wearing face masks walk past Kaminarimon Gate as they visit Sensoji temple in Tokyo, Japan January 31, 2020. (REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon/MANILA BULLETIN) For Japanese who have grown dependent on Chinese tourists for business, like waiter Kiyotake Watanabe, it marks a disconcerting trend. “People on group tours would gather together at noon, and 10 or 20 of them would come in all at once,” Watanabe, who works at a Chinese restaurant in the shopping center, told Reuters. Those customers evaporated after China in January banned overseas group tours. Just months ahead of the 2020 Olympics, the jolt to tourism may presage a broader economic impact from the coronavirus for both Japan and the global economy. Japan could be at particular risk because of its increased reliance on Chinese tourism under Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s “Abenomics” policies. Nomura Securities had forecast a 240 billion yen ($2.3 billion) bump from event-related tourism in 2020, which it said would evaporate if the Olympics were canceled, although organizers have said delaying or moving the games is not an option. Last year, Japan hosted 31.9 million foreign visitors, who spent 4.81 trillion yen. The flu-like virus SARS-CoV-2 has spread to about 80 countries after emerging in central China late last year and has hurt global tourism, air travel and events. About 98,000 people have been infected and 3,300 killed worldwide. Although most cases are in China, more new infections are appearing outside that country. There are no official tourism figures from February yet, but some analysts – and anecdotal evidence from people in the tourism industry – suggest that arrivals from Asia alone are likely to be down by at least half. “You’ve got that negativity that is going to percolate through the system,” said Jesper Koll, a senior adviser at WisdomTree Investments. The hit to economic growth from slowing inbound tourism could be a quarter of a percentage point or more, he said. ‘EXPLOSIVE SHOPPING’ For Japan, which has seen more than 1,000 confirmed infections, 2020 was supposed to be a record year for foreign arrivals and a boon for an economy already on the brink of recession. About 9.5 million of Japan’s foreign visitors last year were Chinese, a number that has risen more than six-fold over the past seven years. And Chinese visitors spend more than others, accounting for 30% of tourists but 37% of tourist spending last year, according to Japan Tourism Agency data. At a shop near Watanabe’s restaurant, the shelves were lined with rice cookers, sake cups and beauty products such as lipstick usually popular with Chinese tourists, who are known for their “bakugai” or “explosive shopping” sprees. But there were few customers. Shop workers chatted with each other in the nearly empty store. On Wednesday, Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said the outbreak has hurt consumption through a decline in Chinese tourists. The pain could worsen after Abe on Thursday said the government would suspend existing visas for visitors from China and South Korea and quarantine them for two weeks. HOTELS SQUEEZED In the central prefecture of Shizuoka, home to Mt Fuji, Chinese account for as much as 70% of foreign tourists. Some 90,000 people, mostly Chinese, have canceled hotel and ryokan inn bookings for the first three months of this year, according to the local tourism association. That represents about a third of the total bookings by Chinese tourists during the period. In response, the prefecture has made it easier for tourism-dependent businesses to get loans, said Mitsuhiro Sasamatsu of the local government’s tourism policy division. But some hotels that are dependent on Chinese tourists are temporarily shutting down. “For them, it is better cost-wise to shut down completely than to have the business open for few guests,” Sasamatsu said. About 80,000 new rooms are expected to open in nine major cities between 2019 and 2021, according to a June report from CBRE, a property research firm. Even before the coronavirus, the supply of rooms in all nine was forecast to outstrip demand, according to CBRE. This week, H.I.S. Co (9603.T), Japan’s largest listed travel agent by revenue, said it expected a full-year loss, rather than a profit, citing the coronavirus impact. Yoshio Adachi, who guides tourists around Yokohama’s bay area in a custom tuk tuk imported from Thailand, reckons the number of Chinese tourists has fallen by as much 60% since the outbreak. He is hoping that a bid to host a casino resort in the city, Japan’s second largest, will pan out and lead to more tourists. “The Olympics will be a one off, so the economy will need to come back after that,” he said.

Empty tables are pictured outside a restaurant at St Mark’s Square, which is usually full of tourists, after Italy’s government adopted a decree with emergency new measures to contain the coronavirus, in Venice, Italy, March 5, 2020. (REUTERS/Manuel Silvestri/MANILA BULLETIN) The government, which has imposed draconian measures to try to contain the outbreak, said it would double the money pledged to help the economy cope with the impact of the epidemic. The accumulative number of cases in the country totaled 3,858, up from 3,089 on Wednesday. The increase in both the number of deaths and the number of infections was by far the largest since the outbreak began in northern regions two weeks ago. As the strain on hospitals increased, the northern Lombardy region, Italy’s industrial and financial heartland that has reported by far the highest number of patients and deaths, told inhabitants not to go to hospital with anything other than urgent problems. The epidemic is focused on a handful of hotspots in the north of Italy. However, cases have now been confirmed in each of the country’s 20 regions, with 44 in central Lazio around Rome, and 45 in southern Campania, around Naples. “We are asking the country for unity, we are all in the same boat and we need to work together otherwise it will be hard to overcome this crisis,” Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte told a news conference. On Wednesday the government shut all schools until March 15, closed cinemas and theaters for longer periods and ordered that sporting events, including top flight Serie A soccer matches, be played in empty stadiums. On Thursday Italy announced it had canceled a rugby match with England, part of the Six Nations Championship, which had been scheduled for March 14. STIMULUS PACKAGE Economy Minister Roberto Gualtieri said the government would spend 7.5 billion euros ($8.4 billion) on the emergency and told the European Commission it would raise this year’s deficit goal to 2.5% of national output from the current 2.2% target. Just four days ago the minister had promised a smaller package worth 3.6 billion euros, a sum that the opposition and much of Italy’s media deemed inadequate. Civil Protection Agency chief Angelo Borrelli said more than 3.8% of those who had tested positive in Italy had died, up from 3.5% on Wednesday. In a video message to the nation, the head of state Sergio Mattarella called on Italians to remain calm. “Without alarmism, we must have confidence in our abilities and resources, we can and we must have faith in Italy,” he said. The government postponed a referendum over legislation to cut the number of parliamentarians that was slated for March 29, due to the coronavirus epidemic, without setting a new date. The delay reduces the possibility of an early election this year, a prospect often mooted due to persistent squabbling in the ruling coalition dominated by the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and the centre-left Democratic Party (PD). The referendum is widely expected to pass, in which case various time-consuming changes would be needed to re-draw electoral boundaries and adjust the voting system. Ordinary political business has ground to a halt, with the Chamber of Deputies in Rome announcing it will only meet once per week to deal with emergency matters. National statistics bureau ISTAT, also based in Rome, said it had suspended presentations of economic data to reporters, with future releases to be emailed directly to newsrooms. Tags: ncov"

The Senate gave sweeping bipartisan support to the funding a day after the House passed the bill, so that it could be quickly sent to the White House for President Donald Trump’s signature. “The American people are looking for leadership, they want assurance their government is up to the task of protecting the health and safety,” said Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy. The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases has surged, particularly in northwest Washington state where another person succumbed to the illness, bringing the US death toll to 12. There have been more than 180 confirmed cases nationwide, according to an AFP tally. Health workers meanwhile began testing 35 or so people on board the Grand Princess cruise ship who have shown flu-like symptoms, after one 71-year-old man who was on a previous voyage died from the virus. There are nearly 3,500 passengers and crew on the vessel, which cut short its voyage back from Hawaii after the passengers began to fall ill. Though not everyone was being tested, they will be isolated once the ship is finally allowed to dock, an official said. One of the passengers contacted by AFP said there was no panic on board and people seemed to be taking the setback in stride. “I can’t get over how the news is sensationalizing our ship,” said Carolyn Wright, 63, a professional photographer from New Mexico. “There were two cases on the previous cruise and they act like everybody on board has the plague.” She said passengers were told around midday on Thursday to remain in their cabins and that test results would be released early Friday. The Grand Princess belongs to Princess Cruises, the same company which operated the Diamond Princess — the coronavirus-stricken ship held off Japan last month from which more than 700 people tested positive and six died. On Thursday, Washington state officials announced a jump in cases, from 39 to more than 70. Eleven of the 12 deaths have been reported there, with the other in California. Tech firms in Seattle like Amazon, Facebook and Google were telling employees to work remotely, as was Microsoft in nearby Richmond. Some schools in the state have also decided to close for a couple weeks and hold classes online. Vice President Mike Pence, the White House pointman on the crisis, was due to visit the state. US officials continue to stress that the overall risk to the public remains low and are urging people not to panic or buy masks — which could create a shortage for those who require them. The scientific data so far shows that elderly people and those with underlying conditions are most at risk of serious illness and the majority of deaths have occurred in a Seattle-area nursing home. But the largest nursing union in the US denounced Thursday the “disturbing” lack of preparation at many hospitals. Nurses are working without necessary personal protective equipment and lack education and training for handling the disease, said National Nurses United director Bonnie Castillo. “It is not a successful strategy to leave nurses and other health workers unprotected,” she said. Earlier, a top health official said the overall mortality rate for the novel coronavirus was lower than previously thought. “The best estimates now of the overall mortality rate for COVID-19 is somewhere between 0.1 percent and one percent,” Admiral Brett Giroir, the assistant secretary of health said at a news briefing. He explained the new figure, far lower than previous estimates of 2 to 5 percent, by saying that there had been a significant underreporting of cases. Tags: ncov"

Some of them, who have shown flu-like symptoms, were being tested after one 71-year-old man who had been on board during a previous voyage died from the virus. The ship had been due to dock in San Francisco on Wednesday but was prevented from doing so. Officials said there were 2,383 passengers and 1,100 crew on the ship, which cut short its voyage back from Hawaii after passengers and crew members developed symptoms. Among the passengers are 62 who remained on board from the earlier Mexico voyage and were already being restricted to their cabins, the Princess Cruises company said in a statement to AFP on Wednesday. One of the passengers contacted by AFP said there was no panic on board and people seemed to be taking the setback in stride. “I can’t get over how the news is sensationalizing our ship,” said Carolyn Wright, 63, a professional photographer from New Mexico traveling with a friend. “There were two cases on the previous cruise and they act like everybody on board has the plague.” She said passengers were told to stay in their cabins and that test results would be released early Friday. “I think it’s all closing the barn after the horse has left,” Wright said via text messages. “I’m not really worried. If you look at the odds, our risk is pretty low.” She said passengers were in good spirits “although that may change if we are stuck in our cabins for too long.” “Everybody I have seen on deck has been very calm and matter of fact, just taking it all in stride,” she said. “The great majority of folks on the ship are over 60 and up to their 90’s, and most are experienced cruisers.” Health officials said it was unclear as of yet when or where the ship would be allowed to dock. Various agencies “are working to determine if COVID-19 is present on the ship,” Mary Ellen Carroll, the head of the San Francisco Department of Emergency Management, told reporters, referring to the formal name of the virus. She said 35 people had shown flu-like symptoms during the 15-day cruise, but many have already recovered. “Testing protocols are being put into place on the ship for those passengers and crew that have shown flu-like symptoms or may have been exposed to the virus, and that is happening today,” she added. Carroll said once test results are back, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and California state officials will determine the most appropriate location for the ship to berth. “The location needs to provide for the safety of the surrounding community, as well as the passengers and crew,” she said. “The CDC and the state are considering a number of locations, including San Francisco.” On Wednesday, California Governor Gavin Newsom said 11 passengers and 10 crew members were potentially infected with the virus that emerged in China late last year and has spread worldwide, killing more than 3,000 people.

Workers, some wearing protective face masks, cross London Bridge during the morning rush hour in London, Britain, March 5, 2020. (REUTERS/Toby Melville/MANILA BULLETIN) Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he is optimistic that Britain is well prepared to cope with the spread of the virus, but early on Thursday regional airline Flybe became one of the first big corporate casualties of the outbreak. The government set out its action plan earlier this week based on four stages – containing the virus, delaying its transmission, researching its origins and mitigating its impact. Whitty, questioned by lawmakers, said Britain had mainly moved into the second stage of delaying transmission and was now considering measures to try to reduce the peak of an epidemic which officials are anticipating in the coming weeks. “The original plan … was very much predicated on the idea of ‘if it could be controlled in China and contained everywhere else, this virus might go away’. I think the chances of that happening are now very slim. Slim to zero,” Whitty said. “As time goes by, we then may start to move into the more socially determined actions … We’ve moved from a situation where we were mainly in contain … to now we’re basically mainly delay.” The government has said it could encourage home-working, cancel large-scale gatherings and possibly close schools to slow the spread of the disease and delay the peak of the outbreak until summer, when the health service is under less pressure. Whitty also said, with older people more vulnerable to the virus, there may be measures to encourage them to stay away from public places, such as the upper house of parliament, the House of Lords.

North Korea’s leader Kim Jong Un (AFP / MANILA BULLETIN FILE PHOTO) Pyongyang has imposed strict restrictions and closed its borders to try to prevent an outbreak and insists it has not had a single case of the novel coronavirus which emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan and has since spread around the world. The South has reported the largest number of cases in the world outside China and its total passed 6,000 Thursday. In his letter to President Moon Jae-in, Kim “conveyed his message of comfort to the South Korean people who are battling against the outbreak”, said Yoon Do-han, a senior official at the presidential Blue House. Kim said he was “worried” about Moon’s own health, Yoon added, and “underlined his unwavering friendship and trust towards” Seoul. It was a marked contrast to the statement issued on Tuesday by Kim’s sister Kim Yo Jong, one of his closest advisers, when she said Seoul’s condemnation of military drills by the North was a “truly senseless act” and “perfectly foolish”. She likened it to “a frightened dog barking”. “Such incoherent assertion and actions made by Chongwadae only magnify our distrust, hatred and scorn for the south side as a whole,” she added, referring to the Blue House. On Monday the nuclear-armed North fired what the South’s military said appeared to be two short-range ballistic missiles, which it is banned from testing under UN Security Council resolutions that impose multiple sanctions over its weapons programmes. The launch came days after the one-year anniversary of the collapsed Hanoi summit between US President Donald Trump and Kim. Negotiations have since been at a standstill and Pyongyang has repeatedly lashed out at the South, saying it has “nothing to talk” about any more with Seoul. Tags: ncov"

India, Pakistan and Bangladesh are home to some 1.7 billion people, or more than a fifth of the world’s population, but their over-stretched health systems could struggle to handle the type of intensive care required for coronavirus patients. On top of that, a prevalence of existing health problems such as diabetes could spell trouble while the sort of sweeping restrictions China has imposed to stifle the virus would be hugely difficult in South Asia’s more unruly cities. “The way Indian society is structured, the kind of lockdown that many countries including China and Japan have instituted, is pretty much impossible even under good circumstances,” said Vivekanand Jha, executive director of the George Institute for Public Health, in New Delhi. India’s total confirmed coronavirus rose to 29 on Wednesday, from six early this week. The coronavirus, which emerged in China late last year, has infected more than 95,000 people globally, and killed more than 3,200, most of them in China. Some health experts fear that even with the recent spike in cases, India’s actual tally could be much bigger. “There is a strong possibility that the number of cases in India is much higher than what has been detected,” Arunkumar G., director of the Manipal Institute of Virology, said, citing a virus incubation of up to two weeks. Fears were fanned this week when India’s health minister disclosed that 16 foreign tourists who have tested positive had been touring since mid-February. Last week, U.S. intelligence sources told Reuters that India’s available countermeasures and the potential for the virus to spread its dense population was a focus of serious concern. India’s government says it has screened more than one million travelers, boosted its testing capabilities and set up isolation wards in all major cities with international airports. But 450 million of India’s 1.3 billion people are estimated to be migrants, with vast numbers packing its rail and road systems daily meaning controlling any spread would be a huge challenge. India’s high number of diabetics – 77 million – and high rates of problems like kidney disease could lead to higher morbidity, or protracted treatment, experts said. “One particular risk of India is the co-existence of other non-communicable disease epidemics,” Dr Rajib Dasgupta, who is a professor of community health at the Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government says it is confident of its ability to arrest the spread of the virus. “Coronavirus is a challenge, but the government of India has taken all initiatives to ensure that it is stopped,” said D.V. Sadananda Gowda, minister of chemicals, who oversees the pharmaceuticals sector. Neighboring Pakistan has found five coronavirus cases. A top health official was gloomy about the prospects of tackling a major outbreak. “We don’t have human resources, we don’t have the required inventory, we don’t have a capacity to cope with a big emergency with the given resources,” Shahid Malik, secretary general of the Pakistan Medical Association, told Reuters. Bangladesh has not confirmed any cases of the coronavirus but five Bangladeshi workers have tested positive in Singapore. Bangladesh’s health ministry said more than 300,000 people have been screened at airports and other border entry points. But one passenger was not impressed by what he considered lax screening upon arrival in the capital, Dhaka. “Many of us could skip the screening. Just imagine what would happen if someone infected with the virus enters. It’ll be a total disaster,” Farid Yamin, a Bangladeshi working in Singapore, told Reuters. Tags: ncov"

Taiwan says the World Health Organization’s (WHO) inclusion of the island as part of China’s virus area has mislead countries into believing the island’s virus situation is as serious as China’s.  Taiwan Foreign Minister Joseph Wu attends a news conference announcing Taiwan’s decision to terminate diplomatic ties with the Pacific island nation of Kiribati, in Taipei, Taiwan September 20, 2019. (REUTERS/I-Hwa Cheng/MANILA BULLETIN) Taiwan, which says it is an independent country and not part of China, has reported 42 cases and one death, compared with more than 80,000 cases and more than 3,000 deaths in China. Sarawak, on the island of Borneo, has separate immigration controls from the rest of Malaysia. This week it included Taiwan as part of its ban on visitors from China, then removed it after Taiwan complained, according to Taiwan’s foreign ministry. “After talks, Sarawak in Malaysia recognized Taiwan isn’t China & lifted its Coronavirus travel ban,” Taiwan Foreign Minister Joseph Wu said on Twitter. “Guess what? China forced Sarawak into banning Taiwan again! China takes joy in shoving Taiwan around & then expects gratitude for its Wuhan sacrifice. That’s sickening.” In Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said Taiwan’s ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) had “politicised” the issue. “China has always opposed the politicisation of the issue of prevention and control of the epidemic. We care about our Taiwan compatriots’ health and wellbeing. The DPP has politicized this issue, and really should be held in contempt,” he said, without elaborating. China has expressed displeasure with countries that ban Chinese travelers. Sarawak immigration authorities did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The virus crisis has worsened already-poor ties between China and Taiwan, which Beijing claims as its territory. Malaysia and Taiwan have close economic and cultural links, despite the absence of formal diplomatic ties. This is not the first time Taiwan has faced travel exclusions because of what Taiwan says is a mistaken link to China. Vietnam and the Philippines both lifted flight or travel bans on Taiwan after Taipei complained. Taiwan has been less successful in the case of Italy, whose ban on Chinese flights includes Taiwan. Taiwan is separately ruled from China and China has no say in the island’s health policy. Tags: ncov"

The dog has tested “weak positive” for the virus, which indicates a low level of infection, the Hong Kong Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) said on Wednesday. “The department will continue to closely monitor the dog … and repeat the test later. It will only be returned to its owner when the test result is negative,” the AFCD said in a statement. It said there is no evidence pets can be a source of infection. The World Health Organization website says there is no evidence so far that companion pets can be infected with the coronavirus. Other disease experts say it is possible, but as animals generally don’t tend to have symptoms, pets are unlikely to spread the virus further. “Some animals have the same receptor for Covid-19 so they can have the disease but…in general, animals are not symptomatic,” said Dale Fisher, a Singapore-based infectious diseases expert, who chairs the Global Outbreak Alert & Response Network coordinated by the WHO. “It’s possible but it’s certainly not proven and I’m sure it’s not going to drive the outbreak.” Animal health experts examining the Hong Kong case said pet owners should not be overly concerned and should not abandon their pets. Hong Kong has more than 100 confirmed cases of coronavirus, and two people have died. There are more than 95,300 cases worldwide, the majority in China, and more than 3,200 people have died, a Reuters tally shows. Tags: ncov"

He warned that the outbreak could temporarily affect the government’s revenues but he expected the pressure on the government’s fiscal position to ease as the economy recovered. He added that Beijing would roll out targeted and phased measures to help virus-hit sectors, without elaborating. China has said it would study phased tax cuts to help struggling small- and medium-sized firms facing difficulties because of the outbreak. China saw an uptick in new coronavirus cases on Thursday driven by more cases in Wuhan, the provincial capital of Hubei, where the virus is believed to have emerged in a market late last year. Some local governments were facing funding difficulties, said Liu Jinrun, an official at the finance ministry, during the briefing. Xu said that fiscal revenues in Hubei were relatively stable in January, but the situation worsened in February, when the province only had “sporadic” revenue. Xu said the ministry is stepping up transfer payments to local governments, especially those hit hard by the virus outbreak. Tags: ncov"

Alen Seranic said the man, who returned from Italy late last month, had been confirmed earlier this week as having coronavirus. He is in a stable condition and is being kept in isolation in hospital in the city of Banja Luka. “His wife tested negative for coronavirus but his child was found positive last night,” Seranic told a news conference in Banja Luka. Health authorities will test school children who have had contact with the infected child, as well as all other members of the infected family, he said. The school will be closed for the next couple of days. “This is the first case of infection that was not unexpected, it was expected after the outbreak in Italy, which is among our biggest trade partners,” Seranic said. Bosnia is divided into two regions, one dominated by Serbs and the other by Croats and Bosniak Muslims. So far the health authorities in the two regions have prepared hospital isolation rooms and urged citizens to be particularly careful with hygiene.

The daily gave no details on its source for the report, but said Prime Minister Shinzo Abe would announce the measures at a meeting later today of a cabinet-level task force on the outbreak. More than 95,000 people have been infected and over 3,200 have died worldwide from COVID-19, which has now reached some 80 countries and territories. The Yomiuri said the government will limit the landing of flights from China and South Korea to two airports, Narita and Kansai International. The arrival of passengers on ships will be suspended, the daily said. The reported decision comes as Japan steps up its response to the outbreak, which has infected over 1,000 people in Japan, including more than 700 on a cruise ship put in quarantine offshore. Six domestic deaths have been linked to the virus, along with six from the cruise ship. Abe’s government has come in for criticism of its response to the outbreak, particularly on the cruise ship, and in recent days has stepped up measures. Schools across the country have been closed and events cancelled after the government warned that the coming two weeks will be crucial to prevent a sustained, large-scale outbreak of the virus. The measures have impacted all types of events, including football matches, sumo bouts and music concerts. Other countries have also taken measures to block or limit arrivals from China, where the outbreak emerged, and nations suffering a large number of cases including South Korea, Iran and Italy. Japan had already banned the entry of people with recent travel to several centers of the outbreak, including two provinces in China and two parts of South Korea.   Tags: ncov"
,"March 5, 2020, 4:26 PM",nCov,Wuhan doctor recounts fears and hope at virus frontline,By Agence France-Presse,"By Agence France-Presse One month after makeshift hospitals opened to chaos and confusion at the epicenter of China’s coronavirus epidemic, frontline doctor Ma Yonggang is finally seeing more empty beds as fewer patients arrive. When 43-year-old Ma was first summoned to a sports stadium converted into a medical facility on February 4, it was a virtual construction site with electrical wiring and beds still being installed.  ` Separated from his wife and young child who had returned to eastern Shandong province for Lunar New Year, Ma said he felt “scared and anxious” when the call from the jury-rigged Wuchang hospital came in the middle of the night. But the situation has slowly improved, with the number of patients receiving treatment in the improvised hospital declining from a high of 760 in mid-February to 320 earlier this week. “We had 30-40 patients being discharged per day, but the number of patients admitted was only a dozen or so. This was when the whole situation changed for us,” Ma, who is the hospital’s deputy director, told AFP in a video call from Wuhan. “Now, we admit very few new patients and about three to four recovered patients are discharged each day.” The situation Ma described tallies with officials’ accounts of a slowdown in new infections in Wuhan, an industrial city of 11 million people where the virus is believed to have emerged at a market that sold wild animals. It was not always like this. AFP saw people standing in line for hours to see doctors in Wuhan’s hospitals during the first weeks of the crisis when the facilities lacked enough beds for the thousands of new patients. Conditions ‘were quite bad’  Hastily converted from sports stadiums, schools and cultural venues, Wuhan’s 16 makeshift “ark” hospitals were designed to ease the burden on the city’s overstretched healthcare system. But in the early stages of the outbreak, they also suffered from the same widespread shortages of medical protective supplies as the city’s designated hospitals, Ma said. The hospitals offer basic treatment and diagnosis for patients with mild to moderate symptoms, as well as simple recreational facilities. “When the hospital was opened, the facilities were only for controlling the outbreak, so the living conditions for patients and medical staff … were quite bad,” he said in the interview arranged by the State Council’s information office. “Now, the conditions have improved a lot, for example now we have patient exercise areas and bathrooms, and we have indoor heating and catering services.” Ma admitted that conditions fell short of patients’ expectations and those hoping for small rooms to themselves were not prepared for the open-plan layout of the makeshift hospital. “Once they arrived, they realized that there were several patients in a large open room and began to doubt whether they could be treated successfully,” he said. Mourning fallen doctors  More than 80,000 people have been infected and more than 3,000 killed by the new coronavirus in mainland China, with the majority in Wuhan. Chinese health authorities and a team of World Health Organization experts say that at least 3,000 Chinese medical workers have caught the virus — mostly in Wuhan — and at least 11 have lost their lives. But according to Ma, none of the medical workers at the city’s makeshift hospitals have been infected. The death last month of whistleblower Li Wenliang, a 34-year-old Wuhan ophthalmologist who was punished for trying to alert people to the outbreak in December, unleashed a torrent of grief and anger at the authorities. “We felt extremely sad at his death,” Ma said. “We will always mourn (Li and the other fallen doctors), and we must learn from them and dedicate ourselves even more to fighting the virus.” One of the latest victims was Li’s colleague, Mei Zhongming, who was deputy director of ophthalmology department at the central hospital and died from the virus on Tuesday.

Mainland China had 139 new confirmed cases as of Wednesday, the National Health Commission (NHC) said, bringing the total accumulated number of cases to 80,409. Authorities reported 119 new cases the previous day and 125 the day before that.  People wearing protective face masks walk past laundry hanging outside a house at a residential area in Wuhan, the epicentre of the novel coronavirus outbreak, Hubei province, China March 4, 2020. (REUTERS/Stringer/MANILA BULLETIN) The increase was driven by more cases in Wuhan, the provincial capital of Hubei, where the virus is believed to have emerged in a market late last year. Wuhan’s new infections climbed to 131 from 114 a day earlier. There was no immediate elaboration and health officials were due to hold a briefing later in the day. After what some critics said was an initially hesitant response to the new virus, China imposed sweeping restrictions to try to stop it, including transport suspensions, lockdowns of cities and extending a Lunar New Year holiday across the country. World Health Organization (WHO) officials have said other countries have much to learn from the way China has handled the outbreak and Vice Foreign Minister Ma Zhaoxu said many countries had asked for help and China was responding. The number of new confirmed cases in Hubei, excluding Wuhan, has remained in single digits for seven consecutive days, with three new infections recorded on Wednesday. In the rest of mainland China, outside Hubei, there were only five new confirmed cases, the health commission said. The death toll from the outbreak in mainland China had reached 3,012 as of the end of Wednesday, up by 31 from the previous day. Hubei accounted for all of the new deaths. In Wuhan, 23 people died. With the downward trend in new cases, Chinese authorities have turned their attention to stopping the virus being brought in from new coronavirus hot spots abroad. The number of new infections overseas now exceeds the tally of new cases in China, with Italy, South Korea and Iran, in particular, seeing worrying spreads of the virus. Authorities have asked overseas Chinese hoping to return home to reconsider their travel plans, while cities across the country have set up quarantine rules for those entering from high-risk places. An infected person is known to have arrived in China from Iran, one of the virus’ new hot spots, last week. The cities of Shanghai and Guangdong have ordered people who have been in countries with severe outbreaks within the previous two weeks to stay in quarantine for 14 days. The city of Chengdu in central Sichuan province said it was also ordering quarantine for such people. The NHC has said authorities were transitioning from “overall containment to targeted containment” measures, with a focus on containment within communities, and medical treatment. Ma told a briefing China would make donations to South Korea, Iraq, Cambodia and Sri Lanka, on top of what it has already given to Pakistan, Japan and Iran. China was also considering responding to WHO call for donations, he said. “Many of the countries which have requested for our help had actually helped us previously, so when we help these countries, it is to help them fight the virus, and also to repay their kindness,” Ma said.

South Korean soldiers in protective gear sanitize a street in Seoul, South Korea, March 5, 2020. (REUTERS/Kim Hong-Ji/MANILA BULLETIN) The South Korean government declared a “special care zone” around Gyeongsan, a city of about 275,000 people 250 kms (150 miles) southeast of Seoul, promising extra resources such as face masks and warning against travel there. Gyeongsan has seen a spike in new cases in recent days, many of them linked to a fringe Christian group at the center of the South Korean outbreak. Similar zones have been declared around neighboring Daegu city and Cheongdo County. About 75% of all cases in South Korea are in and around Daegu, the country’s fourth-largest city, according to the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC). “Every day is sad and tough like a war. But our Daegu citizens are showing surprise wisdom and courage,” Daegu Mayor Kwon Young-jin told reporters on Thursday. About 2,120 patients were waiting for hospital beds in Daegu, city officials said. Dozens of newly commissioned military nurses were due to begin work in the city on Thursday, the health ministry said. The KCDC reported five more deaths from the virus, bringing the total in the country to 37. The flu-like virus that emerged from China late last year has infected more than 95,300 people and killed almost 3,300 around the world, mostly in China, according to a Reuters tally. KCDC Deputy Director Kwon Jun-wook advised all South Koreans to stay home and avoid “any gatherings, especially those that take place in enclosed places with many people such as religious events”. He also advised employers in Asia’s fourth-largest economy, home to tech giants like Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, to work from home. U.S. Forces Korea (USFK) reported two new cases, for a total of six cases in soldiers, employees or people related to the roughly 28,500 troops stationed in South Korea. Despite the new cases, USFK had resumed sending troops to bases in Daegu and surrounding areas, according to military newspaper Stars and Stripes. Commanders believed the bases were protected from the outside population, and that the troop rotations were needed to maintain readiness in the face of continued threats from nuclear-armed North Korea, the newspaper reported. Australia’s move to ban the arrival of foreigners from South Korea is a blow to Seoul’s efforts to prevent the United States from imposing such restrictions. “It is a deeply regrettable step, and we will closely consult Australian authorities for a swift revocation of the measure and to minimise inconvenience for our citizens,” South Korean foreign ministry spokesman Kim In-chul told reporters. South Korean officials met the U.S. ambassador in Seoul on Wednesday to urge the United States not to limit travel. Similar talks would be held on Friday with diplomats from other nations, the foreign ministry said. According to the U.S. State Department, anyone with a fever of 100.4 F (38 C) is already banned from boarding direct flights from South Korea to the United States. Korean Air Lines said on Thursday it would screen all passengers departing Incheon airport for high temperatures and reject those deemed a risk. South Korea sent three “rapid response” teams to Vietnam on Thursday to assist more than 270 citizens quarantined in that country over coronavirus concerns, the foreign ministry said. Tags: ncov"

The UAE, which is closing schools and educational institutions for four weeks on March 8, said students and education workers would have to spend 14 days at home after returning from overseas. The Gulf Arab state is a major hub for international air travel and its Dubai airport is one of the world’s busiest. Dubai airport handled 86.4 million passengers last year, roughly 237,000 a day, most of whom were transiting. The UAE has reported at least 27 coronavirus cases.

Medical tests are already being conducted on passengers arriving from China, Italy, Lebanon, and Thailand at Dubai airport and entering the country, Emirates says on its website. Transit passengers are not being tested but will have their temperature checked before boarding their connecting flight, Emirates added. Passengers arriving and entering from Syria are also being tested, according to an internal Emirates staff email dated February 29 which mentions China, Italy and Lebanon but not Thailand. The test is a nasal swab and temperature check, it says.

,"March 5, 2020, 4:15 PM",nCov,Panic buying follows coronavirus across the globe,By Agence France-Presse,"By Agence France-Presse Shelves are being stripped bare of toilet rolls, hand sanitizer and surgical masks everywhere from Japan to France to the United States as panic buying crisscrosses the globe with the coronavirus, defying repeated calls for calm and disrupting supply chains. Obsessively documented on social media, scrambles to the shops and empty shelves are adding panic and confusion to the fight against an epidemic that has killed thousands, placed millions under quarantine and battered global markets.  Panic-buying is crisscrossing the globe with the coronavirus, defying repeated calls for calm and disrupting supply chains (AFP Photo/CHARLY TRIBALLEAU / MANILA BULLETIN) Australia’s biggest supermarket this week began rationing sales of toilet paper after police had to be called to a shop in Sydney when a knife was drawn in a scuffle over the scarce commodity. On Saturday Japan’s prime minister took to Twitter to calm fears of a national shortage, while social media photos from the US show toilet paper shelves lying bare. Psychologists say a mix of herd mentality and over-exposure to coverage of the virus is to blame. “We might be less irrational if we weren’t being reminded so much of the potential dangers by the news,” London-based consumer psychologist Kate Nightingale told AFP. “We either avoid the topic or we go completely nuts and stock up on anything we might just need.” Panic buying of non-medical items like toilet paper “gives people this sense of control that ‘I will have what I need when I want’,” Andy Yap, a psychologist and Charlene Chen, who specializes in marketing and business in Singapore told AFP in an email. The city-state experienced its own recent run on toilet paper, traceable, they said to a “believable” rumor of an impending shortage due to shutdowns in virus-stricken China, a major producer. Endlessly scrolling through social media also “distorts our perceptions and makes us think that things are a lot more serious than they truly are,” they said. As the uncertainty grows, they added, items such as surgical masks and hand sanitizer transform into “problem-solving goods… that seemingly help people gain control over the virus.” ‘The odd one out’ Single-use surgical masks that typically retail for just a few US cents are also hot property, exacerbated by restrictions on exports from China, the leading producer, as the government keeps more back for domestic usage. Last month ten thousand people queued outside a Hong Kong shop that had secured a shipment, and days later masks were voted the most desirable gifts to receive for Valentine’s Day. In London, masks are now going for more than 100 times their normal retail price, while French authorities said they will requisition all face mask stocks and production. The demand is being “driven by panic buying, stockpiling and speculation,” World Health Organization spokeswoman Fadela Chaib told AFP. This is despite the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention saying it did not “recommend the use of facemasks” to help combat the outbreak. But in crowded, paranoid cities where others are already wearing them, donning a mask can be comforting — if ineffective. “You don’t want to be the odd one out,” Nightingale said. “At the end of the day, we do need our social groups for survival so it’s a primal instinct to obey whatever needs that society imposes on us.” ‘Trusted faces’ As more countries report new cases, Yap and Chen said it was important for authorities to “re-establish control” over information and rumours that spark hoarding and panic-buying. “In times of uncertainty, it is good to set rules because rules provide a sense of order and control.” Governments also need to be clear in explaining any new rules and why they are important in the fight against the virus. But, Nightingale said, with distrust of health authorities on the rise in the West over mandatory vaccinations and with governments and companies “among the least trusted institutions,” this might be difficult. “Hiring trusted faces could help… David Attenborough might work for a certain kind of customer profile, like the over 40s. For younger profiles, you could turn to social media influencers.”   Tags: ncov"
,"March 5, 2020, 4:14 PM",nCov,Australian toilet paper truck catches fire sparking new tissue tizzy,By Reuters,"By Reuters A delivery truck carrying toilet paper has burst into flames in the Australian city of Brisbane, ratcheting up a sense of panic about the availability of the product generated by the coronavirus outbreak.  (REUTERS/MANILA BULLETIN) Shoppers have swept the shelves clean of toilet paper all week and supermarket chains Woolworths and Coles have had to limit the amount people can buy. The government has urged people not to stockpile it and Prime Minister Scott Morrison has even tried to calm consumers worries about the tissue, as Australia’s tally of coronavirus infections has climbed to 53. It has had two deaths. The truck caught fire after its engine exploded in the suburbs of Australia’s third-largest city late on Wednesday, police and firefighting services said. The driver escaped without injury and the cargo, including toilet paper, was also largely unaffected. The fire, nevertheless, grabbed headlines and added to growing worry about the availability of toilet paper, which Australia’s chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, tried again to ease on Thursday. “There is no reason to denude the shelves of lavatory paper in the supermarkets,” Murphy told a news conference in Canberra. Some media have taken the opportunity to poke fun at the toilet paper panic. The NT News, a newspaper known for its tongue-in-cheek antics, published eight blank pages in the middle of its Thursday edition saying it was giving readers what they needed. Toilet-paper-themed hashtags like #ToiletPaperEmergency and #ToiletPaperApocalypse have been popping up on Twitter all week. Jana Bowden, an associate professor of marketing at Macquarie University, said government calls for people not to panic-buy toilet paper might actually spur more hoarding. “When you place restriction notices in front of consumers, and they read for the first time in their entire lives that something like toilet paper, which they’ve always assumed to be a basic necessity, (is restricted), you think ‘that’s something I can’t live without, I must not live without, therefore I just stockpile’,” Bowden said.

,"March 5, 2020, 2:25 PM",nCov,Experts warn against DIY sanitizer,By Gabriela Baron,"By Gabriela Baron Fear of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 has led people to hoard the germ-killing gel, leaving store and shelves empty and online retailers charging sky-high prices. So some people have resorted to making their own hand sanitizer. But experts are warning against it. Recipes for DIY (do it yourself) hand sanitizer are all over the Internet. Even the World Health Organization (WHO) released an official guide to make one — however, it is intended for populations that do not have clean water of other medical-grade products available. If made correctly, DIY solution could be helpful and even effective. But if made incorrectly, according to a public health professor at the University of California, it can be harmful. “I worry about people making their own sanitizer as it will be difficult to make sure that the concentrations are correct,” Daniel Parker told CNN. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), for hand sanitizer to be effective, it must have at least 60 percent alcohol content. London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Sally Bloomfield said that most store products often have emollients to counter the harshness of the alcohol on the skin, DIY products may not and could hurt your hands. “It’s very unwise, dangerous even,” she underscored in an interview with The Guardian. Store-bought sanitizer will often have emollients to counter the harshness of the alcohol on the skin; DIY products may not, and could hurt your hands. Just wash your hands with warm or cold water and soap, it is more effective anyway, said the CDC. “Hand sanitizer will do. But keep in mind that it doesn’t kill all germs.” Tags: ncov"

USAID LOGO(MANILA BULLETIN) US Agency for International Development (USAID) Administrator Mark Green said the allocation from the agency’s Emergency Reserve Fund for Contagious Infectious Diseases will be provided to the World Health Organization (WHO) and other multilateral institutions and programs under USAID’s implementing partners. These funds, he said, are part of Washington’s pledge of up to $100 million which was announced last month by the US Department of State. At the same time, Green called on other donors to contribute to the effort of combatting COVID-19 “because an infectious-disease threat anywhere can be a threat everywhere.” Aside from the Philippines, the other high priority countries who will benefit from the funding are the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan; the Republics of Angola, Indonesia, Iraq, Kazakhstan, Kenya, South Africa, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Zambia, and Zimbabwe; the People’s Republic of Bangladesh; Burma; the Kingdom of Cambodia; the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia; the Kyrgyz Republic; the Lao People’s Democratic Republic; Mongolia; the Federal Republic of Nepal; the Federal Republic of Nigeria; the Islamic Republic of Pakistan; the Kingdom of Thailand; and the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. The USAID official explained that funds intended for the WHO, will help the governments of currently affected or at-risk developing countries prepare their laboratories for large-scale testing for COVID-19, implement a public-health emergency plan for points of entry, activate case-finding and event-based surveillance for influenza-like illnesses, train and equip rapid-response teams, investigate cases and trace the contacts of infected persons, and adapt training materials for health workers on COVID-19. On the other hand, funds that are going through USAID partners and programs will support six broad areas of work: laboratory-strengthening; surveillance for, and rapid response to, infectious diseases; risk-communications and engagement with communities; public-health screening at points of entry; the prevention and control of infections in health facilities; and the management of cases of COVID-19. In view of the mounting needs from affected countries for donations of personal protective equipment (PPE), Green said USAID has reviewed and responded to such requests for the distribution of goggles, gowns, face shields/masks, and gloves in close coordination with the WHO and the White House Coronavirus Task Force. Global response needed Meanwhile, Georgieva on Wednesday called for an all-out, “no regrets” response to the new coronavirus epidemic which poses a “serious threat” to the global economy. “At a time of uncertainty… it is better to do more than to do not enough,” she said, warning that the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak will slow growth in the world economy to below the 2.9 percent posted last year. The epidemic “is no longer a regional issue, it is a global problem calling for global response,” Georgieva told reporters, warning that the financial need could top $1 billion. The virus has shuttered factories, disrupted travel, infected nearly 95,000 people worldwide and killed more than 3,200, mainly in China, while some countries are struggling to test for and contain the spread of the illness. That has spurred global policymakers to come out in force to mitigate the damage, including an emergency, half-point cut in interest rates by the Federal Reserve on Tuesday, followed by a similar cut by the Bank of Canada on Wednesday. While some economists argue lower interest rates will do little to help address interruptions in supply chains, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said it should provide a boost to confidence. And while Georgieva said the global financial system is in good shape now after being fortified in the wake of the 2008 crisis, “We do need to have measures that are bringing a sense of confidence,” and prevent credit from freezing up. The epidemic’s impact on confidence and demand, as well as the steps imposed to contain it, are impacting economic activity, with the result that “global growth in 2020 will dip below last year’s levels,” she said. The IMF in January forecast growth this year of 3.3 percent, which means at least a half point will be lost to the virus. But “how far it will fall and how long the impact will be is still difficult to predict,” she said. Georgieva said the fund’s analysis had assumed the virus would be largely confined to China, which would have led to a sharp but short economic slowdown, followed by a quick recovery. “Unfortunately over the last week we’ve seen a shift to a more adverse scenario for the global economy,” due to the “sheer geographic spread of the epidemic around the world,” impacting a third of the IMF’s 189 member countries. The fund is due to release its updated forecasts in mid-April. Emergency financing Georgieva and World Bank President David Malpass spoke to reporters after a conference call of finance officials from member nations, who directed the IMF “to use all its available financing instruments to help member countries in need.” “We are determined to provide the necessary support to mitigate the impact, especially on the most vulnerable people and countries,” the statement from governing body the IMFC said. It was the first time the group had ever held a meeting by teleconference, the IMF said. Georgieva said the Washington-based development lender has $1 trillion in overall financing capacity, including $50 billion available without a formal IMF program, and $10 billion in no-interest funds for the poorest countries. These are existing aid facilities that can be deployed quickly to deal with emergency situations, such as natural disasters. Georgieva said the fund also has a grant program used for the 2014 Ebola outbreak that relies on government donations and is underfunded with only $200 million against a need that could reach $1 billion. “I called on member countries to help ensure that this facility is fully re-charged and ready for the current crisis,” she said. The World Bank on Tuesday announced it had $12 billion available to help countries respond to the coronavirus threat, especially the poorest nations that are least equipped. Malpass told reporters “the speed and breadth of the response is crucial to its effectiveness.” As the US death toll rose to 11, Congress reached a deal on $8 billion in emergency spending to combat both the health and economic consequences of the disease. The Eurogroup was still mulling an exceptional spending package as cases in Europe grew and Italy shuttered schools, but pledged to use “all appropriate tools to achieve strong, sustainable growth,” including fiscal measures.   Tags: ncov"

Iraq on Wednesday announced its first death from coronavirus (AFP Photo/Haidar HAMDANI / MANILA BULLETIN) A 70-year-old Muslim cleric died on Wednesday from the virus, the first death from the outbreak in a country where 31 people have been infected. The Iraqi preacher had been quarantined in the northeastern city of Sulaimaniyah before his death, a spokesman for the Kurdish autonomous region’s health authority said. According to local sources, he had recently met with Iraqis returning from neighboring Iran, which has recorded the third deadliest outbreak outside China, the epidemic’s epicenter. A second death from the new coronavirus was announced later in the day by Iraq’s health ministry, which said in a statement that the deceased was in Baghdad and suffered from “immune deficiencies”. Across the world, 3,245 people have died from the virus, with China recording 2,981 deaths, Italy 107 and Iran 92. Iraq is one of Iran’s largest export markets and a popular destination for Iranian pilgrims visiting the holy cities of Najaf and Karbala. Many Iraqis also cross the frontier for business, tourism, medical treatment, and religious studies. Iraqi authorities have closed land borders with Iran and banned the entry of foreign nationals traveling from there and other badly affected countries. Schools, universities, cinemas, cafes and other public places in Iraq have been ordered shut until March 7 to further contain the outbreak. Responding to Wednesday’s death in the Kurdish region, Sulaimaniyah Governor Haval Abu Bakr told reporters that all rallies in the province will be banned and that all football matches will now be held behind closed doors. Local religious authorities for their part announced a ban on mass prayers, including on Fridays, until further notice. The outbreak has fuelled public panic among Iraqis who say the war-ravaged country’s healthcare system cannot handle the epidemic. Many hospitals in Iraq are poorly equipped or in disrepair after successive waves of conflict. According to the World Health Organization, there are fewer than 10 doctors for every 10,000 people.   Tags: ncov"

The city’s Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) said repeated tests suggest the dog — a pomeranian — has “a low-level of infection”. The AFCD said experts from universities and the World Organisation for Animal Health have unanimously agreed that “it is likely to be a case of human-to-animal transmission”. The pomeranian has not shown any novel coronavirus symptoms, it said. New measures put in place by Hong Kong’s government last Friday mean all pets infected with the coronavirus must be quarantined for 14 days. Two dogs are already in isolation. The other dog in quarantine belongs to a second coronavirus patient that tested negative for the virus once and will be tested again before its release.

The kingdom halted the pilgrimage for its own citizens and residents, on top of restrictions announced last week on foreign pilgrims as it declared a second coronavirus infection in a Saudi man who returned from Iran.  Muslim worshippers wearing protective face masks walk in the sahn (mosque courtyard) surrounding the Kaaba, Islam’s holiest shrine, at the Grand Mosque complex in Saudi Arabia’s holy city of Mecca late last month (AFP Photo/Haitham EL-TABEI / MANILA BULLETIN) The kingdom said the suspension was provisional, but with the umrah drawing millions of people annually, the decision has a huge potential impact. The Gulf state has decided “to suspend umrah temporarily for citizens and residents in the kingdom”, the interior ministry said in a statement carried by the official Saudi Press Agency. They were also barred from “visits to the Prophet’s mosque in Medina”, according to a foreign ministry tweet. Saudi authorities, alarmed over the spread of coronavirus across the Middle East, last week suspended visas for the umrah and barred citizens from the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council from entering Mecca and Medina. Saudi Arabia on Wednesday confirmed its second coronavirus case — a citizen who returned from COVID-19 hotspot Iran. This second confirmed case had accompanied a Saudi man who was declared positive on Monday. Both of them re-entered the kingdom through Bahrain and sought to hide their Iran visit from border authorities, according to the health ministry. The umrah, which refers to the Islamic pilgrimage to Mecca that can be undertaken at any time of year, attracts millions of Muslims from across the globe annually. The decision to suspend the umrah comes ahead of the holy fasting month of Ramadan starting in late April, which is a favored period for pilgrimage. ‘Big step’  The holy sites, which draw millions of pilgrims every year, are a key revenue earner for Saudi Arabia. De facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s Vision 2030 reform plan seeks to decouple the kingdom’s economy — the world’s top crude exporter — from oil dependency and shunt it towards other sources of revenue, including religious tourism. The government hopes to welcome 30 million pilgrims to the kingdom annually by 2030. “This is a big precautionary step that will certainly have economic consequences,” Karen Young, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, told AFP. “This is already shaping up to be a very difficult year as oil prices drop and Saudi has fewer fiscal levers. It would be a huge setback if the limited progress of its economic reforms are erased.” Around two-thirds of the 18.3 million umrah participants in 2018 were citizens and residents of the kingdom, according to government statistics. It is unclear how the coronavirus will affect the hajj, due to start in late July. Some 2.5 million faithful traveled to Saudi Arabia from across the world in 2019 to take part in the hajj, which is one of the five pillars of Islam. The event is a massive logistical challenge for Saudi authorities, with colossal crowds cramming into relatively small holy sites, making attendees vulnerable to contagion. Saudi Arabia’s custodianship of Mecca and Medina — Islam’s two holiest sites — is seen as the kingdom’s most powerful source of political legitimacy. But a series of deadly disasters over the years has prompted criticism of the Sunni kingdom’s management of the hajj. In September 2015, a stampede killed up to 2,300 worshippers in the worst disaster ever to strike the pilgrimage.   Tags: ncov"

She asked that her identity be kept secret,” the statement read. Foreign Affairs Undersecretary for Civilian Security Brigido Dulay also confirmed in a tweet Wednesday night, saying the Filipino, believed to be a domestic helper, is now undergoing quarantine and treatment. “Our Philippine consulate in Hong Kong reported that an OFW has tested positive for the COVID-19 – the third case involving a Filipino in HK. The worker is now in a quarantine facility undergoing treatment,” Dulay said. Hong Kong’s Center for Health Protection (CHP) announced on Wednesday that they are investigating four new case of COVID-19, including that of a 57-year-old female, a domestic helper of patients labeled as 76th and 91st. The patient, according to the CHP,  has good past health and was “asymptomatic.” “Her respiratory sample was tested positive for COVID-19 virus today (Wednesday, March 4, 2020),” it added. This brings the number of Filipinos with COVID-19 in Hong Kong to three. The other two patients have recovered but still remain in the hospital for further tests. To date, the CHP said the total number of COVID-19 cases in Hong Kong is now at 105, comprising 104 confirmed cases and one probable case. The Consulate General said it is in touch with the three Filipinos and stands ready to render all necessary assistance to them.   Tags: ncov"

The total number of dead in Italy rose to 107 after 28 people died of the highly contagious virus over the past 24 hours, the Civil Protection Agency said.  (AFP/ MANILA BULLETIN) Education Minister Lucia Azzolina said schools and universities all over the country would be closed from Thursday until at least March 15. Only those in the northern regions most heavily affected by the epidemic have been closed so far. The number of cases since the outbreak surfaced 13 days ago rose to 3,089 from 2,502 on Tuesday. Of those who contracted the disease, about 3.5% had died, the head of the agency, Angelo Borrelli, said. The government adopted a decree to try to slow infections which have been rising by about 500 per day. “Our hospitals, despite their efficiency, risk being overwhelmed, we have a problem with intensive-care units,” Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said. The decree orders “the suspension of events of any nature … that entail the concentration of people and do not allow for a safety distance of at least one metre (yard) to be respected.” It calls for the closure of cinemas and theatres and tells Italians not to shake hands or hug each other, and to avoid “direct physical contact with all people.” It also orders all major sporting events, including top flight Serie A soccer matches, to be played in empty stadiums. The school closures caused jubilation among some children and mixed reactions from parents. “I hoped for this decree because I feared an outbreak at school,” said Massimiliano Del Ninno, father of a Rome primary school student. “Even if we are dealing with an age group that doesn’t seem to be at risk, they could have been carriers.” Clarissa Mazzei, a 30-year-old mother of three, called it “tragic … for the students, and also for the parents.” Deputy Economy Minister Laura Castelli said the government was aware of the problems it would cause families and was preparing a directive to allow a parent to stay home from work to look after children. The virus outbreak remains centred on the wealthy and populous region of Lombardy, around Milan, and the neighbouring regions of Veneto and Emilia Romagna, but cases are spreading around the whole of the Italian peninsula and Sicily. Rome’s Spallanzani infectious diseases hospital said it had 20 coronavirus patients, while others were being treated at home in and around Italy’s capital and largest city. Emilia Romagna’s regional government said on Wednesday two of its members had tested positive and Industry Minister Stefano Patuanelli is in self-imposed isolation after coming into contact with a patient, though he himself had tested negative. The outbreak has already heavily disrupted life in the north, with cinemas and museums closed in some regions and many events cancelled including fashion shows and trade fairs. On Wednesday, the government instructed public sector managers to reorganise offices to help staff work from home. Italy’s chronically weak economic growth looks sure to suffer, with the tourist sector taking a huge hit from a wave of cancellations. Industry lobby Confindustria said the country was in recession, forecasting a fall in gross domestic product in both the first and second quarters of this year. Confturismo, the tourist industry’s confederation, said the sector was “on its knees.” It forecast a drop of some 32 million in the number of Italian and foreign tourists in March-to-May, with a loss to the industry of about 7.4 billion euros ($8.23 billion). Economy Minister Roberto Gualtieri has promised tax breaks and other measures for the affected sectors worth 3.6 billion euros. A government source told Reuters on Wednesday this may be raised to 4.5 billion, or 0.25% of GDP. Tags: ncov"

Dr Janos Szlavik at the Central Hospital of Southern Pest told reporters at a news conference that both patients had visited family in Iran recently and that their roommates were being taken into quarantine. Authorities were making efforts to establish their travel history within Hungary and who they had been in contact with, Szlavik said. In neighbouring Slovenia, Health Minister Ales Sabeder told reporters the country’s first case involved a “patient, aged around 60 who returned from Morocco via Italy” a few days ago. The patient had visited a family doctor before being tested and was currently in hospital in the capital Ljubljana, he added. While caseloads have steadily declined in the virus epicentre China, infections and deaths are rising in Asia and Europe, with cases appearing in new countries almost every day. More than 90,000 people have been infected and around 3,200 have died worldwide from the virus, the vast majority in China where COVID-19 first emerged late last year. The World Health Organization (WHO) has so far stopped short of declaring a pandemic, though has said the world must prepare for the possibility. The virus has reached over 80 countries and territories around the world, with South Korea, Iran and Italy emerging as hotspots outside China. Tags: ncov"
,"March 5, 2020, 7:29 AM",nCov,Coronavirus lingers in rooms and toilets but disinfectants kill it,By Agence France-Presse,"By Agence France-Presse New research from Singapore published Wednesday showed that patients with the novel coronavirus extensively contaminate their bedrooms and bathrooms, underscoring the need to routinely clean high-touch surfaces, basins and toilet bowls. The virus was however killed by twice-a-day cleaning of surfaces and daily cleaning of floors with a commonly used disinfectant — suggesting that current decontamination measures are sufficient as long as people adhere to them. The research letter was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) and comes after cases in China where the pathogen spread extensively through hospitals, infecting dozens of health care workers and other patients. This led scientists to believe that, beyond catching the infection through coughing, environmental contamination was an important factor in the disease’s transmission, but its extent was unclear. Researchers at Singapore’s National Centre for Infectious Diseases and DSO National Laboratories looked at the cases of three patients who were held in isolation rooms between late January and early February. They collected samples from their rooms on five days over a two-week period. The room of one patient was sampled before routine cleaning, while the rooms of the other two patients were sampled after disinfection measures. The patient whose room was sampled before cleaning had the mildest symptoms of the three, only experiencing a cough. The other two had moderate symptoms: both had coughing and fever, one experienced shortness of breath and the other was coughing up mucus. Despite this disparity, the patient whose room was sampled before cleaning contaminated 13 of 15 room sites tested, including a chair, the bed rail, a glass window, the floor, and light switches. Three of the five toilet sites were also contaminated, including the sink, door handle and toilet bowl — more evidence that stool can be a route of transmission. Air samples tested negative, but swabs taken from air exhaust outlets were positive — which suggests that virus-laden droplets may be carried by air flows and deposited on vents. The two rooms that were tested after cleaning had no positive results. “Significant environmental contamination by patients with SARS-CoV-2 through respiratory droplets and fecal shedding suggests the environment as a potential medium of transmission and supports the need for strict adherence to environmental and hand hygiene,” the authors wrote. SARS-CoV-R is the official name of the pathogen. The virus, which was first identified in China’s Hubei province in December, has now infected more than 95,000 people in 81 countries and territories, killing more than 3,200. The World Health Organization said Wednesday the mortality rate among reported cases was 3.4 percent, revising upward previous estimates. But there is likely significant underreporting around the world and the disease’s true lethality will only be better understood over time. Tags: ncov"

(Daesun Distilling/Handout via REUTERS/MANILA BULLETIN) South Korean soju makers have responded to soaring ethanol demand for sanitizers by donating the alcohol that goes into the drink, a distilled spirit with 17% to 20% alcohol by volume traditionally based on rice, but now often wheat or potatoes. “Ethanol demand for disinfection has grown while supply is limited…we have decided to provide it,” an official of Daesun Distilling, based in the southeastern city of Busan, told Reuters. To banish the virus, the company has pledged to donate 32 tonnes of ethanol for use in disinfecting buildings and public places in Busan and southeastern Daegu, the city at the center of South Korea’s outbreak. “We plan to keep donating until the coronavirus outbreak is stabilized and to donate 50 tonnes more,” added the official, who sought anonymity as he was not authorized to speak to media. South Koreans drink an average of about 12 shots of soju each week, media say, citing industry figures. Ethanol for alcoholic drinks can be produced by fermentation or distillation, typically from grains and plants. The chemical can also be made from petrochemical feedstock. Whether used for liquor or disinfection, both have the same chemical structure and can break apart the virus particle, said Lee Duckhwan, a chemistry professor at Sogang University in Seoul, the capital. “If there’s any difference, that is the liquor tax imposed on ethanol produced by liquor makers,” Lee said. The virus fears boosted February sales of soaps and hand sanitizers, including those with an alcohol base, to four times the level a year ago, data from a major retailer Lotte Mart shows. Shares of ethanol producers also jumped. Following Daesun Distilling, Hallasan Soju, based on the resort island of Jeju, also provided 5 tonnes of ethanol to authorities on Tuesday, a company official said. Tags: ncov"

A man wearing a face mask rides a kick scooter through an intersection in Wuhan, the epicentre of the novel coronavirus outbreak, Hubei province, China March 3, 2020. (REUTERS/Stringer/MANILA BULLETIN) The researchers, from Peking University’s School of Life Sciences and the Institut Pasteur of Shanghai under the Chinese Academy of Sciences, cautioned that their analysis examined a limited range of data, and said follow-up analyses of larger data sets are needed to better understand the virus’s evolution. The preliminary study found that a more aggressive type of the new coronavirus associated with the disease outbreak in Wuhan accounted for about 70% of analyzed strains, while 30% was linked to a less aggressive type. The prevalence of the more aggressive virus decreased after early January 2020, they said. “These findings strongly support an urgent need for further immediate, comprehensive studies that combine genomic data, epidemiological data, and chart records of the clinical symptoms of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),” they wrote. Their findings were published on Tuesday in the National Science Review, the journal of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. The findings come amid a fall in new coronavirus cases following crippling restrictions imposed on the world’s second largest economy to stop its spread, including transport suspensions and the extension of the Lunar New Year holiday. Mainland China had 119 new confirmed cases of coronavirus on Tuesday, the National Health Commission said, down slightly from 125 the previous day, in a broad trend that has seen numbers of new cases fall from the middle of February. The total number of cases on the mainland has now reached 80,270. The number of deaths rose by 38 to bring the total toll for mainland China to 2,981 by March 3. All but one new death occurred in Hubei province, the epicenter of the outbreak. With the number of new daily infections overseas now exceeding new cases in China, Chinese officials have begun to seek ways to control the spread of the virus outside of China and guard against future outbreaks. Authorities have asked overseas Chinese hoping to return home to reconsider their travel plans, while cities across the country have set up quarantine rules for those entering from high-risk places. Italy, South Korea and Iran have all become infection hot spots. An infected person is known to have arrived in China from Iran last week. China is encouraging domestic producers of medical protective equipment to export protective suits to meet overseas demand as the virus spreads, Cao Xuejun, an official with China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology said in a press briefing in Beijing on Wednesday.

Despite the Fed’s attempt to stem the economic fallout from the coronavirus, U.S. stock indexes closed down about 3%, safe-haven gold rose 3% and analysts and investors questioned whether the rate cut will be enough if the virus continues to spread. U.S. lawmakers were considering spending as much as $9 billion to contain local spread of the virus. In Iran, doctors and nurses lack supplies and 77 people have died, one of the highest numbers outside China. The United Arab Emirates announced it was closing all schools for four weeks. The death toll in Italy, Europe’s hardest-hit country, jumped to 79 on Tuesday and Italian officials are considering expanding the area under quarantine. France reported its fourth coronavirus death, while Indonesia, Ukraine, Argentina and Chile reported their first coronavirus cases. About 3.4% of confirmed cases of COVID-19 have died, far above seasonal flu’s fatality rate of under 1%, but the virus can be contained, the WHO chief said on Tuesday. “To summarize, COVID-19 spreads less efficiently than flu, transmission does not appear to be driven by people who are not sick, it causes more severe illness than flu, there are not yet any vaccines or therapeutics, and it can be contained,” WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in Geneva. Health officials have said the death rate is 2% to 4% depending on the country and may be much lower if there are thousands of unreported mild cases of the disease. Since the coronavirus outbreak, prices of surgical masks have increased sixfold, N95 respirators have tripled in cost and protective gowns cost twice as much, the WHO said. It estimates healthcare workers each month will need 89 million masks, 76 million gloves and 1.6 million pairs of goggles. The coronavirus, which emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year, has spread around the world, with more new cases now appearing outside China than inside. There are almost 91,000 cases globally of which more than 80,000 are in China. China’s death toll was 2,946, with more than 166 fatalities elsewhere. In a unanimous decision, the Fed said it was cutting rates by a half percentage point to a target range of 1.00% to 1.25%. Finance ministers from the G7 group of rich countries were ready to take action, including fiscal measures where appropriate, Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso said. Central banks would continue to support price stability and economic growth. In the United States, there are now over 100 people in at least a dozen states with the coronavirus and nine deaths, all in the Seattle area. Amid criticism of Americans not being able to get tested for coronavirus unless they met certain limited criteria, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence said on Tuesday that anyone can now get tested with a doctor’s order under new guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). New York state reported its second case, a man in his 50s who works in Manhattan and has been hospitalized. The public transportation agency in New York, the most densely populated major U.S. city of more than 8 million, said on Twitter it was deploying “enhanced sanitizing procedures” for stations, train cars, buses and certain vehicles. China has seen coronavirus cases fall sharply, with 129 in the last 24 hours the lowest reported since Jan. 20. With the world’s second largest economy struggling to get back on track, China is increasingly concerned about the virus being brought back into the country by citizens returning from new hotspots elsewhere. Travelers entering Beijing from South Korea, Japan, Iran and Italy would have to be quarantined for 14 days, a city official said. Shanghai has introduced a similar order. The worst outbreak outside China is in South Korea, where President Moon Jae-in declared war on the virus, ordering additional hospital beds and more masks as cases rose by 600 to nearly 5,000, with 34 deaths. WHO officials also expressed concerns about the situation in Iran, saying doctors lacked respirators and ventilators needed for patients with severe cases. WHO emergency program head Michael Ryan said the need in Iran was “more acute” than for other countries. While the case numbers in Iran appear to be bad, he said, “things tend to look worse before getting better.” The International Olympic Committee on Tuesday said the summer games in Tokyo set to begin on July 24 were still expected to happen despite Japan having nearly 1,000 coronavirus cases and 12 deaths.

Moon’s office on Wednesday said he had canceled a planned trip to the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Turkey in mid-March due to the crisis. At least 92 countries have imposed some form of entry restrictions on arrivals from South Korea, according to a tally by Yonhap news agency. Vice Foreign Minister Cho Sei-young met the U.S. ambassador on Wednesday as part of Seoul’s efforts to prevent the United States from imposing restrictions. In the meeting, Cho outlined South Korea’s efforts to control the outbreak and urged the United States not to take steps that would affect exchanges between the two countries, the foreign ministry said. U.S. President Donald Trump said this week his administration was watching Italy, South Korea and Japan – all with severe outbreaks – and would make a decision about travel restrictions “at the right time”. “We remain confident in the South Korean government’s robust and comprehensive response efforts to limit the spread of the virus,” U.S. ambassador Harry Harris tweeted after meeting Cho. Up to 10,000 people are being tested each day in South Korea, and daily totals have decreased slightly since a peak of 909 new cases on Saturday, the KCDC said. Experts caution that the results of those tests could take some time to be processed, leading to future spikes in confirmed cases. Tags: ncov"

Five new infections were reported as of Wednesday afternoon, in locations from Yamaguchi prefecture in the west to Hokkaido in the north, underlining the virus’ spread across the country and raising questions about whether the Olympics can go ahead.  A man wearing a face mask, following an outbreak of the coronavirus, is seen on a street in Tokyo, Japan, March 4, 2020. (REUTERS/Athit Perawongmetha/MANILA BULLETIN) The new cases push the total in Japan over the 1,000 mark, according to a Reuters calculation, of which 706 are from the Diamond Princess liner. A total of 12 have died, of which six were from the Diamond Princess, the health ministry said. The government’s top spokesman said Japan would go ahead in preparing to host the Olympics as planned, amid speculation they could be postponed because of the coronavirus threat. “We would steadily proceed with our preparations while closely coordinating with the IOC (the International Olympic Committee) and the organizing committee,” Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said at a regular news conference. The Olympics are scheduled to open in less than five months and IOC head Thomas Bach on Tuesday reiterated his backing for this summer’s Games despite the coronavirus threat, urging athletes to prepare “full steam.” Still, there are worries the Games could be postponed or even canceled. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has asked schools to close this month, companies are encouraging employees to work from home and sporting events are being canceled or played in empty arenas. Olympic Minister Seiko Hashimoto fueled concerns about a delay, saying on Tuesday that Tokyo’s contract with the IOC “could be interpreted as allowing a postponement” until the end of the year, although she reiterated the government remained committed to the Games starting on July 24. Hashimoto also indicated the end of May could be a key date for making any decisions related to a possible cancellation. Masa Takaya, a Tokyo 2020 organizing committee spokesman, said on Wednesday the government had clarified its commitment for the Games to proceed, and there was no deadline on a decision whether to postpone. “We have been informed from the Olympic minister that she is absolutely on the same page and the Games will go ahead as planned.” The head of the World Health Organization said he had confidence in Japan’s efforts and hoped for progress, but that the WHO was watching developments and talking with the IOC. “What we have agreed is that we monitor the situation and then of course with the government of Japan, if there is a need for any actions then we can discuss with the Japanese government,” WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a news conference in Geneva on Tuesday. The epidemic has already been affecting related events in the run up to the Games. Crowds will be smaller and receptions have been scrapped at the Tokyo 2020 torch-lighting ceremony in ancient Olympia, Greece, next week as the Hellenic Olympic Committee (HOC) introduced measures to protect against the coronavirus, it said on Tuesday. Olympics host city Tokyo has seen 40 cases, while infections have been confirmed as far south as Okinawa. The northern island of Hokkaido reported three new cases on Wednesday, bringing its total to 82, the highest among Japan’s prefectures. In western Japan, Ehime reported its second case and Yamaguchi announced its first. “Given how the coronavirus was spreading throughout the country, I thought it would only be a matter of time before a case was confirmed in Yamaguchi,” Tsugumasa Muraoka, the prefecture’s governor, told a news conference. “We will be doing all we can to prevent the spread of the virus,” he said. In separate statements on Wednesday, Japan’s biggest carrier ANA Holdings and local rival Japan Airlines Co said they would cancel some of their domestic flights between March 6-12 due to slower travel demand.

Amazon sent an internal memo explaining that the employee went home after feeling unwell at work last week and has not returned to the company’s offices, according to a report in CNBC. Amazon has an “urban campus” in Seattle, with offices spread across the city. Workers known to have been in close contact with the ill employee were notified, and the risk to others at the company was considered low, the memo was reported to say. The death toll attributed to virus in the United States has risen to nine, many linked to a nursing home in the Seattle suburbs, while the overall number of infections shot past 100 including cases on both coasts and the Midwest. More than 90,000 people have been infected and 3,200 killed since the first cases were identified in China’s Hubei province late last year.

China appears to be coming to grips with the virus, which emerged late last year and has infected more than 80,000 people and killed nearly 3,000 in the country, but has slowed markedly in recent weeks.  China’s new virus preventive policies have turned life upside down and are particularly felt when trying to move around within China(AFP / Noel Celis / MANILA BULLETIN) But that has come at the cost of new preventive policies that have turned life upside down and are not likely to be swiftly abandoned. The changes wrought by a contagion spread by humans and their travels are particularly felt when trying to move around within China, as AFP journalists discovered during recent trips from Shanghai up to the borders of the viral epicenter of Hubei province. Reminders of the virus begin as soon as one leaves home, with masked cab drivers in white gloves quick to admonish any passengers who forget to wear masks. Some drivers are going even further. In the city of Wenzhou, about four hours by train from Shanghai, AFP reporters jumped into car called via Didi Chuxing — China’s answer to Uber — in which a clear plastic barrier was stretched over a makeshift frame to separate driver and passengers. Didi Chuxing piloted the project in a handful of hard-hit cities and plans to spend 100 million yuan ($14 million) to expand it. ‘Sold-out’ trains  Travelers booking tickets aboard the country’s efficient high-speed rail network lately are surprised to find that, despite travel being depressed by virus fears, popular booking apps like Ctrip invariably list most trains as “sold out” or with only a handful of seats left. But one such Wenzhou-bound train was full of empty seats. That is because only a fraction of tickets are being made available to prevent travelers sitting too close to each other. “We are sorry for the confusion, but China’s high-speed rail systems are contributing to the patriotic hygiene campaign. We hope you find this convenient,” said a young female train attendant. With the government calling for an all-out “People’s War” against the virus, tech champions like Alibaba and Tencent have rolled out digital mobile-phone apps that use big data to track a traveler’s movements going back as far as a month. Users are rated as green, yellow or red based on whether they visited any high-risk zones. Showing one’s code to security personnel is now compulsory in a number of cities to exit train stations, or use public transport. In Wenzhou, cab drivers, hotels, and virtually any business will ask to see the colour code before letting someone pass. The system has fuelled new grumbling on China’s internet over previous accusations that the big tech firms were doing the Communist Party’s surveillance work. But most complaints seem to involve “green” ratings inexplicably turning “red”, which can result in mandatory 14-day home quarantine. The pervasive measures attest to the one-party state’s ability to marshal huge resources — financial, material, and human — for mass campaigns couched in 1950s Communist rhetoric. Red banners hang throughout now largely shut-down cities like Wenzhou, lauding the “War of Resistance Against Pneumonia”, and declaring that “Everyone Must Contribute to the Patriotic Hygiene Campaign.”  Elbow bump  Hotel check-ins have become mini health inspections by masked staff who measure guests’ temperatures by aiming hand-held sensors at foreheads and forearms and record the result. “Have you experienced any fever, felt unwell or visited Hubei recently?” a Wenzhou front-desk clerk asked. The temperature obsession can be taken to absurd lengths, with some hotels re-measuring guests who had stepped out only minutes earlier. On one day, an AFP reporter moving around Wenzhou had his temperature taken a dozen times, including by cab drivers, restaurant owners, convenience-store clerks, hotel security, front-desk staff and a final late-night knock on the door by a female hotel employee. “Do not walk forward! Be still please,” she snapped, before a light beep announced the result. “It’s normal. Enjoy your evening.” Beijing is pushing a long-term fight and local governments will no doubt be fearful of letting up even slightly anytime soon and being blamed for a new outbreak. That means even some of society’s most time-honored practices are on hold. When an AFP reporter presented a business card to a government liaison officer in Wenzhou, she recoiled and asked that it be placed on a table. And when it came time to shake another official’s hand, the man refused, laughing nervously. “For safety, we don’t really shake hands at the current time,” he said, instead sticking forward the crook of his arm for an “elbow bump.” Tags: ncov"

There has been a run on some items at Australian supermarkets due to coronavirus concerns(AFP / PETER PARKS / MANILA BULLETIN) Woolworths said the restriction of four packs of toilet paper per person would apply “to ensure more customers have access to the products”. Hand sanitizers will also be sold from behind the service counter and restricted to two per person. “It will help shore up stock levels as suppliers ramp up local production and deliveries in response to higher-than-usual demand,” the company said in a statement. Despite government assurances, there has been a run on some items at Australian supermarkets, with images on social media purportedly showing shelves stripped of goods and shoppers piling trolleys high with toilet paper. Police had to be called to a Sydney supermarket at lunchtime Wednesday when a knife was drawn in a toilet paper aisle. New South Wales Police confirmed officers went to the western Sydney supermarket but said there were no arrests and no injuries. It is believed a knife was raised in the air by a startled hearing- and speech-impaired customer during a heated exchange over toilet rolls. Retailers have also experienced shortages of masks and hand sanitizers sparked by fears over the deadly coronavirus outbreak, which has infected more than 90,000 people and killed more than 3,100. The vast majority of cases have been in China, but South Korea, Italy, and Iran have also emerged as hotspots. Australia has reported 43 confirmed cases of the virus, including one death. Prime Minister Scott Morrison said he had spoken to the country’s two major supermarket chains — Woolworths and its rival Coles — about their response to panic buying. “I can understand why people may be concerned, and go to supermarkets, and do those sorts of things. But the advice is that’s not necessary,” he told 2GB Radio on Wednesday.   Tags: ncov"

The owners did not have permission to distribute the masks, police said. “Mask prices have skyrocketed everywhere and there are shortages, most likely because hoarders are trying to make money at the public’s expense,” Jakarta police spokesman Yusri Yunus told AFP Wednesday. Those convicted of hoarding masks could face up to five years in jail and hefty fines, police said. The warehouse raid came after hundreds of boxes of surgical masks were also seized Tuesday at a Jakarta apartment. And police said they busted a factory at the weekend allegedly making and distributing counterfeit masks that did not meet health standards “Those masks are useless,” Yunus said. “They won’t protect people who use them.” The crackdown was ordered by Indonesian president Joko Widodo who has called on citizens to avoid panic buying — even as store shelves are cleared and prices soar for masks and hand sanitizers. Major cities including Tokyo, Hong Kong, Sydney have also seen panic buying sparked by the virus. Indonesians, meanwhile, are scooping up a traditional herbal tonic known as jamu and in one city sellers dressed as Batman and local superhero Gundala were handing out the drink to motorists. “My sales have more than doubled since Monday,” said Nur Hidayati, 29, a jamu seller in Bogor near Jakarta. “People tell me they want jamu to stay healthy and immune from the virus.” On Monday, Indonesia confirmed its first coronavirus cases, saying a 64-year-old woman and her daughter, 31, tested positive.

The festival-like developer conference known as the Google I/O, whose 2019 edition is pictured here, is being canceled over coronavirus fears (AFP Photo/Josh Edelson / MANILA BULLETIN) The internet giant said it nixed the festival-like event Google I/O event scheduled for May a short distance from the “Googleplex” in the Silicon Valley city of Mountain View. “Due to concerns around the coronavirus (COVID-19), we’ve decided to cancel this year’s physical event at Shoreline Amphitheatre,” a Google statement said. A Google developers’ account tweeted: “It’s sad that we won’t be able to gather as a developer community but your health and safety is our priority.” Google added it is exploring other ways for its developer community to connect and collaborate. The annual Google I/O conference typically attracts thousands of developers from around the world who get to mingle with one another and engineers from the internet company on ways to synchronize software and services to its array of offerings. It joins a growing list of global events that have been canceled as the virus spreads around the world. A game developers conference in San Francisco was postponed last week after Facebook and Microsoft withdrew from the event due to concerns about the spread of novel coronavirus. Facebook recently canceled its F8 developers conference, the biggest annual event for the US tech giant, due to virus worries. Like Google I/O, the F8 gathering in the Silicon Valley city of San Jose typically draws throngs of software makers from around the world who collaborate with the tech giant on its platform. Face-to-face interaction at San Jose conference center will be replaced with online presentations. Tags: ncov"

(Photo by – / YONHAP / AFP / MANILA BULLETIN) Seoul had reported 851 new cases on Tuesday, its biggest daily case increase to date, with South Korean President Moon Jae-in declaring “war” against the deadly virus. Four more people had died, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Wednesday, taking the toll to 32. South Korea has seen a rapid rise in infections in recent days as authorities carry out checks on more than 260,000 people associated with the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, a religious sect often condemned as a cult that is now linked to more than half the cases. More than 4,000 cases have now been confirmed in southern city of Daegu — where the outbreak among Shincheonji members began with a 61-year-old woman, who developed symptoms on February 10 but attended at least four worship services in the city. Some 2,300 Daegu patients — some of them with severe symptoms, others with either mild ones or none at all — are waiting to be admitted to medical facilities, vice health minister Kim Gang-lip told reporters. Scores of events in the country — from K-pop concerts to sports seasons — have been canceled or postponed over the contagion, with school and kindergarten breaks extended by three weeks nationwide. All daycare centers are also closed until Sunday, and the government is contemplating whether to keep them closed for longer, Kim said. The central bank has warned of a contraction in the first quarter for the world’s 12th-largest economy, noting the epidemic will hit both consumption and exports. President Moon said Tuesday the government will inject more than 30 trillion won ($25 billion) into the economy to address the “grave” situation brought on by the outbreak.   Tags: ncov"

An airline staff member wears a mask while working at Arturo Merino Benitez International Airport in Santiago, Chile — the new coronavirus has spread into Latin America and Africa(AFP / JAVIER TORRES / MANILA BULLETIN) The death toll in the United States rose to nine, many linked to a nursing home in the Seattle suburbs, while the overall number of infections shot past 100 including cases on both coasts and the Midwest. More than 90,000 people have been infected and 3,100 killed since the first cases were identified in China’s Hubei province late last year. The vast majority of cases have been in China, but South Korea, Italy and Iran have also emerged as hotspots. The virus has also spread into Latin America and Africa, raising fears it could become established in conflict-hit countries with weak health infrastructure. The World Bank unveiled a $12 billion aid package on Tuesday to help the world’s poorest nations with medical equipment or health services. Global bourses have seen dramatic swings over the past week as concerns mount that the outbreak could threaten global growth and drive some countries in to a recession. In a unanimous decision, the Fed’s policy-setting committee slashed its key interest rate by a half point to a range of 1.0-1.25 percent — the first between-meeting cut since the height of the global 2008 financial crisis. “My colleagues and I took this action to help the US economy keep strong in the face of new risks to the economic outlook,” Fed Chair Jerome Powell told reporters. But the immediate impact seemed the opposite of what was intended: Investors fled to safe assets, sending the 10-year Treasury yield to its lowest ever return while stocks lost most of the ground recovered Monday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished nearly three percent lower, though European stocks and oil markets were higher but off the day’s best levels. Uncharted territory  Financial jitters followed a dire warning from the World Health Organization’s chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who said on Monday: “We are in uncharted territory.” He added that “we have never before seen a respiratory pathogen that is capable of community transmission, but which can also be contained with the right measures.” Countries across the world have imposed extraordinary measures in a bid to contain the virus, with millions of people across large swathes of China forced into quarantine. Italy has also locked in entire regions, while many nations have imposed travel restrictions on visitors from badly hit countries. Sports events, concerts and large gatherings have been canceled, including Google’s annual developer conference, one of its most important events, which was to be held in May. The International Olympic Committee said Tuesday it was pushing ahead with plans for the Tokyo Olympics kicking off in July. European football’s governing body likewise said the virus would not derail its championship in June and July. In the Middle East, the United Arab Emirates announced six more coronavirus cases linked to an abandoned cycling event, saying that two Russians, two Italians, one German and a Colombian had been infected.  ‘A war’  South Korea remains the biggest infection cluster outside China, confirming 851 new cases on Tuesday, its biggest daily increase. It has clocked a total of more than 5,100 cases, with 28 deaths. “The entire country has entered a war with the infectious disease,” South Korean President Moon Jae-in said. By contrast, China reported 125 new cases Tuesday — its lowest daily increase in six weeks — with all but 11 infections in Hubei province, of which Wuhan is the capital. The nationwide death toll rose to 2,943 with 31 more deaths, and about 80,000 total cases. Argentina announced its first two cases Tuesday while Spain announced its first death, a man who died last month in the eastern region of Valencia. Elsewhere in Europe, attention turned to containment, including Switzerland where all soldiers were confined to their bases after a case of the virus was discovered in their ranks. France, which has more than 200 cases and four deaths, closed dozens of schools on Tuesday in several virus-stricken regions. President Emmanuel Macron said authorities would requisition all face mask stocks and production in the coming months in response to the outbreak, after 2,000 masks were stolen from a hospital. The WHO also issued a warning Tuesday that supplies of protective gear to fight the virus were “rapidly depleting” around the world. It also said a lack of these supplies was complicating efforts at controlling the outbreak in Iran, where the virus was now “well-established.” The Middle Eastern country has had 77 deaths, the second highest after China.   Tags: ncov"
,"March 4, 2020, 10:43 AM",nCov,Protective gear to fight virus ‘rapidly depleting’: WHO,By Agence France-Presse,"By Agence France-Presse The World Health Organization said Tuesday that understanding how the new coronavirus spreads was rapidly increasing, but warned the protective gear needed to fight the disease was “rapidly depleting.” The UN health agency voiced concern that the masks, goggles and other protective equipment used by health workers was running out amid panic buying and manipulation of markets.  The World Health Organization warned supplies of protective gear to fight the virus were “rapidly depleting” globally (AFP / JUSTIN TALLIS / MANILA BULLETIN) “We are concerned that countries’ abilities to respond are being compromised by the severe and increasing disruption to the global supply of personal protective equipment … caused by rising demand, hoarding and misuse,” WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters in Geneva. “We can’t stop COVID-19 without protecting our health workers,” he said. The prices of surgical masks have increased six-fold, while the cost for ventilators had tripled, he added. Tedros said that WHO had shipped more than half a million sets of personal protective equipment to 27 countries, but warned that “supplies are rapidly depleting”. He urged a dramatic hike in production, saying WHO estimates the response to COVID-19 would require 89 million medical masks, 76 million pairs of examination gloves and 1.6 million goggles each month. More than 3,100 people have died from the new virus, while over 92,000 have been infected across 77 countries and territories, according to AFP’s latest toll based on official sources. Deadlier than flu: Tedros  Tedros said he understood why people were rushing to stock up. “Fear is a natural human response to any threat, especially when it is a threat we don’t completely understand.” But with more data, there was a growing understanding of the virus and how it spreads, he said, stressing that the new virus was “unique”. While often compared to the flu, Tedros stressed that the virus was far more deadly “More people are susceptible to infection and some will suffer serious disease. Globally about 3.4 percent of COVID-19 cases have died,” he said. “By comparison, seasonal flu generally kills far fewer than 1 percent of those infected.” And while many people have over the years built up immunity to seasonal flu, “no one has immunity” to the new coronavirus, he acknowledged. At the same time though, COVID-19 does not spread as easily as the flu, and unlike the flu “containment is possible”. Another difference, he said, is that while influenza can easily spread from people showing no symptoms, evidence from China shows “only one percent of reported cases do not have symptoms”.   Tags: ncov"

Chinese authorities did not publicly acknowledge the severity of the virus until January 20 (AFP Photo/STR / MANILA BULLETIN) Although Chinese authorities did not publicly acknowledge the severity of the virus until January 20, censorship began as early as December 31, said researchers at the University of Toronto’s Citizen Lab. Even general terms such as “unknown Wuhan pneumonia” and “Wuhan Health Commission” were deemed taboo in the early weeks of the epidemic, said the report. More than 3,100 people have died and over 90,000 have been infected worldwide by the virus. Citizen Lab said its research showed at least one social media platform in China was blocking some virus content three weeks before the government confirmed it was spreading between people. That “strongly suggests that social media companies came under government pressure to censor information at early stages of the outbreak,” the report said. In China it is common for social media companies to scrub content considered politically sensitive, including protests and government criticism. From the end of December to mid-February, Citizen Lab found more than 500 blocked keywords and phrases on WeChat — which has over one billion active monthly users — as well as on live-streaming platform YY. Some censored terms referred to information that was later made official, such as the fact that the virus was contagious. The two apps also censored a broad range of keywords, including factual information. For instance, messages that included the words “pneumonia”, “disease control and prevention”, “virus”, and “medical journal” were censored when Citizen Lab tested WeChat on February 14. “What makes this case unique is the potential public health harm blocking this information may have,” said Lotus Ruan, researcher at Citizen Lab, commenting on the broad scope of censorship. Doing so can “limit (the) public’s ability to be informed and protect themselves,” she told AFP. Though the death of a whistleblowing doctor prompted rare calls for political reform in February, Beijing has doubled down on censorship. In early February China’s cyberspace authority said it would “supervise” the country’s largest social media firms on virus-related content. And Chinese President Xi Jinping called for even tighter control over online discussion to ensure “positive energy” and social stability. “So far Beijing seems to draw the wrong conclusion from the crisis, that it needs to repress more, not less,” said Lokman Tsui, a communications professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.

The masks were pilfered from a part of Conception hospital that is accessible only to staff and patients who have undergone surgery, the Marseille hospitals authority (AP-HM) told AFP.  French authorities have requisitioned masks as coronavirus cases have mounted (AFP Photo/Loic VENANCE / MANILA BULLETIN) “The AP-HM immediately launched an internal investigation to find the culprits,” it said. It assured that the hospital had enough masks to continue operations as normal, but that it had ordered more and taken steps to secure its stocks of both masks and sanitizing hand gels. News of the theft came as President Emmanuel Macron announced that the authorities would requisition all face mask stocks and production in response to the coronavirus outbreak. Macron said they would be reserved for coronavirus patients and health professionals. Four people have died of the virus in France, which has 204 confirmed cases of the disease. Face masks have also caught the eye of thieves in Japan, who made off with some 6,000 masks from a hospital in the western city of Kobe in mid-February.   Tags: ncov"

(REUTERS / MANILA BULLETIN) “The goal is to provide fast, effective action that responds to country needs,” World Bank President David Malpass told reporters. He said it is critical to “recognize the extra burden on poor countries” least equipped in the struggle to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 virus. The funds, some of which are targeted to the world’s poorest nations, can be used for medical equipment or health services and will include expertise and policy advice, the bank said in a statement. Malpass said the money – $8 billion of which is new – will go to countries that request help. The bank has been in contact with many member nations, but he did not specify which are likely to be the first to receive aid. “The point is to move fast. Speed is needed to save lives,” he said in a conference call. “We want to make the best use of the World Bank’s extensive resources and global expertise and the historical knowledge of crises,” he said, citing similar crisis funding to combat the Ebola and Zika outbreaks in recent years. Treatment for coronavirus As the World Bank allocates funds to combat the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), Takeda Pharmaceutical Co. is developing an experimental treatment for the novel coronavirus that Japan’s largest drugmaker is aiming to make available in 9 to 18 months, Dow Jones reported, citing Rajeev Venkayya, president of Takeda’s vaccines business. Development of the drug, which became a solid project in recent weeks, would use the blood of those who have recovered from the disease to help strengthen the immune system of patients, according to the news agency. A Takeda representative confirmed the report. Takeda is speaking to authorities in regions about plasma collection, according to the report. Takeda’s plasma-derived therapies unit came from its acquisition of Shire for $62 billion in 2019. Pope’s symptoms point to simple cold In Vatican City, a report stated that Pope Francis had tested negative for the novel coronavirus, is still suffering from a cold and not exhibiting other symptoms. Italy’s Messaggero newspaper reported that the 83-year-old pontiff, who has been cancelling events since last Wednesday, had been tested for the virus as a precaution. Without directly confirming the report, Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni said in a statement that “the cold diagnosed (in the pope) was running its course, without symptoms attributable to other pathologies.” Pope Francis cancelled a Lent retreat for the first time in his papacy on Sunday, after axing all public meetings and retreating to his Vatican residence last week. “Unfortunately, a cold forced me not to take part this year,” Pope Francis told a crowd on Saint Peter’s Square after suffering two coughing fits while reciting Sunday’s Angelus Prayer. The Argentine-born pope has been seen coughing and blowing his nose for days. The pope was tested for the disease last Wednesday, the newspaper report said, and the results took several days to come in.  142 new cases in S. Korea South Korea reported 142 more novel coronavirus cases Wednesday, a significantly lower increase than the day before, taking its total to 5,328 — the largest in the world outside China. Seoul had reported 851 new cases on Tuesday, its biggest daily case increase to date, with South Korean President Moon Jae-in declaring “war” against the deadly virus. Four more people had died, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Wednesday, taking the toll to 32. President Moon said Tuesday the government will inject more than 30 trillion won ($25 billion) into the economy to address the ”grave” situation brought on by the outbreak.  Fall in fresh cases in China China on Wednesday reported 38 more deaths from the new coronavirus but a fall in fresh cases for a third consecutive day. The death toll nationwide is now 2,981, the National Health Commission said, with more than 80,200 people infected in total. There were 115 new cases in central Hubei province — the epicentre where the virus first emerged in December last year — and only four elsewhere in the country. The figures in China have generally been declining in recent weeks as a series of draconian quarantine measures seem to be paying off. But there are mounting concerns about infections being brought back into the country from other global hotspots. In total there have been 13 confirmed cases of the virus being imported to the mainland — all in Chinese nationals returning from overseas. Quarantine measures have been put in place on people arriving in Beijing, Shanghai and southern Guangdong province from virus-hit countries. The number of suspected infections in China fell to the lowest level since late January, at 520 cases – down from nearly 29,000 suspected cases reported in early February.  Global charge The US Federal Reserve on Tuesday led the global charge in response to the growing economic risk posed by the new coronavirus, announcing an emergency interest rate cut after the UN health agency said the world has entered ”uncharted territory.” But the Fed’s stimulus, which came hours after the Group of Seven finance ministers and central bankers pledged to take action using ”all appropriate policy tools,” wasn’t enough to prevent Wall Street stocks from tumbling as the virus continued its global spread.

More than 90,000 people have been infected and 3,100 killed since the first cases were identified in China’s Hubei province late last year. Tourists cancel booking As the illness that broke out in China goes global, the tourism business faces a growing threat. Many of the Chinese travelers who have driven the industry’s expansion were already staying home, after the government locked down tens of millions of people and banned sales of package tours. That emptied lodgings in the casino hotspot of Macau, cleared beaches across Southeast Asia and eliminated lines outside Louis Vuitton boutiques in Paris. Even as the viral spread slows in China, it’s taking off elsewhere, including South Korea and Italy, which together have reported more than 7,000 of the global total of 92,000 cases. Now it’s not just Chinese who are staying home. Germans and Belgians are rethinking ski trips to Italy. Japanese are canceling visits to Bali. At stake is the $1.7 trillion in revenue that international tourism generated in 2018, according to the UN World Tourism Organization. Many business travelers who normally fill the travel industry’s slack during the winter months are staying home, too, as companies like Facebook, Inc. and Google trade face-to-face meetings for webcasts. The likes of L’Oreal SA, Nestle SA and Cargill Inc. have suspended employee travel globally for the coming weeks. Authorities have axed trade fairs that would have drawn hundreds of thousands to Berlin, Geneva and Barcelona, while Hawaii’s Festpac cultural festival was canceled. The Global Business Travel Association said the coronavirus could cost the industry some $47 billion per month. Airlines and package tour operators have painted an equally gloomy picture, with the International Air Transport Association predicting almost $30 billion in lost flight sales. “We aren’t capable of saying how long the situation will last,” said Ana de Pro, chief financial officer of Amadeus IT Group SA, which provides online booking software for the travel industry. Package holiday giant TUI AG announced a hiring freeze, saying it can’t yet estimate the financial fallout from the outbreak. It’s the biggest setback for the travel industry since a downturn that accompanied the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001 and the SARS outbreak and the war in Iraq two years later. Airlines, tour operators, and hotel companies were already wrestling with a shift in how people travel, thanks to the rise of online bookings and discount carriers. Rising passenger numbers, including millions of new travelers from China, had cushioned the blow for airlines, which relied on rapid consolidation to fuel profit growth. Now they’re lurching toward a crisis. While Chinese flights are resuming after much of the country’s air traffic was grounded earlier this year, fallout is spreading in Europe and elsewhere. Deutsche Lufthansa AG and British Airways parent IAG SA issued profit warnings over the coronavirus, while EasyJet Plc and Ryanair Holdings Plc have canceled services and Italian carrier Alitalia SpA laid off 4,000 workers temporarily. Some ticket-holders for flights are simply not turning up, the air transport association said. Argentina, Chile confirm 1st cases Argentina and Chile both said on Tuesday they had confirmed their first case of the novel coronavirus in patients who recently returned from travels. A 43-year-old infected Argentine man had returned from Italy on March 1, while a 33-year-old Chilean man had spent a month in southeast Asia. Health Minister Gines Gonzalez Garcia said the Argentine patient has been in isolation since presenting himself to a private health clinic in Buenos Aires the day he returned. ”We’ve identified a first case. It’s a patient who came from Italy” but had also traveled around other parts of Europe, said Gonzalez Garcia.

(Photo by – / AFP / MANILA BULLETIN) The UAE Tour was abandoned last Thursday after two Italian staff members with one of the teams tested positive for the disease. The cyclists, team staff and some media were put under lockdown at hotels in Abu Dhabi where they underwent screening, with most cleared to leave over the past few days. However, four of the 20 teams remained in quarantine — French cycling teams Cofidis and Groupama-FDJ, together with the UAE Team and Russian outfit Gazprom. The official news agency WAM cited the health ministry as confirming the six new cases, which brings the total reported in the UAE to 27. “The patients were connected to the two previously announced cases associated with the cycling event, the UAE Tour,” it said. The French cycling teams had described their continued quarantine as confusing after other competitors were allowed home. “All individuals within the two quarantined hotels that had no direct contact with athletes and their administrative teams were examined, and… those that tested negative for the coronavirus were allowed to leave the hotel premises,” the health ministry said. Individuals currently quarantined will be “re-examined and tested for the virus to ensure their utmost safety,” it said, adding that all buildings and vehicles would be disinfected and sterilized. WAM also said that the UAE education ministry had decided to suspend schools and other educational institutions for four weeks from Sunday as part of measures to prevent the spread of the disease.

He had mainly spent time in Singapore and arrived back in Chile on February 25. The Talca hospital’s director, Alfredo Donoso, said the patient only started exhibiting coronavirus symptoms a week after returning to Chile, although those were “quite light.” “He was admitted with a high fever, but then that became normal and he is now totally free of symptoms here in the Talca hospital and is in isolation,” said Donoso.

The DFA will certainly raise these issues with the foreign authorities when necessary,” DFA Assistant Secretary Eduardo Meñez said Tuesday night. While the DFA official acknowledged that there have been reports of discrimination and even violence specifically against Chinese nationals as an offshoot of the COVID-19 spread, he nevertheless noted that many governments have been very vocal in rejecting the phenomenon. “There have been reports of discrimination and even violence against those appearing to be from where the virus is found ever since COVID-19 became a global concern. Many governments and personalities (even in the Philippines) have spoken out against this particular phenomenon,” he said. A video of the brawl involving two men, one of them claimed to be a Filipino, was posted on YouTube on Wednesday, Feb. 26. The video shows the two men engaged in a fistfight and yelling at each other while inside a supermarket in the town of Casalputerlengo, about 532 kilometers north of Rome. Casalpusterlengo is one of the 11 Italian towns currently on lockdown due to the COVID-19 outbreak.

Nationwide, there are more than 100 confirmed cases, on both coasts and in the Midwest. The Life Care Center, a nursing home and rehabilitation facility in the Seattle suburbs is at the center of the Washington outbreak so far. The center has banned visits from family members until further notice and suspended new admissions. Susan Gregg, a spokeswoman for Seattle’s Harborview Medical Center, where one patient died, said public health officials were identifying care workers who had come in contact with the victim. “In coordination with Public Health, we have determined that some staff may have been exposed while working in an intensive care unit where the patient had been treated,” Gregg said. Health officials around the world have been scrambling to contain the spread of the virus, which first erupted in China late last year and has so far killed more than 3,100 people worldwide. US President Donald Trump visited the National Institutes of Health outside the US capital for an update on efforts to develop a vaccine. He said that for now, the government was not looking at any domestic travel restrictions, describing Washington state as the “one hot spot” for now. US experts “have been just ahead of it,” Trump said. The Republican president said he was not looking at banning mass gatherings for the time being, including the upcoming annual “March Madness” college basketball championship.   Tags: ncov"

,"March 3, 2020, 5:32 PM",nCov,China threatens retaliation over US ‘bullying’ of state media,By Agence France-Presse,"By Agence France-Presse China threatened Tuesday to retaliate against US “bullying” after Washington imposed staff cuts on Chinese state media, two weeks after expelling three Wall Street Journal reporters. The US said its decision Monday to require Beijing’s state-run media to cut the number of Chinese nationals employed in the US was based on leveling numbers between the countries rather than hitting back over content.  This file photo taken on February 24, 2020 shows Wall Street Journal reporters Josh Chin (R) and Philip Wen walking through Beijing Capital Airport before their departure. (Photo by GREG BAKER / AFP / MANILA BULLETIN) Foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said China “strongly opposes and condemns” the US announcement, adding that it effectively means the expulsion of Chinese journalists. “Out of a Cold War mindset and ideological bias, the US State Department uses groundless reasons to politically oppress Chinese media organisations based in the US,” Zhao said at a regular press briefing. He said the move exposes “the hypocrisy of the United States’ so-called freedom of the press as blatant double standard and hegemonic bullying”. Saying China reserves the right to react and take further action, Zhao added: “It was the US who broke the rules of the game first, China can only follow suit.” Visa weapon  China on February 19 ordered three reporters from The Wall Street Journal — two US nationals and an Australian — out of the country in its harshest move against international media in years. China said it took action because the newspaper had not apologized for a “racially discriminatory” headline that read “China is the Real Sick Man of Asia” and appeared on an opinion column about the nation’s fight against the coronavirus. The three journalists were not involved in writing the opinion piece. Two of them left the country last week, but the third has been reporting in Wuhan, the central Chinese city that has been under quarantine since late January to contain the deadly coronavirus epidemic. In its annual report released Monday, the Foreign Correspondents’ Club of China said Beijing was using visas as a weapon to intimidate foreign press “like never before” and feared it was preparing to kick out more reporters. It said China had also been reducing the time journalists can stay, with at least 12 correspondents issued credentials for half a year or less — more than double the number from a year earlier. A US State Department official said five Chinese media outlets, which last month were reclassified by the United States as foreign missions, would be allowed to employ a maximum 100 Chinese nationals as of March 13, down from around 160 now. The organization most affected by the new restriction will be the state news agency Xinhua, which will be allowed to keep 59 Chinese staff in the US, according to the official.   Tags: ncov"

Globally, the virus has killed more than 3,100 people and infected over 90,000 even as a clear shift in the crisis emerges, with nine times as many new cases recorded outside China as inside, according to the WHO.  The WHO has warned that the world has entered uncharted territory in its fight against the deadly new coronavirus (AFP / STR / MANILA BULLETIN) China has imposed draconian quarantines and travel restrictions to keep large swathes of the population indoors for weeks, a strategy that appears to have paid off as new cases have been generally falling for days. While Italy has locked down towns, other countries have stopped short of imposing mass quarantines and instead have discouraged large gatherings, delayed sporting events and banned arrivals from virus-hit nations. Twitter told staff across the world to work from home. South Korea, Iran and Italy have emerged as major COVID-19 hotspots, which is believed to have started at a market that sold wild animals in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year. With concerns growing about its impact on the global economy, G7 finance ministers and central bank chiefs will hold talks on the issue on Tuesday. South Korea, the biggest cluster outside China, approached 5,000 cases on Tuesday as 477 new infections were reported, with two more fatalities taking its death toll to 28. “The entire country has entered a war with the infectious disease,” South Korean President Moon Jae-in said. By contrast, China reported 125 new cases on Tuesday — its lowest daily increase in six weeks — with all but 11 infections in Hubei province, of which Wuhan is the capital. The nationwide death toll rose to 2,943 with 31 more deaths, all in Hubei, with some 80,000 total cases. China is even importing infections now, with 13 confirmed so far, including eight Chinese nationals who had worked at the same restaurant in northern Italy’s Lombardy region. “We are in uncharted territory,” WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Monday. “We have never before seen a respiratory pathogen that is capable of community transmission, but which can also be contained with the right measures.” Community transmission means infections within a population are not imported from another virus-hit area. The United States is now facing a potential epidemic, with six people dying in the northwestern state of Washington, where officials warned residents the battle against the disease was shifting from containment to mitigation. “The risk for all of us of becoming infected will be increasing,” said Jeff Duchin, a health officer in King County where five of the deaths occurred. The county has more than two million residents and is home to Seattle, a major commercial and transportation hub. US eyes treatment  The White House, which has been accused of downplaying the threat from the virus, struck a bullish tone. Vice President Mike Pence declared that a treatment “could literally be available by this summer, or early fall”. He was likely referring to remdesivir, an antiviral drug developed by the pharmaceutical firm Gilead that has already been used to treat one US patient and was moving toward two expansive final stage trials in Asia. Pence also announced American pharmaceuticals were forming a consortium to fight the virus, and that South Korea and Italy would screen all their airline passengers bound for the US. Despite its world-class hospitals and cutting-edge research, the US is viewed as vulnerable to an epidemic because of glaring disparities in healthcare availability, with nearly 28 million people without coverage. Chinese officials have touted progress in their own battle against the epidemic, and in another sign of growing confidence, 19 provinces resumed inter-provincial bus services on Sunday, according to state media. But the restrictions have hammered the world’s second-largest economy and threatened to cut into global growth. After tanking last week, most Asian stock markets were up on Tuesday following a surge on Wall Street as governments and central banks said they would step in if needed to soften the blow. Australia’s central bank slashed interest rates to a record low on Tuesday. Hotspots elsewhere  UN medical experts arrived in Iran on Monday to help tackle the world’s second-deadliest coronavirus outbreak, with 66 fatalities and more than 1,500 infections. In Italy, tourist hotpots including the Duomo in Milan reopened to visitors but access was limited to avoid overcrowding. Italy, Europe’s worst-affected country with around 1,700 infections, said Monday its deaths from the virus had jumped 18 to 52. The WHO says the virus appears to particularly hit people over the age of 60 and those already weakened by other illnesses. Its mortality rate is between two and five percent — higher than the seasonal flu.   Tags: ncov"

Cribbing the tune from pop song “Jealous” — or “Ghen” in Vietnamese — by singers Erik and Min, the Ministry of Health released an animated video with lyrics telling its citizens to “push back the virus Corona, Corona”.  (Vietnam Ministry of Health / MANILA BULLETIN) The unlikely earworm by a usually staid Communist government drew hundreds of thousands of views on Youtube, and was also featured on HBO’s comedic news show “Last Week Tonight”, with host John Oliver calling it a “genuine club-banger”. In Vietnam, the nation’s youth have taken to TikTok performing hand-washing dance moves, making sure to rub in-between their fingers and their fingernails — which health professionals have recommended. Spin-offs include office workers grooving at their desks and even people dressed in the Hmong ethnic minority outfits dancing in front of a waterfall. “The remote village also prevents and fights the epidemic,” read the caption on a video featuring the Hmong couple. Popularised by dancer and internet personality Qang Dang, who has nearly 300,000 followers on TikTok and Instagram, he and another dancer performed it with light-hearted swagger on a street with food vendors. It was tagged with the government-issued hashtag #ghencovychallenge, and Dang’s original video has been viewed more than 1.1 million times. The song provides guidance on how to prevent an infection, such as washing hands by “rub, rub, rubbing evenly” and limiting “visits to crowded places”. “We want the song to give fire and reduce tension for those… leading this fight, including experts, doctors, medical workers and millions of laborers who are on the frontline to fight this epidemic daily,” the health ministry posted in the video’s description. “Vietnam is determined to win this epidemic!” Communist-run Vietnam has a booming youth demographic, with two-thirds of its 97 million citizens under the age of 35. It has 16 confirmed cases of the coronavirus, though it says all patients have recovered and been discharged. The country, which shares a porous border with China, has taken great measures in the fight against the virus, including putting a small village an hour from Hanoi under quarantine after five confirmed cases emerged from there.

Dandong, the northern Chinese city which borders North Korea, said it would test all visitors who arrived in the city from Feb. 12. Those who arrived from Feb. 28 will be tested at designated hotels where they can undergo quarantine if infected. “We are trying to distance ourselves from the virus, but what cannot be broken is the flesh and blood relationships between overseas Chinese and their families in their hometowns,” said the government of Qingtian county in the southeastern Zhejiang province. It added that traveling was the easiest way for cross-infections to happen, describing staying home as the “best form of protection”. “For the sake of your family’s health and safety, please strengthen your precautions, carefully decide on your travel plans and minimize mobility,” it said. The number of new daily infections overseas now exceeded new cases in China, with Italy, South Korea and Iran focal points. Mainland China had 125 new confirmed cases of coronavirus infections on Monday, the National Health Commission said on Tuesday, down from 202 cases a day earlier and the lowest since the authority started publishing nationwide data in January. Excluding cases in Hubei province, where the outbreak first started, there were 11 new cases in mainland China on Monday. Seven of the new cases were imported, involving Chinese nationals who had traveled from Italy to Qingtian county. The seven people had close contact with a previously disclosed case and all eight worked together in a restaurant in Bergamo, a city in the Lombardy region of northern Italy, the Qingtian government said in a statement on its WeChat account. Last week, six of them took a flight from Milan to Shanghai, stopping over in Moscow, while the seventh flew via Germany to Shanghai. They tested positive for the coronavirus on Monday after arriving in Qingtian. None of them had been to Hubei province or its capital Wuhan, the Qingtian government said. China has said it will focus on preventing those infected with coronavirus from crossing borders, as other imported cases had arrived in the country last week. China’s new confirmed cases of coronavirus infections on Monday was driven by a further decline in new confirmed cases in Wuhan, the city hit hardest by the pathogen in China. New cases in Wuhan fell to 111 from 193 a day earlier, and accounted for almost all of the 114 new infections in central Hubei province on Monday. Excluding Hubei, there were 11 new cases in mainland China on Monday, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in mainland China so far to 80,151.

Authorities said more than 190,000 members had been checked as of Tuesday. Lee Man-hee, the 88-year-old founder of the sect, apologized for the outbreak on Monday — twice bowing his head to the ground at a televised press conference — insisting his organization was cooperating with the government’s containment efforts.

(REUTERS/David Ryder / MANILA BULLETIN) At least four of the six people who died were either elderly or had underlying health conditions or both, Duchin said. Nevertheless, Vice President Mike Pence, speaking at a White House briefing, said the risk to Americans from coronavirus remained low. Earlier in the day, two senior officials said the Trump administration was weighing whether to have the president issue an emergency declaration to help cover state and local costs of responding to the coronavirus. Further tightening of travel restrictions on countries hard-hit by the virus also were under consideration, President Donald Trump said during a meeting with pharmaceutical company executives. Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Stephen Hahn said he expects that by the end of this week close to 1 million coronavirus tests will be completed. The total number of cases detected by the public health system in Washington state now stands at 18, the most of any state. In addition to the 14 King County cases, four residents of nearby Snohomish County have tested positive for the virus, officials said. “We expect the number of cases will continue to increase in the coming days and weeks, and we are taking this situation extremely seriously,” Duchin said.

However, he also said the vast majority of diagnosed patients have mild to moderate symptoms and do not need hospitalization. In addition to confirmed cases, King County has about 29 potential cases awaiting test results, so the number there could soon rise, officials said. Tests were being conducted on about 200 samples a day, and health officials expect to boost the number of tests to at least 1,000 a day soon. Duchin said his county was not recommending school closures or cancellation of any events. As of Sunday, the number of confirmed and presumptive cases in the United States had risen to 91, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said. Many of those were among people repatriated to the United States, either from the Diamond Princess cruise ship previously quarantined in Japan or from the Chinese city of Wuhan, where the global outbreak originated. The number of presumed cases reported by states but not yet officially confirmed by the CDC stood at 27, up from seven previously. The CDC will confirm the tests sent by states with their own diagnostics. So far, 10 states, including California and New York, have confirmed or presumed cases. Tags: ncov"

Some 166 people remained were in intensive care, while 149 patients had recovered since the epidemic hit Italy, it said. The World Health Organization said Monday that the number of new coronavirus cases registered in the past day in China was far lower than in the rest of the world — but the situations in Italy, South Korea, Iran and Japan were concerning. To date, more than 3,000 people have died globally from the new virus, while nearly 90,000 have been infected around the world, according to AFP’s latest toll based on official sources. Italy is Europe’s worst-affected country. It has carried out over 23,300 tests so far, largely in the wealth north, where 11 towns have been placed under quarantine.

As the official death toll rose by 12 to 66, the Islamic republic turned down a similar offer from arch-enemy Washington, dismissing it as “propaganda”.  The UAE provided the military plane for the aid flight to Tehran despite having downgraded its relations with Iran (AFP Photo/KARIM SAHIB / MANILA BULLETIN) The World Health Organization said a flight arrived from Dubai carrying medical supplies and experts on a fact-finding mission and to “provide guidance on strengthening and scaling up the response to the ongoing outbreak.” Germany, France, and Britain, for their part, said they would send emergency medical supplies including testing equipment, bodysuits, and gloves as well as five million euros ($5.5 million) to help tackle the outbreak. Iran’s confirmed cases leapt Monday by 523 on the previous day, hitting 1,501, said Deputy Health Minister Alireza Raisi. State news agency IRNA reported the death of Mohammad Mirmohammadi, 72, a member of the Expediency Council which advises Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. It did not specify the cause of death but said he had died at Tehran’s Massih Danechvari Hospital, the capital’s main center for coronavirus patients. The outbreak that originated in China has sparked concern among Iran’s neighbors, with the Gulf Arab states confirming 130 cases including, on Monday, Saudi Arabia’s first case. The health ministry in Riyadh, another key rival of Tehran, said the man had tested positive after returning from Iran. Many of the Gulf’s other victims are pilgrims returning from Iran, especially the Shiite holy city of Qom where the country’s first case was reported. US President Donald Trump had Saturday offered: “If we can help the Iranians with this problem, we are certainly willing to do so… All they have to do is ask.” But Tehran rejected the offer, charging that Trump, who has heaped sanctions and a campaign of “maximum pressure” on Iran, was offering help “for propaganda purposes”. “We are suspicious of the intentions of the Americans and do not count on this aid,” said foreign ministry spokesman Abbas Moussavi, quoted by IRNA. Germany, France, and Britain, who remain as signatories to a 2015 nuclear deal with Iran despite Trump’s withdrawal, expressed “their full solidarity with all impacted by COVID-19 in Iran”. Beijing, also a signatory to the nuclear deal, said an expert team from China had arrived Saturday in Tehran “to provide what assistance it can in terms of epidemic prevention and control and medical relief”. ‘Supplies running low’  The WHO said it had sent Iran “medical supplies and protective equipment to support over 15,000 health care workers, as well as enough laboratory kits to test and diagnose nearly 100,000 people”. As the goods worth more than $300,000 — including gloves, surgical masks and respirators — were loaded onto an Emirati transport plane in Dubai, WHO’s Robert Blanchard warned that global supplies were running low. “What we see now is that demand has greatly exceeded our available stocks… and we are struggling to get access to more supplies.” The six-member medical team is made up of doctors, epidemiologists and laboratory specialists to help Iran detect and control the virus, Blanchard said. WHO operations manager Nevien Attalla said the supplies were the “first big shipment which supports the response to coronavirus”. “Iran is a challenging country. You don’t have always easy approvals to go,” she said. The UAE provided the military transport plane for the flight despite having downgraded its relations with the Islamic republic amid fierce rivalry between Iran and close UAE ally Saudi Arabia. Gulf states have announced a raft of measures to cut links with Iran to curb the spread of the virus, cutting off transport links and telling citizens not to visit. “Aid should reach all people regardless of their background,” said Sultan Mohammed al-Shamsi, the UAE’s undersecretary for humanitarian affairs.

In China, where the deadly new virus first appeared last December, the number of new cases being registered each days is meanwhile continuing to decline, with only 206 new cases reported to WHO on Sunday. That marks the lowest number of daily cases reported since January 22, Tedros said, adding that all but eight of those cases were reported in Hubei province — the epicentre of the outbreak. Outside of China, however, 8,739 cases have now been registered across 61 countries, including 127 deaths, according to WHO’s latest count. Tedros said a “window of opportunity” remains to contain the outbreak, noting that “more than 130 countries have not detected any cases yet”. In the countries that are seeing cases, he said the situations in South Korea, Iran, Italy and Japan are currently “our greatest concern”. Iran reported 12 more deaths on Monday, raising the country’s toll to 66, the second biggest after China. A WHO mission to support the Iranian response to the outbreak arrived in the country on Monday, bringing with it “protective equipment to support over 15,000 health care workers”. The team also brought “laboratory kits enough to test and diagnose nearly 100,000 people,” WHO said. South Korea, the biggest nest of infections outside China, reported nearly 500 new cases on Monday, raising its total past 4,000. Half of South Korea’s cases are linked to a sect whose leader apologised Monday for the spread of the disease. Tedros said he was encouraged to see that most of the South Korean cases were linked to “five known clusters”, indicating “that surveillance measures are working.” Tags: ncov"

Organizers said only a short session on the opening day would now be held following a request from UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres that the conference be drastically scaled back because of coronavirus fears. In a statement, they said a draft political declaration will be adopted and then the meeting will be suspended — “to be resumed at a later date” with a full schedule and participation. “No general debate will take place on 9 March and all side events will be cancelled,” said the statement. The conference was to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the Beijing Declaration, a blueprint aimed at advancing women’s rights.

An Iranian woman wearing a protective mask checks a message on her smart phone in the Tehran as the country faces a coronavirus outbreak (AFP Photo/ATTA KENARE / MANILA BULLETIN) Schools have been shut across the country as part of measures aimed at stemming the rapid spread of COVID-19, the virus that has now claimed 66 lives out of more than 1,500 cases in Iran. “It’s extremely hard for us but I can’t take a taxi or bus to go somewhere even if my feet hurt” from walking, said Parmis’ mother Shahpar. “My daughter was depressed at home, so I brought her out shopping to cheer her up,” said the 45-year-old housewife. “They (the children) haven’t been going to school, and they are scared of the virus,” she told AFP. As she spoke, cars and buses flew past at irregular intervals after sling-shotting out of Vanak Square — one of the capital’s biggest intersections where traffic normally snarls at that time of day. Gone too was the pollution that usually shrouds the sprawling city of more than eight million, thanks at least in part to the reduced congestion. That was of little comfort to 39-year-old architect Pejman, who expressed fears about the spread of the novel coronavirus. “The disease has disrupted our lives. We are scared. There are no masks and no alcohol for disinfection. People need them but cannot find them,” he told AFP. ‘People are frightened’  Businesses are suffering too. Pejman said some of his work colleagues were suspected of having the virus and ordered to stay away at home. “It has had a bad effect on our company. They now test our temperatures every morning before we enter the office,” he said. The economic slowdown was tangible on the streets. Shop assistants passed the time by playing games, cleaners meticulously wiped down the doors and windows of empty restaurants, and taxis sat idle on the side of the road waiting for customers. “The streets are empty,” Jamshidi said as his taxi driver colleagues shared a meal and engaged in rowdy banter. “It’s my job to… take people where they need to go, but nobody is leaving their homes to go anywhere,” he told AFP. “If the situation remains like this, we won’t have enough money to eat. Yesterday I earned very little and so far today I haven’t had any passengers.” Hamid Bayot, who owns a juice shop on Vanat Square, said sales were down by 80 percent since the coronavirus outbreak emerged last month. And that is despite steps the business has taken to reassure its customers. “We disinfect everything three times every day. But people are frightened and haven’t been buying anything from us,” said Bayot. “If the situation remains like this, we’ll go bankrupt and we will have to close our shop.” In an apparent bid to cure the boredom of youths, state television has been airing light-hearted shows on its typically austere news channel. It has shown blooper home videos in the past few days and on Monday it broadcast a Pink Panther cartoon as well as the trailer of The Revenant, a film starring Leonardo DiCaprio. “We have to stay at home and do nothing. We can’t see our friends and we are no longer happy,” Parmis said grudgingly through the face mask given to her by her mother. Tags: ncov"

Health Minister Diouf Sarr urges Senegal’s population to stay calm after the country reported its first coronavirus case (AFP Photo/Seyllou) A French man who lives in Senegal visited France in mid-February, contracting the virus before returning to the West African country and being quarantined in the capital Dakar, Senegal’s Health Minister Diouf Sarr said. “The results of the tests carried out by the Pasteur Institute in Dakar came back positive,” Sarr told journalists. “So far the patient’s condition has not raised any major concerns.” The patient, a father of two who has lived in Senegal for more than two years, stayed in the southern French city of Nimes as well as a unspecified ski resort last month, Sarr said. The man then returned to Senegal on February 26, where he went to a medical centre and registered a fever of 39 degrees Celsius (102 Fahrenheit) as well as a sore throat and headache. The centre contacted the country’s coronavirus alert unit and the patient was quarantined, the minister said. “The surveillance and response system for COVID-19 has been bolstered and all measures are being taken to contain the disease,” Sarr said. He urged the population to stay calm, adding he was “perfectly confident” in the country’s health system. The first case in sub-Saharan African was recorded last week in Nigeria, where an Italian national returned with the virus from his home country. Italy has emerged as the European hotspot for the deadly virus, with more than 2,000 cases, while France has reported the third most in Europe, with at least 130. Before Senegal and Nigeria, the only reported cases in Africa were in Egypt and Algeria. But experts fear the virus spreading to Africa, which struggles with conflicts, poor health infrastructure, crowded cities with inadequate sanitation, rickety governance and porous borders — all of which provide excellent opportunities for the virus to spread. The World Health Organization (WHO) has urged African countries to come together and be more aggressive in attacking the virus. “Our biggest concern continues to be the potential for COVID-19 to spread in countries with weaker health systems,” WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said last week.

The unprecedented moves have left thousands of Muslim pilgrims in limbo, raising uncertainty over the annual hajj to Mecca scheduled for end of July. The holy sites, which draw millions of pilgrims every year, are a potential source of contagion but also a pillar of political legitimacy for Saudi rulers and a key revenue earner.

The sixth victim was from Snohomish county, officials said. “The risk for all of us of becoming infected will be increasing,” said Jeff Duchin, a health officer in King County. “Although most of the cases will be mild or moderate, the infection can cause serious illness and there’s a potential for many people to become ill at the same time.” The state reported four new cases, three from the same nursing home, taking the total number of US cases to more than 90 — about half of which were people repatriated from either China or a virus-stricken cruise ship off Japan. Dow Constantine, the top official in King County, said his administration was in talks to purchase a motel in which to place people who required isolation, adding: “We have to move to a new stage in the fight to contain, mitigate and manage this outbreak.” Earlier in the day, New York’s governor warned it was “inevitable” that the virus would spread in the global financial hub after its first confirmed case was detected in a health care worker who had visited Iran. “There is no doubt that there will be more cases. This is New York — we’re a gateway to the world,” Andrew Cuomo told reporters. “People are going to test positive, not just one or two or three or five, there will be many who test positive,” he added. Cuomo said the 39-year-old woman who tested positive at the weekend had mild symptoms and was recovering in isolation at home. Her husband is however expected to test positive as well. He added that the Manhattan resident had been “very aware of her situation” and had taken a private car to her home from the airport on Tuesday. “She did textbook everything right.

But strength on Wall Street — which rebounded from sharp losses last week to post gains of more than two percent Monday — helped European markets emerge from the red after governments and central banks said they would step in if needed to soften the blow. China’s economy has ground to a halt with large swathes of the country under quarantine or subject to strict travel restrictions. Other countries have started to enact their own containment measures, banning arrivals from virus-hit nations, locking down towns, urging citizens to stay home and suspending major events such as football matches and trade fairs. The Louvre — the world’s most visited museum — was closed on Sunday and Monday after staff refused to work because of fears about the virus, which has now claimed three lives in France. In Geneva, the UN headquarters said it was closing its doors to visitors and curbing some activities linked to the UN Human Rights Council. In Italy, tourist hotpots including the Duomo in Milan reopened to visitors but access was limited to avoid overcrowding in a bid to contain the virus. Italy is Europe’s worst-affected country with around 1,700 infections. EU Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides said there were more than 2,100 confirmed cases across 18 member states. Elsewhere in Europe, Sweden barred flights from Iran — where cases have rapidly ballooned — while France, Germany and Britain said they would send medical and financial aid to the Middle Eastern nation struggling to contain the outbreak. Iran reported 12 more deaths on Monday, raising the country’s toll to 66, the second biggest after China’s. It also reported more than 500 new cases, raising its total number of infections to 1,501. – South Korea sect –
China reported 42 more deaths on Monday — all in central Hubei province, bringing the death toll to 2,912. The pathogen is believed to have originated in a market that sold wild animals in Hubei’s capital Wuhan. China’s National Health Commission reported 202 new infections on Monday, the lowest daily rise since late January, bringing the nationwide total to over 80,000. In a sign of an apparently improving situation, authorities in Wuhan closed on Sunday one of 16 makeshift hospitals built or repurposed from public buildings to treat the city’s huge number of patients. The WHO says the virus appears to particularly hit people over the age of 60 and those already weakened by other illnesses. It has a mortality rate of between two and five percent. Infections are now rising faster abroad than in China, as the country’s drastic measures, including quarantining some 56 million people in Hubei since late January, appear to be paying off. South Korea, the worst affected outside China, reported nearly 500 new cases on Monday, raising its total past 4,000. Four more people died there, taking the country’s toll to 22. Half of South Korea’s cases are linked to a sect whose leader Lee Man-hee apologised Monday for the spread of the disease. Seoul’s city government has asked prosecutors to press murder charges against him for failing to cooperate in efforts to contain the virus. South Korea’s cases are expected to rise further as authorities test more than 260,000 people associated with the group. Meanwhile, a second person died in the northwestern US state of Washington as President Donald Trump, who has played down the risk of a major outbreak, faced criticism over his administration’s preparedness. He was due to hold talks with pharmaceutical executives on the response to the outbreak. New York reported its first case, in a woman who had visited Iran, and the governor said he expected the virus to spread in the global financial hub. Tags: ncov"

The anti-coronavirus task force said in a statement quoted by Russian news agencies that the “young man” had fallen ill on February 21 while on vacation to Italy. The man, who resides outside Moscow, returned to Russia on February 23, and started showing signs of a respiratory viral infection, it said. He sought medical help and was hospitalized on February 27. Testing confirmed the infection on Monday and his symptoms were not severe, the statement said. Nearly 90,000 people have been infected in over 60 countries and more than 3,000 people have been killed by COVID-19. Russia has so far managed to avoid a large number of infections and introduced a range of travel and visa restrictions. Russia repatriated and quarantined a number of passengers from the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan, three of whom tested positive for the virus. Two Chinese citizens in Russia were also infected and treated in Siberia. Moscow has imposed a near blanket ban on Chinese visitors over coronavirus fears and has closed rail links with China and halted most flights. Authorities have also announced restrictions on travel to Russia from Iran and South Korea, two countries hit by the outbreak, and most recently advised against all non-essential foreign travel.

,"March 2, 2020, 3:55 PM",nCov,China steps up visa threats against foreign reporters: media group,By Agence France-Presse,"By Agence France-Presse The Chinese government is threatening to remove visas from journalists as a weapon to intimidate foreign media “like never before”, a press group said Monday, following the expulsion of three reporters last month. In its annual report, the Foreign Correspondents’ Club of China said it also feared Beijing was preparing to kick out more reporters, with two journalists this year given working visas of only a single month.  This file photo taken on February 24, 2020 shows Wall Street Journal reporters Josh Chin (R) and Philip Wen walking through Beijing Capital Airport before their departure. (Photo by GREG BAKER / AFP / MANILA BULLETIN) At least 12 correspondents received press credentials valid for six months or less — more than double the number given short-term visas the previous year, in what the FCCC called a record. Resident journalist visas, which are mandatory for all foreign media based in mainland China, are typically issued for one year. “Chinese authorities are using visas as weapons against the foreign press like never before,” the report warned, flagging a “continued decline in reporting conditions”. Since President Xi Jinping came to power in 2013, China has forced out nine foreign journalists, either through outright expulsion or by non-renewal of visas, the FCCC said. The report also found a majority of journalists surveyed — 82 percent — said they had experienced interference, harassment or violence while reporting in China over the past year. Nearly double the correspondents surveyed this year faced difficulty renewing their credentials, and almost all of them believed this was related to their reporting. In late February, Beijing ordered three reporters from The Wall Street Journal to leave the country over what it deemed a racist headline in an opinion piece they were not involved in writing. Deputy bureau chief Josh Chin and reporter Chao Deng, both US nationals, as well as reporter Philip Wen, an Australian, were given five days to leave. The reporters had reported on Xinjiang, covering forced labor, surveillance and re-education camps. Last August, China refused to renew the press credentials of Wall Street Journal correspondent Chun Han Wong after he and Wen wrote an article on one of Xi’s cousins. The group warned that “hostility toward foreign press is now so pervasive that the most basic elements of journalism are often frustrated in China”.

,"March 2, 2020, 3:53 PM",nCov,‘They’re the virus’: Iraq outbreak refuels anti-govt protests,By Agence France-Presse,"By Agence France-Presse Iraqi protesters had been rallying against government incompetence, poor public services and foreign meddling for months before a novel coronavirus outbreak. Then the epidemic arrived and breathed new life to their grievances. “The real virus is Iraqi politicians,” said Fatima, an 18-year-old protester and medical student from Baghdad.  omen student protesters wearing protective face masks march with a sign during an anti-government demonstration in Iraq’s southern city of Nasiriyah (AFP Photo/Asaad NIAZI / MANILA BULLETIN) “We are immune to almost everything else.” Across protest squares in the capital and southern hotspots, the anti-government demonstrators mobilized since October have started to take public health into their own hands. They have distributed leaflets and delivered lectures on coronavirus prevention, while volunteers have handed out free medical masks, which have more than doubled in price in local markets. Makeshift clinics erected months ago to treat demonstrators hit by live fire and tear gas canisters are now dispensing gloves and sanitizers. Volunteers in biohazard suits take the temperature of protesters lined up in organized queues. “Even in normal times our health care system is totally run down,” said Fatima, a volunteer in central Baghdad’s Tahrir Square, epicenter of the protests. “Now on top of everything, we have a coronavirus outbreak, and we are supposed to rely on these facilities?” Inside medical centers, blood-stained sinks in washrooms and ill-equipped amenities have become a common sight. Hasan Khallati, a member of parliament’s health committee, told AFP that “hospitals and healthcare facilities are fully-equipped to deal with the outbreak” of COVID-19. But available data tells a different story. According to the World Health Organization, Iraq has less than 10 doctors for every 10,000 residents. Outbreak next-door  Iraq reported its first coronavirus case last week in an Iranian national studying at a religious seminary in the southern shrine city of Najaf. The total number of diagnosed infections has since jumped to 19 — all traced to the Islamic republic, just across the border. Iran has recorded 54 deaths among 978 cases, the largest death toll outside China, the epidemic’s epicentre. This has sparked public panic in Iraq, one of Iran’s largest export markets and a popular destination for Iranian pilgrims visiting Najaf and Karbala, another holy city. Many Iraqis also flow across the frontier for business, tourism, medical treatment and religious studies. Responding to the outbreak, Iraqi authorities closed land borders with Iran and banned the entry of foreign nationals traveling from the Islamic republic and other badly affected countries. In the protest camps, anti-Iranian sentiment is on the rise, having surged in recent months among demonstrators who accuse Iran of meddling in Iraq’s internal affairs. This has been compounded by accusations that Iranian officials are covering up the severity of the outbreak within their borders. Iraqi officials, protesters say, are doing the same. “We think there are cases the government has not yet declared,” medical student Russol said at a protest camp in the southern city of Diwaniya. “They need to be transparent with the people,” she said. ‘Snipers didn’t deter us’  With schools, universities, cinemas, cafes and other public places ordered shut until March 7, turnout at protests had been expected to fall, especially after the government said it would restrict large gatherings over virus fears. Populist cleric Moqtada Sadr, regarded as an engine of the protest movement before he withdrew his support in late January, told his loyalists they were prohibited from demonstrating because of the epidemic. But students who make up the bulk of the anti-government movement have taken advantage of suspended classes to trickle back onto the streets. On Sunday, they flowed into protest camps in Baghdad and Diwaniya to press for a government overhaul two months after outgoing premier Adel Abdel Mahdi resigned under popular pressure. Undeterred, they said they have faced much deadlier threats than the novel coronavirus which has yet to lead to fatalities in Iraq. “Your snipers didn’t deter us, what can coronavirus do?” protesters chanted. Security forces have used tear gas, rubber bullets, flashbangs, live rounds and even machine-gun fire to disperse protests. Since October 1, around 550 people have been killed and 30,000 others injured, mostly protesters. Last week alone, four protesters were shot dead in protest camps and one activist was assassinated in his home. “Political parties and corruption are an epidemic that is much more dangerous than the coronavirus,” said Mohammad, a university student in Diwaniya. “This is the outbreak we want to get rid of because it has destroyed Iraq.”   Tags: ncov"

(REUTERS/Andrew Kelly / MANILA BULLETIN) Australia, one of the first countries to put restrictions on its borders in a bid to limit the spread of the virus, confirmed its first death from the disease on Sunday. “It is no longer possible to absolutely prevent new cases coming in,” Brendan Murphy, Australia’s Chief Medical Officer, told reporters in Canberra. “We have got concerns about Japan and South Korea. They are working hard to control their outbreaks but we are still concerned that people in those countries and other high risk countries may present with an infection.” The chief medical officer’s comments came as Australian officials confirmed the country’s 30th case of coronavirus, a 40-year old man who arrived in Australia’s second most populated city, Melbourne from Iran. He later travelled to Tasmania. Meanwhile, Australia named the 78-year old man who became the country’s first person to die from coronavirus as James Kwan. He was a passenger on the Diamond Princess ship that was held off Japan’s coast for weeks. Kwan and his wife, who also has the virus, were transferred back to Australia for treatment. Australia barred entry from Feb. 1 to any foreigners who had travelled through China in the two weeks prior to arriving in Australia. It extended that ban to Iran on Sunday. Both bans are in force until at least March 7. Australian citizens and permanent residents are exempted. China, the epicentre of the outbreak, retains the bulk of the infections with more than 86,500 cases. However, it has since spread to 53 countries, with more than 6,500 cases and more than 100 deaths. The majority of the deaths outside of China have come from outbreaks in recent days in South Korea, Italy and Iran. Murphy said travel bans were “a way of slowing things down” as he urged any Australians returning from Italy or South Korea who work in the healthcare sector to self-quarantine for two weeks. However, he said the outbreaks in Italy and South Korea, while large, were confined and localised, meaning that further travel bans to Australia were not necessary.

WASHINGTON, DC – FEBRUARY 29: U.S. President Donald Trump listens as Vice President Mike Pence speaks during a news conference at the James Brady Press Briefing Room at the White House February 29, 2020 in Washington, DC. Department of Health in Washington State has reported the first death in the U.S. related to the coronavirus. (Alex Wong/Getty Images/AFP / MANILA BULLETIN) Pence and Health Secretary Alex Azar made the rounds of Sunday talk shows with the message that risks from the disease remain low for most Americans, while promising to make up for testing shortfalls. “We could have more sad news, but the American people should know the risk to the average American remains low,” Pence said on CNN’s “State of the Union.” The assurances came a day after officials confirmed that two men had died in the northwestern state of Washington after becoming infected with the virus. The first was a man in his 50s, with no known contact with persons infected abroad. The second was a man in his 70s. Both had “underlying health issues,” according to the public health officials. Azar told “Fox News Sunday” the man in his 50s was in a hospital to which a nursing home, hit by a coronavirus outbreak, had sent patients. “So right now there’s a large investigation going on in the nursing home, the hospital, contact tracing to try to determine where that disease was introduced and how it might have spread,” he said. The United States has had about 70 confirmed coronavirus cases in all, including 47 patients who were repatriated from virus hotspots in Asia and quarantined for 14 days on their return, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Pence put the number of cases among repatriated Americans at 46. There are more than 20 other cases in the United States, including the first infection in New York state confirmed on Sunday — a woman who had traveled to Iran. She was described as not being in a serious condition. Genetic analysis suggests the novel coronavirus had probably been spreading undetected for about six weeks in Washington state, The New York Times reported. Testing kits  The spread of the virus through communities would be an ominous development that would almost certainly intensify the epidemic in the United States. US health authorities have been slow to distribute coronavirus testing kits, however, making the dimensions of the problem uncertain. “It’s a very fair question, and it’s one of the first issues that governors I spoke to raised with me,” Pence said when asked on CNN why the US was so far behind other countries in producing testing kits. He said more than 15,000 testing kits were released over the weekend, the federal Food and Drug Administration has approved a testing regime, and the government was working with a commercial provider to produce an additional 50,000 kits. President Donald Trump put Pence in charge of the US response last week, amid rising complaints that the administration had been slow to prepare for the virus’s spread. Trump himself had been criticized for seeming to low-ball the risk, even as experts from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned of a looming health emergency. ‘Political talking points’ Former vice president and Democratic candidate Joe Biden attacked what he described as Trump’s “incompetence” in dealing with the epidemic, accusing him of muzzling the government’s top experts. “I see no preparedness other than political talking points,” he said on ABC’s “This Week.” Democrats also have roundly attacked proposed Trump budget cuts for the CDC and for eliminating in 2018 a senior White House position for a director in charge of global health security. Right-wing commentators, meanwhile, have accused Democrats of “weaponizing” the health crisis, while the president’s son Donald Trump Jr. accused them of hoping the virus “kills millions” to hurt his father. In defending the administration’s response, Pence credited Trump with acting quickly to establish quarantines for Americans brought back from China and Japan. “The coronavirus remains low — and that is largely owing to the decision the president made, the energetic efforts of CDC and local health officials, and we’ll continue to lean in that in a hopeful way,” the vice president said.   Tags: ncov"

Last month, Indonesia criticised a US study that questioned why the Southeast Asian archipelago had not recorded a case of the new coronavirus (AFP Photo/JUNI KRISWANTO / MANILA BULLETIN) A 64-year-old woman and her daughter, 31, tested positive for the virus at a Jakarta hospital, said health minister Terawan Agus Putranto. “This morning I received the test results and they were positive,” he told reporters in the capital. “Both are in good condition…they don’t have serious breathing difficulties.” Officials said that the pair may have been in close contact with a Japanese national who has since tested positive after returning to neighboring Malaysia. Last month, Indonesia criticized a US study that questioned why the Southeast Asian archipelago of more than 260 million, which has strong links to China, had not recorded a case of the virus. The World Health Organization said it was particularly concerned about high-risk nations with weaker health systems, who may lack the facilities to identify cases. The global death toll from the new coronavirus epidemic surpassed 3,000 on Monday after dozens more died at its epicenter in China and cases soared around the world with a second fatality on US soil. The WHO says the virus appears to particularly hit those over the age of 60 and people already weakened by other illness.   Tags: ncov"

Presidential Communications Operations Office (PCOO) Secretary Martin Andanar(ALBERT ALCAIN/PRESIDENTIAL PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN FILE PHOTO) Presidential Communications Secretary Martin Andanar said the government would remain on guard to prevent and contain the spread of the coronavirus in the country. “Let me begin by commending everyone for doing a good job. The World Health Organization recently cited the Philippine as one of the countries that had not reported a new case of coronavirus for more than two weeks now,” he said during a Palace press briefing. “This is no time to celebrate however as there is much work that needs to be done,” he added. According to Andanar, the nation must remain vigilant and sustain measures against the coronavirus amid reports of local transmission of disease in other countries. “Some parts of the globe, local transmission has been prevalent. Thus, we cannot let our guards down and lull ourselves into complacency. We have to remain vigilant, prepared and united in combating his global health emergency,” he said. “We have to be laging handa, always prepared from knowing the alert levels to safety precautions and preventive measures  plus government interventions,” he added. WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus recently announced that the spread of the coronavirus could be contained, citing the Philippines and eight other counties that have not reported a coronavirus case for more than weeks. The countries include Belgium, Cambodia, Finland, Nepal, Russia, Sri Lanka and Sweden. WHO however recently raised the global COVID-19 risk to its highest level as cases continued to surge outside China. The viral outbreak, which started in China, has reportedly infected more than 86,000 globally and left more than 2,900 dead globally. The Philippines earlier recorded three confirmed cases of the coronavirus, including one fatality. As of March 2, a total of 43 patients under investigation are admitted in hospitals while 592 have been discharged for testing negative for the virus. Apart from good public health policy and preparedness, Foreign Affairs Assistant Secretary Eduardo Meñez said the government’s transparency in recording “the latest and most accurate information” to the public contributed to the country’s good performance. “The government also accepts all comments and tries to process reports to discuss and arrive at informed and data-driven policy decisions ensure public health and maintain safety and security of all people in the Philippines and of course Filipinos abroad,” he said in the same press conference. There is no local transmission yet in the country but the government has raised its preparedness efforts to deal with such eventuality. The government’s precautions included strict screening and quarantine procedures, travel restrictions to some coronavirus-hit places, and advocacy for self-protection measures. In case of a local community spread, Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles recently said the government may put a certain place on lockdown to contain the virus outbreak. Several potential quarantine sites in Visayas and Mindanao  have also been identified, he added. According to Health Assistant Secretary Maria Rosario Vergeire, the inter-agency task forces has also readied a contingency plan in the event of local transmission of the new coronavirus. “We will take each issue one at a time. We have a contingency plan. We are making ourselves prepared to eventually of a local transmission. The suspension of classes, avoiding public transport and public gathering will depend on the situation,” she said at the same Palace press conference.#   Tags: ncov"

(REUTERS/David Ryder/MANILA BULLETIN) On Saturday, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said his state would immediately begin using its own test kit developed in-state after asking the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Friday for permission to do so. The FDA said on Saturday it would allow some laboratories to immediately use tests they have developed and validated to achieve more rapid testing capacity for the coronavirus. On Sunday, New York confirmed its first case of coronavirus. FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn said in a statement on Sunday that “upon learning about the test issue from CDC (the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), FDA worked with CDC to determine that problems with certain test components were due to a manufacturing issue. We worked hand in hand with CDC to resolve the issues with manufacturing.” Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Alex Azar told ABC’s “This Week” on Sunday the United States has 75,000 test kits on hand “and over the next week that will expand radically.” He said over 3,600 people in the United States have been tested to date. Hahn added that the “FDA has confidence in the design and current manufacturing of the test that already have and are continuing to be distributed. These tests have passed extensive quality control procedures.” Reuters reported Friday that New York health officials had sought to get their own coronavirus testing kits up and running after getting stuck with faulty tests from the federal government that they said left them unable to diagnose people quickly in the nation’s most populous city. HHS confirmed Sunday it had “launched an investigation and is assembling a team of non-CDC scientists to better understand the nature and source of the manufacturing defect in the first batch of COVID-19 test kits that were distributed to state health departments and others.” Tags: ncov"

South Korean soldiers wearing protective gear spray disinfectant as part of preventive measures against the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus, at Dongdaegu railway station in Daegu on February 29, 2020.(Photo by – / YONHAP / AFP / MANILA BULLETIN) South Korea has seen a surge in the number of infections — adding more than 4,000 cases in less than two weeks — with around 60 percent of the national total linked to the Shincheonji Church of Jesus. As officials try to track down and test more than 266,000 people associated with Shincheonji, the entity has been accused of submitting false lists of its members to authorities. The Seoul City government said it had filed a legal complaint to prosecutors against 12 leaders of the sect — including its founder, Lee Man-hee — accusing them of homicide, causing harm and violating the Infectious Disease and Control Act. “They did not take any action to encourage its members to actively cooperate with the health authorities to prevent further spread of the COVID-19,” the city authorities said in a statement. Seoul mayor Park Won-soon added on his Facebook page: “If they had actively taken early measures, we could have prevented the explosive rise of COVID-19 cases in Daegu and North Gyeongbuk province and the deaths of several people.” Under South Korean law prosecutors can make their own decision on whether to act on complaints filed to them, and Yonhap news agency reported that the Seoul City request had been assigned for investigation. Shincheonji declined to comment, saying: “The most important thing for us now is disinfecting and our highest priority is to end the COVID-19 outbreak soon.” The outbreak among Shincheonji members began with a 61-year-old woman, who developed a fever on February 10 but attended at least four church services in Daegu — the country’s fourth-largest city and epicenter of its outbreak — before being diagnosed. The organization has apologized on behalf of its members who have not answered survey calls but has insisted that it has been fully cooperating with the government to contain the virus. Shincheonji, founded in 1984, proclaims Lee has donned the mantle of Jesus Christ and will take 144,000 people with him to heaven on the day of judgement. But with more church members than available places in heaven, they are said to have to compete for slots and pursue converts. Tags: ncov"

(REUTERS/Kim Hong-Ji/MANILA BULLETIN) The new cases followed the country’s biggest daily jump on Saturday of 813 confirmed infections. There were 586 more on Sunday, broadening the largest virus outbreak outside China. [nL4N2AU01A] The death toll rose to 22, up from 20, according to the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC). Of the new cases, 377 were from the southeastern city of Daegu, home to a branch of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, to which most of South Korea’s cases have been traced. Sixty-eight were from the nearby province of North Gyeongsang, KCDC said. The agency said some members of the church in January visited the central Chinese city of Wuhan, where the disease emerged late last year, though it was investigating to determine whether that played a role in the outbreak. “We will take all necessary measures we can if there are signs that the church did not cooperate with us intentionally or for other reasons,” Vice Health Minister Kim Gang-lip told a briefing. “But until then, it is substantially helpful to draw the church’s voluntary cooperation using the information they’ve provided.” Seoul has asked prosecutors to consider a murder investigation into the church’s founder and chairman, Lee Man-hee, saying the church was liable for its refusal to cooperate with efforts to stop the disease. The church issued a statement late on Sunday reiterating calls for an end to “stigmatisation, hatred and slander” against its followers, saying it was cooperating with the government. The secretive church faces unprecedented scrutiny from authorities and the public, with all of its 310,000 known followers and “trainees” are being tested for the virus.

He did not say where the woman lived. “The patient has respiratory symptoms, but is not in serious condition and has been in a controlled situation since arriving in New York,” Cuomo said. At the federal level, President Donald Trump’s administration scrambled on Sunday to reassure Americans as the disease spreads and businesses cancel conferences and flights. Administration officials tried to calm market fears that the coronavirus could cause a global recession, saying the public had overreacted and that stocks would bounce back because of the underlying strength of the U.S. economy. The first American died from coronavirus, a man in his 50s with underlying conditions in Washington state, officials said on Saturday. They still do not know how he contracted the disease. The state on Sunday confirmed two other cases and locked down a long-term care facility where a resident and a worker also tested positive for coronavirus and 50 residents and staff are showing symptoms. Over 70 cases have been reported in the United States, with most on the West Coast but new cases in the Chicago area and Rhode Island, aside from New York. Stock markets plunged last week, with an index of global stocks setting its largest weekly fall since the 2008 financial crisis, and more than $5 trillion wiped off the value of stocks worldwide.

Delta Air Lines Inc said on Sunday it was suspending until May flights to Milan in northern Italy where most of that country’s coronavirus cases have been reported. Flights will continue to Rome. American Airlines Group Inc announced a similar move late on Saturday. The United States has 75,000 test kits for coronavirus and will expand that number “radically” in coming weeks, U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar told ABC’s “This Week” on Sunday. Vice President Mike Pence said the government had contracted 3M Co to produce an extra 35 million respiratory masks a month. He urged Americans not to buy the masks, which he said were only needed by healthcare workers. Honeywell International Inc is the other major U.S. mask producer. He also told Fox News that clinical trials of a coronavirus vaccine would start in six weeks but that a vaccine would likely not be available this season. Democrats, who will challenge Trump for the presidency in the Nov. 3 election, have criticized his administration for downplaying the crisis and not preparing for the disease to spread in the United States.
Pence, whom Trump appointed last week to run the White House’s coronavirus response, said Americans should brace for more cases but that the “vast majority” of those who contracted the disease would recover. “Other than in areas where there are individuals that have been infected with the coronavirus, people need to understand that for the average American, the risk does remain low. We’re ready,” Pence told NBC’s “Meet the Press.” The United States has imposed limits on travelers who have visited Iran and recommended against travel to hard-hit areas of Italy and South Korea. Trump said on Saturday that the United States was also considering shutting the country’s southern border with Mexico to control the spread of the virus, adding: “We hope we won’t have to do that.” Mexico has reported four coronavirus cases.

Worldwide, nearly 3,000 people have been killed and more than 88,000 infected across some 60 countries since the virus was first detected late last year in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. But WHO noted that the virus appears to particularly hit those over the age of 60 and people already weakened by other illness. Among the nearly 45,000 people who tested positive for COVID-19 in China by February 24, only 2.1 percent were under the age of 20, WHO said. The agency noted that most people with the illness only experience mild symptoms, while around 14 percent suffer severe disease like pneumonia and five percent become critically ill. The mortality rate in the outbreak appears to be between two and five percent. The UN health agency stressed the importance of early recognition, followed by “implementation of appropriate infection prevention and control (IPC) measures; provision of symptomatic care for those with mild illness; and optimized supportive care for those with severe disease.” WHO warned that mortality among those suffering with critical illness had been reported at over 50 percent, emphasizing that rapid “critical care interventions such as lung protective ventilation should be optimized.” PH, 8 others cited WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, however, said recently that the spread of the coronavirus could be contained, citing the Philippines and eight other counties that have not reported a coronavirus case for more than weeks.

READ MORE: Mainland China reports 573 new COVID-19 cases, death toll at 2,870 Leaders in Europe, the Middle East, and the Americas rolled out bans on big gatherings, and stricter travel restrictions as cases of the new coronavirus spread around the world. Ecuador on Saturday reported its first case, in a woman who had traveled from Madrid, while Mexico reported four cases, all in people who had visited Italy. Brazilian officials confirmed that country’s second case, a patient in São Paulo who recently visited Italy. Luxembourg on Saturday announced its first case of infection by the new coronavirus: a man who recently returned from Italy, Health Minister Paulette Lenert told reporters. The man in his 40s returned to Luxembourg “at the beginning of the week” and, after “more recently” exhibiting COVID-19 symptoms, had a test that confirmed the disease, she said. A second test is being carried out in the Netherlands and the results should be known on Sunday, she added. The patient was isolated in a Luxembourg hospital and his family members were in quarantine, the minister said, adding that the procedures had “gone as planned” for this scenario. As governments worldwide stepped up efforts to halt the spread of the virus, France announced a temporary ban on public gatherings with more than 5,000 people in confined spaces. Switzerland said it is banning events expected to draw more than 1,000 people. Traditional Chinese medicine yields good results Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been widely used to treat COVID-19 patients, yielding good outcomes, said a medical expert Saturday. With TCM treatment, patients with mild symptoms have seen their fever or cough alleviated, Wang Rongbing, director physician with Beijing Ditan Hospital, said at a press conference. For severely ill patients, TCM helped relieve symptoms and restore blood oxygen saturation, preventing the patients’ conditions from developing into critically ill cases, Wang said. She also noted the effectiveness of Qingfei Paidu Soup, an herbal concoction that mixes ephedra and licorice root among other ingredients, in the treatment of COVID-19 patients with symptoms ranging from mild to critical. Qingfei Paidu Soup has been used in 66 designated hospitals in 10 provincial-level regions, Wang said, adding that of the 1,183 patients under medical observation, 640 have been discharged from hospital and 457 have seen their symptoms eased. Churches close Churches were closed in South Korea on Sunday with many holding online services instead, as authorities fought to rein in public gatherings, with 376 new coronavirus infections taking the tally to 3,526 cases. That came a day after the biggest daily jump of 813 cases in South Korea’s battle with the largest virus outbreak outside China, said the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC), which will update numbers later in the day. The death toll of 17 was unchanged from Saturday, it added. In Seoul, the capital, about a dozen worshippers were turned away from the Yoido Full Gospel Church, which put a sermon for its 560,000 followers on YouTube, filmed with a small choir instead of all 200 members and 60-strong orchestra. Health authorities have urged South Koreans to refrain from attending religious services and political events and stay indoors this weekend, warning of a “critical moment” in the battle on the virus. For the first time in its 236-year history, South Korea’s Catholic church decided to halt masses at more than 1,700 locations nationwide. Buddhist temples have also called off events, while major Christian churches held online services. READ MORE: South Korea wages ‘all-out responses’ to virus with 586 new cases No cheek-to-cheek, no kissing One of France’s dearest touchy-feely customs is running up against the coronavirus. Health Minister Olivier Veran urged his compatriots to avoid greeting each other with a cheek-to-cheek embrace and a kiss or several — known as “la bise” in French — to avoid spreading the infection. He also renewed his official advice for people not to shake hands when they meet. “The reduction in social contacts of a physical nature is advised,” Veran said at a news briefing on Saturday. “That includes the practice of the bise.” The French government also canceled the Paris half-marathon on Sunday and banned indoor gatherings of more than 5,000 people. Cases in France jumped to 100 on Saturday, almost double of the day before. They include a cluster of 36 cases linked to a patient who died in the Oise region north of Paris, including 10 military and civilian personnel at the Creil air force base. Other clusters include a group of 11 related to an organized trip to Egypt, Director General for Health Jerome Salomon told reporters. Schools stay closed Schools and universities will stay closed for a second consecutive week in three northern Italian regions in an effort to contain Europe’s worst outbreak of coronavirus, dashing any hopes of a swift return to normality. The decision was taken as the death toll from the contagion rose by eight during the day to 29, while the total number of cases jumped by 240 to 1,128 — the vast majority in the wealthy regions of Lombardy, Veneto and Emilia Romagna. Besides a growing human cost, the government is also worried by the likely impact on Italy’s fragile economy, with the respected REF Ricerche think-tank warning that the crisis could cut national output by 1%-3% in the first half of 2020. Deputy Economy Minister Antonio Misiani said on Saturday the government was working on a slew of measures to “boost growth at national level” and would ask parliament next week to let it push up the 2020 budget deficit to help pay for the move. “The decree will mobilize very substantial resources,” he said, without giving precise details. Looking to halt the spread of the highly infectious disease, the government last week banned public gatherings across much of northern Italy and shuttered educational centers. Tags: ncov"

Around 130 people — including the captain and 98 health ministry officials who were working aboard — tested negative for the virus as they left the vessel, he said. They will spend 14 days at government-designated dormitories before being allowed to leave Japan, while the vessel will be disinfected before sailing again. At least six people who were hospitalized after being taken off the ship have died, including a British male passenger, the health ministry said. On Sunday a 78-year-old man evacuated from the vessel died at a Perth hospital, becoming Australia’s first fatality from the disease. Japan quarantined the cruise ship after an 80-year-old passenger who disembarked on January 25 in Hong Kong tested positive for the deadly virus. The quarantine has been heavily criticized after more than 700 people on board tested positive for the virus. The ship carried about 3,700 passengers and crew members when it reached the port of Yokohama. Kato said the government “will have to review the whole process”, but for now authorities were focusing on efforts to contain the spread of the virus.
