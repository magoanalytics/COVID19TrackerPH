(Photo by Noel Celis/AFP) PARIS, France – A mysterious SARS-like virus has spread around China with more than 200 diagnosed cases in the cities of Wuhan, Beijing and Shenzhen, plus two people infected in Thailand and another case confirmed in Japan. Here are a few key points about coronavirus. What is coronavirus? The UN's health agency says that the outbreak of the disease in Wuhan is a never-before-seen strain belonging to a broad family of viruses ranging from the common cold to more serious illnesses such as SARS. According to Arnaud Fontanet, head of the department of epidemiology at Institut Pasteur in Paris, the new strain is the seventh known type of coronavirus that humans can contract. ""We think that the source may have been animals sold at market and from there it passed to the human population,"" he told AFP. The World Health Organization (WHO) says an ""animal source seems the most likely primary source... with some limited human-to-human transmission occurring between close contacts."" The outbreak has caused alarm because of the link with SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), which killed 349 people in mainland China and another 299 in Hong Kong in 2002-2003. Fontanet said the current virus strain was 80 percent genetically identical to SARS. A total of 201 people have now been diagnosed with the virus in China, and the outbreak has already claimed 3 lives. Time to panic? Fontanet said that the coronavirus appears to be ""weaker"" than SARS in its current form, but cautioned that it could mutate into a more virulent strain. ""We don't have evidence that says this virus is going to mutate, but that's what happened with SARS,"" he said. ""The virus has only been circulating a short time, so it's too early to say."" As for person-to-person transmission – a key hallmark of pandemics – it may also be too early to tell for sure. But Wuhan authorities said over the weekend that some of the new cases had ""no history of contact"" with the seafood market believed to be the center of the outbreak. Authorities have pronounced the risk of human transmission ""weak"" but not impossible. Fontanet said the fact that the virus had spread beyond China, to Japan and Thailand, was ""starting to make us fear that interhuman transmission is possible."" Scientists with the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis at Imperial College in London warned in a paper last week that the number of cases in Wuhan was likely to be close to 1,700, much higher than the number officially identified. WHO has advised that individuals should protect themselves against the virus by thoroughly washing their hands, covering their noses when they sneeze, thoroughly cooking meat and eggs, and avoiding close contact with wild or farm animals. The best way of containing any disease outbreak is to rapidly confirm the source, according to Raina MacIntyre, from the University of New South Wales in Sydney. ""Tests are being done on animals in the Wuhan region and they should provide some insight,"" she said. Experts said authorities must be vigilant and monitor travellers coming to and from Wuhan for signs of breathing problems. Lessons learned? Fontanet said health workers in China had responded admirably by rapidly carrying out testing among patients and linking the cases to the market in question. ""We've learned some lessons from SARS. We're better armed and more reactive,"" he said. Adam Kamradt-Scott, an expert in the spread and control of infectious diseases at the University of Sydney, said China had ""has been quick to share the genome sequencing of this novel coronavirus"". ""This has enabled the identification of this new case in Japan,"" he said. Fontanet said that such transparency was different to the start of the SARS epidemic, when China ""hid the story for two or 3 months"" at the start of the outbreak. – Rappler.com "

""As she was detected at the quarantine stage there has been no exposure for locals,"" she added. The outbreak has caused alarm because the new virus is from the same family as the pathogen that causes SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), which killed 349 people in mainland China and 299 in Hong Kong in 2002 and 2003. No cases of human-to-human transmission have been confirmed so far, but authorities have previously said the possibility ""cannot be excluded"". Authorities in Wuhan said a seafood market was the centre of the outbreak. It was closed on January 1.

Photo by AFP BEIJING, China – A mysterious SARS-like virus has killed a third person, spread around China and reached a third Asian country, authorities said Monday, January 20, fuelling fears of a major outbreak as millions begin travelling for the Lunar New Year in humanity's biggest migration. The new coronavirus strain, first discovered in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, has caused alarm because of its connection to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which killed nearly 650 people across mainland China and Hong Kong in 2002-2003. Wuhan has 11 million inhabitants and serves as a major transport hub, including during the annual Lunar New Year holiday which begins later this week and sees hundreds of millions of Chinese people travel across the country to visit family. A third person was confirmed to have died and 136 new cases were found over the weekend in Wuhan, the local health commission said, taking the total number of people to have been diagnosed with the virus in China to 201. South Korea on Monday reported its first case – a 35-year-old woman who flew in from Wuhan. Thailand and Japan have previously confirmed a total of 3 cases – all of whom had visited the Chinese city. No human-to-human transmission has been confirmed so far, but authorities have previously said the possibility ""cannot be excluded"". Health authorities in Beijing's Daxing district said two people who had travelled to Wuhan were treated for pneumonia linked to the virus and are in stable condition. In southern Guangdong province, a 66-year-old Shenzhen man was quarantined on January 11 after contracting a fever and showing other symptoms following a trip to visit relatives in Wuhan, the provincial health commission said. He is also in stable condition. Shenzhen officials said another eight people were under medical observation. ""Experts believe that the current epidemic situation is still preventable and controllable,"" the Guangdong health commission said. Five other people have been put in isolation and tested in eastern Zhejiang province. At Beijing's crowded central railway station, some travellers wore masks as a precaution but were not too concerned about the virus. ""Watching the news, I do feel a little worried. But I haven't taken precautionary measures beyond wearing regular masks,"" said Li Yang, a 28-year-old account manager who was heading home to the northern region of Inner Mongolia for the Lunar New Year. A 26-year-old woman surnamed Guo, who was heading to northeast Liaoning province, said she and her friends generally avoided crowded areas and have been reminding each other to wear masks. Detection measures A seafood market is believed to be the centre of the outbreak in Wuhan, but health officials have reported that some patients had no history of contact with the facility. The World Health Organization (WHO) said on Twitter Monday that ""an animal source seems the most likely primary source"" with ""some limited human-to-human transmission occurring between close contacts"". It said the new cases in China were the result of ""increased searching and testing for (the virus) among people sick with respiratory illness"". Scientists with the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis at Imperial College in London warned in a paper published Friday that the number of cases in the city was likely to be closer to 1,700, much higher than the number officially identified. Wuhan authorities said they have installed infrared thermometers at airports, railway stations and coach stations across the city. Passengers with fevers were being registered, given masks and taken to medical institutions. State TV footage aired Monday showed medical staff working inside an isolation ward at a Wuhan hospital in full-body suits. Authorities in Hong Kong have also stepped up virus detection measures at border crossings, including rigorous temperature checks for inbound travellers from the Chinese mainland. Passengers are also being screened at some airports in Thailand and the United States. In Wuhan, 170 people are still being treated at hospital, including nine in critical condition, the city health commission said, adding that 25 people have been discharged so far. Chinese state media moved to calm the mood as discussion about the coronavirus spreading to other Chinese cities swelled on social media. Nationalist tabloid Global Times called for better handling of the new virus than that of the 2003 SARS outbreak. – Rappler.com "

File photo by Noel Celis/AFP BEIJING, China (3rd UPDATE) – A World Health Organization emergency panel will meet this week to discuss a SARS-like virus that has spread beyond China and that a Beijing government expert said Monday, January 20 is contagious between humans. The new coronavirus strain, first discovered in the central city of Wuhan, has caused alarm because of its connection to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which killed nearly 650 people across mainland China and Hong Kong in 2002-2003. The total number of people diagnosed with the new virus has risen to 218. Beijing and Shanghai confirmed their first cases on Monday while more than a dozen others emerged in southern Guangdong province, and 136 new ones were found over the weekend in Wuhan, according to state broadcaster CCTV. An 89-year-old man has become the fourth person to die from the virus in China, authorities said Tuesday. Scientists have scrambled to determine the mode of transmission, with a seafood market in Wuhan believed to be the center of the outbreak. But Zhong Nanshan, a renowned scientist at the National Health Commission who helped expose the scale of the SARS outbreak, said patients could contract the new virus without having visited the city. ""Currently, it can be said it is affirmative that there is the phenomenon of human-to-human transmission,"" he said in an interview with CCTV. In Guangdong, two patients were infected by family members who visited Wuhan, Zhong explained. Fourteen medical personnel helping with coronavirus patients have also been infected, he said. Zhong predicted an increase of viral pneumonia cases during the Lunar New Year holiday – the world's biggest annual travel rush – but expressed confidence in curbing the spread of the virus, China's official Xinhua news agency reported on Tuesday. The World Health Organization panel will meet in Geneva on Wednesday to determine whether to declare the outbreak ""a public health emergency of international concern"" – a rare designation only used for the gravest epidemics. WHO said earlier that an animal source seemed to be ""the most likely primary source,"" with ""some limited human-to-human transmission occurring between close contacts."" Wuhan has 11 million inhabitants and serves as a major transport hub, including during the annual Lunar New Year holiday, which begins later this week and sees hundreds of millions of Chinese people travel across the country to visit family. Over the next week, 2,131 flights will depart Wuhan for other Chinese cities, according to the flightradar24 website. Another 205 are headed for overseas destinations, the most frequent of which is Thailand, which will receive 54 flights in the January 20-27 period, the website said. Weighing in on the matter for the first time, President Xi Jinping said Monday that safeguarding people's lives should be given ""top priority"" and that the spread of the epidemic ""should be resolutely contained,"" according to CCTV. Xi said it was necessary to ""release information on the epidemic in a timely manner and deepen international cooperation,"" and ensure people have a ""stable and peaceful Spring Festival,"" the broadcaster said. Five cases were reported in Beijing, while in Shanghai, a 56-year-old woman who had come from Wuhan was hospitalised and in stable condition, local health authorities said. South Korea on Monday also reported its first case – a 35-year-old woman who flew in from Wuhan. Thailand and Japan have previously confirmed a total of three cases -- all of whom had visited the Chinese city. The virus did not slow down the annual holiday travel rush, though some travellers wore masks at crowded railway stations in Beijing and Shanghai. ""Watching the news, I do feel a little worried.

Nations across the Asia-Pacific region stepped up checks of passengers at airports to detect the SARS-like coronavirus, which first emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. Fears of a bigger outbreak rose after a prominent expert from China's National Health Commission confirmed late Monday that the virus can be passed between people. (READ: WHO to hold emergency meeting as SARS-like virus spreads in Asia) Authorities previously said there was no obvious evidence of person-to-person transmission and animals were suspected to be the source, as a seafood market where live animals were sold in Wuhan was identified as the centre of the outbreak. But the World Health Organization (WHO), which was concluding a fact-finding mission in Wuhan, was still being cautious, saying at a briefing in Geneva that ""not enough is known to draw definitive conclusions about how it is transmitted"". Spokesman Tarik Jasarevic warned though that ""more cases should be expected"" both in China and in other countries. Hundreds of millions of people are criss-crossing China this week in packed buses, trains and planes to celebrate the Lunar New Year with relatives. Almost 80 new cases have been confirmed, bringing the total number of people hit by the virus in China to 291, with the vast majority in Hubei, the province where Wuhan lies, according to the National Health Commission (NHC). Other cases have also been confirmed in Beijing and Shanghai plus Guangdong, Zhejiang and Henan provinces. Meanwhile Wang Guangfa, one of the doctors on the NHC team investigating the epidemic, told Hong Kong TV station iCable News that he was receiving treatment after becoming infected. The first case on the self-ruled island of Taiwan was also confirmed Tuesday, with a woman taken to a hospital on arrival at the airport from Wuhan. Wuhan mayor Zhou Xianwang told state broadcaster CCTV Tuesday that the death toll had risen from 4 to 6. China said it would attend a special WHO meeting Wednesday which will determine whether to declare a rare global public health emergency over the disease, which was also detected in Thailand, Japan and South Korea among four people who had visited Wuhan. The coronavirus has caused alarm because of its genetic similarities to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which killed nearly 650 people across mainland China and Hong Kong in 2002-2003. Fever checks At four airports in Thailand, authorities introduced mandatory thermal scans of passengers arriving from high-risk areas of China. Anyone exhibiting signs of fever will be quarantined for 24 hours for monitoring. Around 1,300 passengers are expected each day in Thailand from Wuhan over Chinese New Year, which starts on Friday. In Hong Kong, where memories of SARS still haunt the city, authorities said they were on ""extreme high alert"", with passengers from Wuhan required to fill out health declarations and face possible jail time if they do not declare symptoms. Enhanced screening measures have also been set up at airports in Australia, Bangladesh, Nepal, Singapore and the United States. A man showing symptoms of the disease who had travelled to Wuhan has been put in isolation in Australia as health officials await test results, authorities said Tuesday. In China, the government announced it was classifying the outbreak in the same category as SARS, meaning compulsory isolation for those diagnosed with the disease and the potential to implement quarantine measures on travel. In Wuhan, authorities banned tour groups and police were conducting spot checks for live poultry or wild animals in vehicles leaving and entering the city, state media said. Passengers were being screened for fever at the airport, railway stations and bus terminals. Those with fevers would be registered, handed masks and advised to see a doctor. Chinese train and plane authorities said travellers with tickets to Wuhan could get refunds. WHO meeting Zhong Nanshan, a renowned scientist at the National Health Commission, raised the alarm when he said on Monday that patients can contract the virus without having visited Wuhan, though he added that it was milder than SARS. Doctors at the University of Hong Kong released a study on Tuesday estimating that there have been 1,343 cases of the new virus in Wuhan. Scientists at Imperial College in London said last week the number was likely closer to 1,700. The WHO has only called a global public health emergency a handful of times, including during the H1N1 -- or swine flu -- pandemic of 2009 and the Ebola epidemic that devastated parts of West Africa from 2014 to 2016. China was accused of covering up the SARS outbreak in 2003 but some foreign experts have praised the swift release of information on this new virus. – Rappler.com "

Photo by KD Madrilejos/Rappler MANILA, Philippines (3rd UPDATE) – The Department of Health (DOH) announced on Tuesday, January 21, that it is investigating a suspected case of novel coronavirus in Cebu City. Health Secretary Francisco Duque III announced in a news briefing on Tuesday that the case involved a 5-year-old Chinese boy who arrived in Cebu City from Wuhan, China, the epicenter of cases of the SARS-like virus. The child had fever, throat irritation, and cough prior to entering the Philippines, he said. ""The samples from the child tested negative for MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. The sample, though, had been sent to the Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory in Australia to identify what kind of coronavirus it is,"" he added. Health officials expected the test results to come out on Thursday, January 23. Duque said the patient ""is still experiencing cough but is currently stable and afebrile"" or no longer feverish. The DOH referred to the case as ""non-specific pancoronavirus,"" which means it could be the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) or any of the 4 other existing coronaviruses that can infect humans. There are coronaviruses that can cause very mild symptoms, Duque said. “Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses ranging from the common cold to more serious infections such as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. Common signs of coronavirus infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath, and breathing difficulties,” he added. Duque held the news briefing  a day after it was reported that the provincial health office of Aklan quarantined 3 Chinese travelers who were detected as having fever upon their arrival at the Kalibo International Airport. The Aklan provincial health office said on Monday, January 20, that throat swabs and blood samples were taken from the 3 who all came on different flights on January 17, 18, and 20.  They were later allowed to proceed to Boracay, their destination, after their fever and breathing difficulty subsided. The Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) said test results on the samples from the 3 persons in Aklan were expected “within 24 to 48 hours.” Referring tothe Chinese travelers, Duque said, ""The signs and symptoms manifested by the 3 Chinese nationals did not fit the case definition as prescribed by the WHO interim guidelines on the new coronavirus."" He said the 3 ""had no history of travel to Wuhan, and without any known contact with a confirmed 2019 novel coronavirus case, Severe Acute Respiratory illness case, or sick animals."" The SARS-like viral disease caused by what the World Health Organization (WHO) and the medical community are calling the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), was initially reported in the Chinese city of Wuhan. Chinese health officials said it could be transmitted between humans. Cases have since been reported in the cities of Beijing and Shanghai and the province of Guangdong. South Korea, Japan, and Thailand have also reported cases of the disease, which was found in people who visited Wuhan. So far, a total of 218 people have been diagnosed with the virus. This novel strain is the 7th known type of coronavirus that humans can contract. The 2019 nCoV, according to WHO, is “a never-before-seen strain belonging to a broad family of viruses ranging from the common cold to more serious illnesses such as SARS.” (READ: What is coronavirus? New disease spreading in Asia revives SARS fears) SARS or severe acute respiratory syndrome is a potentially deadly illness that spread in 2003 and killed over 800 in China and Hong Kong. It started in China and quickly spread in Asia, even reaching Europe and North America. It was transmitted through coughing and sneezing. In the Philippines, SARS claimed two deaths in 2003 – a Filipino nursing assistant visiting from Canada and her father, whom she had infected. SARS may start out like flu. Initial symptoms of the disease are: fever over 38 °C, chills, muscle aches and soreness. After 2 to 7 days, infected people develop dry cough, which affects oxygen intake. SARS can then lead to pneumonia, heart failure, and liver failure, especially if infected people have existing illnesses like diabetes and hepatitis. Health Secretary Francisco Duque III earlier in January ordered the health department’s Bureau of Quarantine (BOQ) to strengthen its surveillance of incoming travelers from China after initial reports of the disease in Wuhan. Duque said the BOQ will be on high alert, especially with travelers manifesting fever or signs of respiratory infection. He also urged the public, especially those who have recently traveled from China, to seek immediate medical consult if they have been experiencing flu-like symptoms. The BOQ will with airlines on Wednesday, January 22, to remind them of measures to observe in light of the virus. The BOQ said it would ensure that airlines have universal protective kits on board and remind them of protocols in handling cases on board and reporting cases to authorities. – Rappler.com "

There are just 3 direct flights each week between Wuhan and Australia, all landing in Sydney.   Australia's chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, said the screening program may also be expanded to other flights from China carrying a high proportion of passengers from Wuhan, but doing so provided no guarantees of stopping its spread into the country. ""Many people who have this may present as asymptomatic. So it's about identifying those with a high risk and making sure those who have a high risk know about it and know how to get medical attention,"" he told reporters in Canberra.

Medical staff members carry a patient into the Jinyintan hospital, where patients infected by a mysterious SARS-like virus are being treated, in Wuhan in China's central Hubei province on January 18, 2020. Photo by AFP MANILA, Philippines (2nd UPDATE) – The Department of Health (DOH) on Thursday, January 30, confirmed the first case of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in the Philippines.  The country's first 2019-nCoV patient is among the 29 people being monitored by the DOH. The World Health Organization (WHO) said the mode of transmission for the virus is still being determined, though a Beijing government expert said it could be contagious between humans. Here’s what we know so far: When did it start? The first cases of nCoV were revealed by Chinese state media on December 31, after 44 people from the Chinese city of Wuhan were confirmed to be infected. Initial reports referred to the disease as “mystery viral pneumonia,” as infected people exhibited flu-like symptoms like persistent coughing, fever, shortness of breath, and difficulty in breathing. Where did it come from? The infections started in the Chinese city of Wuhan, a city of 11 million. It is the capital of China’s Hubei province and also serves as a major transport hub in the country. Officials in Wuhan have put in place strict screening measures of people traveling out of the city, with medics even taking passengers’ temperatures before planes are allowed to fly out. The city is also currently on lockdown, effectively trapping its citizens. So far, cases have been confirmed in all regions of China. The virus has also reached South Korea, Japan, Thailand, Cambodia, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Nepal, Singapore, Sri Lanka, India, Taiwan, Vietnam, the Philippines, Australia, the US, Canada, Finland, France, Germany, and the United Arab Emirates, with most cases confirmed in people with history of travel to Wuhan. Health officials in China have said that the virus probably originated in animals and was transmitted to humans by contact with animals at a live market, but such suspicion has yet to be confirmed. Chinese officials in China have also said that the virus can spread from person to person, and the WHO said there is sufficient evidence to say so. How is it related to SARS and MERS? The pneumonia-like disease caused by the 2019-nCoV is similar to SARS and MERS in that nCoV, like MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, is also a coronavirus. Coronaviruses are a large group of viruses that can cause a range of diseases in humans and animals – diseases as simple as the common cold to diseases like MERS and SARS. (READ: What is coronavirus? New disease spreading in Asia revives SARS fears) MERS is a viral respiratory disease that was first identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012. By the end of 2015, 483 deaths and a total of 1,180 cases were reported in the Middle East. MERS symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Pneumonia may also be present, but not always. Though it remains unknown where exactly the virus came from, health officials have said that the virus might have come from camels, which is common in the Horn of Africa and the Middle East. SARS is another viral respiratory disease which originated in Guangdong province, southern China in 2003. A SARS epidemic spread to 26 countries in 2003, resulting in a total of 8,000 cases and over 800 deaths in China and Hong Kong. Transmitted by human-to-human contact, it is characterized by the following flu-like symptoms: fever, headache, diarrhea, shivering, dry cough, and shortness of breath. The virus is believed to have come from bats and spread to other animals. Unlike MERS that was found to infect mostly older men with chronic conditions, SARS was found to infect both health and unhealthy individuals. It is not yet known whether the 2019 disease infecting over 7,000 in China is caused by a more severe kind of coronavirus like MERS and SARS, but the WHO has emphasized that many of those who have died due to the new virus had pre-existing illnesses. Like MERS and SARS, though, the disease emerging from the 2019-nCoV cannot be treated through vaccination. Control of the disease is done through close monitoring, symptom management, and rest. How severe is it? WHO has declared the current 2019-nCoV situation in China a public health emergency of international concern. ""Our greatest concern is the potential for the virus to spread to countries with weaker health systems,"" WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said after the WHO emergency council meeting on January 30. Tedros also said there was no reason for any of the international travel or trade restrictions with current evidence. WHO’s country representative to the Philippines, Rabindra Abeyasinghe, said in a January 21 press briefing that “it is too early to say this is a severe disease.” There are two crucial indicators that health authorities look at to assess the severity of a potential pandemic: how infectious it is and how deadly. Infectiousness is measured by what is called R0 (R-naught). Scientific knowledge about 2019-nCoV is still expanding, but for now scientists have pegged the virus's R0 at 1.4 to 2.5. This means an infected person can potentially spread it to 1 to 2 others. This would mean that 2019-nCoV is less contagious that SARS, whose R0 is 3. Measles turns out to be more contagious, with an R0 of 11-18. But it is more contagious that the seasonal flu, whose R0 is 1.8. Another indicator is how deadly it is, which is measured through the case fatality rate (CFR). With 212 deaths and a total of 8,236 cases as of January 31, 2019-nCoV has a CFR of about 2.6%. This is lower than SARS, whose CFR was 10%, and MERS, whose CFR was about 35%. But this figure is not unshakeable, as figures continue to rise. “We still need to understand better the mode of transmission and what needs to be done specifically for management,” WHO's Abeyasinghe added. WHO recommends the use of tried and tested guidelines used for MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. DOH and WHO are reminding people to practice proper hygiene, as transmission may be from contacts with animals or other humans. They have also advised the public to practice frequent handwashing and avoid unprotected contact with farm or wild animals. Proper cough etiquette is to be observed as well: maintaining distance and covering your nose and mouth with tissue, a towel, or the crook of your elbow. DOH and WHO are also calling on people to ensure that food is well-cooked while the potential source of the virus is still being identified. What is the government doing? The health department’s Bureau of Quarantine (BOQ) is on high alert, especially with travelers from Wuhan and China manifesting fever or signs of respiratory infection. The BOQ has met with airlines to remind them of measures to observe in light of the scare. They will ensure that airlines have universal protective kits on board and remind them of protocols in handling cases on board and reporting cases to authorities on the ground. DOH also said that health workers are also expected to be more vigilant when in contact with patients with acute respiratory infection, especially those with travel history to China. Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said the Philippines’ “detection capability is still evolving.” The Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM), DOH’s main research arm for prevention and control of infectious and tropical diseases, now has the test kit necessary to determine whether a sample is positive for the 2019-nCoV. Duque has also led a meeting of the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases, which has discouraged non-essential travel to China. The Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) will also begin repatriating Filipinos in Wuhan and Hubei province by the first week of February. Duque had earlier said that travel restrictions may not be necessary, as WHO does not recommend them, but later said he would propose a travel ban on all people coming from Wuhan and Hubei province to the President. Lawmakers and citizens have called on the government to impose a temporary travel ban on all of China. – Rappler.com Sources: World Health Organization, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Department of Health "

Virus source A prominent expert from China's National Health Commission confirmed this week that the virus can be passed between people. However, animals are suspected to be the primary source of the outbreak. A Wuhan market is believed to be the epicenter of the outbreak. A price list circulating online in China for a business there lists a menagerie of animals or animal-based products including live foxes, crocodiles, wolf puppies and rats. It also offered civets, the animal linked to SARS.

The Department of Health (DOH) on Tuesday, January 21, announced that it was investigating a case of “non-specific pancoronavirus” found in a 5-year-old child who traveled from Wuhan, China – the center of the outbreak – to Cebu City. This means that the child could be afflicted with the 2019 nCoV or any of the 4 other existing coronaviruses that can infect humans.

Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, January 22, Duque said there are “still many blindspots on the novel coronavirus” and that the DOH is in constant communication with the World Health Organization (WHO) for definitive updates regarding the virus. Duque said being infected with a coronavirus is not “an automatic death sentence” as there are coronaviruses that cause the common cold. He added that the 5-year-old child in Cebu City is recovering, still with coughs but no longer feverish. But he added that the DOH is waiting for test results from the Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory in Australia before it can rule out that the coronavirus found in the child is 2019 nCoV. They expect results to come out Thursday, January 23. The Chinese government on Wednesday warned that the disease may spread as the death toll hit 9 and the number of cases reached 440 across China. Cases have also been reported in Thailand, Japan, South Korea, and the United States. Chinese officials have also said that the virus may be spread through human-to-human contact, though the WHO has yet to make a similar pronouncement. “Generally, coronaviruses spread via aerial droplets…through sneezing and coughing. That’s why personal hygiene, cough etiquette are very important, they will certainly reduce the chances of transmission,” Duque said. He also said illnesses caused by coronaviruses are “self-limiting” and that recovery may be quick given effective supportive treatment. The key is to strengthen the immune system, Duque said. The WHO will convene an emergency committee on Wednesday to discuss the novel virus to determine whether the recent outbreak is a public health emergency of international concern.

The theories are based on examination of the genome sequence of the virus released by authorities in the wake of the outbreak, with two studies pointing to the likely role of bats in the outbreak. One study, published Tuesday, January 21 in the journal Science China Life Sciences, which is sponsored by Beijing's Chinese Academy of Sciences, looked at the relations between the new strain and other viruses. It found the coronavirus that emerged from China's Wuhan was closely related to a strain that exists in bats. ""Bats being the native host of the Wuhan CoV (coronavirus) would be the logical and convenient reasoning, though it remains likely there was intermediate host(s) in the transmission cascade from bats to humans,"" the researchers from several institutions in China wrote in the paper.

But they could offer clues to Chinese authorities as they hunt for the source of the outbreak that has sickened hundreds of people in the country and has been confirmed as far afield as the United States.

Gao Fu, director of the Chinese centre for disease control and prevention, said in Beijing on Wednesday that authorities believe the virus likely came from ""wild animals at the seafood market"" though the exact source remains undetermined. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS, was linked to Chinese consumption of civet meat. Many exotic species are still widely consumed in China or other Asian countries where they are considered a delicacy – like the civet or some rats or bats – or for purported health benefits unproven by science. – Rappler.com "

A woman holds a child wearing a face mask as they queue at the West Kowloon rail station in Hong Kong on January 23, 2020. Photo by Philip Fong/AFP HONG KONG, China – Hong Kong will turn two holiday camps, including a former military barracks, into quarantine zones for people who may have come into contact with carriers of the Wuhan virus, officials announced Thursday, January 23. The international financial hub has been on high alert for the virus, which has killed 17 people since the outbreak started in central China. The same sites were used as quarantine facilities during the deadly Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak 17 years ago. Nearly 300 people in Hong Kong were killed by SARS, a tragedy that left a profound psychological impact on one of the most densely populated places on earth. So far two people in the city have tested positive for the new coronavirus – which is similar to the SARS pathogen. Both had visited Wuhan in recent days. They are being treated on isolation wards in hospital. The gambling hub of Macau, which is hugely popular with mainland tourists, also confirmed two cases this week. On Thursday, Macau's tourism bureau announced it was cancelling all official Lunar New Year celebrations in response. In Hong Kong, officials announced they would convert two holiday parks to isolate any potential cases while they await test results. ""We will have a full team of staff to operate the quarantine camps,"" Wong Ka-hing, the director of the Centre for Health Protection, told reporters. Wong said 3 people who had come into close contact with the two confirmed cases would be taken to a camp in rural Sai Kung district later Thursday. Another holiday camp, a former British military barracks on Hong Kong island, was being prepared to serve as a quarantine facility. Scarred by the past The 3 people are the wife of one of the confirmed cases and two medical staff, health officials said. Those who test positive for the Wuhan virus will then be treated in isolation wards at the city's hospitals, but the holiday camp quarantine zones will lower the risk of the virus spreading while people await results. The same system was used during the SARS outbreak, which dramatically transformed Hong Kong into a place where the population is now far more conscious of contagion and hygiene standards. Door handles, elevator buttons and escalator handles in the city's myriad skyscrapers and metro stations are routinely sterilized multiple times a day, while an unguarded sneeze on the crowded subway can cause neighboring commuters to scramble for distance. Surgical face masks are ubiquitous, not just in the winter flu season, with many shops selling out in recent days. Hong Kong's difficulties in battling SARS were compounded by the veil of secrecy that surrounded the outbreak on the authoritarian mainland. But officials insist they are more prepared than 2003 and say Chinese authorities are being much more transparent with data. Nonetheless, suspicion of the mainland remains high in Hong Kong, especially as it convulses with anti-government protests sparked by fears Beijing is eroding the city's unique freedoms. On Thursday, health officials were questioned by reporters as to why they weren't advising all arrivals at the city's high-speed train link with the mainland to fill out health declaration forms. ""We are now actively considering to extend the compulsory health declaration to cover the high-speed rail link,"" Wong said. He added that any decision to cancel Lunar New Year celebrations like Macau has would need to be taken by the government. Officials have also been criticized by opposition lawmakers for allowing relatives of the first confirmed case to travel on to Manila. Hong Kong's train operator MTR Corporation said it was no longer selling tickets to and from Wuhan. Local media reported long queues at the high-speed terminus on Thursday as passengers sought refunds. – Rappler.com  "

Photo by Ben Nabong/Rappler MANILA, Philippines – The Department of Health (DOH) assured the public that systems are in place in case the new coronavirus that has spread in China reaches the Philippines. DOH Undersecretary Eric Domingo told reporters on Thursday, January 23, that the health department is “fully prepared” and that protocols are in place if ever cases of the disease caused by the novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV are reported in the country. “It’s just a matter of activating the infrastructure we have ready,” Domingo said. (READ: ‘Novel coronavirus’ or 2019 nCoV: What we know so far) The health department is currently probing the case of a 5-year-old Chinese boy in Cebu City who tested positive for what the DOH called “non-specific pancoronavirus.” This means that he tested negative for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, but may have been infected by any of the 4 mild coronaviruses known to infect humans or the new coronavirus that emerged in the city of Wuhan in China in December 2019. The DOH is waiting for test results from an Australian laboratory to determine whether the boy indeed has 2019-nCoV. If he tests negative, he may be discharged from the hospital in Cebu, where he has been under observation since January 12. “The World Health Organization’s (WHO) position right now is that the virus is really going to spread. In fact, it has already gone to several countries; the international spread is no longer theoretical. ” Domingo said. If a case is confirmed and if the WHO declares the new virus an international public health emergency, Domingo said the DOH will proceed with guidelines it followed during the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) outbreaks in 2003 and 2014, respectively, but “with modifications” attentive to the new virus. This means other government agencies, including the Department of the Interior and Local Government, the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Bureau of Immigration, the Department of National Defense, among others, will be involved. More resources will also be directed to guarding airports and seaports and other points of entry into the country. Currently, the Bureau of Quarantine (BOQ) is on high alert, screening passengers of flights from China for symptoms like coughs, colds, sneezing, and difficulty breathing. South China Morning Post reported that 4 family members of a 39-year-old man found to be “preliminarily positive” with the 2019 novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV traveled from Hong Kong to Manila Wednesday, January 23, via a Cebu Pacific flight. According to the airline, all passengers were screened by the BOQ upon arrival and none was held for further observation, which means no passenger exhibited symptoms of respiratory illness. Domingo reminded the public that persons would only be put under observation if they have a history of travel to Wuhan or of working at a hospital there, if they’ve had contact with anyone suspected of the virus, and if they show symptoms of respiratory illness. Health cards are also being issued to travelers from China. Domingo said they also plan to distribute flyers so travelers may know how to contact the DOH in case they start manifesting symptoms. Health Secretary Francisco Duque III earlier said that there were still “many blindspots” concerning the new virus, allaying fears that 2019-nCoV, which has caused 17 deaths in Wuhan, is certainly as threatening as the viruses that caused SARS and MERS epidemics years ago. Scientists have yet to identify the source of the 2019-nCoV, but there are reasonable suspicions that it may have come from a public seafood market in Wuhan that has been found to be selling wild animals. Health officials in China have also said the virus may be transmitted from person-to-person. As of Wednesday, January 22, there have been 555 cases reported in Asia and North America, with 444 of the cases all in Wuhan, the epicenter of the disease. Wuhan, with a population of 11 million, has been on lockdown as authorities scramble to control the spread of the disease. Flights from Wuhan have also been canceled since Thursday as ports of entry around the world ramped up their response to the threat. WHO is set to convene a council meeting on Thursday that would determine whether the current situation is an international public health emergency and would outline the steps for preparedness and response against the disease. – Rappler.com "

File photo by STR/Vietnam News Agency/AFP WUHAN, China – (UPDATED) China locked down some 20 million people at the epicenter of a deadly virus outbreak on Thursday, January 23, but the World Health Organization said the disease did not yet constitute a global health emergency. The respiratory virus has claimed 18 lives since emerging from a seafood and animal market in the central city of Wuhan, infected hundreds of other people and been detected as far away as the United States. The new virus has caused alarm because of its similarity to SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), which killed nearly 650 people across mainland China and Hong Kong in 2002-2003. But after two days of talks to determine the level of global concern, the World Health Organization on Thursday stopped short of declaring a so-called a public health emergency of international concern – declaration used for the gravest epidemics. ""This is an emergency in China, but it has not yet become a global health emergency,"" WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters in Geneva. WHO had postponed its decision by a day, after Chinese authorities announced unprecedented measures to rein in the spread of the virus. China has effectively quarantined nearly 20 million people across Wuhan and other cities, and announced measures to curb the disease nationwide as hundreds of millions of people began travelling across the country this week for the Lunar New Year holiday. 'End of the world' Beijing cancelled massive gatherings that usually attract throngs at temples during the New Year holiday, while the historic Forbidden City will close from Saturday. Streets and shopping centres in Wuhan were eerily quiet after authorities told residents not to leave the major city of 11 million people, where most of the cases have been identified. Trains and planes out of Wuhan were indefinitely suspended and tollways on roads out the city were closed, leading to fear and panic for those who were trapped. ""We are feeling as though it is the end of the world,"" said one Wuhan resident on China's Twitter-like Weibo platform, voicing concerns about shortages of food and disinfectant. Authorities in neighbouring Huanggang City also announced public transport and train services would be suspended at midnight, while people were told to not leave the city of 7.5 million. Ezhou, a city in Hubei province with a population of 1.1 million, announced the train station had been closed earlier in the day, while 3 other cities in the province announced restrictions on their public transport or roads. 'Effective and short' Tedros hailed China for taking ""measures it believes appropriate to contain the spread of coronavirus in Wuhan and other cities."" He stressed though that ""we hope that they will be both effective and short in their duration."" WHO emergency committee chairman Didier Houssin meanwhile told reporters that after receiving ""precise information"" from Chinese authorities, the health experts had determined that the travel restrictions were ""not directly related to a specific evolution of the epidemiology in the city."" More than 580 people have been infected with the virus across China – with most cases found in Wuhan, where a seafood market that illegally sold wild animals has been identified as the epicenter of the outbreak. China meanwhile confirmed Thursday the first death from the virus outside the epicenter, bringing the total number of deaths to 18. The health commission in northern Hebei province – which borders Beijing – said an 80-year-old man diagnosed with the new virus had died. The other 17 fatalities have all been people aged 48 to 89 and had pre-existing health conditions, Chinese health authorities said Thursday. The first case of the new virus was confirmed on December 31, and it has since been detected in Japan, Hong Kong, Macau, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, and the United States. Singapore and Vietnam confirmed their first cases on Thursday. Spreading between people Animals are suspected to be the primary source of the outbreak, with studies published this week suggesting the virus may have originated in bats or snakes. The WHO has confirmed that the new virus can be passed between people, at least those in close contact. Chinese health officials warned it could mutate and spread further. But Tedros stressed Thursday there was so far ""no evidence of human-to-human transmission outside China."" If WHO had declared a global emergency, it would prompt countries to intensify their cooperation towards reining in the virus, including possibly on trade and travel restrictions – something the organization is not recommending for the time being. Countries have already increased efforts to stop the spread of the pathogen – known by its technical name 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) – with thermal screening of all passengers arriving from China at airports in a number of countries. Several companies have also begun exploring developing a vaccine for the virus, with hopes that initial clinical trials could be carried out within months. Tedros meanwhile hailed China for quickly spotting the new virus and for its ""cooperation and transparency"" in sharing vital information about it with the international community. But a senior US State Department official said Washington was ""still concerned"" about transparency in the Chinese government. During the SARS epidemic, the Chinese government took months to report the disease and initially denied WHO experts any access. WHO's emergency committee stressed the need for international vigilance and information sharing, and recommended a new meeting in ""a matter of days to examine the situation further."" – Rappler.com "

The pathogen – 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) – has caused many outlets in Shanghai, Beijing and other cities to sell out their stocks of face masks. As reports surfaced of bed shortages in Wuhan hospitals, state media said authorities were rushing to build a new facility devoted to the outbreak in a mind-blowing 10 days. The Wuhan hospital is targeted to be ready by February 3. Dozens of excavators and trucks were filmed working on the site by state television. State broadcaster CCTV also reported that 40 medical doctors from the military were being brought in to help with intensive care. In addition, 405 medical workers were being sent to Wuhan from Shanghai, said state news agency Xinhua, with the first set of 135 flying in Friday night. On Friday, staff in full body protective suits were seen checking the temperatures of people entering a subway station in Beijing. Thermal cameras scanned passengers arriving at Beijing's West Railway Station. 'Work as one' Chinese authorities said the number of cases leapt overnight to more than 800, with 177 in serious condition. There were another 1,072 suspected cases. Officials also said that a virus patient died in Heilongjiang province in China's far northeast, the second death outside the Wuhan epicenter. Beijing has been praised for its response in contrast to SARS, when it took months to report the disease and initially denied WHO experts any access. Gao Fu, head of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, asked China's people to forego New Year gatherings this year and confine themselves at home until the all-clear. ""If we all work as one, we can contain the virus in Wuhan and add no more cases exported from Wuhan, so as to stem the virus nationwide,"" Gao told state TV. Beijing has cancelled popular New Year public events at temples in the capital, the historic Forbidden City will close from Saturday, January 25, and Shanghai Disneyland said it also will shut down for an indefinite period from Saturday to protect visitors and staff. A number of tourist spots were closed and events cancelled in central Hunan province, which borders Hubei province. The crisis was given a prominent spot on the celebrated gala show on state TV Friday evening, the traditional Lunar New Year's Eve extravaganza broadcast by CCTV watched by hundreds of millions of Chinese. The host told Wuhan medical staff ""We love you"" against a backdrop of hospital footage and stirring music. – Rappler.com "
250097,rappler,"January 24, 2020",Philippines,Lacson questions ending VFA to get Dela Rosa's visa back,Aika Rey,"(UPDATED) Senator Panfilo Lacson says the Supreme Court needs to 'act soonest' on whether a two-third vote by the Senate is needed to terminate international treaties  PH-US WAR GAMES. This file photo shows US soldiers and their Filipino counterparts joining forces in an Amphibious Landing operation as part of the 2015 Balikatan Exercises. File photo by Ben Nabong/Rappler MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – Senator Panfilo Lacson questioned President Rodrigo Duterte's decision to end the Philippines' Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA) following the cancellation of the US visa of Senator Ronald ""Bato"" dela Rosa. ""Where is the connection?"" Lacson asked on Friday, January 24, saying that bargaining VFA with Dela Rosa's visa are two different things. ""The Visiting Forces Agreement between the Philippines and United States is a BILATERAL accord that went through some back-and-forth diplomatic discussions prior to ratification by the Senate, after some intense plenary deliberation,"" Lacson said. ""On the other hand, the US visa is a conditional authorization UNILATERALLY given to a visiting foreigner which may be granted, canceled or even denied outright, without need for explanation or justification,"" he added. Lacson, whose US visa was also canceled, said he didn't make an issue out of it. His visa was revoked after the 2000 case where he got classified information from then-White House security specialist Leandro Aragoncillo. ""I never make an issue out of it for the same reason that I am saying now – it is the US government’s right, as it was only my privilege to be granted the same,"" he said. In another tweet, Lacson also cited the significant help that the Philippines had been receiving from the US under the VFA. ""International terrorist Zulkifli Abdhir Marwan was neutralized with the technical assistance extended by the US. The VFA has provided our AFP the military training and equipment, thus upgrading their capability. That and more may be missed,"" he said. Abu Sayyaf leader Abu Sabaya was also neutralized in June 2002, also with the help of US tecnical assistance. Dela Rosa, meanwhile, said that the President's bargain is ""not all about him."" ""He is a leader who doesn’t want his people treated unfairly. I don't deserve this bargain, but it's not all about me. It is about a one-sided foreign relations,"" said Dela Rosa, who has a lot to lose with the visa cancelation as he has relatives in the US. Issue on Senate concurrence Several lawmakers had raised the issue of treaties that may easily be revoked by the President as he wished, because of the lack of safeguards such as Senate concurrence. ""While Senate ratification was needed to make the VFA valid – which the Senate did during presidency [of Joseph Estrada] – it can now be terminated without concurrence of the Senate,"" Drilon said. During the 17th Congress, at least 14 senators had filed a resolution declaring that the Senate has a say in the termination of any treaty or international agreements. The resolution was filed in 2016 after Duterte had declared intentions to scrap the VFA and withdraw from the International Criminal Court. The same justification led to the actual withdrawal of the Philippines from the ICC. The Supreme Court has yet to issue a decision on the Philippines' withdrawal from the ICC, which may set the guidelines on terminating international agreements. ""In the absence of a Philippine Supreme Court ruling on the President’s power to unilaterally break a treaty or bilateral agreement like the VFA without the consent of a 2/3 supermajority vote of the members of the Senate, the President can do that without the Senate’s approval or consent,""  Lacson said. ""The Supreme Court should act soonest on whether the Senate’s consent is needed before the executive department can terminate a treaty or bilateral agreement – an issue raised in a petition filed before it by members of the Senate,"" Lacson added. Foreign interference? Senator Francis Pangilinan said that ending the VFA is in line of Duterte's pivot to China. ""Pabor sa China ang pagterminate ng VFA, kaya hindi na katakataka ito. (The termination of the VFA is in favor of China, so this is not surprising),"" Pangilinan said. The senator also added that the President should have focused on other things such as the welfare of the residents affected by the Taal Volcano eruption and the threat of a new coronavirus outbreak. Meanwhile, Senator Aquilino Pimentel III said that he understood the decision of the President even if it sounds ""personal."" ""The reason stated by the president for terminating the PH-US VFA may sound ""personal"" but I see the point of the President. He believes Sen Bato is being punished by the US for having once been the implementor of his main program of government – the all-out war against drugs,"" Pimentel said. Pimentel added that such punishment reeks of foreign interference to domestic policy. ""Since that is domestic policy (war on drugs) then punishing someone – even if indirectly – for a domestic policy shows the intent to interfere by a foreign state with PH domestic policy,"" Pimentel said. The VFA, which took effect in 1999, outlined guidelines for the conduct of American troops visiting the Philippines and is the foundation for military exercises between the Philippines and the US, some of which the Duterte adminstration has already stopped. Duterte first threatened the abrogation of the VFA in 2016, when the  Millennium Challenge Corporation, a US aid-giving body, did not renew its grant to the Philippines over human rights concerns on the Philippines' war on drugs. – Rappler.com "

The Bureau of Quarantine monitors the thermal scanner of passengers arriving from international flights at Ninoy Aquino International Airport in Pasay City on January 23, 2020 amid the reports of new strain of Coronavirus from China and spreading to other countries. Photo by Inoue Jaena/Rappler MANILA, Philippines – Reports of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) that has caused pneumonia-like illness in China and parts of Asia and North America have revived fears of an outbreak akin to the SARS (severe acute respiratory disease) scare of 2003. So far, 25 have died, most of them found to have pre-existing illnesses. A total of 881 cases have been recorded, over 400 of them in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the disease’s epicenter. Wuhan is currently a city on lockdown, with flights to and from the city having been cancelled since Thursday, January 23. In the city, a university town of 11 million, students have been advised not to leave their rooms. Metro services have also been halted indefinitely and passenger boats and buses are being turned away as authorities scramble to contain the disease. (READ: ’Novel coronavirus’ or 2019 nCoV: What we know so far) Much is still unknown about the new coronavirus. Health officials in China suspect that the virus may have come from a seafood market known for selling wild animals. Human-to-human transmission is also possible, though not yet definitively confirmed. The World Health Organization (WHO) convened a council meeting on Thursday, Janaury 23, and decided not to declare the Wuhan outbreak a public health emergency of international concern for now. “This is an emergency in China, but it has not yet become a global health emergency,” the WHO director-general said. This situation does not come without precedent. In 2003, over 800 were died in China and Hong Kong after SARS spread from the two countries to neighboring places like Vietnam to as far as Canada and the United States. The crisis then lasted for 5 months, from March 2003, when the WHO issued a global alert, to July 2003, when finally the last case was reported and contained in Taiwan. In the Philippines, SARS claimed two deaths that year – a Filipino nursing assistant visiting from Canada and her father, whom she had infected. A total of 14 cases were recorded in the country, making it the lowest count among 30 countries affected by the disease. How did the Philippines handle it then? What might we learn from the SARS crisis in case a similar one hits this time around? Rappler speaks to former health secretary Manuel Dayrit, who headed the health department during the SARS crisis of 2003. Former Health Secretary Manuel Dayrit. Photo by Janella Paris/Rappler Former Health Secretary Manuel Dayrit. Photo by Janella Paris/Rappler There are protocols in place. In case the 2019-nCoV outbreak spreads outside of China and reached the Philippines, the DOH has protocols in place dating back to the SARS crisis in 2003. The SARS crisis was unprecedentd, Dayrit said, but they weren't completely in the dark as there were guidelines set after the 1960s cholera outbreak, for example. The DOH now is saying that in the event that a case of 2019-nCoV is confirmed in the Philippines, it will ""activate the infrastructure the government already has."" This infrasturcture was one that Dayrit helped build. ""The first step is you try to prevent entry or identify those who enter and may be infected,"" he said. ""Now that's a huge challenge, because there are thousands of people who are traveling every day."" It's important, Dayrit said, to know the criteria, which DOH, through its Bureau of Quarantine (BOQ) is now using when screening passengers traveling from China: If a person meets these criteria, health officials then have to do the necessary laboratory exams, which start with throat swabs and blood samples. If they turn up positive, the patient is isolated and given clinical care. ""First you do surveillance, then you do case detection, and then you do clinical care of the patient,"" Dayrit said. ""That's the protocol on the individual level."" ""If you think about it from the point of view of a country, you have to be able to be prepared to have those protocols ready everywhere as much as possible, and therefore you're looking at the places where likely infections are gonna come in,"" he added. This means monitoring ports of airports and seaports of entry, especially major travel hubs with international airports like Manila, Cebu, Davao, Iloilo, and Bohol. ""You have to make sure that in those places you have the capacity to detect, the capacity to isolate, and the capacity to treat,"" Dayrit said. ""We're far, far more prepared now than we were in 2003 for this type of problem,"" Dayrit thinks. ""This is because the infrastructure has been built up. So when DOH says we're activating the protocols, it means, everything that's already been built up from the time that we encountered this problem with SARS, we're doing now."" Local government matters. Dayrit recalls how during the SARS crisis, people were so scared that a mayor once refused to let an ambulance carrying a SARS patient pass through their area of jurisdiction to be able to reach the hospital it needed to go to. This, according to Dayrit, highlights the importance of cascading information about the disease and the virus down to the local level. ""You have to function as a team, otherwise, things start getting bogged down,"" Dayrit said. This means coordiation with local executives, health workers at the local level, and the man on the street. During the SARS crisis, networks of epidemiological surveillance units were established in regions, provinces, cities, and municipalities. Health and local government personnel down to the barangay level were also briefed on information about the virus and the disease. Special hospitals, including the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine, San Lazaro Hospital, the Lung Center of the Philippines, and DOH regional hospitals were designated as SARS hospitals. The DOH confirmed to Rappler that regional health offices are making sure that local governments are briefed enough about the disease in case it becomes an emergency. As for the man on the street, Dayrit said one should ask, ""What's the likelihood that I'm going to be infected by somebody who's come from China and has the disease?"" ""If there's critical awareness of your risk and if you know that it might be very low, then you can go about business as usual,"" he said. But this is no reason to be complacent, he said. ""The threat is there. If it's a novel virus, then there are going to be people who are going to encounter it that will not have defenses, that's why people have died. But if you look at it, eventually, we'll overcome it over time. I think the challenge is to overcome it with minimal casualties."" There will be a 'virus' of fear and panic. The public didn't know how to react to the SARS emergency then, Dayrit said. People refused to travel, people started panic-buying, flights were virtually empty. There was also a ""virus of fear and panic,"" as Dayrit would call it. ""Fear and panic often traveled much faster than the virus itself then,"" he said. ""When you think about these things, particularly if you are managing the situation, you have to take care to react appropriately– not to underreact, have a cavalier attitude, and be complacent, but not to overreact either,"" said the former health secretary."" Dayrit looks back on the health department's communication strategy then as a success, having conveyed the news in a ""consistent and accurate"" way. ""I'd like to think that our approach had a calming influence on the public,"" he said. Besides, then, the major sources of information were TV, radio, and newspapers. ""I think the difference now is there's a lot more fragmentation of the news and there's social media,"" Dayrit said. There have been false reports concerning the current 2019-nCoV crisis circulating online, including a Facebook post claiming that SARS was spreading in a mall in Mandaluyong, and a chain message saying there were confirmed cases of the virus in PBCom Tower in Makati. The DOH have since said that both reports were false. Dayrit also said this new landscape of news – with traditional sources and social media – ""creates a whole different cycle or ecology of how news is handled and sought."" He thinks because information can be accessed so swiftly nowadays, people just want a constant stream of information on their screens. ""There is a danger to do very irrational things because it’s driven by fear that's in turn driven by a constant stream of information,"" he cautioned. The government can counter this by disseminating public information and health advisories that may control fear and panic, like advisories that show precautionary measures in the event of viral infection, as the DOH did during Dayrit's time. Right now, as it investigates the case of a 5-year-old in Cebu and monitors other people that exhibit respiratory infection, the DOH is reminding the public to practice proper hygiene and coughing etiquette to curb the spread of viral diseases. Health Secretary Francisco Duque III has also said that there were still “many blindspots” concerning the new virus, allaying fears that 2019-nCoV is certainly as threatening as the virus that caused SARS years ago. There is still much about the virus that scientists have yet to determine, and technology to detect the virus in people is so far limited. But the DOH expects to build its capacities soon, after it acquires samples of the virus from China to be able to conduct laboratory exams here. It's a question of preparedness, Dayrit said. ""Even if you've set your defenses up, there's always a possibility that you'll be overrun, just by the sheer number of cases."" It doesn't hurt to expect the worst. As DOH now said, ""We need to think it [the virus] is coming so we can be prepared."" – Rappler.com "

Photo by Fabrice Coffrini/AFP DAVOS, Switzerland – Teenage activist Greta Thunberg on Friday, January 24, said activists' calls on the corporate and political elite at Davos to seriously fight climate change had been ""completely ignored,"" but vowed not to be subdued by stinging personal criticism from the Trump administration. The 50th edition of the annual Swiss Alps forum wrapped up with the menace of climate change – which UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres warned could leave humanity ""doomed"" – hammered into the minds of participants but doubt over whether any concrete action would be forthcoming. Thunberg, 17, whose school strike movement had inspired a generation of young people to pressure governments over their inaction, had told the World Economic Forum (WEF) she wanted to see an immediate end to investment in fossil fuels. ""Before we came here we had a few demands for this WEF. Of course these demands have been completely ignored. We expected nothing less,"" Thunberg told reporters in the ski resort on the last day of the conference. ""As long as the science is being ignored – as the facts are not being taken into account – and as long as the situation is not being treated as a crisis, then world and business leaders can, of course, continue to ignore the situation.

Her demand for an immediate halt to investment in fossil fuels also prompted a stingingly personal aside from US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Thursday, January 23. ""Is she the chief economist? Who is she? I'm confused,"" Mnuchin said, emphasizing after a pause that this was a joke. ""After she goes and studies economics in college, she can come back and explain that to us,"" he said. Asked about Mnuchin's comments, the Swede said: ""Of course it has no effect. We are being criticized like that all the time."" ""If we cared about that, we would not be able to do what we do. We put ourselves in the spotlight."" Mnuchin on Friday launched a new defense of US policy, insisting the Trump administration cared for the environment, but that problems should not be reduced to just climate change. ""Climate change is one of many issues"" affecting the environment, he said, adding Trump was a firm advocate of ""clean air and clean water."" He said the reason the US left the Paris climate agreement – which calls for blocking global warming at well below 2C, and 1.5C if possible – ""was not because we don't support the environment (but because) we thought it wasn't a fair and balanced agreement."" He added that there were other key global issues to worry about, notably that ""there's way too many people in the developing world"" without access to electricity and preventing the spread of epidemics in the next decades like the coronavirus. 'Not for change in discourse' The starkest warnings at the forum came from Britain's Prince Charles – who asked ""what good is all the extra wealth in the world...if you can do nothing with it, except watch it burn?"" – and Guterres. The UN chief warned that the world was losing the war against climate change and humanity's capacity ""to live in this planet"" will risk being destroyed. ""We need to act in order to make sure we are not doomed,"" he said. Another prominent climate change protest leader, German student Luisa Neubauer, acknowledged that some bold words had been heard at Davos, but deeds were now needed.

The contagion has so far claimed 26 lives in China, sickened hundreds and has spread across several Asian countries as well as the US. ""I'm pleased to report she is clinically doing well and is in stable condition,"" said Allison Arwady, commissioner of the Chicago Department of Public Health of the new patient. Nancy Messonier, senior official at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), said the agency had so far tested 63 samples from patients across 22 US states for the 2019 Novel Coronavirus. Eleven were found to be negative and two positive, and the CDC was working to make diagnosis kits more nationally available. At present the testing is occurring at the agency's headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia. The Chicago patient had traveled to Wuhan in late December before returning to the US on January 13, Arwady said, a few days before health screenings began at major airports for travelers originating from the central Chinese city that is at the center of the outbreak. She began experiencing symptoms and called her health care providers, and was later admitted to hospital and placed in isolation. ""She has not taken public transportation, have not attended any large gatherings and, she has not had extended close contact with anyone outside her home since returning from China,"" added Arwady. The US confirmed its first case of the infection earlier this week, a man in his thirties from Washington state who had also traveled to Wuhan recently and also reported himself to authorities after developing mild symptoms. Neither of the cases were detected by the airport screenings that began on January 17, said CDC official Martin Cetron, and both patients had no symptoms or fever when they first arrived in the US. China has placed a travel ban across a vast region encompassing 13 cities and more than 40 million people, and the US was now ""reevaluating"" its approach of carrying out airport screenings, added Cetron.

250157,rappler,"January 26, 2020",Science Solitaire,The germs among us,Maria Isabel Garcia,"'Panicking is a normal reaction to the discovery of a virus, but we have to try harder as the general public to respond'   It was easier for us to understand the heavens than to fathom what is inside our bodies. We already understood for the most part how objects, including the planets, move and stayed still before we understood germs. Isaac Newton had already laid this out in the late 1600s. But it was only in the 1800s that we had definitively found and accepted that there was tiny “stuff” in the air (some we consider as “living” and some we are not sure qualifies as “living”) that cause sickness in plants and animals (humans are animals even if we forget this a lot) and that they reproduce inside us and spread through different ways. The size of a human hair is about 75,000 nanometers. Bacteria is about 1000 nanometers. But a virus is only 20-400 nanometers. This is one of the reasons why it is very difficult to treat a viral disease – you have to come up with ingenious ways to first see it, and then devise incredibly tiny filters to catch it and then attack it. Bacteria and viruses are among the “stuff” that scientists call “pathogens” (“pathos” which means “feeling” or “suffering” and “gen” which means “born”) – those that cause diseases. The 5 kinds of pathogens are viruses, protozoa, bacteria, fungi, and worms. The smallest of these are viruses. Bacteria was discovered before viruses, because scientists until the end of the 1800’s had found ways to make tiny filters that could catch bacteria, but were surprised to find that infection still persisted. This could only be so because what was causing the infection may have been a lot smaller. Bacteria could be seen through a “regular” microscope. This kind of microscope had its beginnings in 1590 and went through great improvements, including the one by Galileo in 1609. Robert Hooke, the one who coined the term “cell” in 1665, also had a hand in it, as did Leeuwenhoek in the 1670’s – he was the one who first described “spermatozoa” when he saw it through his self-designed high-powered single lens microscope. Robert Koch in 1882 also designed the bacteria that could cause tuberculosis. But a virus could only reveal itself through an electron microscope, and this was not invented until 1931 by Ernst Ruska and Max Knoll. Viruses could be considered the weirdest among the 5 pathogens because they do not have their own cells. And if “cell” is how we define the “basic unit of life,” then they are not alive. As such, they do not have “cell walls.” But they move and reproduce by using the cells of the hosts that they invade. They can infect everything that have cells, including bacteria. Viruses move because they are like freelancers – they are not attached to any institutions, but they have “wifi,” literally wired with strands of RNA and DNA molecules which carry their own genetic material, protected by a protein coat and another layer of material. These are the ones that move in and wreak havoc inside cells. Viruses take on many shapes – like snowflakes. A coronavirus was named as such because when seen under an electron microscope, it has “crowns” like the sun’s crown. A flu virus, meanwhile, is spherical in shape. The shapes of the virus determine how a virus works and and attaches itself to host cells. A virus can find various ways to enter a life form through carriers: through coughing and sneezing, through fecal matter, b coming into contact with blood that has it, or by sexual contact.  When it enters a host, it will invade the cell, taking over that cell’s machinery so that it can reproduce itself. While a bacteria is specific to a disease (local), a viral infection spreads throughout your other cells (systemic). A disease caused by bacteria can be treated by antibiotics because antibiotics generally work by attacking the cell wall of the bacteria. As viruses do not have cell walls, there is nothing that antibiotics can do to treat viruses. Your own immune system generally would have to be the one to be strengthened so you could fight off the march of viruses in your own cells. For the nastier viruses like polio, measles, smallpox, and chickenpox, vaccination is the most effective way to prevent them. Vaccination is when a substance (the “foreign” chemical or the “good” twin of the virus) is formulated in such a way that when it is introduced into your own body, your own immune system will be on high alert and will be able to recognize the virus and fight it off with its own defense mechanism. Each kind of virus will call for its own kind of vaccine, because the latter will depend on the virus structure. Our immune system should be able to know it when it sees it and know the kind of “weapons” to use and to what extent they will be unleashed to destroy the virus. That is why it is so essential that when public health experts say they are still studying a virus, this includes the possibility of figuring out how soon they can come up with a vaccine. This is also why vaccination of the large majority of the population is paramount. Viruses will survive and flourish and spread if they find more and more people who have not been vaccinated. Once that happens, the viruses gain enough power to be an epidemic (throughout communities) or pandemic (throughout the world). As long as the vast majority has been vaccinated against these viruses, these viruses will be relatively silent. The newly discovered coronavirus that started in Wuhan, China seems to have come from animals, though they are not sure yet which animal it is and how they jumped to humans. They know this because a significant number of the people health experts examined were exposed to the meat market. They also know that it may be spreading because of coughing or sneezing, similar to the flu, as a good number tested have also been exposed to people with respiratory illness. Panicking is a normal reaction to the discovery of a virus, but we have to try harder as the general public to respond – which means you should wear a mask if you are in public places, and take the strictest precautions when in contact with animals. We should also listen to our local health officials as well as the World Health Organization. (READ: DOH says it's ready in case new coronavirus reaches PH) This is a chance for us to get to understand what a virus is, why vaccination is essential, and how science could be on your side regardless of your sketchy relationship with it when you were still in school – that is, on the side of life. – Rappler.com Maria Isabel Garcia is a science writer.

For its part, Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) has also suspended airline operations between Wuhan and the Philippines on Thursday, January 23. Hours before the restrictions of Philippine and China authorities though some 135 passengers onboard a Royal Air Charter flight arrived Thursday morning at the Kalibo International Airport  from Wuhan. They were all bound for Boracay Island and were scheduled to return to China on January 30. While those identified as from Wuhan were repatriated Saturday, the rest of the group were allowed to stay in Boracay until Monday, January 27. Despite high-level monitoring and surveillance measures  by Aklan authorites, the presence in Boracay of tourists from China has triggered alarm and public anxiety in the province. Airports and ports remained on alert as quarantine officers enhanced temperature screening of passengers from other countries to contain the coronavirus threat. Last week, 3 Chinese citizens with no travel history to Wuhan were examined in Aklan provincial hospital after they experienced flu-like symptoms on arrival at Kalibo airport. A flight attendant also sought medical help after arriving at Kalibo airport from Wuhan. She was self-quarantined after manifesting the symptoms. Provincial Health Officer I Dr. Cornelio Cuachon, Jr. said specimen samples were collected and transported to Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) for confirmatory tests. Health authorities in Aklan said the province had no confirmed cases of patients contracting of new identified coronavirus strain. Cuachon also appealed to the public to stop spreading ""fake news and unverified information"" on coronavirus outbreak. He urged the public to avoid close contact with live or dead animals, wash hands frequently and avoid close contact with people suffering from acute respiratory infections. Common symptoms of fast-spreading virus include sore throat, fever and breathing difficulties.  – Rappler.com Here are more stories on the raging coronavirus outbreak: "

Photo by Gary Kwok/AFP HONG KONG, China – Hong Kong's Disneyland announced it was shutting its doors on Sunday, January 26, until further notice over the deadly virus outbreak in central China, a day after city authorities classified the crisis as an emergency. The park said it was taking the step to protect ""the health and safety of our guests and cast members"" and said refunds would be given. Ocean Park, a rival amusement park on Hong Kong's main island, said it was also closing its doors. On Saturday, Hong Kong classified the outbreak as an ""emergency"" – the city's highest warning tier – and announced ramped-up measures to reduce the risk of further infections. The move came as city leader Carrie Lam faced criticism in some quarters over her administration's response to the crisis, including calls to halt, or limit, arrivals from the Chinese mainland where the epidemic began. Of the 5 people who have tested positive for the virus in Hong Kong so far, 4 arrived via a newly built high-speed train terminal which connects with the mainland. Lam has resisted closing the border, saying the crisis is not yet at a point where such a drastic measure is needed. But she has announced all mainland arrivals must now sign health declaration forms. A series of public events, including a Lunar New Year gala and next month's marathon have also been cancelled. On Sunday, the nearby gambling hub of Macau announced 3 more cases of the novel coronavirus, bringing its total to 5. All 3 new cases were women who came from the central Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicenter of the epidemic. One of the women had arrived in Macau via Hong Kong, authorities said. The closure of Disneyland and Ocean Park will pile fresh misery on Hong Kong's tourism, leisure and retail industries which have already been battered by more than 7 months of often-violent pro-democracy protests. Ocean Park is on track to receive a HK$10.6 billion (US$1.3 billion) government bailout over grim ticket sales in recent years. Combined with the US-China trade war fallout, the protests have helped tip Hong Kong into recession and the virus outbreak has only compounded the city's economic woes. Shanghai's Disneyland also closed from Saturday in response to the coronavirus outbreak. Hong Kong has firsthand experience of deadly viral outbreaks. Nearly 300 people were killed in the city by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003, a tragedy that left a profound psychological impact on one of the most densely populated places on earth. – Rappler.com "

China has locked down the hard-hit province of Hubei in the country's centre in an unprecedented operation affecting tens of millions of people to slow the spread of the respiratory illness.  (READ: ‘Novel coronavirus’ or 2019 nCoV: What we know so far) The virus's ability to spread appears to be ""getting stronger"" though it is ""not as powerful as SARS"", top Chinese health officials said at a press conference, adding that their knowledge of it is limited. The previously unknown virus has caused global concern because of its similarity to the SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) pathogen, which killed hundreds across mainland China and Hong Kong in 2002-2003. Outside the epicentre, 4 cities – including Beijing and Shanghai, and the eastern province of Shandong – announced bans on long-distance buses from entering or leaving their borders, a move that will affect millions of people travelling over the Lunar New Year holiday. The popular southern province of Guangdong, Jiangxi in the centre, and 3 cities made it mandatory for residents to wear faces masks in public. Originating in Hubei's capital of Wuhan, the virus has spread throughout China and around the world – with cases confirmed in around a dozen countries as distant as the United States. The US State Department said Sunday it was arranging a flight from Wuhan to San Francisco for consulate staff and other Americans in the city. The flight is on Tuesday, it said in an email to Americans in China that warned of ""extremely limited"" capacity for private citizens. France's government and the French carmaker PSA also said they were formulating plans to evacuate staff and families, who will be quarantined in a city in a neighboring province. Japan is coordinating with the Chinese government to swiftly evacuate its citizens, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said. South Korea's consulate in Wuhan said it was conducting an online poll of its citizens there to gauge demand for a chartered flight out. Fear in Wuhan Instead of New Year revelry, Wuhan has been seized by an eerie calm that deepened on Sunday as new restrictions banned most road traffic in the metropolis of 11 million. Loudspeakers broke the silence by offering tips slathered with bravado. ""Do not believe in rumors. Do not spread rumors. If you feel unwell, go to the hospital in time,"" the message said. ""Wuhan is a city that dares to face difficulties and keeps overcoming them,"" the female voice added, mentioning the deadly 2002-03 SARS epidemic and 1998 Yangtze River flooding. The health emergency has overwhelmed Wuhan's hospitals with patients, prompting authorities to send hundreds of medical reinforcements, including military doctors, and start construction on two field hospitals. With non-essential vehicles banned from the road, volunteers stepped up to drive sick fellow citizens to hospitals. ""There has to be someone who does this,"" Zhang Lin, 48, told AFP journalists as he waited for a patient to emerge from a clinic for the drive back home in nearly deserted streets. Some foreigners in Wuhan expressed deep concern, saying they feared going outside even though their food supplies were running low. ""We want to be evacuated as soon as possible, because either the virus, the hunger or the fear will kill us,"" Mashal Jamalzai, a political science student from Afghanistan at Central China Normal University, told Agence France-Presse. The outbreak is suspected to have originated in a Wuhan market where animals including rats, snakes and hedgehogs were reportedly sold as exotic food. China said Sunday it was banning all trade in wildlife until the emergency is over, but conservationists complain that China has previously failed to deliver on pledges to get tough. Another Disneyland closes Health officials said the virus has since become transmissible between humans.

Shanghai on Sunday reported its first death -- an 88-year-old man who had pre-existing health problems. The government says most deaths involved the elderly or people already suffering from other ailments. Fearing a repeat of SARS, China has dramatically scaled back celebrations and travel associated with the New Year holiday, which began Friday, while tourist sites like Beijing's Forbidden City and a section of the Great Wall have closed as a precaution. In Hong Kong, Disneyland announced Sunday it had closed as a precaution after the city declared an emergency to combat the crisis. Shanghai's Disneyland park had already closed Saturday.

Photo by AFP BEIJING, China – China on Sunday, January 26, ordered a temporary ban on the trade in wild animals as the country struggles to contain a deadly virus believed to have been spawned in a market that sold wild animals as food. Raising, transporting or selling all wild animal species is forbidden ""from the date of the announcement until the national epidemic situation is over,"" said a government directive. (READ: ‘Novel coronavirus’ or 2019 nCoV: What we know so far) The ban was issued by the Ministry of Agriculture, the State Administration for Market Regulation, and the National Forestry and Grassland Administration. The lethal virus, which has caused 56 confirmed deaths and nearly 2,000 total infections in China, and spread to about a dozen countries, is believed to have originated in a market in the central city of Wuhan, where a range of wildlife was reportedly sold. Conservationists have long accused China of tolerating a shadowy trade in exotic animals for food or as ingredients in traditional medicines, including highly endangered species such as the pangolin or tiger. Health experts say the trade poses a significant and growing public health risk as potentially dangerous animal-borne pathogens that people would normally not be exposed to make the jump to humans. The SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) virus that killed hundreds of people in China and Hong Kong in 2002-03 also has been traced to wild animals, with scientists saying it likely originated in bats, later reaching humans via civets. Civets, a cat-like creature, were among dozens of species listed on an exhaustive price list for one of the animal-trading businesses at the Wuhan market that emerged online last week. Other items included various rats, snakes, giant salamanders and even live wolf pups. Sunday's announcement said all businesses, markets, food and beverage outlets, and e-commerce platforms are ""strictly prohibited from trading in wild animals in any form."" It added that ""consumers must fully understand the health risks of eating wild animals, avoid wild game, and eat healthy."" The so-called bushmeat trade, along with broader human encroachment on wild habitats, is bringing humans into ever-closer contact with animal viruses that can spread rapidly in today's connected world, scientists say. A study by the Global Virome Project, a worldwide effort to increase preparedness for pandemics, estimated that there are nearly 1.7 million undiscovered viruses in the animal kingdom, nearly half of which could be harmful to humans. Peter Daszak, a virology expert with the project, told Agence France-Presse its research also indicated that we can expect around 5 new animal-borne pathogens to infect humanity each year. China has launched previous crackdowns on the wildlife trade, including after SARS, but conservationists say the trade typically resumes over time. – Rappler.com "

(READ: ‘Novel coronavirus’ or 2019 nCoV: What we know so far) The city has diagnosed 6 positive cases of the virus so far. Dozens of local residents and protesters opposed to the idea held rallies outside the complex on Sunday, with some setting up road blocks.

An Agence France-Presse photographer on the scene saw fierce flames coming from the entrance of two apartment blocks before firefighters got the blaze under control. Riot police were on scene and protesters had left, although some local residents were arguing with officers who used pepper spray. The Centre for Health Protection said the plan to turn the housing estate into a quarantine zone would be suspended. The agency has already turned a holiday park in an isolated rural area into a working quarantine facility. Two other holiday parks located away from major housing estates are also ready to be used as similar facilities. But officials say they have struggled to find hotels and spare rooms for doctors and nurses working on the isolation wards where patients are being treated. The virus outbreak comes at a time when Hong Kong is already boiling with widespread anti-government sentiment after seven months of often violent pro-democracy protests. The city's pro-Beijing leader Carrie Lam boasts record-low approval ratings while the police force is loathed in many neighbourhoods. The frequency and ferocity of protests have died down in the last six weeks, but sporadic clashes still take place. Police fired tear gas on Saturday night – the first day of the Lunar New Year – at small groups of masked protesters in Mongkok. Nearly 300 people were killed by SARS in 2003, a tragedy that left a profound psychological impact on one of the most densely populated places on earth. The city's ability to combat the crisis was hampered by moves in mainland China to cover up and play down the outbreak, leaving a lasting legacy of distrust among many Hong Kongers.

250270,rappler,"January 27, 2020",#AnimatED,[EDITORIAL] Our biggest enemy amid the Wuhan virus outbreak,Rappler.com,"It’s not the virus. It’s not the Chinese flying into the Philippines. It’s panic. Here's the situation: a new strain of the coronavirus has caused an outbreak in the city of Wuhan in central China. It has so far killed 80 people and infected more than 2,700. While the entire province of Hubei is on lockdown, the virus has nevertheless been transmitted by infected humans to at least 12 other countries. The Philippines is awaiting confirmation if the virus has reached its shores. So far, the only case acknowledged by the Department of Health (DOH) to be under observation is a 5-year-old boy from Wuhan who was isolated in a hospital in Cebu City starting January 12, and has since been discharged. While the boy has exhibited flu-like symptoms, there’s no certainty yet that what he has is the newly-discovered 2019 novel coronavirus (nCoV), also called the Wuhan virus. It could be any of the 7 known coronaviruses. Health authorities are awaiting the results of lab tests done on the boy’s samples in Australia. The Bureau of Immigration has tracked down the family of 4 whose father, after traveling from Wuhan to Hong Kong, has been found to be “preliminary positive” with the virus. Leaving the patient in HK, the family boarded a Cebu Pacific flight to Manila on January 22. The justice department says it is monitoring the movements of that family, and “may refer them to Bureau of Quarantine” (BOQ). The airline urged the passengers of that flight 5J 111 to get themselves checked. On Monday morning, January 27, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said in a Malacañang briefing that the DOH was investigating 11 possible nCov cases in 6 regions in the country, but reiterated that there is no confirmed case yet. Without any confirmation from health authorities, the rest of the supposed cases we’ve been reading about on social media are speculations or outright misinformation.   Understandably, Filipinos are worried. The 2019 nCov, which can infect a person’s airways, has symptoms similar to the deadly SARS-CoV of 17 years ago, and can be transferred from human to human. And while scientists have yet to understand the new virus’ life cycle, how exactly it’s transmitted, and whether it is going to mutate, there is no approved vaccine or treatment yet for the coronavirus infection. But we should caution ourselves against letting this worry spiral into panic. Because panic can blur our judgment. It makes us vulnerable to wrong information or speculation or conspiracy theories. It makes us discriminate against any person “who looks Chinese” and is wearing a mask, or is in the vicinity of a hospital. It makes us question the specialists in the health department when they don’t seem to be as worried as we are. We nag our local governments to do drastic things that are outside the protocols established by the DOH. We’ve heard of Chinese-looking individuals not being allowed to enter the emergency room of a hospital – a nurse had to talk to them outside, and then they were turned away. In one city, we heard that some journalists were among those pushing the mayor to declare a total ban on Chinese tourists. Some have made racist remarks about what the Chinese in the mainland eat. Let’s go back to what authorities say we know about the Wuhan virus, and stick to that. Arnaud Fontanet, head of the department of epidemiology at Institut Pasteur in Paris, says the 2019 nCov, in its current form, appears to be “weaker” than SARS. It’s too early to say whether the virus is going to mutate or not. Rabindra Abeyasinghe, the country representative to the Philippines of the World Health Organization (WHO), said as of January 21 that it was “too early to say this is a severe disease.” So far, those who have died had pre-existing illnesses, while not all of them had a history of getting in contact with the wet market in Wuhan where wild animals being sold were suspected to have been the source of the virus. Through the WHO, China’s health ministry is expected to provide the Philippines and other countries a DNA sample of the 2019 nCoV. This “will serve as the basis for our own testing and treatment” via the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine, says Secretary Duque. Duque says the Philippines’ “detection capability is still evolving,” but this should not be a handicap. Thanks to the internet, scientists from universities, research centers, and even private companies across the globe are collaborating online to study the Wuhan virus so China and other countries can all respond to it appropriately. So far, the Philippines has suspended all direct flights to and from Wuhan, and has put its Bureau of Quarantine at the airports on high alert. The DOH assures the public that it is ready in case the Wuhan virus reaches the Philippines, and this confidence stems from the fact that, since the 2003 SARS crisis, protocols on monitoring and testing are in place, and surveillance units are in place in the regions, cascading information and instructions down to the barangays.

Authorities have barred travel to and from Hubei province and its capital Wuhan, where the coronavirus was first detected before it spread across China and to a dozen other countries – including the United States, France, and Australia. Several other large cities in China have introduced their own travel restrictions in a bid to contain the disease, which has killed 56 people and infected nearly 2,000 others. ""In the past week we've not been able to go out and buy anything to eat,"" said Mashal Jamalzai, a political science student from Afghanistan at Central China Normal University. He told AFP that he and his classmates had been living on biscuits, and his embassy had not responded to requests for help. ""We want to be evacuated as soon as possible, because either the virus, the hunger or the fear will kill us,"" Jamalzai said. Thousands of foreign students and other international residents live in Wuhan, a normally bustling transport hub in central China home to a huge steel and auto industry. But with schools, hospitals and public offices shut and no transport to and from the city, Hubei University student Siti Mawaddah says the city now ""looks like a ghost town."" ""The situation in Wuhan right now is very intense and worrying,"" the 25-year-old Indonesian told AFP, adding that the situation had taken a psychological toll on her and her classmates. ""If we stay in Wuhan, it's as if we're just waiting for our turn to get infected,"" she said. Mawaddah said she had heard the United States plans to evacuate consular staff and some American citizens living in the city, and hoped her own government could do the same. Evacuation plans The US State Department is sending a flight to collect its consular staff and carry them to San Francisco, but warned that there would only be limited space for the estimated 1,000 Americans living in Wuhan. ""If there is insufficient ability to transport everyone who expresses interest, priority will be given to individuals at greater risk from coronavirus,"" the department said. Diana Adama, an American teacher living in Wuhan, told CNN that she was upset at the lack of information about the virus. But she said she didn't want to leave on the chartered flight if it meant carrying the virus back home. ""I'm not going to endanger anybody else. And that's just erring on the side of caution,"" she told the broadcaster. France is also planning to evacuate its citizens stuck in Hubei province by bus, and French carmaker PSA – which has a sizable presence in Wuhan – said was formulating plans to evacuate staff and relatives for quarantine in a neighbouring province. South Korea's consulate general in Wuhan conducted a poll on Sunday to determine the demand for a chartered plane for its citizens who want to return home, while Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said his country would fly out any nationals who wanted to leave. Singapore has already repatriated 20 airline staff and passengers who were quarantined in the eastern city of Hangzhou for more than a day after fears one person on the flight was carrying the disease, according to the Straits Times newspaper. And Sri Lanka said Sunday it would fly back 150 students from China in the next two days. With China ramping up travel restrictions in cities across the country – including Beijing and Shanghai – foreign countries have told their citizens to avoid Wuhan. Russia has yet to report its first case of the virus but has gone a step further, with tourism officials on Friday asking operators to stop selling tour packages to China and inform customers about the dangers of the outbreak. Tourism company Rus-Tour announced Sunday it was transporting 1,100 of its customers home from Hainan, a resort island popular with Russian travellers around 1,600 kilometres (1,000 miles) south of Wuhan.

The 58-year-old Church of Our Lady of Perpetual Succour on Siglap Hill, Singapore, was standing room only. It was the Fiesta Mass in honor of Santo Niño de Cebu, the Child Jesus symbolized by the Philippines' oldest religious image that Spanish colonizers gave Cebu in the 1500s. It was the 6th time that the Filipino community in Singapore was celebrating the Sinulog, but this year was different because Singapore is on alert. In Singapore, there have been at least 4 cases of the novel coronavirus, also known as the Wuhan virus, named after its reported place of origin in China. (READ: The global spread of the coronavirus: Where is it?) Safety from the Wuhan virus was one of the prayers by Santo Niño devotees in Singapore on Sunday. With some of them wearing surgical masks, devotees joined not only the Mass but also the Sinulog procession afterwards. ""Since there's the coronavirus, hopefully no Filipino is affected by this disease,"" said Janice Papa, a Filipino who has been working in Singapore for almost 11 years. Papa, who has attended Sinulog celebrations in Singapore since 6 years ago, also prayed that Taal Volcano would not erupt again, and that she might have good health. One of the event's organizers, Eric Naguiat, also prayed that the Wuhan virus ""will be prevented soon,"" and that victims ""be given God's grace for their fast healing."" The Philippine embassy in Singapore has advised Filipinos not to touch live animals or consume raw, undercooked food; avoid crowded places; observe proper hygiene; always wash their hands with soap; wear a mask if they have cough or shortness of breath; and seek doctors' help if they feel unwell. The local Catholic Church itself implemented its own precautionary measures, with the Archdiocese of Singapore indefinitely suspending the practice of communion by the mouth. The Wuhan virus, however, did not stop the Sinulog in Singapore from demonstrating the vibrant faith of Filipinos anywhere in the world. Still it showed how Filipinos, from merely receiving the Gospel from Spaniards almost 500 years ago, are now the ones spreading Catholicism worldwide – in the words of Pope Francis late last year, ""smugglers of the faith."" ""In the 500 years of our faith, we Filipinos have spread and proclaimed the faith to other places where we Filipinos live,"" said Father Charlie Oasan, chaplain of Filipinos in Singapore, in an interview with Rappler. The Sinulog Mass on Sunday ended with a symbolic gesture: Filipinos in Singapore, whose ancestors received the Santo Niño from their colonizers, handed dozens of these images to their Singaporean friends. – Rappler.com "

The virus has caused global concern because of its similarity to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which killed hundreds across mainland China and Hong Kong in 2002-2003 and was also traced to the wild game trade. Authorities around China have already imposed aggressive curbs on transport during the usually high-traffic Lunar New Year season to keep the virus from spreading.

Passengers wearing protective facemasks to help stop the spread of a deadly SARS-like virus which originated in the central city of Wuhan arrive at Beijing railway station in Beijing on January 24, 2020. Photo by Noel Celis/AFP GENEVA, Switzerland – The World Health Organization said Monday, January 27, it remained unclear if the deadly coronavirus spreading in China and beyond is contagious during its incubation period, before symptoms appear. The virus, which can cause a pneumonia-like acute respiratory infection, has in a matter of weeks killed more than 80 people and infected some 2,740 in China, while cases have been identified in more than a dozen other countries. In a fresh report on the new virus, known as 2019nCoV, the UN health agency said current estimates put the incubation period for the virus at between two and 10 days. ""Understanding the time when infected patients may transmit the virus to others is critical for control efforts,"" WHO said. It did not immediately confirm assertions made by Chinese authorities that people who are infected can spread the disease before they show any symptoms of fever or respiratory difficulties. ""Detailed epidemiological information from more people infected is needed to determine the infectious period of 2019nCoV, in particular whether transmission can occur from asymptomatic individuals or during the incubation period,"" it said. WHO last week stopped short of declaring the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern – a rare designation used only for the worst outbreaks that would trigger more concerted global action. But the world body admitted Monday it had made an error in its risk assessment for the deadly virus in several reports last week, acknowledging the global risk was ""high"" rather than ""moderate."" The virus has caused global concern because of its similarity to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which killed hundreds across mainland China and Hong Kong in 2002-2003 and was also traced to the wild game trade. The new virus is believed to have jumped to people from animals in a Wuhan market, but it has since begun spreading between humans, although the exact mode of transmission has yet to be confirmed. As with SARS and another deadly coronavirus known as Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome, or MERS, WHO suggested that the new virus could be spreading through droplets, for instance when people sneeze or cough, or through direct contact with infected people or with objects they have touched. To reduce the risk of infection, WHO stressed the need to avoid close contact with people suffering from acute respiratory infections, frequently wash one's hands, and avoid unprotected contact with farm or wild animals. The agency also stressed the importance of practicing so-called cough etiquette, including maintaining distance and covering coughs and sneezes with tissues. WHO has not recommended any international travel or trade restrictions, but does call for high levels of vigilance, including encouraging airport exit and entry screening for passengers leaving affected areas to check for fever and coughs. – Rappler.com "

Workers are seen at the construction site of a new hospital being built to treat patients from a deadly virus outbreak in Wuhan in China's central Hubei province on January 27, 2020. Photo by Hector Retamal/AFP WUHAN, China – Hundreds of workers are toiling around the clock at the site of a field hospital that China is racing to build within days to treat a rapidly growing number of patients stricken by a deadly virus. The outline of a floor began to take shape and electrical switchboards were already up on Monday, January 27 when AFP reporters visited the site of the facility, dubbed ""Fire God Mountain,"" being built in Wuhan, the central city where the coronavirus first emerged. It is one of two makeshift hospitals that Chinese authorities are rushing to build within a fortnight in the city of 11 million people to relieve medical facilities swamped with patients waiting for hours to see doctors. Work to build Fire God Mountain started Friday and is due to be ready to receive patients on February 3, according to state media. The second one, named ""Thunder God Mountain,"" will be ready for use on February 5. The construction workers all wore masks as mandated by the authorities for the entire population of the city, which has been under lockdown since Thursday, January 23. They are checked for fevers when they arrived by bus and again during their breaks. They worked around a forest of excavators and trucks bringing in prefab material at the site on the southwestern side of the city. ""We have to work fast to combat the epidemic,"" a worker in his 30s, who refused to give his name, told AFP. He said he worked 9 hours per day, ""sometimes less, sometimes more. It depends on what they need"". All workers mobilized The 25,000-square-metre hospital will have between 700 and 1,000 beds to treat patients of a pneumonia-like virus that has killed 81 people – mostly in Wuhan – and infected more than 2,700 across the country. The second facility will have 1,300 beds. ""We've mobilized all the workers left in Wuhan to work in shifts to ensure round-the-clock construction,"" Zhang Chongxi, general manager of the road and bridge company of Wuhan Construction, was quoted as saying by the official Xinhua news agency. Chen Bingzhong, a former health ministry official, said the facilities are needed because infectious diseases should not be treated in general hospitals. ""Because the infectious power of this virus is too strong, it will infect other patients, including medical staff,"" Chen told AFP. 'Let's go Wuhan' China has experience building hospitals in record time in periods of crisis. In 2003, it built a facility in Beijing within a week to treat patients during the SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) epidemic. Authorities have used this as a model for the new facilities for the patients ill with the novel virus, which shares genetic similarities with SARS. Premier Li Keqiang visited one of the construction sites on Monday during his first trip to Wuhan since the health crisis erupted – a sign of the growing concern among the leadership in Beijing. ""Fast doesn't mean without quality,"" Li, who wore a mask, told the workers, according to videos of his visit. ""Fire God Mountain"" is being erected next to a residential building. A road outside the construction site is used to park dozens of trucks and construction vehicles. The city's new rallying cry – ""Let's go Wuhan!"" – was written on a banner across the front of a truck. Bulldozers flattened the earth, electricians installed 5G antennas, and workers began to bury pipes. ""We are happy to help in this situation.

Health Secretary Francisco Duque III told the Inquirer that two of the 3 Chinese nationals being monitored had a history of travel to Wuhan, China, the city where the outbreak of the new virus began. So far, the disease has stricken over 2,800 and killed over 80. It has spread outside of China, reaching neighboring Asian countries as well as countries in North America, Europe, and Australia. In addition to the 3, 11 others are “under investigation” by the DOH for possible cases of 2019-nCoV. In a press briefing in Malacañang on Monday, Duque said the persons under investigation (PUIs), whose ages vary, are in the following areas: The DOH said persons under investigation are Chinese, US, German, and Brazilian nationals, among others. The health department also cautioned the public against believing random messages circulating online and through text about supposed cases of 2019-nCoV in the Philippines. The DOH and the World Health Organization (WHO) in the Philippines reiterated that there are so far no cases of the new virus here, and that the people under investigation are isolated in the respective hospitals to which they are admitted. The DOH on Tuesday, January 28, activated the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases in light of the emerging public health thread.

The contagion, which experts believe emanated from a wild animal market in the city of Wuhan last month, has triggered a desperate Chinese containment effort after spreading nationwide and to more than a dozen other countries. The government has sealed off Wuhan and other cities in central Hubei province, effectively trapping more than 50 million people, including thousands of foreigners, in a bid to contain the virus as the high-travel Lunar New Year holiday unfolds. (READ: ‘Novel coronavirus’ or 2019 nCoV: What we know so far) ""It's deeply stressful,"" Joseph Pacey, a 31-year-old Briton who teaches English in Wuhan, told AFP. ""The virus is scary, but the biggest fear for me is that this thing will go on for months, and it will get harder and harder to get supplies, and to live."" Governments are scrambling to devise ways to safely get their citizens out of the city of 11 million. Japan announced it would send a chartered flight to Wuhan on Tuesday evening to evacuate about 200 of 650 Japanese nationals. ""We will also bring with it aid supplies such as masks and protective suits for Chinese people as well as for Japanese nationals,"" Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi said in Tokyo. Motegi said the plane would leave Wuhan on Wednesday morning, and that efforts were being made ot organize more flights. Flight delays The United States was also trying to organise a rescue mission. A chartered California-bound flight with limited space had been scheduled to leave Wuhan on Tuesday with consular staff and some American citizens. But the State Department said it was postponed to Wednesday, without giving a reason. France has also said it intends to fly its citizens out of the city in the middle of this week. Several other countries also were working to repatriate their people, while Germany said it was considering doing so. Exposure to a sneeze or cough from an infected person appeared to be the main transmission mode, Chinese infectious disease experts told reporters on Tuesday. To prevent huge numbers of people coming into close contact with each other, China has imposed tight transport restrictions in other parts of the country. In the latest move, state-owned China Railway Group announced on Tuesday that it would suspend hundreds of train lines throughout the country. China already has extended the Lunar New Year national holiday into next week to keep people at home. And the education ministry on Tuesday said the spring semester for schools and universities would be postponed, giving no resumption date. Death toll climbs Despite the unprecedented measures, the virus has showed little sign of slowing down. The National Health Commission on Tuesday announced 26 new deaths, bringing the nationwide total to 106. Confirmed infections also nearly doubled compared to Monday, to 4,515. Nearly 7,000 more cases are suspected and awaiting confirmation. On Monday, the first infections were confirmed in Germany, Canada and Sri Lanka. Colombo followed up by imposing new visa restrictions on Chinese visitors to the island. President Donald Trump said the United States has offered Beijing ""any help that is necessary"" in combatting the virus. But the United States, Turkey and Germany were among nations urging their citizens to ""reconsider"" all travel to China. Landlocked Mongolia – which is heavily dependent on trade with China – took the drastic step of closing the border with its huge neighbor to cars, while banning large gatherings and suspending classes. Fighting spirit Medical facilities have been overwhelmed in Wuhan, which has become a near ghost town. China has deployed hundreds of military medics to help and is building two field hospitals, aiming to finish them in just 10 days. Hundreds of masked workers toiled around the clock at one site, where a foundation was already taking shape and electrical switchboards were up. ""We have to work fast to combat the epidemic,"" a worker in his 30s, told AFP. Pacey, the British teacher, said he and other foreign friends in Wuhan were in contact via chat groups ""to keep each other's spirits up."" He was rationing what food he had and hopes for a UK-organised evacuation, but complained that his government has been unresponsive. ""Things here are going to get worse, and I feel that China should be able to deal with their own citizens and not have me needing extra help,"" he said. But Wuhan's people, who have a reputation in China for resilience, sought to project a fighting spirit. Quarantined residents shouted ""Go Wuhan"" from towering apartment blocks, according to videos posted online. A building lit up the night sky late on Monday with those words in red. The World Health Organization last week stopped short of declaring the outbreak a global emergency, which could have prompted a more aggressive international response such as travel restrictions.

The World Dream cruise ship arrived in Manila from Hong Kong on Tuesday. Its 778 passengers were ""authorized to travel"" by the BOQ. They were originally scheduled to board the ship again on Tuesday night to travel to Subic Bay for a tour on Wednesday, January 29. However, Olongapo City Mayor Rolen Paulino Jr and Subic Mayor Jonathan John Khonghun both asked the Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority to stop admitting cruise ships because of the threat of the novel coronavirus. In Olongapo City, which faces Subic Bay, groups rallied to protest the arrival of cruise ships, worried it would put them at risk of exposure to the virus. Coast guard spokesperson Captain Armand Balilo said the World Dream's Subic tour has been canceled, and the cruise ship will sail back to Hong Kong on Wednesday. The other vessel, the cargo ship MV Ligulao, arrived in Manila from Lianyungang, Jiangsu, in mainland China on Monday, January 27. Although the BOQ declared the ship's 20 crew members free of the novel coronavirus, they were not allowed to disembark because they had no shore passes. The MV Ligulao is expected to leave Manila on Tuesday afternoon. Officials from the BOQ ran ""mandatory inspections"" of both vessels' crew and passengers, the coast guard said. When asked how the BOQ concluded that the people aboard the ship were free of the virus given that its carriers may not show any symptoms, the coast guard did not give an immediate answer.

Authorities also ordered schools and universities to remain closed on Tuesday after extending a national holiday by a week in a bid to contain an outbreak that has already killed more than 100 people and spread to a dozen countries. Earlier the government shuttered major tourist attractions from Disneyland to a stretch of the Great Wall and rolled out draconian transport restrictions in areas worst affected by the virus. Here is a rundown of the measures taken so far in an unprecedented effort: Millions under lockdown More than 56 million people are subject to travel curbs in Hubei province, where the virus was first detected. Public transport has been stopped in 18 cities there, with train stations shut, events cancelled and theatres, libraries and karaoke bars closed in some locations. The epicenter of the outbreak is provincial capital Wuhan, the biggest city on lockdown, where the government has halted all travel out of the Yangtze River metropolis of 11 million. Wuhan residents have been told to stay home and authorities have restricted car traffic in the city centre. Similar quarantine measures are being taken in nearby cities, with strict controls on weddings and funerals, temperature screenings for new arrivals, and the suspension of online taxi services. Travel restrictions Beijing, Shanghai and other megacities have suspended the entry and departure of long-distance bus services. More than 400 inter-province train services were cancelled – most until February 8-9 but some for weeks. China's immigration agency has also asked citizens to delay international travel to stop the virus from spreading elsewhere overseas. Authorities had already suspended both domestic and overseas Chinese group tours over the weekend. Tourists from Hubei in Haikou, capital of the island province of Hainan, were told by the city government they had to spend 14 days in a hotel for centralised medical observation, and were forbidden to leave.

Instead, public health officials asked China's 1.4 billion citizens to confine themselves at home until all is clear. Schools and universities across the country were ordered not to reopen until further notice on Tuesday, a day after the holiday break was extended to try and reduce the spread of the virus. Wuhan and Beijing had earlier cancelled public events that usually attract hundreds of thousands of people to temples during the New Year holiday. Attractions closed The historic Forbidden City – a sprawling imperial palace in Beijing and one of the country's most revered cultural sites – was closed from Saturday. Other famous landmarks including a section of the Great Wall, the Ming Tombs and Yinshan Pagoda are also not open to visitors. Tibet's Potala Palace was shut down on Monday. Disneyland theme parks in Shanghai and Hong Kong have closed down indefinitely. Women's Olympics football qualifiers scheduled for next week in Wuhan have been moved out of the country and will now be held in Sydney. China's film box-office earnings for Lunar New Year's Eve on Friday were just one-tenth of last year as people shunned crowds. US coffee chain Starbucks said it had shut all its stores in Hubei during the holiday break. Travel screenings China has ordered sterilization and ventilation at airports and bus stations, as well as inside planes and trains, while travellers are being screened for fever. Temperature screening checkpoints have been set up in hundreds of Chinese railway stations, according to state news agency Xinhua. Authorities have asked people to wash their hands regularly, avoid crowded places, get plenty of fresh air and wear protective face masks. City authorities in Wuhan have gone further and made it mandatory to wear masks in public places. A similar order was issued in southern Guangdong province, which has more than 110 million people. With people rushing to get masks at pharmacies and on popular websites, China's industry and information technology ministry vowed to increase supply. Two new hospitals Authorities in Wuhan are rushing to build two field hospitals by next week to ease pressure on medical facilities in the city that are struggling to handle a growing caseload. The first facility is expected to be operational by next Monday and will have a capacity of 1,000 beds spread over 25,000 square metres, according to state media. The second is slated to open two days later with 1,300 beds. Xinhua said the two new hospitals in Wuhan would be similar in size to the temporary facility built to tackle SARS in Beijing in 2003, when 650 people died from the disease in the mainland and Hong Kong. – Rappler.com "

Photo by Gelo Litonjua/Rappler MANILA, Philippines – The over 300 Filipinos in Hubei province in China, including around 150 who are in the provincial capital of Wuhan, the epicenter of the 2019-nCoV threat, may voluntarily come home, according to the Department of Health (DOH) and the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA). This decision comes after a meeting of the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases on Tuesday, January 28, that discussed the Philippine government’s measures to contain the current 2019-nCoV threat. As of posting, the virus has sickened 4,515 people and killed 106. All the deaths have so far been in China – 105 in Wuhan and 1 in Beijing. While cases are concentrated in China, the virus has spread to neighboring Asian countries, as well as, Europe, North America, and Australia. (READ: ’Novel coronavirus’ or 2019 nCoV: What we know so far) The city of Wuhan is currently on lockdown, but foreign nationals may be repatriated if their home countries order so, according to DFA Undersecretary Brigido Dulay, who was at the inter-agency task force meeting. The task force was led by the DOH, with the DFA, Department of the Interior and Local Government, Department of Labor and Employment, Civil Aeronautics Board, Overseas Workers Welfare Administration, and Philippine Overseas Employment Administration. “We have to work with Chinese authorities. Right now it’s hard to put a finger on how fast we can do it (repatriate Filipinos), but we hope to do it as quickly as possible,” Dulay said, adding that the repatriation may either be by air or by land. The task force is also discouraging “non-essential travel to China” while Chinese authorities scramble to contain the outbreak. It added that Filipinos who wish to stay in China should heed advisories from local health authorities and cooperate with efforts to quell the further spread of 2019-nCoV there. The DOH also advised overseas Filipinos in affected areas to avoid crowded places, use mask and gloves, and practice proper hygiene in order to reduce exposure to and transmission of said virus. Filipinos who are repatriated from Wuhan City and the rest of Hubei province will be put on quarantine for 14 days, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said. Duque added that the Philippine government was in constant communication with Chinese counterparts through the DFA. “We just have to make sure that we are to monitor the further developments,” he said. As of posting, there are no confirmed cases of the 2019-nCoV in the Philippines, but the DOH revealed that it is probing 24 foreign nationals who have shown symptoms of respiratory illness and have had histories of travel to Wuhan, China. The Bureau of Immigration has also “temporarily suspended” the visa upon arrival (VUA) procedure for Chinese tourists and businessmen due to the scare. But there is no policy barring Chinese nationals in general, so those who have other valid visas can still enter the Philippines. Asked whether the Philippines should bar from entering anyone flying in from countries with confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV, World Health Organization (WHO) Philippine country representative Rabindra Abeyasinghe said: “There is no justification for this. Certainly if there is evidence of clear, extensive transmission at a community level, that could be considered."" Abeyasinghe added that the primary measure at the moment is to monitor those showing symptoms, as well as those with history of travel to Wuhan. — Rappler.com "
250407,rappler,"January 28, 2020",Life & Health,Experts say China virus outbreak will last months at least,Agence France-Presse,"Researchers estimate the coronavirus will afflict a minimum of tens of thousands of people, lasting at least several months based on the first available data  FIGHTING THE VIRUS. Pedestrians wearing face masks cross a road during a Lunar New Year of the Rat public holiday in Hong Kong on January 27, 2020, as a preventative measure following a coronavirus outbreak which began in the Chinese city of Wuhan. Photo by Anthony Wallace/AFP ""The best case scenario, you would have something... where we go through the spring into the summer, and then it dies down,"" David Fisman, a professor at the University of Toronto who wrote an analysis of the virus for the International Society for Infectious Diseases, told AFP. ""It's not something that's going to end the next week or the next month,"" said Alessandro Vespignani, a professor at Northeastern University. He is part of a group of researchers that manages an online dashboard about the outbreak. Epidemiologists have no crystal ball. They have only piecemeal information on the new virus, which appeared in December. They use mathematical models to estimate the actual number of cases, as of the current date, and compare them to past outbreaks -- but many of their hypotheses remain uncertain. Until the past weekend, researchers thought that infected people were not contagious until they began exhibiting symptoms, such as fever, respiratory problems, and pneumonia. But Chinese authorities said Sunday they had established the opposite. (READ: ‘Novel coronavirus’ or 2019 nCoV: What we know so far) US health authorities said Monday they had not seen evidence that asymptomatic patients can infect other people. But if they can, this would definitely change the outbreak's dynamics. The first estimates for the length of the incubation period –about two weeks – are recent. Patience In recent days, multiple experts have calculated an important parameter for any outbreak: the basic reproduction number, or ""R0."" It represents the number of people contaminated by an infected person. Estimates range from 1.4 to 3.8, according to Fisman, figures that are considered moderate. That is only an average: some patients may infect many people, while others infect only a few. ""On its own, it isn't a reason to panic,"" said Maimuna Majumder, a researcher at Harvard University and at Boston Children's Hospital. She said the rate is 1.3 for seasonal flu (which has millions of cases per year) and between two and five for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which resulted in 8,000 cases and 774 deaths, the majority in mainland China and Hong Kong in 2002-2003. In comparison, the rate for measles ranges from 12 to 18. Quarantines and isolation measures, systematic hand washing and masks could help drive down the average number of infected people. If the rate falls below one, the epidemic will die down. But the effect of the control measures China has implemented won't be felt for another week or two, researchers say, based on the virus's cycle. ""The more we learn about it, the more it looks like SARS,"" said Fisman. ""SARS was controllable; hopefully this will be too. But we won't know for a few weeks."" ""It's going to be many weeks, probably months, and nobody knows where this will go,"" he added. The official number of cases is more than 4,000 in China, with more than 100 deaths, and some 50 confirmed infections outside the country. But the actual number of Chinese cases, including those not yet detected, is likely to be more than 25,000, said Vespignani, according to the analysis of the group coordinated by Northeastern. And researchers at the University of Hong Kong (HKU) estimate that the number of actual cases has currently passed 40,000. ""It's easy to get to twice or three times as much, even just in the city of Wuhan,"" the virus's epicenter, said Vespignani. ""If we start to have other larger areas affected, then those numbers are going to be much, much bigger."" He said he doesn't want to estimate the number of possible deaths. The mortality rate, until now, has hovered around three percent, but such rates have a tendency to fluctuate: they increase at the beginning as the most vulnerable patients die, then drop, and then rise again as others die. Again, only time will tell. – Rappler.com "

With tour groups from the mainland already suspended, the new measures blocking individual travelers will dramatically reduce the number of Chinese able to visit the semi-autonomous city.

Photo by Ben Nabong/Rappler MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – Since the outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus or nCoV,  false information about the deadly disease has also spread like a virus on a global scale. (READ: ‘Novel coronavirus’ or 2019 nCoV: What we know so far) Several fact-checking organizations that are signatory to Poynter's International Fact Checking Network (IFCN) collaborated to combat the disinformation on 2019-nCoV. (READ: Fact checkers worldwide team up to debunk false info about 2019-nCoV) The Philippines only confirmed on Thursday, January 30, its first case of 2019-nCoV. Rappler consolidated the list of coronavirus-related claims that we fact-checked. We also added the 3 biggest trends of misinformation from Poynter’s article published on Tuesday, January 28. Here are the false claims: 1. Claim: 'SARS' case reported in clinic at Shangri-La Plaza A chain message circulated on Tuesday, January 14, warning people to avoid going to Shangri-La Plaza, a mall in Mandaluyong City, because of a supposed case of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) reported in one of the mall's medical clinics. However, the Department of Health (DOH) and Healthway Medical both issued advisories denying the claim in the chain message. 2. Claim: Confirmed cases' of coronavirus at PBCom Tower in Makati “Confirmed cases” of the novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV were recorded at the Philippine Bank of Communications (PBCom) Tower in Makati City, according to a message that circulated Friday, January 24. Speaking to reporters on January 24, Health Undersecretary Eric Domingo maintained that there was still no confirmed case of the 2019-nCov in the Philippines on that day. The management of PBCom Tower also said there was “no truth” to the information. 3. Claim: 'Patient tested positive' for 2019-nCoV in Makati Medical Center A message saying a “patient tested positive” for the 2019 novel coronavirus (nCoV) at the Makati Medical Center circulated on messaging apps and social media platforms on Monday, January 27. The fact was, there was still no confirmed case of the 2019-nCoV in the Philippines as of January 28, according to the Department of Health (DOH). 4. Claim: Chinese patient in Alabang clinic, hospital tested ‘positive’ for coronavirus A screenshot of a text message that spread on Facebook claimed that there is a Chinese patient at the Hi-Precision Diagnostics clinic in Alabang who was tested positive for the novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV. In a press briefing on Tuesday, January 28, the Department of Health (DOH) announced that there was still no confirmed case of 2019-nCoV in the country. The patient at Asian Hospital and Medical Center in Alabang, Muntinlupa City is among the 24 persons under investigation (PUIs) for the possible 2019-nCoV infection. 5. Claim: Novel coronavirus a 'type of rabies' A Facebook post claimed that the 2019 novel coronavirus (nCoV) is a ""type of rabies"" that can be contracted by eating bats. In a press briefing on Tuesday, January 28, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III clarified that the 2019-nCoV belongs to the Coronaviridae family of viruses. Meanwhile, rabies is from Rhabdoviridae. 6. Claim: 2019-nCoV is created in laboratory; new vaccines are invented In the United States, social media posts falsely claimed that the 2019-nCoV was created in the laboratory and was patented to boost sales on the vaccine. The vaccine for the Wuhan virus was already invented and supposedly available in the market. But the truth is, there was no vaccine created yet at the time when the claim spread. According to the fact-checks done by US fact-checking organizations such as Lead Stories, Fact-Check.org and PolitiFact, the existing patent claimed by social media posts is related to the different viruses in the coronavirus family such as SARS. There is no current patent for the new virus. The same claim was also debunked by a group of fact-checkers in Brazil and Canada. 7. Claim: Drugs to treat patient with 2019-nCoV Since Taiwan is geographically near China, many false procedures were spread that supposedly could cure or prevent the 2019-nCoV. Different versions of the claim said salty water and acetic acid could prevent one from getting the Wuhan virus. Others said substances like steroids and ethanol could kill it. The Taiwan Fact-Checking Center said 2019-nCoV does not have approve vaccines and drugs to treat the disease during the time when the claim circulated. 8. Claim: 2019-nCoV comes from bat soup, laboratories False claims about the origin of the 2019-nCoV surfaced on social media and news cycles in countries like Brazil and the United Kingdom. Supposedly, the virus is linked to eating bat soup. However, there was no proof that supports the claim. It is still not clear which animals may have transmitted the virus to humans, according to Aos Fatos, a fact-checking unit in Brazil. Some fact-checkers also debunked the conspiracies that 2019-nCoV originated from laboratories in China. Italy-based fact-checking unit Pagella Politica found ""no evidence that the coronavirus 2019-nCoV was born in a China laboratory.” 9. Claim: Video of ""market in Wuhan, China"" Following the outbreak, a video of a market with wild animals like bats was shared on social media. The caption says it was taken in Wuhan, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak. However, outlets like Agencia Lupa in Brazil as well as Factly and Boom Factcheck in India showed that the market in the video is in Langowan, Indonesia. 10. Claim: “10,000 dead” in Wuhan Many online users shared a January 24 story of the Geller Report saying that 10,000 people have died in Wuhan, China, due to the coronavirus. News groups and fact checkers – like Politifact and FactCheck.org in the United States, Newtral in Spain, ColombiaCheck in Colombia, and Tempo in Indonesia – debunked this claim and raised questions on Geller Report's ""death toll."" They all pointed to the official numbers from Chinese authorities and the World Health Organization, which stand at only over 200 deaths as of this writing. 11. Claim: People “fainting” or “lying on the ground” due to coronavirus Various posts have popped up on social media showing people fainting, collapsing, or lying on the ground in China, supposedly due to the virus. However, many of these videos, as fact-checkers found out, are not related to the outbreak. For instance, a photo of people lying down on a road supposedly in China was a mass activity for an art project in Frankfurt, Germany, in March 2014 to commemorate the victims of concentration camps during World War II, according to Tempo (Indonesia), Agencia Lupa (Brazil), and Agence France-Presse. Videos showing security camera footage of individuals collapsing in China, Sri Lanka, and Malaysia, were not due to the coronavirus. The persons in these cases fainted due to an unrelated hospital incident, fatigue, and heart failure, respectively. – Rappler.com "

In this instance, the 33-year-old German attended a training session held by a visiting Chinese colleague on January 21 at the office of car parts supplier Webasto in Stockdorf, in Germany's southern Bavaria region. The Chinese woman ""started to feel sick on the flight home on January 23,"" said Andreas Zapf, head of the Bavarian State Office for Health and Food Safety. The German man tested positive for the virus on Monday evening, January 27, after reporting flu-like symptoms. He remains in hospital in an isolation ward, but Zapf said he ""was doing well."" A spokeswoman for the Robert Koch Institute, Germany's center for disease prevention and control, told Agence France-Presse the German case appeared to be the first instance of a ""human-to-human transmission"" outside Asia. Vietnam and Japan have also each reported a patient testing positive for the new coronavirus without having travelled to China. The Chinese woman working for Webasto immediately sought medical attention on her return to China. She was confirmed to have caught the virus, which has spread rapidly in recent weeks after first emerging in the Chinese city of Wuhan. The woman had recently visited her parents in the Wuhan region, Zapf said. In a statement, the Webasto company said it had halted all business travel to and from China ""for at least the next two weeks."" Health officials are checking some 40 people that the two infected workers have been in contact with recently, including colleagues and family members. The virus has so far killed 106 people and infected over 4,000 – the bulk of them in and around Wuhan. Cases have also been reported in a string of other countries, including the United States, France, Australia and Japan. – Rappler.com "

All photos from Randy Datu/Rappler ZAMBALES, Philippines – The Subic tour of cruise ship MV World Dream was canceled due to intense pressure from residents and local leaders for the Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority (SBMA) to temporarily stop accepting cruise ships amid the novel coronavirus scare.

""He advised that there is not a need just yet to stop the entry of cruise ships in Subic in view of established safety measures in the Freeport,"" she added. The SBMA initially highlighted the supposed loss of income that could occur if the arrival of cruise ships was rejected, but this only angered residents even more. ""As an emerging cruise ship destination in Southeast Asia, Subic expects to be adversely affected by this ongoing health emergency,"" Eisma earlier said. Eisma was also in the habit of asking SBMA employees to physically welcome passengers of cruise ships at the dock upon their arrival, but none were willing this time. A rumor even circulated that SBMA tourism employees would not report for work if the cruise ship was allowed to dock. On Tuesday, as the uproar from residents and Subic workers grew, Paulino pleaded with Eisma to ""please err on the side of caution and put primacy in the health and safety of the residents and workers of SBFZ (Subic Bay Freeport Zone) and the city and municipalities surrounding it."" Subic Mayor Jonathan John Khonghun also sent a letter to Eisma, saying ""let us join hands to be more cautious, giving priority to the health and safety of the people in our locality.""  'ERR ON SIDE OF CAUTION.' Olongapo City Mayor Rolen Paulino Jr joins the rally. Photo from Randy Datu/Rappler Backlash It was also reported that tourism establishments in the Subic Freeport were pushing behind the scenes and working with the Subic Bay Freeport Chamber of Commerce to temporarily suspend the arrival of cruise ships. Robert Gonzaga, president and CEO of Subic Bay Marine Exploratorium Inc (SBMEI), said in a statement: ""The SBMA has issued guidelines on how to deal with this, but they should do more to address the core issue of a temporary ban on cruise ship visits. For our part, we will refuse access to our park to cruise ship visitors if they do not comply with SBMA guidelines, and our [government's] health and safety policies."" SBMEI is the corporate owner and operator of Ocean Adventure, Adventure Beach Waterpark, and Camayan Beach Resort and Hotel – top attractions in the Freeport. Gonzaga said that more important considerations should be prioritized over short-term income. ""We have put in place several measures to protect our guests, as well as our employees, from any health risk associated with the coronavirus. We want to reassure the public that safety comes first, last, and always for SBMEI,"" he added. The backlash to Eisma's stance on the issue culminated in a rally in front of the main gate of the Subic Freeport, where about 200 residents and Freeport workers brandished signs that read: ""No to cruise ships in the meantime,"" ""Konting malasakit naman SBMA,"" and ""Mas mahalaga ba ang kita kesa sa kaligtasan ng mamamayan ng Olongapo?"" While the rally was ongoing, cheers went up as news broke that the MV World Dream has decided to cancel its visit to Subic. For her part, Eisma immediately took to Facebook and posted a statement saying, in part, that the cruise visit ""has been canceled by Genting Cruise Lines, the operator of the cruise liner, in face of the circumstances on the ground."" She said that the Subic Bay Freeport community can ""breathe a sigh of relief in the outcome that, we hope, is acceptable and satisfactory to all."" Despite this announcement, however, the SBMA is still silent on whether or not a temporary ban on cruise ships is already in place in the Subic Bay Freeport. Among the groups that exerted pressure on the SBMA were Batang Gapo People's Organization Incorporated, Olongapo City local government units, Aeta leaders, all 17 barangay captains, and other people's organizations. ""Why would we put ourselves in harm's way if we can prevent it? If in their own country, they have already implemented a lockdown, why can't we do the same here?"" Barangay Gordon Heights Captain Priscilla Echie Ponge, one of the 17 barangay captains, said. – Rappler.com "

World Health Organization Director General Tedros Adhanom (L) shakes hands with Chinese President Xi Jinping before a meeting at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on January 28, 2020. Photo by Naohiko Hatta/AFP WUHAN, China – President Xi Jinping said Tuesday, January 28, China was in a struggle against a ""demon"" epidemic, as the death toll from the new SARS-like virus soared to 106 and the first cases of human-to-human contagion were detected abroad. Xi made his remarks during talks with head of the World Health Organization in Beijing as a host of nations prepared to airlift their citizens from Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak. ""Chinese people are currently engaged in a serious struggle against an epidemic of a new type of coronavirus infection,"" Xi told WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. ""The epidemic is a demon, and we cannot let this demon hide,"" the Chinese leader said, pledging that the government would be transparent and release information on the virus in a ""timely"" manner. His comments came after anger simmered on Chinese social media over the handling of the health emergency by local officials in central Hubei province, where the disease first emerged in December. Some experts have praised Beijing for being more reactive and open about this virus compared to its handling of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic of 2002-2003. But others say local cadres had earlier been more focused on projecting stability than responding to the outbreak when it began to spread earlier this month. Since then, the number of cases has soared – doubling to more than 4,500 in the past 24 hours. WHO chief Tedros praised China's response to the crisis during a meeting with Foreign Minister Wang Yi, according to state news agency Xinhua. Contagion abroad The WHO last week stopped short of declaring the outbreak a global emergency, which could have prompted a more aggressive international response such as travel restrictions. But global concern has been growing, with Japan and Germany on Tuesday reporting the first human-to-human infections outside China. Until now, all cases in more than a dozen countries involved people who had been in or around Wuhan. In Japan, a man in his 60s contracted the virus apparently after driving two groups of tourists from the city earlier in January, the health ministry said. He was hospitalized with flu-like symptoms on Saturday, January 25. On the other side of the world, a 33-year-old German man caught the disease off a Chinese colleague from Shanghai who visited Germany last week, according to health officials. The development came after countries including Sri Lanka, Malaysia and the Philippines announced tighter visa restrictions for people coming from China. Experts believe the virus came from a wild animal market in Wuhan and then jumped to humans, with Chinese health officials saying Tuesday that people infect each other through sneezing or coughing, and possibly through contact. Authorities initially sealed off Wuhan and other cities in Hubei province late last week, trapping more than 50 million people. China then halted international and domestic group tours. It also imposed a wide range of travel restrictions inside China, suspending long-distance bus routes and more than 2,000 train services. But with the death toll climbing and more fatalities reported in Chinese cities far away from Wuhan, authorities on Tuesday urged people to delay any foreign travel ""to protect the health and safety of Chinese and foreign people,"" the National Immigration Administration said. Escape plans Wuhan, meanwhile, has been turned into a near ghost-town under a lockdown that has largely confined the industrial hub's 11 million people to their homes. With a ban on car traffic, the streets were nearly deserted apart from the occasional ambulance – although the city's hospitals are overwhelmed. ""Everyone goes out wearing masks and they are worried about the infection,"" said David, a Chinese man who works in Shanghai but ended up trapped in Wuhan after it was put under quarantine. Many thousands of foreigners are also among those stuck in the city. ""It's deeply stressful,"" Joseph Pacey, a 31-year-old Briton who teaches English in Wuhan, told Agence France-Presse. ""The biggest fear for me is that this thing will go on for months, and it will get harder and harder to get supplies, and to live."" Japan said it would send a chartered flight on Tuesday evening to get about a third of its 650 nationals there. ""We will also bring aid supplies such as masks and protective suits for Chinese people as well as for Japanese nationals,"" Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi said in Tokyo. If the mission succeeds, Japan would be the first country to airlift its citizens out of Wuhan. A US-chartered flight bound for California is scheduled to leave Wuhan on Wednesday, January 29, with consular staff and some American citizens, a day later than previously planned. France and South Korea are also planning to fly out their citizens later this week, and several other countries, including Germany, were considering doing the same. The United States, Turkey and Germany have urged their citizens to ""reconsider"" all travel to China. Landlocked Mongolia – which is heavily dependent on trade with China – took the drastic step of closing the border with its huge neighbor to cars, as well as shutting down schools and banning large gatherings. – Rappler.com "

The Provincial Health Office of Aklan says it is coordinating with the health department and the Bureau of Quarantine in monitoring arriving passengers at ports and airports in the province. Photo by Boy Ryan Zabal/Rappler AKLAN, Philippines – Eleven Chinese tourists – 7 adults and 4 children – tracked down in a resort on Boracay Island are under medical observation by the Provincial Health Office (PHO) of Aklan for possible exposure to the novel coronavirus. Four of them were in close contact with an infected coronavirus patient in Hong Kong, Provincial Health Officer I Dr. Cornelio Cuachon Jr said on Tuesday, January 28. The 11 Chinese nationals from Hubei province were supposed to spend a one-month vacation in Boracay when Hong Kong authorities alerted the Philippine health officials to conduct intensive contact-tracing. Hubei has been on lockdown, limiting the movements of some 60 million people, since the new coronavirus broke out in its capital city of Wuhan last December. The tourists traveled from Hong Kong to Kalibo via Manila on January 22. Seven other Chinese people were traced by health authorities in close contacts with the 4 Chinese tourists in Boracay Island. It was not immediately known if the 4 Chinese who were in close contact with a confirmed case in Hong Kong were the family who landed in Manila on January 22 via Cebu Pacific, and which the Bureau of Immigration was supposed to have already tracked. The patients were transported to Kalibo town on Friday evening, January 24, for medical observation. They are staying in hotel rooms at the government-run Governor Corazon L. Cabagnot Tourism and Training Center in Old Buswang, Kalibo Old Buswang, Kalibo for the next 14 days. Cuachon emphasized there is still no confirmed cases of 2019-nCov in the province of Aklan and in the Philippines. ""They had no flu-like symptoms, no cough or fever. They are made to stay at the training center because they might be at risk of hospital acquired-pneumonia if we admitted them. The 4 Chinese tourists had close contacts with one confirmed coronavirus patient in Hong Kong. The 7 other Chinese who are with these 4 in Boracay are also under medical observation,"" Cuachon said in a mix of English and Filipino. “We are monitoring them every day. After the 14-day incubation period, they will be allowed to go back to China, with the help of the Chinese embassy, and will have to cut short their vacation in Boracay,” Cuachon added. 3 earlier patients discharged Meanwhile, the 3 patients were discharged from isolation rooms at the Dr. Rafael S. Tumbokon Memorial Hospital (DRSTMH) in Kalibo were discharged by attending doctors on January 28. A 6-year-old boy initially admitted in the Dr. Ciriaco H. Tirol Hospital in Boracay Island was referred to the Aklan provincial hospital on January 23 for exhibiting flu-like symptoms. Cuachon said the child, who had a history of travel to Wuhan in Hubei province, yielded negative results on coronavirus infection, based on tests conducted by the Philippines Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM). “He had influenza, not novel coronavirus,” Cuachon said. Sample specimens were also taken from two female siblings, aged 8 and 6, from Shanghai, China, who had been admitted to the Aklan provincial hospital on January 26. These were sent to RITM for confirmatory tests. In efforts to keep coronavirus from spreading, PHO-Aklan is coordinating with the Department of Health and the Bureau of Quarantine in monitoring the arrival of passengers in ports and airports in the province. Cuachon urged the public to avoid contact with farm and wild animals, going to crowded places, and contact with sick individuals. On Saturday, January 25, Aklan health authorities sent back to Wuhan 80 Boracay-bound tourists. They were part of the group which left the epicenter city a few hours before it was locked down by Chinese authorities. Since December 2019, the Wuhan coronavirus has been reported in China, France, Australia, Vietnam, South Korea, Singapore, Nepal, Germany, Japan, Macau, Thailand, Taiwan, Malaysia, Canada, Hong Kong, United States, and Sri Lanka.

Photo by Noel Celis/AFP SYDNEY, Australia – Scientists in Australia have successfully replicated the deadly Wuhan coronavirus, in what they said would be a ""game changer"" in the fight against a deadly epidemic which has stricken thousands. The Doherty Institute in Melbourne announced Wednesday, January 29 that it had grown the novel coronavirus in cell culture from a patient sample, the first time the virus has been replicated outside China. ""Having the real virus means we now have the ability to actually validate and verify all test methods, and compare their sensitivities and specificities,"" virus identification laboratory head Julian Druce said. ""It will be a game changer for diagnosis."" China was quick to sequence the genome of the coronavirus and make it public, allowing scientists around the world to develop diagnostic tools and winning praise for its efforts, in contrast to the SARS outbreak of 2002-2003. However, China has not shared the virus itself with laboratories worldwide – which the Australian lab will now do via the World Health Organization (WHO) – though the WHO announced Tuesday, January 28 that Beijing had agreed to allow a team of international experts into the country to work with their Chinese counterparts. Doherty Institute deputy director Mike Catton said the new finding meant scientists could now create an antibody test that would allow the coronavirus to be detected in patients who had not displayed any symptoms. ""An antibody test will enable us to retrospectively test suspected patients so we can gather a more accurate picture of how widespread the virus is, and consequently, among other things, the true mortality rate,"" he said. ""It will also assist in the assessment of effectiveness of trial vaccines."" Governments, universities, and medical corporations worldwide are racing to develop a vaccine against the coronavirus, a process that could take months. The virus, which is believed to have originated in a wild-animal market in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, has infected more than 4,500 people in China and killed more than 100.

Concern over the steadily expanding contagion, which has killed over 100 in China and sickened more than 4,500, is prompting an increasingly urgent push for protection. Hong Kong, which has 8 reported cases of the SARS-like disease, announced the sealing of 6 of its 14 border crossings to the mainland from Thursday, January 29. The government in the semi-autonomous Chinese city of 7 million had faced criticism for merely barring people from the outbreak's ground-zero, central Hubei province. ""The epidemic has spread to many Chinese provinces. Only blocking visitors from Hubei can't do much to help Hong Kong,"" lawmaker Helena Wong said. Singapore, with 7 confirmed cases of the virus, has announced it will ban visitors who have traveled to Hubei as well as those with passports issued in that Chinese province. Government official Lawrence Wong said the travel restrictions were not taken lightly and will be expanded if necessary. Officials said efforts are also underway to track down an estimated 2,000 people already in Singapore with a Hubei travel history for potenital quarantine. Mongolia has taken a much more drastic line, closing its entire border with China to pedestrians and cars as well as ordering schools to close. It has no reported cases. In Russia's Far-Eastern district, which shares some 4,500 kilometers (2,800 miles) of frontier with China, crossings that should have re-opened after Chinese New Year will stay closed for days or weeks. Corralling the disease has become an effort at containing people's movements, and both Malaysia and the Philippines have taken steps to squelch the flow of Chinese visitors. Manila has been issuing visas on arrival since 2017 to Chinese nationals, adding fuel to the boom in mainland visitors to the Philippines. That policy is now suspended, though Chinese can still apply for a visa at a consulate or embassy in their home nation. 'Avoid people gathering' ""We are taking this proactive measure to slow down travel, and possibly help prevent the entry (of the virus),"" said Jaime Morente, immigration commissioner in the Philippines, which has no confirmed cases.

The outbreak is sending shock waves through Asia's tourism industry, which has become increasingly reliant on growing numbers of Chinese visitors. The measures come amid a boom in Chinese foreign travel, with the number of tourists from the country increasing nearly tenfold since 2003, according to a report by research firm Capital Economics. China has already imposed wide-ranging travel restrictions across the country and halted international tours, but on Tuesday called for all overseas travel to be postponed.

Rappler is taking part in the initiative. The International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN) launched the collaborative project on Friday, January 24. So far, the 3 biggest trends of misinformation and disinformation that have spread online are: ""The collaborative project, coordinated by the IFCN, will be active for as long as the disease spreads worldwide and can be followed on social media channels through two hashtags, #CoronaVirusFacts and #DatosCoronaVirus,"" IFCN associate director Cristina Tardáguila wrote in her article published on Poynter on Tuesday, January 28. IFCN said the ""first big wave of misinformation"" was about a patent of the virus created a few years ago. Among the organizations that fact checked this were US-based Lead Stories, Fact-Check.org, and PolitiFact. Following this, the Taiwan Fact-Check Center then debunked several posts about ways to protect people from the virus, as well as methods to cure the ones who have contracted it. Since Taiwan is geographically close to China, this ""second wave of falsehoods"" became big there, IFCN said. The ""third wave of hoaxes"" was about the sources of the novel coronavirus. Although there are studies that suggest bats and snakes play a role in the outbreak, the origin hasn't been confirmed yet as of posting. ""In the next few days, an interesting subject should pop up: Will the anti-vaccination movement try to take any advantage out of this? Brazilian fact-checking unit Agência Lupa is keeping track of that,"" Tardáguila added. In the Philippines, Rappler has also debunked a number of false claims about the 2019-nCoV. So far, the false claims that circulated nationwide were mostly about ""confirmed cases"" of the 2019-nCoV in the country. There was also a claim that wrongly associated the novel coronavirus with rabies, which may cause confusion about the nature and classification of the new illness. The 2019-nCoV first emerged in December 2019 in the city of Wuhan, a major transport hub in China that has a population of 11 million. Since it is a new strain of coronavirus, much is still unknown about it.

In this file photo taken on January 22, 2020 passengers wear protective masks to protect against the spread of the coronavirus as they arrive at the Los Angeles International Airport, California. Photo by Mark Ralston/AFP WUHAN, China – Hundreds of Americans and Japanese escaped the quarantined Chinese city at the center of a coronavirus epidemic aboard charter flights on Wednesday, January 29, as the death toll soared to 132 and confirmed infections neared 6,000. The scale of the deepening crisis was emphasized with the new infection number on the Chinese mainland exceeding that of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2002-03. SARS, another respiratory coronavirus transmitted between people, went on to claim nearly 800 lives around the world, with most of those fatalities in mainland China and Hong Kong. The new disease has spread to more than 15 countries since it emerged out of Wuhan late last year, although all the confirmed fatalities have so far been in China. (READ: PH repatriating Filipinos in Wuhan, Hubei province who want to return home) Authorities last week imposed transport bans in and around Wuhan in an unprecedented quarantine effort, leaving more than 50 million people effectively trapped. ""We were not able to move freely, so we only had partial information,"" said Takeo Aoyama, a Nippon Steel worker who was among the Japanese nationals airlifted early Wednesday. ""The number of patients began increasing rapidly at a certain point. That was very worrying."" China has taken other extraordinary measures to try and stop the disease spreading, including bans on tour groups travelling overseas, suspending schools and extending the Lunar New Year holiday. With global concerns mounting, the United States, Britain and other countries have also advised their citizens against travelling to China. (READ: PH suspends visa issuance for travelers from Hubei over coronavirus scare) Escape Thousands of foreigners have been among those trapped in Wuhan, which has become a near ghost-town with car travel banned and residents staying indoors. Countries have for days been scrambling to try and get their citizens out of Wuhan safely, but have faced huge logistical, medical and bureaucratic hurdles. About 200 people were aboard the Japanese flight which landed in Tokyo on Wednesday morning. Medical professionals were on the plane to carry out checks but Japan's health ministry said there were no plans to quarantine the passengers. They would instead be asked to remain at home and avoid crowds at least until the results of the test were known. A US charter flight also left Wuhan on Wednesday with about 200 Americans on board, including employees from the local American consulate. The European Union will fly its citizens out aboard two French planes this week, and South Korea is due to do the same. Australia said it would evacuate citizens from Wuhan and quarantine them on an island normally used to detain asylum seekers. More deaths Meanwhile, the virus continued to spread and kill in China. Authorities said Wednesday the number of cases in Hubei province, the epicenter of the virus of which Wuhan is the capital, soared by over 800 from the previous day. The number of confirmed cases across the country climbed to 5,974, while the death toll nationwide jumped 26 to 132. All of those new reported deaths were in Hubei except for one, in a province just to the north. The virus is believed to have originated in a wild-animal market in Wuhan, where it jumped to humans before spreading across the country as the peak travel period for Lunar New Year festivities got under way. Chinese President Xi Jinping on Tuesday, January 28, branded the virus a ""demon"", as he held talks with World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. The WHO later said it would send urgently dispatch international experts to China ""to guide global response efforts"". ""Stopping the spread of this virus both in China and globally is WHO's highest priority,"" Tedros said. Until Tuesday, all reported cases in more than a dozen countries had involved people who had been in or around Wuhan. But Japan and Germany then reported the first confirmed human-to-human transmission of the illness outside China. Vietnam is investigating another case. Germany now has 4 confirmed cases, all of them employees at a Bavarian firm recently visited by a Chinese colleague, health officials said. Some experts have praised Beijing for being more reactive and open about the new virus compared with its handling of the 2002-03 SARS epidemic. But others say local officials had earlier been more focused on projecting stability than responding to the outbreak when it began to spread earlier this month. The US asked China on Tuesday to step up its cooperation with international health authorities over the epidemic. Washington has offered China assistance 3 times so far without success, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar told reporters. Separately, US health authorities said they were working on a vaccine, but that it would take months to develop. The virus has rattled global markets and threatens to dent an already-slowing Chinese economy. Apple was closely watching the outbreak in China, home to the firm's third-biggest consumer market and much of its supply chain, chief executive Tim Cook said in an earnings call. Global coffee chain Starbucks said it expected a significant earnings hit after closing more than half of its stores across China. US Federal Reserve chief Jerome Powell is likely to be quizzed about the economic impact of the virus after the bank's monthly interest rate decision on Wednesday. – Rappler.com  "

DOH Francisco Duque III says the Philippine government is still studying imposing a temporary travel ban against Chinese tourists. Photo by Darren Langit/Rappler MANILA, Philippines – The Philippine government is not yet considering imposing a temporary travel ban on all tourists coming from mainland China amid the threat of the novel coronavirus or 2019-nCov. This was Health Secretary Francisco Duque III’s response on Wednesday, January 29, when asked by Deputy Speaker Loren Legarda during the House of Representatives’ question hour if they were considering a temporary ban on all Chinese tourists. “Certainly thats one of the possible options that we are looking at, but not at this very moment. The reason being, your honor, is we have to be very careful also of possible repercussions of doing this, in light of the fact that confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus are not limited to China,” Duque said. The Department of Health (DOH) chief argued it would be unfair if only Chinese tourists are barred from entering the Philippines, when cases of 2019-nCov have also been confirmed in other countries. “If we do this, then the concerned country – China in this case – might question why we’re not doing the same for all other countries that have reported cases of the new coronavirus. It’s very tricky… but we commit to take this into consideration,” Duque said. The Philippines has only temporarily stopped issuing visas to travelers from Hubei province in China, whose capital city of Wuhan is the origin of the novel coronavirus. As of Wednesday, China has a total of 5,974 confirmed cases of the 2019-nCov, which has killed at least 106 people there. Apart from China, other countries that have confirmed cases of 2019 nCov include France, Japan, Australia, United States, Canada, Malaysia, Nepal, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, Vietnam, and United Arab Emirates. More ‘prudent’ to temporarily ban Chinese Contrasting with the DOH chief, Legarda believes it would be more “prudent” for the Philippines to impose the temporary travel ban against mainlander Chinese. “We’re clearly incapable of handling [this] crisis. Wouldn’t it be prudent [for us] to be proactive and ban temporarily mainland tourists in any port, not only Wuhan?” asked the Antique congresswoman. “I just value too much the health of the Filipino people,” Legarda added. Senator Francis Pangilinan, who wants a temporary ban against Chinese tourists like Legarda, said a total of 1,626,309 mainlanders visited the Philippines from January to November 2019 alone. “The progressive spread of the coronavirus and the increasing number of deaths due to it should prompt Philippine health and immigration authorities to preemptively ban visitors from Wuhan, if not from the most affected provinces of China,” Pangilinan said in a separate statement. The Philippines still has no confirmed case of the novel coronavirus, though 23 persons with flu-like symptoms are still under observation by the DOH. – Rappler.com "

The evacuees will be monitored for symptoms and sent to local hospitals if they are found to be ill, the Pentagon said. More than 200 Japanese nationals were brought home Wednesday, but only a handful of them were hospitalized for tests after they reported they felt unwell or showed flu-like symptoms. Some 250 French citizens and 100 other Europeans will be flown out of Wuhan on board two French planes this week. Australia plans to house any citizens evacuated on an island normally used to detain asylum seekers. A growing number of governments – including the United States, Britain and Germany – have advised their citizens to avoid non-essential travel to China. China has urged its own citizens to delay trips abroad, with more than 15 other countries having confirmed cases of the disease, including 3 with cases of human-to-human transmission. Flights scrapped, stores closed British Airways was the first major airline to announce a suspension of flights to and from China, citing the travel advice of Britain's foreign office. Many others followed suit, including German flag carrier Lufthansa, which said all flights to mainland China would be suspended until February 9. Others pared back their service, like American Airlines, KLM, and United. Hong Kong-based Cathay Pacific has reduced flights, citing low demand and the city government's response plan to the virus. In one of the most dramatic measures, the Pacific nation of Papua New Guinea announced no travellers from Asia would be allowed in. ""Although the numbers outside China are still relatively small, they hold the potential for a much larger outbreak,"" Tedros said. 'I need to buy food' China has effectively cut off Hubei province to try to contain the spread of the virus, banned tour groups from traveling overseas, suspended classes and extended the Lunar New Year holiday. Most street traffic in and around Wuhan – where the virus originated in a wild animal market – has been banned, leaving more than 50 million people shuttered in their homes. ""This is the first day since the lockdown that I've had to go out,"" a man in his 50s told AFP on the mostly deserted streets of the industrial city on Wednesday. ""I have no choice because I need to buy food."" The number of confirmed cases across China climbed to 5,974, while the death toll nationwide jumped to 132. The scale of the deepening crisis was emphasized with the total number of infections on the Chinese mainland exceeding that of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak of 2002-03. But the death toll is so far much lower than SARS, which claimed nearly 800 lives around the world –  with most fatalities in mainland China and Hong Kong. Economic pain The virus has rattled global markets and started to dent the Chinese economy. Japanese automaker Toyota said it would keep its plants in China closed until at least February 9. Swedish furniture giant IKEA will temporarily close half of its 30 stores on the mainland. Tech giant Foxconn said Wednesday that Taiwan staff at its vast network of factories in China do not need to return to work until mid-February, a move threatening supply chains for everything from iPhones to flat-screen TVs and laptops. US fast food giant McDonald's said it had closed all its locations – ""several hundred"" restaurants – in Hubei. – Rappler.com "

In this photo taken on January 25, 2020, medical staff wearing protective clothing arrive with a patient at the Wuhan Red Cross Hospital in Wuhan. Photo by Hector Retamal/AFP WUHAN, China (UPDATED) – China reported its biggest single-day jump in novel coronavirus deaths on Thursday, January 30, as confirmation that 3 Japanese evacuated from the outbreak's epicenter were infected deepened fears about a global contagion. The World Health Organization, which initially downplayed the severity of a disease that has now killed 170 nationwide, warned all governments to be ""on alert"" as it weighed whether to declare a global health emergency. As foreign countries evacuated their citizens from Wuhan, the locked-down city where the virus was first detected, concern over the economic impact has steadily intensified. Airlines have suspended services to China and companies from Starbucks to Tesla have shuttered stores and production lines. Chinese authorities have taken extraordinary steps to arrest the virus's spread, including effectively locking down more than 50 million people in Wuhan and surrounding Hubei province. But that was yet to pay dividends, with the government reporting 38 new deaths in the 24 hours to Thursday, the highest one-day total. All but one were in Hubei. The number of confirmed new cases also grew steadily to 7,711, the National Health Commission said. Another 81,000 people were under observation for possible infection. The pathogen is believed to have been spawned in a market that sold wild game, spreading far and wide by a Lunar New Year holiday season in which hundreds of millions of Chinese travel domestically or abroad. 'Totally new situation' Japan's infection rate grew to 11 after 3 Japanese citizens among more than 200 on an evacuation flight Wednesday, January 29, tested positive. Officials had already confirmed two cases in which patients tested positive without having travelled to China, adding to anxiety over human-to-human transmission of the respiratory disease. ""We are in a truly new situation,"" Health Minister Katsunobu Kato told parliament. The fact that 2 of the 3 new confirmed Japanese cases showed no symptoms underscored the scale of the challenge for health workers. The WHO has come under fire after it last week declined to declare a global health emergency. The global health body's chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus expressed regret for what he called a ""human error"" in the WHO's assessment. WHO's Emergency Committee will meet Thursday to decide whether to declare an emergency – which could lead to travel or trade barriers. ""The whole world needs to take action,"" Michael Ryan, head of the WHO Health Emergencies Programme, told reporters in Geneva. A US charter flight from Wuhan arrived Wednesday at a California military base with nearly 200 consular staff and other Americans, who ""cheered loudly"" when the jet touched down, said an official with US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. All passengers were declared symptom-free but will remain isolated for days while they are monitored. Some 250 French citizens and 100 other Europeans will be flown out of Wuhan on board two French planes this week. Australia plans to house any citizens it evacuates from the city on an island normally used to detain asylum seekers. A growing number of governments – including the United States, Britain and Germany – have advised their citizens to avoid non-essential travel to China. China also has urged its own citizens to delay trips abroad, after more than 15 countries confirmed infections. Flights scrapped, stores closed Major airlines that have suspended or pared back service to China include British Airways, German flag carrier Lufthansa, American Airlines, KLM, and United. China efforts to halt the virus have seen the suspension of classes nationwide and an extension of the Lunar New Year holiday. Most street traffic in and around Wuhan has been banned. ""This is the first day since the lockdown that I've had to go out,"" a man in his 50s told Agence France-Presse on the mostly deserted streets of the industrial city. ""I have no choice because I need to buy food."" China's football body meanwhile said it was postponing ""all levels and all types of football matches across the country,"" including the country's top-tier Chinese Super League, in response to the outbreak. Economic worries Japanese automaker Toyota, Swedish furniture giant IKEA, tech giant Foxconn, Starbucks, Tesla and McDonald's were among major corporate giants to temporarily freeze production or close large numbers of outlets in China. As the ""world's factory,"" the disruptions in China are expected to send ripples through supply chains globally, denting profits. US Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said the new coronavirus posed a fresh risk to a fragile world economy, adding that the US central bank was on alert. ""There will clearly be implications at least in the near term for Chinese output and I would guess for some of their close neighbors,"" Powell said. The contagion has spread to nearly every corner of China, with remote Tibet reporting its first case on Thursday. It has triggered fears in part due to its striking similarity to the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak of 2002-03, which also began in China and eventually killed nearly 800 people worldwide. – Rappler.com "

The novel coronavirus outbreak traced to the provincial capital Wuhan in central China has killed  more than 130 people and infected nearly 6,000 people across the country. That has prompted factories and businesses to close, airlines to cancel flights to the country, and governments to discourage travel to China.

While admitting that the estimate is ""imprecise,"" the Chinese team behind a paper published in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) on Wednesday, January 29 said their findings support a 14-day medical observation period for people exposed to the pathogen. The World Health Organization said in an update Monday, January 27 that the incubation period ranged from between two and 10 days before symptoms like fever, cough, shortness of breath, and acute respiratory distress emerged. (READ: WHO calls world to action on China virus ahead of crisis talks) The incubation period estimate in the new study was based on 10 patients. The researchers also studied the virus's first 425 patients in order to establish two other fundamental characteristics of the outbreak. Since it first emerged in Wuhan in December, the number of cases of the 2019 novel coronavirus doubled every 7.4 days, the researchers wrote. They also estimated that each infected person then infected an average of 2.2 other people, a figure known as the basic reproductive number, or R0 (pronounced ""R-naught""). The figure doesn't predict how big an epidemic will eventually be, but is a useful measure nonetheless. In this case, it is relatively low: close to the seasonal flu (around 1.3), much less than the measles (12 or higher), and comparable to the SARS-epidemic of 2002-2003 (3). The team also found that human-to-human transmission had been occurring among close contacts since the middle of December 2019. The Chinese findings echo research by a team in the Netherlands that found an incubation period of 5.8 days, with large variations. – Rappler.com And a 27-year-old Vietnamese man who was infected by his father who had traveled to Wuhan showed symptoms in around three days, according to a letter published in NEJM.

On Thursday, January 29, Kalibo Mayor Emerson Lachica issued Executive Order No. 004 calling for the class suspensions to safeguard the health and safety of students, employees, and teachers.

File photo by AFP LONDON, United Kingdom – From carmaking to electronics and tourism, the outbreak of a new coronavirus in China is infecting companies around the world with anxiety about the impact on their supplies and earnings. As authorities adopt drastic steps to contain the deadly virus, foreign businesses are braced for further disruption next month after the Lunar New Year holidays, which for now have shuttered most factories and offices in China. Taiwanese tech giant Foxconn said Wednesday, January 29, it would keep its Chinese factories closed until mid-February and will allow local employees to delay their return after the new year break. The move could affect global supply chains for tech companies that rely on Foxconn to manufacture everything from Apple's iPhones to flat-screen TVs and laptops. Chinese tour groups are banned from heading overseas meanwhile, promoting jitters among foreign luxury brands and high-end retail hubs such as Paris and Milan. Airlines have slashed flights to China. British Airways and Lufthansa have stopped flying there altogether. Iris Pang, China economist at ING, forecast global tourism numbers could plummet by 30% this year from last due to the outbreak, which has spread out of China to the rest of Asia, Europe, and North America. In China itself, Pang said, year-on-year retail sales growth could halve to 3% to 4%, possibly imperiling the government's promises to import more US goods under a recent deal aimed at ending a protracted trade war. 'Negative feedback loop' ""It is not necessarily the virus per se that is the problem for the world's economy,"" commented Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst for Asia at OANDA in Singapore, after days of selloffs on stock markets in Asia, Europe, and the United States. ""It is the self-feeding negative feedback loop on economic activity, and thus growth, it creates,"" he said, warning that a months-long crisis could even force the Federal Reserve to shift tack on US interest rates. The extended holiday in China means the immediate impact on industrial production is limited for now. Wuhan in Hubei province, the epicenter of the outbreak in central China, is a hub for US, European, and Japanese carmakers, and electronics suppliers. But now foreign countries are organizing evacuation flights for their nationals out of the city. And with China imposing quarantines on millions of people in several cities beyond Wuhan itself, while prolonging the break for a week beyond its scheduled finish on January 30, ripple effects for companies are inevitable. Apple itself on Tuesday, January 28, gave an unusually wide revenue forecast for this quarter, due to uncertainty about how the outbreak will affect its business. Chief executive Tim Cook said Apple was working on ""mitigation plans"" to make up for any production loss from its suppliers in China, such as Foxconn, which accounts for the most US-bound exports by volume from Hubei province. Coffee and cars Another emblematic US brand, Starbucks, declined to offer further earnings guidance after posting its quarterly results, citing ""the dynamic situation unfolding with the coronavirus."" Mainland China is Starbucks' second biggest market, with more than 4,000 outlets, and half of them have been closed by the outbreak. After Starbucks, the fast-food chains McDonald's and Domino's are most exposed among US brands as a percentage of their global revenues, according to Guggenheim analyst Matthew DiFrisco. Prolonged disruption will affect an array of other sectors. China is the leading producer of active pharmaceutical ingredients, which are repackaged by Western drugs companies into many life-saving treatments. In the immediate firing line around Wuhan are General Motors, PSA, Renault, Nissan, and Honda, who have all adopted the city as a base for joint carmaking ventures. Each says it is monitoring the situation closely, while Toyota is suspending production in China until at least February 9 given the likely disruption not just for its own staff but to parts suppliers around the country.

250601,rappler,"January 30, 2020",Business,Virus crisis adds pressure on slowing Chinese economy,Agence France-Presse,"The novel coronavirus outbreak is expected to deliver a fresh blow to the world's No. 2 economy  SLOWING ECONOMY. A customer buys dried sausages at a market in Beijing on January 15, 2020. Photo by Nicolas Asfouri/AFP BEIJING, China – Cinemas empty, high-speed train trips canceled, tourist sites closed, an entire province shut down: The extraordinary measures taken by China to contain a deadly coronavirus threaten to dent an already fragile economy. With the world's No. 2 economy increasingly reliant on its consumers to drive growth, the virus has struck at the worst possible time with hundreds of millions of people fanned out across the country for the Lunar New Year holiday. Gross domestic product (GDP) expanded at its slowest pace in 3 decades last year, hit by weak domestic demand and the trade war with the United States. Still, figures in the final 3 months pointed to some stability and the recently signed trade pact with the US had provided further hope. But Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics said there wasn't ""any doubt"" the coronavirus outbreak – which has killed more than 100 people – would deliver a fresh blow, warning that transport and broader consumption would be hit, including dining and retail. The holiday has been extended by 3 days, meaning the country may slowly get back to business only from Monday, February 3. Some companies told employees to work from home or stay away, including tech giant Tencent, which told staff to work at home until February 10. Popular restaurant chain Haidilao will close all its restaurants in China until the end of the month. The government has canceled domestic and international group tours, a move that could have a serious impact on its tourism sector – a crucial industry worth 11% of the country's total GDP. Authorities on Tuesday, January 28, recommended that all Chinese travelers put their trips abroad on hold ""in order to protect the health and safety of Chinese and foreign people"" – bad news for the country's airline industry. Threat to industry Railway volume and air traffic on the first day of the Lunar New Year were both down more than 40% on last year, according to the deputy transport minister. More than 2,000 high-speed trains – a popular mode of transportation in the vast country – have been suspended for days or weeks. Another growing sector – the film industry – has also taken a hit. China's box-office earnings for Lunar New Year's Eve were just one-tenth of last year as people shunned cinema crowds, and 7 key blockbusters set to be released during the holiday were canceled. Analysts at S&P say consumption contributed about 3.5 percentage points of China's growth rate in 2019, and warn that even a 10% drop in consumption would knock about 1.2 percentage points off GDP. Stephen Innes, of AxiCorp, said it would not be until after the holiday that ""the true extent of the carnage would be more evident."" The shutdown has been most serious in central Hubei province – the epicenter of the virus – where train stations have been closed, events canceled, and theaters, libraries, and karaoke bars shut in some locations. But beyond consumption and transport, the closure could have longer-term impacts to industry. Hubei's capital, Wuhan, a major manufacturing hub of 11 million people that produces steel and cars, has been placed under indefinite quarantine since Thursday, January 23. (READ: China virus injects fears for global supply chains) ""Wuhan is an important hub and manufacturing center in central China. If the lockdown continues after the Lunar New Year holidays, it will affect industrial production, one of the key growth drivers,"" said Raymond Yeung, chief China economist at ANZ Research. 'Complicated supply chains' Wuhan accounts for about 1.6% of China's GDP, according to S&P. Some 160 Japanese companies have offices in the city, according to the Japanese Chamber of Commerce in Wuhan. Several foreign carmakers, including General Motors and Renault, produce vehicles in the city through joint ventures with Chinese companies. The output value of the automobile and parts industry in Wuhan was around 400 billion yuan ($57 billion), according to a report in the Changliang Daily. The city was predicted to have produced around 1.7 million vehicles in 2018, it said. ""Complicated supply chains and just-in-time production could mean that production outages in Wuhan factories have broader spillover effects,"" S&P warned in a research note. The outbreak is inevitably drawing comparisons to the 2003 SARS epidemic, which killed nearly 650 people across mainland China and Hong Kong. Evans-Pritchard warned that the new virus faces spreading wider and faster than SARS, pointing out that overseas travel has risen tenfold and passenger traffic has more than tripled in the past 17 years. During SARS, he said, passenger traffic halved, as did growth in the space of a few months. But ANZ's Yeung said the government had learned lessons on how to handle an epidemic and therefore the ""impact should be less severe"" than during SARS. Oxford Economics said in a note that the outbreak could potentially be ""a high impact, but short-lived event,"" mostly forming a risk in the first two quarters. – Rappler.com "

File photo by Ben Nabong/Rappler MANILA, Philippines – The government's economic managers are confident that the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) scare would have a minimal impact on Philippine growth. Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III downplayed the possible effects of the 2019-nCov on the economy, saying that the Philippines has not been widely affected by the virus. (READ: Philippines confirms 1st case of novel coronavirus) ""We are a big enough economy that can handle this thing. We are not going into recession because of it,"" Dominguez said. Socioeconomic Planning Secretary Ernesto Pernia, meanwhile, said the effect on tourism would be ""short-term."" The Philippines has so far suspended visa upon arrival for Chinese tourists and businessmen, and temporarily stopped issuing visas to travelers from the Chinese province of Hubei. Wuhan, the city where the virus originated, is in Hubei. There are strong calls to impose a temporary ban on all travel to and from China. While the Philippine officials said the health scare would not make much of a dent in the economy internally, they acknowledged that it could be among the external factors that may affect growth in the medium term. The economic team, composed of Dominguez, Pernia, and Budget Secretary Wendel Avisado, met on Thursday to discuss the country's economic performance and to ""forge a strategy"" to achieve the gross domestic product (GDP) growth target of 6.5% to 7.5% in 2020. Aside from the 2019-nCov, the economic team identified the slowdown in global economic growth, lackluster recovery in trade, protectionist policies, and volatile oil prices, among others, as possible primary downside risks externally. On the domestic front, the economic team said natural hazards, African swine fever, water supply disruptions, slow implementation of infrastructure projects, and policy ""uncertainties"" – such as the delayed passage of tax reform packages – could hinder the economic growth trajectory in the medium term. They also said that the implementation of the Supreme Court ruling increasing local government units' share of national taxes may hinder growth, citing inefficient spending by LGUs. Because of the risks, Dominguez said infrastructure agencies should accelerate the implementation of priority projects. He added that the agriculture sector should grow at least 2% annually. In 2019, agriculture posted the slowest growth among major sectors at 1.5%. Digital trade, speeding up the rollout of the 3rd major telecommunications player, and addressing regulatory issues in the e-commerce industry, among others, were seen as part of strategies to address the risks to economic growth. The Philippines missed its GDP growth target in 2019, growing by 5.9% – the slowest in 8 years. The economic team largely attributed that to the delayed passage of the national budget, which had stalled infrastructure projects. – Rappler.com "

Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said that just as the global economy seemed to have stabilized, the coronavirus poses a new risk to growth in China and elsewhere. (READ: Virus crisis adds pressure on slowing Chinese economy) The SARS-like outbreak in China has left at least 170 people dead and thousands sickened, while airlines have canceled flights and businesses have been shuttered.

""There will clearly be implications at least in the near term for Chinese output and I would guess for some of their close neighbors,"" Powell told reporters following the Fed's policy meeting. However, ""the situation is really in its early stages and it's very uncertain about how far it will spread and what the macroeconomic effects will be,"" he said. ""We are very carefully monitoring the situation."" There remains grounds for ""cautious optimism"" about the global outlook,"" Powell said, but ""none of this is assured"" given continued uncertainties, including the impact of the virus outbreak. The policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) left the benchmark interest rate steady in the target range of 1.5% to 1.75%, as expected, at the end of its two-day meeting. Policymakers also signaled that they want to see US inflation push a bit higher, to hit the 2% Fed target. After cutting rates 3 times last year in their effort to buoy the economy amid President Donald Trump's multi-front trade wars, this is the second policy meeting where the central bank has made no move, and it had seemed content to tread water unless there was a ""material change"" to the outlook. The statement Wednesday repeated that policymakers will ""continue to monitor the implications of incoming inflation for the economic outlook including global developments and muted inflation pressures."" Inflation goal and repo The Fed's statement however focuses mostly on the domestic economy, noting that household spending has been ""rising at a moderate pace,"" a slightly less upbeat view than in December. Slowing consumer spending on top of ""weak"" business investments and exports could undercut the Fed's ability to meet its inflation goal, which is running at just 1.5%. The statement tinkered with the wording from December to stress that the policy is aimed at ""inflation returning to the Committee's symmetric 2% inflation objective."" The FOMC decision, though widely expected, is unlikely to please Trump, who has repeatedly berated the Fed and called on Powell to slash rates to zero to supercharge the US economy, which the president says is at a disadvantage against foreign economies with lower rates. ""The Fed should get smart & lower the Rate to make our interest competitive with other Countries which pay much lower even though we are, by far, the high standard,"" Trump tweeted on Tuesday, January 28. ""We would then focus on paying off & refinancing debt! There is almost no inflation-this is the time (2 years late)!"" In a technical move, the Fed also slightly raised the interest it offers to banks with cash on deposit at the central bank, bumping it up to 1.6% from 1.55%, reversing the rate cut in September. And the FOMC announced that it will continue the measures to boost the amount of cash available in the financial system at least through the 2nd quarter of the year. The Fed had to take emergency steps in September after interest rates started to climb amid an apparent shortage of bank reserves, using overnight cash injections known as ""repo"" operations. Powell said the aim is to ensure reserves in the system remain above a floor of $1.5 trillion, while working on a plan to gradually reduce the Fed's asset purchases. – Rappler.com "

The first confirmed case concerned a woman in her 60s who had recently traveled to Wuhan. Her husband did not travel to China. Jennifer Layden, the state's chief medical officer, said the man's condition was ""stable"" and that his situation was exacerbated by some underlying medical conditions. Both federal and state officials, however, stressed that the pathogen is not spreading widely in communities and the overall risk to Americans remains low. The latest case brings to 6 the overall number of confirmed patients with the virus in the US. As of Thursday, some 7,700 cases have been confirmed in China, its country of origin, with at least 170 fatalities. The virus has spread from the city of Wuhan across China to more than 15 countries, with about 60 cases in Asia, Europe, North America and, most recently, the Middle East. No deaths have been attributed to the virus outside China. – Rappler.com "

Photo by Fabrice Coffrini/AFP GENEVA, Switzerland – The UN health agency on Thursday, January 30, declared an international emergency over the deadly novel coronavirus from China – a rarely used designation that could lead to improved international co-ordination in tackling the disease. ""Our greatest concern is the potential for the virus to spread to countries with weaker health systems,"" World Health Organization (WHO) chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said as he declared a ""public health emergency of international concern."" ""This is not a vote of no confidence in China,"" he said, emphasizing repeatedly that the measure was intended to help other countries less able to cope and praising the Chinese government for taking swift action to tackle the outbreak. ""We must all act together now to limit further spread.... We can only stop it together,"" said Tedros, who travelled to China this week and met with President Xi Jinping. Tedros also said there was ""no reason"" for any of the international travel or trade restrictions announced in recent days, such as flight suspensions, border closures and quarantine for apparently healthy travelers. Top airlines including Air France, British Airways and Lufthansa have suspended or cut back services to China. The WHO's Emergency Committee, an advisory body of international experts, said in a statement that evidence had shown that restricting movement of people and goods during public health emergencies ""may be ineffective and may divert resources from other interventions."" ""Further, restrictions may interrupt needed aid and technical support, may disrupt businesses, and may have negative effects on the economies of countries affected by the emergencies,"" the committee said. But it added that ""in certain specific circumstances, measures that restrict the movement of people may prove temporarily useful"" – a possible reference to lockdowns within China that have affected millions of people. WHO stopped short of declaring an emergency last week because its emergency committee was divided over the issue. More than 7,700 people have been infected with the virus – almost all of them in China – and 170 have died. The WHO said there have also been 82 confirmed cases in 18 other countries, including cases of onward transmission in Germany, Japan, the United States and Vietnam. The WHO has called a public health emergency of international concern only 5 times since the relevant legislation took effect in 2007 – for swine flu, polio, Zika and twice for Ebola outbreaks in Africa. The designation, which is reviewed every 3 months, allows the WHO to issue global recommendations that the international community is expected to follow. Governments, companies and people around the world have already been escalating efforts to contain the illness, which is believed to have emerged from an animal market in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. Many countries have urged their citizens not to visit China, while some have banned entry for travelers from Wuhan and Russia said it was closing its far eastern border with China over the outbreak. – Rappler.com "

Photo by Nicolas Asfouri/AFP BEIJING, China (UPDATED) – Countries stepped up travel restrictions on arrivals from China on Friday, January 31, after a global health emergency was declared over a viral epidemic that has killed 213 people. Nearly 10,000 people have been infected in China by the new coronavirus and new cases were found abroad, with more than 20 countries now affected by the disease. The World Health Organization on Thursday, January 30, declared the outbreak a global health emergency, but said it was not recommending any international trade or travel restrictions and urged the numerous countries already taking such measures to reconsider. Nevertheless, countries intensified travel curbs. The US State Department raised its warning alert to the highest level, telling Americans ""do not travel"" to China and urged those already there to leave. Singapore, Vietnam and Mongolia went a step further. Citing a likely ""sharper rise"" in the spread of the virus, Singapore's government barred arrivals and transit passengers who visited China in the past 14 days, and stopped issuing all forms of new visas to Chinese passport holders. Mongolia will ban Chinese nationals and foreigners coming from the neighboring country by plane, train or road from Saturday, February 1, until March 2. Mongolians will be barred from going to China over the same period. In Vietnam, Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc ordered the suspension of new tourist visas for Chinese citizens and foreigners who have been in China over the last two weeks. Trade with China will also be ""discouraged"" until the outbreak abates, he said. Japan, meanwhile, joined Britain, Germany and other countries that have recommended that their citizens avoid China. Taking action The WHO has declared a global health emergency 5 times since the practice began in 2007 – for swine flu, polio, Zika and twice for Ebola. It allows the UN health body to issue recommendations that the international community is expected to follow. But the WHO warned Friday that closing borders was probably ineffective in halting transmissions of the virus and could even accelerate its spread. ""As we know from other scenarios, be it Ebola or other cases whenever people want to travel...if the official paths are not open, they will find unofficial paths,"" WHO spokesman Christian Lindmeier said in Geneva. Authorities, businesses and worried people around the world have been taking matters into their own hands. Many major airlines this week suspended or reduced flights to China. Russia sealed its remote far-eastern frontier. Papua New Guinea went so far as to bar all visitors from ""Asian ports."" Some countries banned entry for travelers from Wuhan, the city in central Hubei province where the virus first surfaced. Italy, which has stopped all flights to and from China, declared a state of emergency on Friday to fast-track efforts to prevent the spread of the virus. Growing panic China on Friday said it sent charter planes to Thailand and Malaysia to bring Hubei residents back to Wuhan, citing the ""practical difficulties"" that they have encountered overseas. In a sign of growing global anxiety, more than 6,000 tourists were temporarily confined aboard their cruise ship at an Italian port after two Chinese passengers fell ill. They later tested negative for the coronavirus. More than 40,000 workers at a vast Chinese-controlled industrial complex in Indonesia's Sulawesi island have been quarantined over fears about the virus. Myanmar sent a plane back to China after a Chinese passenger was hospitalized with possible symptoms of the virus. The US reported its first case of person-to-person transmission of the virus on American soil – a man in Chicago who got it from his wife, who had travelled to Wuhan. Britain and Russia each reported their first two cases. Death toll grows China has taken extreme steps to stop the spread of the virus, including effectively quarantining more than 50 million people in Wuhan and surrounding Hubei province. It has also suspended school nationwide and extended the Lunar New Year holiday in an effort to limit people travelling. But the toll continues to swell, rising to 213 after 43 new deaths were reported on Friday. All the dead have been in China. China's National Health Commission also confirmed 1,982 new cases, bringing the total to 9,692. That exceeds the 8,096 cases from SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) a similar pathogen that spread to more than two dozen countries in 2002-03, and killed 774 people, mostly in China and Hong Kong. Another 102,000 people are under medical observation in China with possible coronavirus symptoms. The new virus is believed to have emerged in a Wuhan market that sold wild game, and spread by a Lunar New Year holiday season in which hundreds of millions of Chinese travel domestically or abroad. Airlifts continue Countries have scrambled to evacuate their nationals from Wuhan, with US and Japanese citizens leaving first on Wednesday, January 29. Britain and France airlifted hundreds of their nationals on Friday. Three people aboard Japan's first evacuation flight tested positive after landing back home, two of whom showed no symptoms, underscoring the difficulty detecting the coronavirus. South Korea said 18 of around 350 people who were repatriated from Wuhan were hospitalized after showing symptoms. – Rappler.com "

The country has only temporarily stopped issuing visas to travelers from Hubei, China, the epicenter of the novel coronavirus that has so far killed 212 people there. The government is calling for the repatriation of Filipino workers in China. On Thursday, January 30, the governor of Iloilo province called on Cebu Pacific airline to stop its flights from Hong Kong to the province's international airport.

Researchers say the internet and chat apps are awash in them. (READ: FACT CHECK: Misinformation on novel coronavirus that spreads online) Ever since the emergence of the virus in the central Chinese city of Wuhan became public at the start of January, misinformation has stalked its spread. (READ: China virus death toll hits 212 – health officials) Cristina Tardaguila, from the Poynter Institute for Media Studies, says more than 50 fact-checking organizations in 30 countries have been dealing with ""3 waves"" of misinformation. ""One regarding the origins of the virus; one about a fake patent, and a third about how to prevent it/cure it,"" she told AFP. 'Racist morons' AFP's own fact-check teams have encountered a deluge of misinformation causing confusion and fear – including one out of Sri Lanka claiming China said 11 million people would die. Another was a false report in Australia listing common food brands and locations in Sydney that were supposedly tainted, while multiple posts pushed the erroneous idea that saline – basic salt water – can kill the virus. Some of the misinformation has tapped into prejudices towards Chinese eating habits, or has been used to fuel racist stereotypes. One video which went especially viral was a video of a woman tucking into bat soup. The footage, which was also picked up by western tabloid media outlets, was hailed as proof that China's appetite for exotic animals had caused the crisis. But it emerged that the video was shot in 2016 on the Pacific island of Palau by a Chinese travel blogger – a fact that few of the media outlets which ran the footage bothered to either check or update once the reality became known. While China's culinary tradition encompasses a vast array of ingredients that many elsewhere may turn their noses up at – and there are legitimate concerns over the country's hygiene standards and live animal markets – bat is not commonly consumed. Australia has seen multiple false claims that tap into prejudice towards its sizeable Chinese community. On Monday, Duncan Pegg, a lawmaker for Brisbane, alerted constituents to a fake Department of Health press release warning against travel to suburbs with high concentrations of Chinese Australians. ""To have false information spread by racist morons creates a sense of fear and anxiety,"" he told AFP. 'Fear and uncertainty' The far-right corners of the internet have also seized on the outbreak. One early hoax widely spread alleged a vaccine against the virus had already been patented in 2015. The story was quickly dismantled -- the patent was for a coronavirus found in poultry – but it gained traction within ""QAnon,"" a widely discredited movement that alleges a conspiracy within the US intelligence services to topple Donald Trump. Hal Turner – a far-right American radio host who the Southern Poverty Law Center says pushes white-supremacist views – has published a piece on his website claiming 112,000 people have already died in China, with 2.8 million quarantined. ""The coronavirus is a classic setup for the spread of rumours which are incubated in an atmosphere of fear and uncertainty,"" said Robert Bartholomew, a medical sociologist in New Zeland who has written a book about public panics. Sensationalist media headlines – and historical distrust of China's opaque government – has made it easier for rumours to flourish, he told AFP. ""But for many people, their primary source of information is from social media which is notorious for carrying stories that are unvetted."" For health officials tasked with battling the outbreak, the relentless flood of false claims is making their jobs harder.

A 'No mask, no entry' sign can be seen at the entrance of San Lazaro Hospital in Manila on January 30, 2020, the day the Philippines confirmed its first case of novel coronavirus. Photo by Inoue Jaena/Rappler  MANILA, Philippines – A day after the Department of Health (DOH) confirmed the Philippines' first case of novel coronavirus, the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) called on all local government units (LGUs) to create their respective task forces to help contain the spread of the virus. ""All LGUs nationwide are advised to create their respective task forces to implement DOH protocols and guidelines and extend full cooperation to the DOH and other government agencies to meet the world health emergency,"" DILG Undersecretary Jonathan Malaya said in a statement on Friday, January 31. Malaya said Interior Secretary Eduardo Año was prompted to give the directive after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared an international emergency in relation to the novel coronavirus outbreak that has killed 212  people in China alone as of Friday. The DILG said the task force will be led either by the governor or the mayor, who will ensure that local health personnel have the necessary equipment and protective gear. The task force will also handle the referral and transport of constituents suspected of  2019-nCoV infection to a DOH-designated hospital. Local chief executives,  in coordination with the DOH, are also expected to train health workers on 2019-nCoV prevention, containment, and control. LGUs must also conduct information campaigns on the virus in their areas. The DILG said that LGUs hosting international airports must coordinate with the Bureau of Immigration and airport authorities to ensure the implementation of quarantine procedures. LGUs are expected to cooperate with the DOH in the latter's contact-tracing of individuals who encountered a confirmed 2019-nCoV patient. ""The mayor should immediately inform the DOH should there be reasonable basis to place an individual under quarantine. The DOH needs the support of all LGUs in this important matter and local and police authorities should extend all possible assistance in this regard,"" Malaya said. On Friday, the WHO declared a public health emergency of international concern, citing ""potential for the virus to spread to countries with weaker health systems."" In the Philippines, President Rodrigo Duterte imposed a ban on travelers from Wuhan City – the epicenter of the outbreak – and the rest of Hubei province, China, which would last until the 2019-nCoV threat was over. Other countries have taken their own precautionary measures to stem the disease. Russia had shut its border with China and would stop issuing electronic visas to Chinese nationals. A number of airlines had either halted or reduced flights to China. The public is advised to practice proper hygiene and coughing etiquette, including constant washing of hands and coughing into the crook of the elbow.

The man lay straight on his back in front of a closed furniture store. Medical staff in blue overalls gently shrouded his body with a blue blanket. The ambulance left, and police stacked supermarket cardboard boxes to hide the scene. AFP could not determine how the man, who appeared to be aged in his 60s, had died.

Wuhan is the epicenter of the outbreak of the new coronavirus, which is believed to have jumped from wild animals at a city market into humans. The virus, which emerged late last year, has claimed at least 213 lives and infected thousands in China, with at least 159 deaths in Wuhan alone. With the virus spreading to other countries, the World Health Organization has declared the crisis a global health emergency. Torment Authorities have imposed an unprecedented lockdown of Wuhan, blocking off roads out of the city and banning flights, in a bid to stop the virus spreading. Those who are trapped are enduring a tormenting wait for the lockdown to end, for a cure to be found, or even just for check-ups at overwhelmed hospitals. AFP reporters in Wuhan have seen long queues at hospitals, with some patients saying they had queued for two days to see a doctor. Many brought their own chairs for the wait. With most traffic banned, people who venture outside have to walk or bike everywhere in the huge city. The dead man on the street on Thursday lay one block from the Wuhan Number Six Hospital, one of the main medical centers for treating those with virus symptoms. A team of forensic experts who examined him were immediately sprayed with disinfectant by colleagues after removing their hazardous material suits. One man smoking near the scene was told sharply by police to put out his cigarette and don a face mask. He quickly followed their orders. In the two hours that AFP observed the scene, at least 15 ambulances passed by, attending other calls. Finally, a white van with blacked-out windows arrived to take away the man. The body was zipped into a yellow surgical bag, and carried into the van on a stretcher. Staff immediately began to clean the ground as the van drove away, disinfecting the streets where the body had lain. – Rappler.com "

The State Department issued a level 4 warning – up from urging Americans to ""reconsider"" travel to China – and said any nationals in China now ""should consider departing using commercial means."" In the travel advisory, the department cited the World Health Organization's (WHO) decision that the ""rapidly spreading outbreak constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern."" The WHO declared the global emergency earlier Thursday over the new coronavirus, which originated in the city of Wuhan in Hubei province, as China reported the death toll had climbed to 213 with nearly 10,000 infections. The UN health agency based in Geneva had initially downplayed the threat posed by the disease, but revised its risk assessment after crisis talks. In the updated travel advisory, the State Department recalled that last week it had ordered the departure of all non-emergency US personnel and their family members from Wuhan. ""The US government has limited ability to provide emergency services to US citizens in Hubei province,"" the advisory said.

Many other countries have also urged their citizens not to visit China, while some have banned entry for travelers from Wuhan. Airlines began cancelling flights servicing China on Wednesday, and more followed suit on Thursday. Israel barred all flights from China, while Russia said it was closing its far eastern border with China over the outbreak. More than 6,000 tourists were temporarily put under lockdown aboard a cruise ship at an Italian port after two Chinese passengers were isolated over fears they could be carrying the virus.

""In an effort to contain the novel coronavirus, the Chinese authorities have suspended air, road, and rail travel in the area around Wuhan and placed restrictions on travel and other activities throughout the country,"" it said. Beijing has taken extreme steps to stop the spread of the virus, including effectively quarantining more than 50 million people in Wuhan and surrounding Hubei province. Thousands of foreigners have been trapped in Wuhan since it was sealed off last week. The pathogen is believed to have emerged in a market that sold wild game, and spread during a Lunar New Year holiday season in which hundreds of millions of Chinese travel at home or abroad. – Rappler.com "

The Philippine's Department of Health confirmed the first case of coronavirus in the country – a female patient who traveled to the Philippines from Wuhan in China. (READ: FAQs: Ano-ano ang alam natin tungkol sa 2019 novel coronavirus?) What happens now after the WHO declaration? Here are the important things you need to know about the declaration of an international health emergency: The declaration of a global emergency is formally called the Public Health Emergency of International Concern or the PHEIC by WHO. The 2005 International Health Regulations (IHR) define PHEIC as “an extraordinary event which is determined to constitute a public health risk to other states through the international spread of disease and to potentially require a coordinated international response.” The 2005 IHR is a document that serves as a guide for the prevention or spread of public health risks that threaten people globally. To fall under a PHEIC, a public health situation: The PHEIC on the novel coronavirus is the 6th declaration that WHO has made. The others include: the H1N1 influenza pandemic in 2009, polio outbreak in 2014, West Africa Ebola epidemic in 2014, Zika virus outbreak in 2016, and the Kivu Ebola epidemic in 2018. The January 30 declaration, as advised by a team of international experts, focuses mainly on preventing the further spread of the virus. In a press conference, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that the organization’s greatest concern is “the potential for the virus to spread to countries with weaker health systems.” In a statement, WHO said that a global coordinated effort is vital to improve preparedness in other areas around the world, especially countries that may need additional support in addressing the spread of the virus. It also emphasized that the declaration of the international emergency “should be seen in the spirit of support and appreciation for China, its people, and the actions China has taken on the frontlines of this outbreak, with transparency, and, it is to be hoped, with success. In compliance with IHR article 4, the WHO emergency committee urges the global community to continue to work together towards discovering new information on the novel coronavirus and other similar public health risks. These information that may prove to be very useful include the novel coronavirus' full potential for human-to-human transmission, how a country prepared or prevented further spread of the virus, and valuable research for possible treatment. The PHEIC also calls for global support for low- and middle-income countries in the face of a global spread of the novel coronavirus, assistance in their response, and access to diagnostics and potential vaccines, among others. In a nutshell, countries that currently have confirmed cases are now expected to prevent the further spread of the novel coronavirus and at the same time ensure that the handling of the situation will not border on discrimination. Now that the novel coronavirus situation is considered a global health emergency, the WHO Emergency Committee urges all countries to be prepared for the containment of cases, including: “Countries should place particular emphasis on reducing human infection, prevention of secondary transmission and international spread, and contributing to the international response though multi-sectoral communication and collaboration and active participation in increasing knowledge on the virus and the disease, as well as advancing research,” it said. As countries follow these steps, the committee demands full transparency and to share their full data with WHO, as legally required by the IHR. It also does not recommend any travel or trade restriction based on the current situation. Any further measures on travels should be adequately consulted with WHO. “Countries must inform WHO about any travel measures taken, as required by the IHR,” it said. “Countries are cautioned against actions that promote stigma or discrimination,” the committee added. The WHO Emergency Committee is expected to meet again in 3 months to adjust any declaration and recommendations to align with new information. – Rappler.com Other news you can use: "

(READ: ’Novel coronavirus’ or 2019 nCoV: What we know so far) What happened in the past 5 incidents declared as a global public health emergency, and how were they handled? Swine flu pandemic (2009) After first being discovered in the United States in early 2009, the swine flu, or influenza A H1N1 pandemic was declared in June that same year. By this time, 74 countries and territories had confirmed infections. According to WHO, swine flu was a new virus when it emerged and most people had no or little immunity to it. By February 2010, the death toll hit 16,000, mostly from countries with inadequate resources for widespread laboratory testing. The outbreak was declared over in August 2010. While this does not mean the virus had been eradicated, WHO saw that it had “largely run its course.” The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimated that 151,000 to 575,400 people died from the pandemic worldwide during the first year the virus circulated. The H1N1 virus that caused the pandemic is now a regular human flu virus and continues to circulate seasonally worldwide. The manufacturers that produce seasonal flu vaccines produced the swine flu shot the same way seasonal vaccines are made. Polio resurgence (2014) The international spread of wild poliovirus was declared a PHEIC in May 2014. A spike of cases occurred in Pakistan, Syria, and Cameroon and began to spread to other countries. WHO urged all residents and long-term visitors from the 3 countries to have themselves vaccinated before traveling and to provide proof of vaccination. Inaccessibility remains to be a major risk, especially for several countries that have infection cases. These include Afghanistan, Nigeria, Niger, Somalia, Myanmar, and Indonesia. As of January 2020, polio is still considered a PHEIC. Although wild poliovirus type 2 and type 3 have been eradicated, there are still cases of wild polio type 1 and vaccine-derived poliovirus types. Vaccine-derived polio type 1 was found in recent cases in the Philippines. (READ: PH declares polio outbreak as disease returns after 19 years) There is no cure for polio, but it can be prevented by vaccination. WHO reported a 99% decrease in wild polio cases, from 350,000 in 1988 to 33 in 2018. In 2018, 85% of infants around the world received 3 doses of polio vaccine. The CDC however, recommends 4 doses. Ebola epidemics (2014 and 2019) Just 3 months after polio was declared a PHEIC, the same was done in the case of the Ebola virus disease in West Africa in August 2014. Since Ebola is not airborne and can only be transmitted through direct contact with an infected person's bodily fluids, WHO recommended no ban on travel or trade. However, the WHO Emergency Committee recommended that countries still prepare to detect, investigate, and manage Ebola cases. This includes preparing their capacity to identify and care for travelers originating from Ebola-infected areas. In 2016, when risk of international spread became low, WHO lifted the PHEIC status of Ebola. It had killed 11,300 people by then. The second largest Ebola outbreak on record was declared on August 1, 2018, after occuring in the North Kivu and Ituri provinces of Congo. WHO named it a PHEIC in July 2019. As of January 28, 2020, there are 3,302 confirmed cases, 2,242 deaths, and 1,154 survivors of the disease. The US Food and Drug Administration has had an Ebola vaccine since December 2019. Zika virus (2016) The Zika virus disease, which is caused by a virus transmitted primarily by Aedes mosquitoes, had been identified in humans since 1952. But in February 2016, reports came out that microcephaly, a condition where the head circumference is smaller than usual, and other neurological disorders were linked with cases of Zika in Brazil. This led to the declaration of a PHEIC due to their being extraordinary cases. Zika infection during pregnancy was found to lead to such disorders in infants and other complications like stillbirth. The CDC advised pregnant women to avoid traveling to affected areas. In May 2016, more than 100 doctors and scientists signed an open letter to WHO Director General Margaret Chan, calling for the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro to be postponed due to the Zika outbreak. However, the WHO lifted the emergency status in November 2016 as research demonstrated the link of Zika and microcephaly. While the virus was still a challenge for WHO, the outbreak no longer constituted a PHEIC, following its definition. By the end of 2016, the Zika virus had spread throughout the Americas and Europe, and in some parts of Asia and Oceania.The Pan American Health Organization reported 175,063 confirmed cases in the Americas. At least 57 cases were found in the Philippines in 2017. Zika transmission still persists, but has generally been at low levels from 2018 to present. Currently, there is no vaccine or medicine for Zika, although development is underway. – Rappler.com Sources: World Health Organization, AIMS Public Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Other updates on the novel coronavirus: "

But when the temperature dipped to 11.2 degrees at 5 am Friday, January 31, it was met with more anxiety than excitement. It is the coldest temperature for Baguio this year. Last January 4, the temperature dipped to 11.4 degrees. In the higher reaches of Benguet, the cold reached 10 degrees, this does not even include the wind chill factor which can bring the cold down to 5 degrees.

This may be good for the cold hunters. But with the first victim of coronavirus in the Philippines identified last Thursday, January 31, and persons under investigation reaching 53, the cold is actually bad news. Cold weather is known to serve as an ideal ground for viruses like the common cold and the flu. These viruses  have achieved the ability to spread between people, as they are more stable in cold air, and low humidity helps them to “float” for longer. Cold weather also decreases the bodily defenses, allowing viruses to enter the body with ease. But so far, Baguio is safe from the dreaded coronavirus.

The Philippines' first nCoV patient took a Cebu Pacific flight from Hong Kong to Cebu, a CebGo flight from Cebu to Dumaguete, and a Philippine Airlines flight from Dumaguete to Manila, the DOH said. The DOH said the airlines were cooperating with them. The DOH said it was also in the process of identifying people other people the patient might have interacted with. This would include finding personnel in hotels and other establishments that the patient went to and putting them under monitoring, but not isolation. “We are doing this carefully so we may release the proper advice to the contacts. We don’t want them to hide,” epidemiology bureau head Avelino said. Travel ban Amid the scare, President Rodrigo Duterte banned travel from Wuhan City and the rest of Hubei province.

The two airlines issued separate statements on Friday, a day after the Department of Health confirmed a 38-year-old woman as the country's first case of 2019-nCoV. The woman, who also visited Cebu and Dumaguete before heading to Manila, took Cebu Pacific flights on January 21 and a PAL flight on January 25. PAL said it placed two pilots and 4 cabin crew under quarantine. Meanwhile, the cabin crew and pilots on affected Cebu Pacific flights were also informed about the development, but Cebu Pacific said they showed no symptoms of illness. Cebu Pacific said the planes that the nCoV patient boarded had been pulled out and disinfected. It said it was also implementing the following preventive measures: PAL said it was conducting these preventive measures: The airlines also tracked down the passengers who might have come into contact with the woman who took flights on both airlines. In coordination with the DOH and the Bureau of Quarantine, the two airlines informed the patient's co-passengers about the confirmed case so they could have themselves checked. The BoQ will handle the medical observation of the concerned passengers and airline crew. ""We are also working to trace any onward journeys made by these passengers and crew on other flights, in case there is a need for BoQ to contact other people for precautionary medical observation,"" PAL said in a statement on Friday. Cebu Pacific has reduced its flights between the Philippines, mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau. PAL is set to reduce flights between Manila and mainland China by more than 50%, starting February 1. PAL has canceled all charter flights from China and has also prohibited accepting passengers from the Hubei province of China.

The United States, France, and Japan are among nations that have already sent aircraft to remove their nationals. (READ: WHO declares international emergency over novel coronavirus) China has sealed off the city, effectively quarantining more than 50 million people in Hubei province, including thousands of foreigners. (READ: China virus death toll hits 212 – health officials) AFP answers 5 questions on the evacuation efforts. What are the risks? Authorities will have to “really, really clean the airports and prevent transmission at every step of the logistics – it’s a huge risk”, said Wang Linfa, director of the Emerging Infectious Diseases program at Duke-NUS Medical School in Singapore. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) says the risk of contracting a disease on board a plane is in general similar to other confined, crowded spaces such as buses or trains. “That said, the risk on airplanes is probably lower than in many confined spaces because modern planes have cabin air filtration systems equipped with HEPA filters,” it adds. How are airlines preventing infection? Singaporean airline Scoot, which flew home 92 people to the Southeast Asian city-state on Thursday, January 30, provided surgical masks to all passengers and required its crew to wear the more effective N95 masks and surgical gloves. To limit physical interaction, food packs were left on seats before take-off and no meals or drinks were distributed in-flight. Scoot said temperature screening was conducted at check-in and again before boarding, and those with a fever were prevented from flying. Air India enforced similar measures in New Delhi's evacuation effort on Friday, January 31. “There are risks but on the other hand, the risks of leaving them at the epicenter of the global outbreak are significantly higher with the strain on resources there,” said Paul Tambyah, an infectious diseases expert at the National University of Singapore. International aviation agencies have protocols for evacuations that include having empty seats between passengers and ensuring good air quality and flow, he added. What about the foreigners left behind? Thousands of non-Chinese citizens remain trapped in Wuhan watching helplessly as others are flown home on government-chartered flights. Many left in the city have described an atmosphere of fear and confusion as well as uncertainty about food supply. Wuhan is a virtual ghost town, with restaurants and shops shuttered. “It’s unfortunate but citizens of countries that don’t have that kind of diplomatic wherewithal are going to have to deal with the situation that they’re presented with,” said China analyst Drew Thompson, a former US Department of Defense official. “They’re going to have to hunker down...and stay in contact with their embassies, and make do, just like their Chinese friends and counterparts.” What happens after they return home? Quarantine arrangements for evacuees vary from country to country. Japan’s policy of “self-quarantine” has sparked fierce criticism. Two of Wednesday's returnees initially refused to be tested for the virus although officials said the pair were later willing to be checked. “It’s a difficult scenario,” said Wang. “You just do your best to...educate the citizens, to say, 'we’ll help you to help us'.” “In most circumstances self-quarantine is more than enough if the citizen is educated.” In South Korea 18 passengers on an evacuation flight were immediately sent to hospital on arriving back in their country Friday after displaying symptoms of the coronavirus. How long is the quarantine period? French and British returnees will undergo a 14-day quarantine, while Americans will be voluntarily isolated for 3 days at a US airbase. The virus's incubation period, during which patients are infected but show no symptoms, is 2-17 days, meaning a two-week quarantine should catch about 99% of cases, said Wang. “It’s all about risk assessment,"" he said. ""There’s no such thing as a single quarantine (type) for all citizens in all countries coming from any part of the world.” – Rappler.com "

Several forms of malware have been discovered that disguise themselves as documents containing information pertinent to the novel coronavirus or nCoV according to cybersecurity firm Kaspersky in an email sent Friday, January 31. As the World Health Organization labelled the virus a global threat, the documents look to trick victims by implying to have vital information on how to detect and protect yourself from the disease and other supposedly crucial updates. The files are made to look like a PDF, MP4 or DOCX file but “actually contain a range of threats from Trojans to worms that can destroy, block, as well as interfere with the operation of computer networks.” So far, only 10 unique files have been seen containing the malware, but the firm expects that the number may grow as the coronavirus threat continues. The firm didn’t specify how the malware was being distributed but popular means by which such files may be spread include emails, chat apps, or via website links. To avoid being infected by the malware, the firm has a few tips: Try to avoid suspicious links, promising exclusive content.

Reducing the risks Meanwhile, to reduce the risk of infections, schools in Metro Manila and in some provinces took on the necessary steps to promote the antiseptic technique among students and employees. It provided hand sanitizers and rubbing alochol at the entrance of the building and in various counters inside the campus. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), practicing hand hygiene is a simple yet effective way to prevent infection. Temperature checks were also done at school entrances. Face masks were also given to students in some public schools. In Araullo High School for example, face masks were distributed to the students by the Manila City local government. According to the Philippine Society for Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (PSMID) and Philippine Hospital Infection Control Society (PHICS), face masks or surgical masks are designed to protect users from droplets and splashes that might cause possible infection.

But he is scheduled to discuss the water crisis in a public forum at the Cebu City Sports Complex on Monday, February 3. More water sources to open In January alone, the Metro Cebu Water District (MCWD) announced 15 separate water interruptions for different barangays. MCWD spokesperson Charmaine Kara Rodriguez said the supply deficit is currently at 10,000 cubic meters per day, with a total production of 223,000 cubic meters per day. The total demand for water in Metro Cebu was an average of 500,000 cubic meters.   “Supply problems were experienced this month in areas due to leaks, non-operation of wells due to power outages, and maintenance of MCWD facilities,” Kara explained. She said, however, that new wells scheduled to open in February and March should help add to the daily output of water production.   Additional water supply from Pilipinas Water Resources Incorporated in Mambaling is expected to add 5,000 cubic meters per day, while water sourced from Danao City is expected to add an additional 10,000 cubic meters per day.  But even with the additional sources of water, the supply would still be producing only 47% of total water demand in Metro Cebu. The MCWD, however, acknowledged that the amount of rainfall that will come in the summer months to replenish the water supply in the Buhisan and Jaclupan dams is unpredictable. While they recognized the important of water in combating the spread of viruses, they still encouraged the public to practice water conservation in their homes. “MCWD is advising the public to use water wisely so everyone can enjoy it. Let’s conserve where we can so we will have enough supply even during the summer months.” Kara said. From 2016 to 2019, Cebu City and the Province of Cebu had declared a state of calamity on diffent occasions due to drought, brought about by El Niño.  When water supply is low, the MCWD said they could deliver water to barangays where there is no service.

One rainy night when I was walking to the nearest bus stop from a fun party, I noticed that my wallet, along with some cash, IDs, and bank cards, was gone. I couldn’t even open my phone because it had run out of battery, so e-payment was also not an option. My place was over 25 kilometers away and it was already past 2 am. There was no public bus or subway I could ride either. I was already too tired to go back to the party venue and ask anyone to give me a ride back home. I told myself to try my luck and see if there was anyone out there willing to give me a ride. I started walking until I spotted a green cab. I hailed the cab and talked to the driver about my situation. Without further questions, he let me in. “What a nice driver,” I silently told myself. It did not take long for him to notice that I was a foreigner. During our trip, we exchanged stories. He shared how challenging life is for him in a thriving city like Wuhan. Just like other stories of perseverance and self-sacrifice, his story is also remarkable. He is supporting his two children who are both studying while also taking care of his ailing wife. He also told me how he decided to escape his poor life in a rural town and started to dream for his family. For my part, I shared how it is to live in the Philippines and how similar his inspiring stories were with those of some Filipino drivers. The trip was about an hour long. When I got off in front of my apartment, I asked him to wait for me while I got my money so I could pay him. He quickly refused. He said that he believed I was a good person even if we'd just met for the first time. I insisted and said that he needed the money for his family. He calmly smiled and said “I drive a taxi not just for my family. I also love my job because I love meeting people like you who are willing to listen to my story.” He humbly continued, “I obviously can’t afford to travel abroad but through your story, it is as if I have experienced life in a different country. And that feels really good.” I was in complete awe after hearing those words from him. I did not realize the impact of genuinely listening and sharing stories until he uttered those inspiring words. The only request the driver had was to take a selfie with me. Most Chinese people I've met love taking selfies with their international friends. Although I was embarrassed about my post-party appearance, I was happy to accommodate his request. I shook his hands and said ""Zai jian,"" (roughly translated as “see you again” in Chinese) then went back to my room happy with an unforgettable memory. The next day, I woke up to a call from the police station. Before I could fully comprehend what the police was saying, he mentioned that my missing wallet was at their station. He told me that a bus driver had found it and surrendered it to their office. “What a kind bus driver,” I told myself after the call. It is just a pity that the city that brought me such wonderful memories is battling a serious epidemic. It is even more unfortunate to see that people from my country are spreading racist ideology with their ethnocentric-remarks, like how the Chinese are ""uncivilized"" and “dirty-eaters.” I believe that we can rally against the actions and inactions of involved governments without being xenophobic towards any citizens. We can deliberately criticize those in power, those who handle the crisis, and those policies that are supposed to protect the people concerned without feeding into the anger against Chinese or other citizens. If there is one thing I learned from my encounter with the cab driver in Wuhan, it is compassion. When things get hard for others, we don’t need to make the condition harder for them. Instead, we spread compassion to make the situation more bearable for everyone. – Rappler.com Dr. Marshal Murillo is an associate professor of political science and public administration at the Ateneo de Naga University.

But with the disease – which has killed 213 people and infected nearly 10,000 in China – spreading to more than 20 nations, governments, businesses and worried people around the world were taking matters into their own hands. Several countries have halted cross-border traffic from China or banned entry from travelers from Wuhan, the city in central Hubei province where the virus first surfaced last month. But Lindmeier warned that countries' efforts to halt the virus by closing their borders and banning arrivals from China could be counterproductive. ""It might be a logical step to...say, look we see a danger from outside, so let's lock ourselves up,"" he said. ""But as we know from other scenarios, be it Ebola or other cases whenever people want to travel...if the official paths are not open, they will find inofficial paths. ""But the only way to control, to check fever for example, to identified travel history, to try to monitor who's coming across the border, and to see whether they have any signs of infection is through official border crossing points,"" he said.

The National Health Commission said in its daily update that 46 more people had succumbed to the respiratory disease. All but one of the new deaths came in hardest-hit Hubei province, the epicenter of an outbreak that has spread around the world. The virus emerged in December in Hubei's provincial capital Wuhan, and has been traced to a meat market that sold wild game. The number of infections in China also rose, by 2,102, bringing the nationwide total to 11,791. Fresh cases have been detected abroad, with more than 20 countries now affected.

Last week, China's central government finally jumped into action, effectively sealing off Wuhan and surrounding Hubei province, and curbing travel across the nation of 1.4 billion people. But the epidemic has spread far and wide as Chinese people travelled across the country and abroad over the Lunar New Year holiday that started last week. The World Health Organization has declared the outbreak a global health emergency, but said it was not recommending any international trade or travel restrictions. Countries nonetheless intensified travel curbs. The United States told its citizens not to go to China and urged those already there to leave – drawing a sharp rebuke from Beijing, which said the move was ""certainly not a gesture of goodwill."" On Friday, Washington doubled down, declaring its own public health emergency and temporarily barring entry to any foreign nationals who have travelled to China in the past two weeks. Japan has joined the US, Britain, Germany and other nations that have recommended that their citizens avoid China.

China's ambassador to Geneva said his country was controlling the outbreak and insisted there was no need for ""unnecessary panic"". Beyond government travel advisories, businesses and worried travellers have been taking matters into their own hands, with airlines suspending or reducing flights with China. The virus is believed to have originated in a Wuhan market that sold wild animals. It then jumped to humans. Wuhan officials have been criticized online for withholding information about the outbreak until the end of last year, despite knowing about the new illness weeks earlier. ""Right now I'm in a state of guilt, remorse and self-reproach,"" said Ma Guoqiang, the municipal Communist Party secretary for Wuhan. ""If strict control measures had been taken earlier, the result would have been better than now,"" he told state broadcaster CCTV.

China finally lurched into action last week, effectively quarantining whole cities in Hubei and tens of millions of people. Unprecedented safeguards imposed nationwide include postponing the return to school, cutting bus and train routes, and tightening health screening on travellers nationwide. Authorities in Hubei have extended the new year holiday until February 13 and suspended marriage registrations from Monday to discourage public gatherings. The city of Huanggang, east of Wuhan, said only one member of each household would be permitted to leave the house every two days to buy necessities.

Border closures Some nations have closed their borders with China in a bid to protect their territory from the outbreak. Russia said Thursday, January 30, it was closing its frontiers with China in the Far East, while Kazakhstan has halted cross-border bus and passenger train services to China. Mongolia has closed its border with China to cars, while North Korea – an isolated nation which relies heavily on its links with China – banned foreign tourists. Vietnam on the weekend announced a suspension of all mainland China flights. Nepal closed its Rasuwagadhi checkpoint on the Chinese border for 15 days starting January 29.

Visa bans for Chinese A number of countries have temporarily stopped issuing visas to Chinese nationals after the coronavirus outbreak. Singapore has stopped issuing all types of visas to Chinese travellers, while Vietnam – a popular destination for Chinese tourists – has halted tourist visas.

Photo by Kevin Lamarque/AFP NUR SULTAN, Kazakhstan – US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called on countries to offer asylum to ethnic minorities fleeing China's troubled Xinjiang region during a visit Sunday to oil-rich Kazakhstan -- a country that borders the region. ""We ask simply for them to provide safe refuge and asylum for those seeking to flee China,"" Pompeo said at a press appearance with Kazakh foreign minister Mukhtar Tleuberdi. ""Protect human dignity, just do what is right,"" Pompeo said. Pompeo was meeting top officials in ex-Soviet Kazakhstan as he rounds off a 5-nation tour in two countries where Russia and China enjoy privileged interests. His visit to the Kazakh capital Nur-Sultan also saw him meet with Kazakhs who say their family members are detained in Xinjiang, where over a million ethnic Uighurs, Kazakhs and other minorities are believed to have been incarcerated as part of an unprecedented security crackdown in the region. Kazakhstan has allowed several ethnic Kazakhs of Chinese citizenship who fled the region to stay in the country, but has not given any of them asylum – a reluctance local activists attribute to Chinese pressure. Pompeo also commended Kazakhstan's ""quick action"" over the novel coronavirus that has killed more than 300 people and infected more than 14,000 in mainland China and beyond, forcing governments around the world to take drastic measures. Kazakhstan has presently hospitalized over 40 people that returned to the country from China with flu-like symptoms, but has yet to confirm any cases of the disease. On Sunday evening Pompeo will fly to Uzbekistan, a country of 33 million that is emerging from nearly 3 decades of isolation. Pompeo also visited two other ex-Soviet countries – Belarus and Ukraine – as part of a trip that began with a stop in Britain. Ahead of the visit, Pompeo stressed that the Central Asian countries on his itinerary ""want to be sovereign and independent"", and Washington had ""an important opportunity to help them achieve that"". But he also acknowledged ""a lot of activity (in the region) – Chinese activity, Russian activity"". Washington has often struggled to keep a foothold in Central Asian states that were part of the Soviet Union up to its collapse in 1991. At the height of hostilities in Afghanistan after the September 11 attacks, NATO and the United States maintained important logistics centres in the region, but these have now closed. Russia has retained military bases and heads security and trade blocs that have helped to entrench its position there. But Central Asia also increasingly looks east to China's trillion-dollar Belt and Road global trade plan as a panacea to treat battered economies. Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan have both seen leadership transitions since John Kerry toured the region in 2015 -- the last US secretary of state to visit. In Kazakhstan, Pompeo was to meet President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev as well as his predecessor Nursultan Nazarbayev, who last year shocked Kazakhs by retiring from the presidency after nearly three decades in office. In Uzbekistan, he was to hold talks with President Shavkat Mirziyoyev, who has embarked on ambitious reforms, welcoming tourism and investment in the once-isolated republic while keeping the authoritarian system intact. Mirziyoyev's long-ruling hardline predecessor, Islam Karimov, turned his back on the United States in 2005 after a row over the Uzbek government's bloody crackdown on protests. The relationship had healed somewhat by the time of Karimov's death in 2016. Mirziyoyev, who visited Trump at the White House in 2018, has mused on the benefits of joining the Moscow-backed Eurasian Economic Union, a five-country bloc including Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan that is seen as a key vehicle for Russia to wield influence in the region. In addition to holding bilateral meetings, Pompeo on Monday in Tashkent will hold a meeting with foreign ministers from all five ex-Soviet Central Asian countries – Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.

Citing China's Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, Reuters reported on Saturday, February 1, that an outbreak of a ""highly pathogenic strain"" of H5N1 happened at a farm in the city of Shaoyang in Hunan. The farm had 7,850 chickens, of which 4,500 have died due to the bird flu. Chinese authorities have culled nearly 18,000 poultry following the H5N1 outbreak there.

(READ: Novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV: What we know so far) But beyond being tagged as ground zero of the latest coronavirus outbreak, what else do we need to know about Wuhan? Wuhan City is the capital of Hubei province located in Central China. It's about 838 kilometers west of Shanghai and 1,152 kilometers south of Beijing. The city has an area of 8,494 square kilometers and is divided into 13 districts, traversed by the great Yangtze and the Han Rivers. Its size is about half of Palawan's (17,030.75 square km). As of 2018, Wuhan’s population is estimated at 11 million, making it the 7th most populous city in China. Wuhan is one of the major manufacturing areas in China. In 2016, it was designated as a national central city under China’s national urban system plan, which means Wuhan is considered and expected to lead regional economic development, among others. The makeup of the city supports this goal since as of 2018, Wuhan is home to 3 national development zones, 4 scientific and technological development parks, and more than 300 research institutions, aside from enterprise incubators and enterprises. Its major industries include: automotive, advanced manufacturing, electronics, food processing, energy and environmental protection, and iron and steel, among others. Wuhan’s major exports, meanwhile, are machinery, organic chemicals, apparel, preserved foods, and automotive vehicles, often shipped to the United States, some parts of Europe, South Korea, India, Japan, Singapore, and Brazil. Among its biggest factories is the Dongfeng Motor Corporation, the state-owned automobile manufacturer which supplies key supplies to Western companies. MAIN HUB.

This photo taken in May 2014 shows passengers walking on the square outside Wuhan railway station in central China's Hubei province. File photo by AFP The city of Wuhan is considered a main transportation hub in China, earning the tag “jiu sheng tong qu” which refers to its accessibility to the country's 9 key provinces – Sichuan, Shanxi, Henan, Hunan, Guizhou, Jiangxi, Anhui, Jiangsu, and Hubei. Wuhan Railway Hub, managed by the China Railway Wuhan Group, is one of the 4 key railway hubs in China. It has 3 main passenger stations, with two servicing high-speed trains traversing key Chinese cities. More than two million people are estimated to use this transportation service at any given day before the virus outbreak. The city’s airport, Wuhan Tianhe International Airport, is considered one of the busiest in the country, being strategically located along China’s airline network. It opened in 1995 but only started doing international flights in 2000. Located 26 kilometers north of the Wuhan city center, the airport has ""non-stop passenger flights scheduled to 113 destinations in 22 countries,"" according to the FlightConnections website. In 2018, the international airport handled 24,500,356 passengers with at least 48 airlines using its facilities. Wuhan prides itself with its rich history, dating from when people first settled in the area more than 10,000 years ago. One of Wuhan’s districts, Wuchan, was the site of an uprising organized by imperial soldiers in 1911. The mutiny, according to historical records, was initiated by soldiers who sympathized with progressive leaders who were carrying out a protest movement against a railway crisis. The Wuchang Uprising is referred to as the turning point of the Xinhai Revolution, which eventually toppled the last imperial Qing dynasty, establishing the Republic of China and installing Sun Yat-sen as the first provisional president. In the past, Wuhan became the capital of China twice – in 1927 under the left-wing Kuomintang government which opposed the nationalist government led by Chiang Kai-shek, and as provisional capital during the 2nd Sino-Japanese War following the fall of Nanking in 1937. The Department of Foreign Affairs said that there are at least 150 Filipinos in Wuhan and another 150 in other parts of Hubei province. On January 28, the Philippine government said it is open to repatriate those who want to come home but they will be subjected to necessary screening and quarantine. Aside from Filipinos, there are also thousands of other foreigners who call Wuhan their temporary home, most of them students. Labeled as an education hub, Wuhan has more than 30 tertiary schools with students from all over the world. There are at least 1,500 foreign students in Wuhan University alone. In total, it welcomes about 3,000 foreign visitors for ""academic visits and exchanges"" annually.

With businesses closed for at least another week, classes suspended and airlines cancelling flights, many foreign students and workers see no reason to stay in the country while it struggles with the viral epidemic. (READ: Novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV: What we know so far) At Beijing's international airport on Sunday, February 2, the 19-year-old Uzbek student told Agence France-Presse he was heading home because his parents were worried about the virus, which has claimed over 300 lives and infected more than 14,000 across China. ""Maybe I will give up studying here,"" said the Yangzhou University student, who asked to be identified only as Max. Calling the situation ""dreadful,"" he expressed concern over the rising death toll and the restrictions other countries have imposed on travellers from China. After the World Health Organization declared a global health emergency, several countries – including the United States, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore and Israel – have barred foreign nationals from visiting if they had recently been in China. The travel bans have left many jittery. 'No reason to stay' A 46-year-old American said she was worried her flight home would be cancelled at the eleventh hour. ""My only hope is that I can go home. I have been standing here checking the flight schedules for any changes,"" said the woman, who declined to give her name. ""I can't be sure until the last minute."" Others, such as 22-year-old Jamie Bosch, are leaving because of work. ""We can't do anything, and everything is closed,"" said the English teacher. ""You can't see your friends. There's nothing to do, so I just decided to go home."" Bosch, who is from South Africa, said she was worried if she did contract the virus, she would be isolated, with no family support. ""(My family) said I need to go home,"" she said, adding that she would return when school re-opens in March. Chinese travellers affected Icaro Medeiros, 22, a student at Beijing's Central University of Finance and Economics, said his family cancelled their planned February visit to China after Beijing closed off tourist attractions such as the Great Wall and Forbidden City. ""I decided to leave Beijing because we are not sure when the semester will start again,"" he said. ""All of my friends have returned home, so there wasn't any reason for me to stay in Beijing alone."" Chinese citizens too have seen their plans derailed. Wang Yulu, 46, was on her way to the airport with her daughter on Saturday when they learned that Australia had barred non-citizens arriving from China. Her daughter was due to begin a university semester in Australia, but the pair were forced to turn back to Changchun city in northeast China even before they arrived at the airport. ""It can't be helped, we won't be going,"" said Wang. They don't want us Chinese citizens there."" – Rappler.com "

Domingo said that on February 3, RITM notified the DOH that the January 23 samples tested positive for 2019-nCoV. This showed that the woman was able to mount immunity against the virus by the time the January 24 samples were taken. Asked why it took the DOH two days to report the third confirmed case, Domingo said: ""We found out evening of February 3, and yesterday we were at the Senate. As you well know, the secretary was there the whole day, so we couldn’t have a press conference yesterday.""
