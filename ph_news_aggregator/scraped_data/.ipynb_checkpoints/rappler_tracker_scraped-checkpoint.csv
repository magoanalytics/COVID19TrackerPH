MANILA, Philippines – Philippine Airlines (PAL) terminated some 300 employees, as the company incurs losses primarily due to the travel bans caused by the novel coronavirus.
""The streamlining will strengthen the company in the wake of losses sustained in 2019, aggravated by the ongoing travel restrictions and flight suspensions to areas affected by COVID-19,"" PAL said on Friday, February 28, referring to the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.
The airline said that it implemented a ""voluntary separation initiative"" for long-serving employees and a retrenchment process on Friday.
PAL said that affected employees will receive ""appropriate separation benefits,"" as well as trip pass privileges.
Affected employees will also get career counseling and outplacement support.
""PAL continues to be focused on managing the risks related to the COVID-19 situation, in the interest of public health and safety,"" it said.
Parent firm PAL Holdings earlier told the Philippine Stock Exchange that it registered a total comprehensive loss of over P3 billion in the 1st semester of 2019, a sharp 355% increase from the total loss of P661.6 million during the same period in 2018.
PAL reported consolidated expenses amounting to P77.75 billion in the six-month period of 2019, 3.3% higher than the previous year's total of P75.27 billion.
The novel coronavirus that originated from Wuhan, China, has so far killed over 2,800 and sickened over 83,700 people across the country and worldwide. The World Health Organization already declared an international emergency over the virus.
As of Friday, the Philippines has recorded 3 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus, all of them Chinese. One died, while the other two recovered.
The DOH has also probed 621 patients in the Philippines for possible infection. Of this number, only 30 remain admitted to heath facilities nationwide, while 588 have been discharged. – Rappler.com

The World Health Organization earlier declared the outbreak an international emergency, warning that the novel coronavirus poses a ""very grave threat.""

Photo by Anthony Wallace / AFP 
MANILA, Philippines – The Philippine government is eyeing the repatriation of Filipinos in Macau, Health Assistant Secretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said on Friday, February 28.
Vergeire said in a news briefing that the Inter-agency Task Force (IATF) met to discuss the plan and were reaching out to the Macau government for the repatriation process.
The IATF is also discussing logistical matters, such as what kind of carrier the repatriates would be brought in, if they would travel by air or sea.
Vergeire said that the final decision may be reached after the IATF meeting this weekend.
Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles, an ex-officio member of the IATF, said in a news brieing earlier this week that at least 200 Filipinos in Macau have signified their desire to be repatriated.
Unlike the repatriates from Wuhan, China; and the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan, the DOH said that repatriates from Macau and other countries would not be brought to the New Clark City (NCC) in Capas, Tarlac, for quarantine.
Vergeire said that the Diamond Princess repatriates had a ""special situation,"" because the transmission dynamics are unique on the ship. Since it is a contained place, it is difficult to determine the circumstances of the people on board, so the Philippine government quarantined them in New Clark City where they could be closely monitored.
Since the possible repatriates from Macau were not subject to the same situation, the DOH would only consider them as persons-under-monitoring, subject to home-based quarantine. Vergeire noted that they would be strictly monitored.
The first batch of 49 Filipino repatriates from Hubei province were quarantined in NCC and discharged on February 21.
Four days later, 445 repatriates from the Diamond Princess were brought to NCC. The DOH reported that a total of 5 exhibited symptoms, although two had already tested negative for COVID-19. Three were still awaiting results. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – The Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) is investigating a foreign cargo vessel for allegedly violating the Philippines’ 14-day quarantine rule amid the novel coronavirus outbreak.
PCG Spokesperson Commodore Armand Balilio said that PCG Commandant Admiral Joel Garcia ordered the investigation of the Panama-flagged MV Harmony 6, which arrived at Poro Point in La Union on February 23.
Captain Luu Van Loi, MV Harmony 6 skipper, declared to Philippine authorities on February 23 that the ship left China on February 10, apparently to skirt the 14-day quarantine strictly implemented on ships coming from China and other areas with the coronavirus outbreak. 
The PCG said that based on the initial report, the MV Harmony 6 arrived in Changzhou, China, on February 13 and left that country on February 18. 
“Scheduled to have its next port call at the Port of Poro Point in La Union, Philippines, the crew of the vessel allegedly turned off its Automatic Identification System (AIS) from 19 February 2020 until its arrival in Philippine waters on 23 February 2020,” the PCG said.
The MV Harmony 6 was placed under temporary detention at the anchorage area pending PCG investigation.
“PCG will coordinate with BOQ to identify possible criminal charges if MV Harmony 6 will be found guilty of mentioned violations,” the PCG said.
Under the rule, foreign vessels that came from any country with reported COVID-19 cases should observe a 14-day period from its date of departure to its arrival in Philippines waters, before the Bureau of Quarantine (BOQ) conducts a health inspection on its crew. This is a requirement for the issuance of port clearance.
“However, due to the Captain’s misrepresentation of its date of departure from China, the BOQ team boarded the vessel to conduct the health inspection among its 18 Vietnamese and 5 Indian crew in just 6 days, instead of the required 14-day quarantine period,” the PCG said.
Fortunately, the PCG Command Center, with the help of the National Coast Watch Center (NCWC), managed to alert La Union port authorities about the altered date of departure on February 24, a few hours after the health inspection.
The Philippines has imposed a partial travel ban on China and its administrative regions Hong Kong and Macau to help prevent the spread of COVID-19. 
As of  Friday, the COVID-19 death toll in mainland China stands at 2,788, while there are 78,824 people infected with the virus there. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – The Department of Health (DOH) confirmed on Friday, February 28, that two more repatriates from the coronavirus-hit Diamond Princess cruise ship docked in Japan showed flu-like symptoms.
This brings the number of symptomatic repatriates to 5. Three, not feverish, were reported to exhibit symptoms on Thursday, February 27. However, the DOH announced that 2 of them had already tested negative for the coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The remaining 3 are awaiting results. 
The two new persons under investigation were brought to a referral health facility due to sore throat. Their specimens were collected and sent for testing at the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine.
“While we are still waiting for the other test results, we assure the public that our referral hospitals are well-equipped and prepared to handle COVID-19 cases once they arise. Our health response team at the quarantine facility is being extra cautious to prevent further health risks,” said Health Secretary Francisco Duque III.
Of the 538 Filipinos who were previously quarantined on the cruise ship docked in Yokohama, a total of 445 were repatriated late Tuesday night, February 25. They went through several layers of screening before, during, and after the flight to ensure they were asymptomatic and coronavirus-free.
All the Filipino repatriates from Diamond Princess are subject to another 14 days of quarantine from their arrival in New Clark City.
Eighty Filipino crew members have so far tested positive for COVID-19. These confirmed cases were left behind in hospitals in Japan. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – The World Health Organization (WHO) has cited 9 countries, including the Philippines, that show that the spread of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)  ""can be contained"" after these nations recorded no new positive cases in the past two weeks. 
“The key message that should give all countries hope, courage and confidence is that this virus can be contained. Indeed, there are many countries that have done exactly that,” WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a press briefing on Wednesday, February 26.
“Fourteen countries that have had cases have not reported a case for more than a week, and even more importantly, 9 countries have not reported a case for more than two weeks: Belgium, Cambodia, Finland, India, Nepal, Philippines, the Russian Federation, Sri Lanka, and Sweden,” he added. 
Still, the WHO Director-General clarified that this did not mean that new COVID-19 cases “may not came to these countries, but the cases that made it before have been contained.” 
COVID-19 is the name of the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.
The Philippines has so far recorded 3 confirmed COVID-19 cases, all Chinese travelers  from Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, who came to the Philippines in late January.  
Since then, the country has not reported any new confirmed cases, and no local transmission of the virus as of Friday, February 28.
The Department of Helath (DOH) is probing a total of 621 patients for possible infection, but only 30 remain admitted in hospitals nationwide. The other 588 patients under investigation have already been discharged. 
DOH Secretary Francisco Duque III told Rappler on Friday, February 28, that even with the WHO update served as ""inspiration"" for the Philippine government to remain vigilant in handling the COVID-19 threat.
“This should not be a reason for us to be complacent nor should we put our guards down. We should use this as inspiration to do better [in terms of containing COVID-19],” Duque said in a phone interview. 
A total of 442 Filipinos repatriated from the Diamond Princess  cruise ship earlier this week were on a 14-day quarantine at the New Clark City in Capas, Tarlac.
Another 3 repatriates started showing flu-like symptoms on Thursday, February 27, and were transferred to a hospital outside the quarantine center for further observation. – Rappler.com  "

MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – The Philippines is looking at banning travel to Japan, Italy, and Iran in light of the increasing cases of the novel coronavirus in the 3 countries, Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles said on Friday, February 28. 
In an interview with CNN Philippines, Nograles said that the country's task force is constantly assessing the situations in the 3 countries. ""Ayaw ko pangunahan (I don't want to preempt anything), but obviously the task force is looking at these countries as well,"" said Nograles.
He mentioned the importance of checking the situation in Iran, due to the large volume of Filipinos situated there.
""Hindi natin puwedeng balewalain ang Iran because we still have Filipinos in Iran – more than a thousand na mga kababayan natin ang naninirahan po diyan sa Iran. So tinitingnan din po namin iyan,"" he said. (We cannot brush off Iran because we still have Filipinos in Iran – more than a thousand of our countrymen live there. So we're taking a look at it too.)
The New York Times reported that the number of infections in Iran and Italy doubled in just two days, approaching 900 combined. Seventeen people in Italy died as of Friday, while 26 in Iran died as of Thursday.
Japan lists 214 cases with 4 deaths nationwide. In Yokohama, 538 Filipinos were previously quarantined aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship. Some 445 have been repatriated, while others who were symptomatic or contracted the COVID-19 disease stayed behind.
On Thursday, February 27, the Philippine government banned travel of Filipino tourists to South Korea, and also restricted travelers coming from its North Gyeongsang province. 
Travel ban criteria
In a February 28 press conference, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III enumerated the criteria for the inclusion of countries in travel bans. He said there are 4 factors to consider:

Presence of local transmission in the country proposed to be covered by the ban
Volume of travelers coming into the country
Context and threat based on international health regulations
Health expenditure per capita 

Duque also said they look into a particular country's entry restrictions on people traveling from China. If that country has no full restrictions from travelers from China, then that puts the country at a higher risk. 
The Inter-agency Task Force consider these in deciding if a travel ban would be partial or total. – Rappler.com "

File photo by Valerie Escalera/Presidential Photo 
MANILA, Philippines – House Minority Leader Bienvenido Abante Jr – who was supposed to have an official trip to Saudi Arabia – was barred from entering due to a temporary travel ban imposed on Filipino travelers due to the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) scare. 
But it seems the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) was not aware of the travel restrictions on the Philippines, as Assistant Secretary Eduardo Meñez said they are still getting the “exact details” on the ban as of Friday morning, February 28. 
“We are confirming the exact details of KSA acting’s on COVID restrictions. Thank you for this information about Cong Abante,” Meñez said in a text message to Rappler. 
Saudi Arabia has already banned pilgrims from visiting Islam's holiest sites there in attempt to contain the spread of COVID-19, the disease caused by 2019-nCoV.
According to Abante, he was scheduled speak to several overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) organizations in Jeddah, Saudia Arabia regarding the proposed Department of OFWs. 
He boarded an Emirates flight from the Philippines bound for Saudi Arabia on Wednesday, February 26, with a layover in Dubai. From there, he was supposed to take a connecting flight to Jeddah on Thursday, February 27.
While in Dubai, however, Abante’s airline informed him that he will no longer be allowed to enter Saudi Arabia because its government already barred Filipino tourists from entering due to the 2019-nCoV.  
But Abante thought he would still be able to travel since he had a diplomatic passport with him and was on an official House trip. 
“On Thursday, February 27, I was in Dubai and en route to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia on an official trip when I was informed by our airline that I would not be allowed to board my connecting flight to Jeddah due to sguidelines issued by the Saudi government prohibiting the entry of Filipino nationals possessing tourist visas,” Abante said in a statement.  
“While I am aware that these travel restrictions are in place to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 virus, to my knowledge government functionaries on official trips are not covered by this ban – including myself, as I am a government official traveling with a diplomatic passport and a travel authority issued by the House of Representatives,” he added. 
In the end, Abante was forced to just stay in Dubai for now and is expected to fly back to Manila over the weekend. 
Still, the Manila 6th District congressman understands the precautionary measures that had to be taken by Saudi Arabia to help prevent the spread of COVID-19. 
“Be that as it may, given the threats posed by the COVID-19 outbreak, I understand and respect the precautions being undertaken by governments worldwide to protect their populations from this disease, and trust that our Department of Foreign Affairs will work to clarify matters regarding this unfortunate misunderstanding,” Abante said.  
As of Friday, the Philippines has recorded no local transmission of 2019-nCoV. The 3 confirmed cases recorded in the country were all Chinese nationals, one of whom died while the other two recovered from their symptoms. 
To date, the Department of Health is probing a total of 621 patients for possible infection, but only 30 remain admitted in hospitals nationwide.

The disembarkation of about 240 crew members, including many foreign nationals, is expected to last several days, according to the Japan health ministry.
They will stay at the National Tax College in Wako, Saitama Prefecture, near Tokyo for further monitoring by doctors, and can leave the facility only after testing negative for the virus, the ministry said.

Since the outbreak, which has resulted in 3 confirmed cases and one death in the Philippines, churches have also discouraged worshippers from holding hands during mass.

She was among thousands of people, some wearing surgical masks, who lined up at Baclaran church in Manila for services on Wednesday.
Ash Wednesday marks the beginning of Lent, the run-up to Easter, and includes Catholics having crosses drawn in ash on their foreheads.
The Philippines is overwhelmingly Catholic, with some 80% of its people said to be believers. Its unique brand of the religion also includes gruesome annual re-enactments of the crucifixion of Jesus Christ.
Local church officials have also ""strongly recommended"" that Catholics do not kiss or touch the cross during Good Friday services, which is usually common practice.

MANILA, Philippines – Philippine health officials have stopped tracking down other people who came into contact with the 3 Chinese visitors who tested positive for the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) while in the country in late January.  In a press conference on Wednesday, February 26, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said there would be no more contact tracing efforts in relation to the 3 cases because the 14-day incubation period for 2019-nCoV had long passed, and there were no other confirmed cases being reported so far.
Duque made the statement in response when asked whether the rest of the people who came into contact with the 3 confirmed cases were still the subject of contact tracing. During the briefing, it was learned that the Department of Health managed to trace 67% of these people so far.
Asked if the DOH was still looking for the other people that the 3 Chinese travelers had come into contact with while in the country, Duque said: “Wala na, kasi lampas na lampas ang incubation period natin.... There is no indication of the group or groups that might have been exposed to the 3 Chinese nationals, mukhang walang indication na nagkasakit sila. Kasi kung nagkasakit sila ay dapat nakita na ‘yan sa mga ospital natin,” said Duque.  
(There will be no contact tracing for now because it’s way, way past the incubation period.... There is no indication that the groups that might have been exposed to the 3 Chinese nationals got sick. Because if they did, then our hospitals would have found out already.) 
The DOH chief said the government would instead focus its efforts on strengthening the capacities of health facilities nationwide to prevent the spread of COVID-19 – the disease caused by the novel coronavirus – should another patient test positive for it.
“So doon na lang...level ng gamutan, doon na lang dapat ibuhos ang dapat ang lahat ng dapat isagawa ng DOH (So on the level of treatment, that’s where the DOH should focus its efforts),” Duque said.  
The Philippines has so far recorded 3 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus, all of them Chinese who arrived in the Philippines in January. One died, while the other two recovered. 
The Philippine government came under fire during a Senate hearing on February 4, after it was revealed that there was an apparent lack of communication between the DOH, the Civil Aeronautics Board, and the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines on contact tracing for possible COVID-19 cases.
As of 5 pm on Wednesday, there were 614 patients under investigation (PUIs) in the Philippines for possible 2019-nCoV infection. Of this number, 101 remained in health facilities across the country, while the other 510 were already discharged.

There are at least 84 Filipinos confirmed to have the virus, but all are based outside the Philippines, including two in the United Arab Emirates, one in Hong Kong, one in Singapore, and 80 who were aboard a cruise ship quarantined in Japan.
The World Health Organization earlier declared the outbreak an international emergency, warning that the novel coronavirus poses a ""very grave threat.""
So far, the virus has killed 2,715 and infected more than 77,000 people in China. Cases have been recorded in at least 33 countries. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – The Philippine Stock Exchange index (PSEi) dipped to 6,909 on Wednesday, February 26, its lowest level in more than a year, as the novel coronavirus continued to spread fear among investors.
The PSEi lost 277 points or almost 4% and went as low as 6,879 within the trading day. This is its weakest since November 13, 2018, when it closed at 6,843.
This is also the biggest 1-day percentage drop since January 11, 2016, when it fell by 4.4%.
In an email to Rappler, the PSE said the index lost a staggering P401.5 billion in market value.
All sub-indices were in the red, with industrial and property leading the decline.
The most actively traded companies were Ayala Land (down 6.6%), BDO (down 4.4%), SM Prime (down 2%), SM Investments (down 2.5%), and Jollibee (down 5.7%).
Luis Limlingan of Regina Capital said Philippine shares stumbled as more companies abroad indicated earnings would be affected from the spread of the novel coronavirus.
Limlingan said the next support level is at 6,800. If it breaks that level, the next support would be at 6,600.
A support is a price level where the decline in stock prices is expected to pause as investors start buying the losing shares. As prices drop, demand for the stock increases or stabilizes.
Ayala's Integrated Micro Electronics, which was down by over 8%, has temporarily closed its factories in China due to the outbreak.
SM Malls president Steven Tan said in an ANC interview that their malls in China are like ""ghost towns.""
Fast-food giant Jollibee has temporarily closed 14 of its Yonghe King stores in the Chinese province of Hubei. Wuhan City, the epicenter of the outbreak, is in Hubei.
There were 184 decliners and 27 advancers on Wednesday, while 30 remained unchanged.
Foreign buying stood at P4.47 billion, while foreign selling was at P7.56 billion. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines (3rd UPDATE) – The Philippines on Wednesday, February 26, temporarily prohibited Filipino tourists from traveling to South Korea due to the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) scare.
The Philippine government also banned the the entry of travelers from South Korea’s North Gyeongsang province, which has been grappling with an outbreak of COVID-19, the disease cuased by the novel coronavirus.
“Any travel to South Korea will be temporarily suspended,” Department of Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said in a press conference but added groups of people not covered by the ban.
Duque said permanent residents, overseas Filipino workers with jobs in South Korea, and students based in that country will still be allowed to travel to South Korea, subject to proper precautionary measures.  
Before proceeding to South Korea, those who are not covered by the travel ban will be required to sign a declaration that they know and understand the risks involved in traveling to South Korea.
As of 3:40 pm on Wednesday, South Korea recorded the highest number of 2019-nCoV cases outside mainland China at 1,146. Of this number, 12 died while 22 had recovered from COVID-19.
In the case of the ban on the entry of travelers from North Gyeongsang province, Duque clarified that ""Filipinos and their foreign spouses and children, and holders of permanent resident and diplomatic visas will be allowed entry subject to exiting screening and quarantine protocols.""
Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles said the inter-agency task force decided to impose only a partial travel ban on those arriving from North Gyeongsang because the South Korean government gave its assurance that it will be able to isolate the 2019-nCoV cases there.
""There's an assurance from the South Korean government that they'll be able to contain 'yong problema at isolated, most of the cases are isolated in these two areas, meaning to say mostly Daegu City and Cheongdo county. But in-expand na rin natin [ang travel ban] sa buong province of North Gyeongsang,"" Nograles said.
(There's an assurance from the South Korean government that they'll be able to contain the problem and most of the cases are isolated in these two areas, meaning to say mostly Daegu City and Cheongdo county. But we decided to expand the travel ban to the entire province of North Gyeongsang.
Presidential Spokesperson Salvador Panelo said in a news briefing on Wednesday that the government body on top of COVID-19-related measures would determine the need for an expanded South Korea travel ban.
“The Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases shall conduct a risk assessment of the situation in the aforesaid country within 48 hours to analyze whether it is necessary to expand the travel ban” to cover other parts of South Korea, Panelo said, adding that “strict protocols” will be observed on travelers arriving from areas not covered by the ban.
South Korea is the Philippines' number one source of foreign tourists, followed by China. Earlier this month, the Philippine government imposed a travel ban on travelers from China, Macau, and Hong Kong over the COVID-19 outbreak.
Big question
A big question, however, is how authorities in either country would be able to distinguish travelers who have been to North Gyeongsang, from those who have not. Most flights coming into the Philippines from South Korea take off from Busan, Incheon, or Jeju, with passengers from different areas.
“Hindi ko alam kung paano ang kanilang protocol doon (I don’t know about their protocol there). I will ask them how. Siguro (Maybe) in cooperation with the Korean government because…they’re also trying very hard to contain the spread of the virus so magkakaroon siguro sila ng coordination (they’ will probably have coordination),” Panelo replied.
South Korea has reported more than 1,100 confirmed cases of COVID-19 – the name of the disease  the novel coronavirus, the largest number of infections outside China. There have been 11 deaths from the disease in the country.
The vast majority – 90% – of the recent infections were in Daegu, South Korea’s fourth-largest city and the epicenter of the outbreak, and the neighboring province of North Gyeongsang, Agence France-Presse reported.
In the Philippines, health officials have probed 610 patients for the virus. There had been 3 confirmed cases of infection – all Chinese tourists – of whom one died and two recovered.
A total of 84 Filipinos have contracted the virus outside the Philippines – two in the United Arab Emirates, one in Hong Kong, one in Singapore, and 80 who were onboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan. – Rappler.com "

Before disembarking the plane, the Filipinos were first assessed for possible symptoms of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. They will undergo another health assessment upon arrival at New Clark City.
The Department of Health (DOH) said only those who will show no signs of COVID-19 will be asked to stay at the Athletes' Village for their 14-day quarantine period.
Should a repatriate show signs of the new disease, he or she will be immediately brought to a hospital and isolated from other patients for further observation.
As of Tuesday, a total of 80 Filipinos caught the novel coronavirus while aboard the Diamond Princess, which had been in quarantine since February 4 at the port of Yokohama in Japan following the spread of the virus among the ship's crew and passengers. Ten of them have since recovered and been discharged.
None of these 80 positive cases, however, were included in the Philippine government's repatriation program for now.
There were a total of 3,700 people onboard the ship, including 531 Filipino crew members and 7 Filipino passengers. 
As of Tuesday, the Philippines has recorded 3 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus, all of them Chinese. One died, while the other two recovered.
The DOH has also probed 610 patients in the Philippines for possible infection. Of this number, only 98 remain admitted to heath facilities nationwide, while 509 have been discharged. – with reports from JC Gotinga/Rappler.com  "

MANILA, Philippines – Filipino tracksters continue to gear up for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics despite the threat of the novel coronavirus outbreak.
Pole vaulter EJ Obiena, the first Filipino to qualify for Tokyo, has been mapping out his preparation plans with Ukrainian coach Vitali Petrov which center around competing and training in California, USA and Europe. 
Obiena, who cleared 5.8 meters to punch his Olympic ticket, was slated to see action in the Asian Indoor Championships and the World Indoor Championships in China in March but both events were postponed. 
World Athletics, formerly known as the IAAF, decided to call off both championships due the coronavirus outbreak. 
Obiena and Petrov will unveil their new plans on February 25.
Like Obiena, three-time SEA Games 400m hurdles gold medalist Eric Cray was forced to tweak his plans following the postponement of the events in China and he instead competed in two indoor meets in New Mexico, USA. 
He can make the Olympics by meeting the qualifying standard of 48.8 seconds or by being ranked in the world's top 50 by the end of the qualifying date on June 29.
Cray will be suiting up in several top-notch competitions in the USA in the next 4 or 5 months.
Meanwhile, William Morrison achieved a distance of 20.21 meters in shotput in a meet in Indiana, USA earlier February – a mark that compares favorably with the qualifying standard of 21.1 meters.
In a conversation with Philippine Athletics Track and Field Association president Philip Ella Juico, Morrison expressed confidence in meeting the qualifying standard ""with a lot of hard work and technical adjustments.""
Kristina Knott, who lorded over the 200m sprint in the 2019 SEA Games, was also affected by the cancellation of the events in China. 
The Florida-based runner will compete in the Texas relays before she moves to Orlando and train there until the rest of the outdoor races are confirmed for April and beyond.
Knott will then have stops in San Antonio and Austin in Texas and in Japan and Italy. 
Pole vaulter Natalie Uy, the 2019 SEA games gold medalist and a 2019 Asian Championship bronze medalist, recently set a new Philippine indoor record of 4.25 m. 
Uy participated in the Pole Vault Summit in Nevada and will play in several outdoor events in the months to come. 
Christine Hallasgo, who emerged as the surprise marathon gold medalist in the 2019 SEA Games, proved her victory was no fluke by winning the MILO National Marathon this month in Tarlac City. 
Meanwhile, the rest of the 50-string PATAFA national pool are preparing for regional meets, national championships, and the Philippine National Athletics Championships. – Rappler.com "

SINGAPORE – The Singaporean Ministry of Health (MOH) said the first Filipino novel coronavirus patient is now in stable condition as of Monday, February 24.
His identity remains anonymous due to Singapore's privacy laws.
""We have verified with the MOH that the patient is in stable condition in the hospital,"" said Philippine Ambassador to Singapore Joseph Yap in a media briefing Monday afternoon, February 24.
Yap said the Singapore government has not disclosed the identity of the Filipino. The most that Singapore has relayed to the Philippine embassy is that the Filipino is a male 41-year-old permanent resident of the city-state. The patient does not have a recent travel history to China.
Yap also confirmed that the Filipino is Singapore's Case 89 of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.
The MOH provided information about Case 89 in its novel coronavirus bulletin on Sunday, February 23. Below is an excerpt from the MOH bulletin, as quoted verbatim:
6. Case 89 is a 41 year-old male Singapore Permanent Resident who has no recent travel history to China. He is currently warded in an isolation room at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID).
7. He reported onset of symptoms on 3 February and had sought treatment at two general practitioner (GP) clinics on 3 February, 7 February, 10 February, 17 February and 21 February. He was referred to NCID on 21 February, and subsequent test results confirmed COVID-19 infection on 22 February morning.
8. Prior to hospital admission, he had gone to work at Affinity Equity Partners (S) Pte Ltd (8 Temasek Boulevard) and visited Bishan Community Club (51 Bishan Street 13). He stays at Serangoon Avenue 3.
Travel ban not recommended
Yap said that despite Case 89, he is not recommending travel restrictions against Singapore because the novel coronavirus situation here is improving. Earlier, Philippine Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr also said he is opposing a travel ban to Singapore, citing the city-state's capacity to handle the outbreak.
""I know it's one case that hits close to home because it's a kababayan (countryman) who is ill, but on the other hand, in terms of the bigger picture in the whole of Singapore, I think the situation is better now than it was one or two weeks ago,"" Yap said.
In an earlier phone interview with Rappler, Yap advised Filipinos, ""I think we should just continue to be careful, to be cautious, but there's no reason to be panicking.""
In the first few weeks after Singapore got its first case of COVID-19, the city-state had the highest number of novel coronavirus cases outside China. It has since been overtaken by South Korea and Japan.
Singapore has at least 89 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus, according to data from the Singaporean government as of Sunday evening. Of these cases, 65 contracted the virus in Singapore while 24 got it outside the country.
The Singaporean government said 49 patients have been discharged, 35 are stable, and 5 others remain in critical condition. No one has died due to the virus in Singapore. – Rappler.com "

REMITTANCES. Filipino workers line up to send money to their families. File photo by Pat Nabong/Rappler  
MANILA, Philippines – The Philippine government expects that the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak would only have a ""minimal effect"" on the total cash remittances from overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) by the end of 2020.
Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles said in a press conference on Monday, February 24, that the government foresees a decrease of 0.8 percentage points in total cash remittance growth in 2020 – from the initial projection of 3% to just 2.2% – as an effect of COVID-19, the disease caused by 2019-nCoV.
""Because of this COVID-19 epidemic, we have adjusted our growth projections to 2.2% and now expect $34.2 billion in remittances for 2020. Nevertheless, this shall still breach another record high in overseas Filipino remittances,"" Nograles said.
He said the government had initially expected OFW remittances to reach as high as $34.5 billion by the end of this year. But Nograles said they had to adjust their projections due to the partial travel ban on China and its administrative regions Hong Kong and Macau.
The government has already allowed some 25,000 Filipinos to return to their jobs or homes in Hong Kong and Macau after being stranded in the Philippines due to the travel ban.
Nograles said the existing travel restrictions, however, would not severely affect OFW remittances as mainland China accounts for only 0.1% of total OFW remittances, Hong Kong 2.7%, and Macau 0.4%.
""DOLE (Department of Labor and Employment) also assures us that remittances from other source countries such as the US, UAE, and Saudi Arabia may help compensate for the possible slowdown in remittances coming from China, Macau, and Hong Kong. And we are encouraged by historical data that shows that Philippine remittances have been resilient even in the face of global downtrends,"" added the Cabinet secretary.
In 2019, personal remittances from OFWs reached a record high of $33.5 billion, which is 3.9% higher than the $32.2 billion recorded in 2018.
As of Monday, the Philippines has recorded 3 confirmed cases of COVID-19, all of them Chinese. One died, while the other two recovered.
The Department of Health has probed 609 patients in the Philippines for possible infection. Of this number, 126 remain admitted in heath facilities nationwide, while 480 have been discharged. – Rappler.com "

HANOI, Vietnam – Teacher Brenda* from Baguio City has been waiting for classes to resume after Vietnam’s Ministry of Education and Training (MET) extended the Lunar New Year break due to the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) scare.
“If the forced vacation extends to another week, I’ll just stay home and wait. But if they extend it longer, I’ll start looking for an alternative source of income,” Brenda, 37, said.
Brenda is among the many Filipino English teachers in Vietnam who are losing income since the MET suspended classes as a preventive measure against the COVID-19 pandemic.
The suspension of classes began on February 3. Since then, classes have not resumed, preventing many Filipinos working at English Learning Centers from earning their daily wages.
According to Brenda, her employer cannot pay her for the month of February because the students’ parents asked for a reimbursement of the tuition fee they paid for their children’s English language lessons.
Teacher Mary, 23, from Ilocos Sur, came back to Hanoi after spending the Lunar New Year break in the Philippines. She has been staying with her sister since. She is working in Hai Duong, a province in Northern Vietnam, but she has not yet returned to her workplace because of the class suspension.
“I am not expecting I’ll get paid this month because I did not teach,” she said.
The MET released its directive for a week of cancellation of classes on the first week of February. The second directive was released for the city of Ho Chi Minh on February 14, which stated that classes are cancelled until February 29. The city of Hanoi and 62 provinces were later included in the directive.
Teacher Cecilia, 40, from Mankayan in Benguet, has a full-time contract with a “big” English center. Her school moved some of her classes to an online platform. Her teaching hours are lesser but she will still earn her monthly salary. However, she has to offset her teaching hours once the school resumes its regular schedule.
Both Brenda and Mary are working for “small” English centers and have a full-time contract with their employers.

The three Filipinos, like many other English teachers in Vietnam, are waiting for further announcement from the MET after the Municipal People’s Committee of Ho Chi Minh requested an extension of the school break until the end of March.
This could mean two months of no income for many Filipino English teachers.
Meanwhile, online hubs like Filipino English Teachers in Vietnam and Filipino Expats in Vietnam have offered their help to those greatly affected by the crisis.
On Facebook community pages, Filipinos in different parts of Vietnam wrote they were willing to take in kababayans (countrymen) who are in need of a place to stay while ""this remains unsolved and 'till classes resume.""
Vietnam has recorded 16 cases COVID-19 infection, where 15 have recovered and been discharged from the hospital. Vietnam also closed its borders to China for the meantime.

MANILA, Philippines – Around 400 Filipinos on board the Diamond Princess cruise ship docked in Japan are set to come home on Tuesday, February 25, according to Department of Health (DOH) Assistant Secretary Maria Rosario Vergeire.
Vergeire confirmed the repatriation date on Monday, February 24, after DOH coordination with the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Philippine embassy in Tokyo.
Although over 400 Filipinos requested repatriation, the exact number of repatriates will be known only on Tuesday. Vergeire said they would still be subject to a screening process that would include testing and assessment if they have signs and symptoms of the COVID-19 disease. 
Those who test positive or exhibit symptoms prior to disembarking will be left behind, along with the 59 novel coronavirus-positive crew members in Japan. 
The repatriates will depart on two carriers. While they are on board the aircraft, the DOH will conduct regular monitoring. Those who manifest signs of respiratory illness will be isolated in one area of the plane. The planes are set to arrive at the Clark International Airport, where another layer of screening will be conducted upon landing.
Those who manifest illness will be brought to hospitals, while asymptomatic passengers will be taken to New Clark City in Tarlac for a two-week quarantine period.
""During the 14-day quarantine procedure, 20 medical teams from DOH hospitals will manage the quarantine facility to provide appropriate health services. Patients will be checked twice a day and provided with food and basic provisions,"" the DOH said.
A total of 538 Filipinos had been quarantined aboard the Diamond Princess docked at the port of Yokohama, Japan, since the outbreak of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which infected a total of 763 people aboard the ship.
Left behind for now
The 59 crew members who are COVID19-positive will not be included in the repatriation on Tuesday. They are currently in hospitals in Japan. If they test negative twice within 48 hours and exhibit no more symptoms, then they will be cleared to go home.
The two Filipinos in Japan who previously tested positive but recovered from the coronavirus will not be included in Tuesday's repatriation.
According to Vergeire, the Japanese government assured the Philippine government that the Filipinos who won't be going home yet will be taken care of.
Less than 20 Filipino ship crew members will be left behind, as designated by their employers. 
As of Monday, the confirmed cases in the Philippines has been stable at 3 for the past weeks. One died and two recovered and have been discharged from the hospital. The DOH has probed 609 for possible novel coronavirus infection, but 480 have been released. There remains 126 patients in various health facilities nationwide. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – The Philippine government will not yet impose a travel ban on South Korea, which has so far recorded the highest number of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) cases outside of mainland China.
On Monday, February 24, Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles told Malacañang reporters that the inter-agency task force handling the 2019-nCoV outbreak has yet to talk about possibly restricting travel to and from South Korea.
He said the Philippine government would be relying on existing protocols and recommendations from the World Health Organization (WHO) before imposing another travel ban.
""Sa ngayon wala pang desisyon 'no? Pag-uusapan ito sa task force,"" Nograles said. (Right now there's still no decision on this, okay? The task force will still talk about it.)
There has been a surge of 2019-nCoV infections in South Korea in the past days, with the country recording 763 confirmed cases as of 1:50 pm on Monday. Of this number, 7 people have died while 18 have recovered from COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus. (READ: South Korea on frontline as coronavirus spreads)
Nograles assured the public that none of those who tested positive in South Korea is a Filipino.
""So far, Filipinos there are safe, and I think the South Korean government is also doing everything that they can to contain the epidemic and control the situation,"" said the Cabinet secretary in a mix of English and Filipino.
For now, the Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs has advised Filipinos to ""delay non-essential travel"" to South Korea.
The Philippines is currently imposing a partial travel ban on China and its administrative regions Hong Kong and Macau to help prevent the spread of COVID-19. But the government has already allowed some 25,000 Filipinos to return to their jobs or homes in Hong Kong and Macau after being stranded in the Philippines due to the travel ban. – Rappler.com  "

MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – The number of Filipino crew members aboard Japanese cruise ship M/V Diamond Princess who have been infected with the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has risen to 59 as of Monday, February 24. 
The latest figure was announced by both Health Assistant Secretary Maria Rosario Vergeire and Foreign Affairs Assistant Secretary Eduardo Meñez during the weekly “Laging Handa” press briefing in Malacañang on Monday.  
THe 59 infected cases include two crew members who have already recovered from COVID-19, the disease caused by 2019-nCoV.  
“To date, 59 out of the 538 overseas Filipinos from the cruise ship had been confirmed with COVID-19. Two of the confirmed cases have recovered since isolation and admission [in health facilities],” Vergeire said. 
A total of 538 Filipinos – only 7 of whom are passengers while the rest are crew members – had been quarantined aboard the Diamond Princess docked at the port of Yokohama, Japan, since the outbreak of 2019-nCov, which infected a total of 763 people aboard the ship. 
Over 400 Filipinos from Diamond Princess have already requested to be repatriated to the Philippines. But Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles said their trip back to the country, originally set on Sunday, February, 23, was postponed to sometime this week “out of an abundance of caution to further safeguard the health and safety of our kababayans (countrymen).”
The Cabinet officials did not specify the new flight schedules of the Filipinos to be repatriated from Japan, but the DOH said in a briefing later on Monday afternoon that the repatriation will happen on Tuesday, February 25. (READ: Virus ship crew's families fear for kin as PH evacuation postponed)
None of the 52 positive cases will be allowed to go back to the Philippines, while those that will be allowed to enter the country will be subjected to a 14-day quarantine period at the New Clark City in Capas, Tarlac, the designated national quarantine facility for possible COVID-19 cases.
Meñez also said several Filipino crew members will be asked by their employer, Magsaysay Maritime Corporation, to stay behind to keep the cruise ship running, but only “essential” staff will be asked to work.  
“Actually even before na in-announce ’yong essential crew, I believe over 100 of our crew members nagsabi na rin sila na they were willing to stay behind should it be required by the employer. Pero as the situation developed, mukhang ang [Diamond Princess management] mismo ang nagsabi na titingnan namin kung sino lang ang crew member na essential,” Meñez said. 
(Actually, even before they announced that an essential crew will be needed, I believe over 100 of our crew members already expressed they were willing to stay behind should it be required by the employer. But as the situation developed, it looks the Diamond Princess management itself said they would still have to check who only among the crew members would be considered essential for the operations.) 
As of Monday, the Philippines has so far recorded 3 confirmed cases of COVID-19. One of them died, but the other two recovered and have since been discharged from the hospital.  The Department of Health has probed 609 patients in the Philippines for possible novel coronavirus infection. Of this number, 126 remain admitted in various heath facilities nationwide, while 480 have been released. – Rappler.com "

SINGAPORE – The Philippine government is not implementing a travel ban against Singapore even if close to 90 individuals here, including a Filipino permanent resident of the city-state, have contracted the novel coronavirus.
Praising how the Singaporean government has handled the crisis, Philippine Ambassador to Singapore Joseph Yap said he will not recommend travel restrictions against Singapore. His superior, Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr, earlier said he will also oppose a travel ban against the city-state.
“It’s unfortunate that we have a kababayan (countryman) affected by the virus, but the overall situation in Singapore really, I think, is stable and is in fact improving,” Yap told Rappler late Sunday evening, February 23. (READ: Singapore announces $4.6-billion boost to fight virus)
Yap cited information from the Singaporean Ministry of Health (MOH) that on Sunday there were no new cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, in Singapore. Two were discharged from the hospital on the same day.
This brings to 51 the number of people who have recovered from COVID-19 in Singapore, which has 89 recorded cases of the disease as of Sunday.
“I think whatever protocols and procedures that Singapore has in place, seem to be showing results. If anything, there is even less reason now to have travel restrictions of any kind compared to one or two weeks ago,” Yap said.
He added, “I think we should just continue to be careful, to be cautious, but there's no reason to be panicking.”
What’s at stake
If a travel ban against Singapore is imposed, Yap said that “definitely, it will be very inconvenient for everybody.” 
The ambassador noted that Singapore is one of the Philippines’ top trading partners. Singapore is the Philippines’ top export market in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, and the Philippines’ 5th biggest in the world, according to data from the Philippine embassy. Singapore is also the Philippines’ second largest international investor.
The embassy added that Singapore is the Philippines’ biggest tourist market in ASEAN.
“It’s not as simple as just saying, you know, we’ll ban people for health reasons. We have to seriously weigh the pros and cons, whether the damage will be much more than what we’re trying to prevent,” Yap explained.
Locsin earlier also opposed a travel ban against Singapore, as he tweeted on February 14: “I will not support a travel ban to and from ASEAN Singapore. A ban should hinge NOT on the incidence and number of infections/fatalities but on the demonstrated capability of the state concerned to contain the disease and strictly regulate ingress and egress from its air/seaports.”
The MOH on Sunday informed the Philippine embassy that a male Filipino permanent resident of Singapore contracted the novel coronavirus. Singapore has not disclosed the identity of the Filipino patient, and will only give more information to the Philippine government if the Filipino gives his consent.
Singapore will shoulder the Filipino patient’s hospital bills, as the city-state does with other COVID-19 cases. Yap said the Philippine embassy however is willing to help in reaching out to the Filipino patient’s relatives or flying them into Singapore if needed. 
In the first few weeks after Singapore got its first case of COVID-19, the city-state had the highest number of novel coronavirus cases outside China. It has since been overtaken by South Korea and Japan.
Singapore has at least 89 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus, according to data from the Singaporean government as of Sunday evening. Of these cases, 65 contracted the virus in Singapore while 24 got it outside the country.
The Singaporean government said 49 patients have been discharged, 35 remain stable, and 5 others remain in critical condition. No one has died due to the virus in Singapore.  – Rappler.com "

SINGAPORE (UPDATED) – The Singaporean government is investigating the close contacts of the first Filipino case of the novel coronavirus here, as the patient, whose identity Singapore has not disclosed, did not recently travel to China.
Philippine Ambassador to Singapore Joseph Yap confirmed these details to Rappler late Sunday evening, February 23, as he said the Philippine embassy is ready to help the Filipino coronavirus patient.
""The patient has no recent travel history to China, and they are still investigating his close contacts to find out more about where he could have gotten the virus from,"" Yap told Rappler.
Yap said it is possible that the patient's close contacts are also Filipinos, ""but it's hard to speculate."" He noted that Singapore's protocol for all coronavirus patients here is to trace their close contacts and to test them for the virus, if necessary.
The Filipino ""is now in isolation"" at Singapore's National Centre for Infectious Diseases, said Foreign Affairs Undersecretary Brigido Dulay earlier on Sunday.
It was also on Sunday evening when Singapore's Ministry of Health (MOH) advised the Philippine embassy about the Filipino patient, Yap said.
The most that the MOH disclosed was that the Filipino is a male permanent resident of Singapore, according to Yap. The patient needs to give his consent to the Singaporean government before his identity can be disclosed to the Philippine embassy.
""We do not know the identity because the MOH has not shared it with us for privacy reasons,"" the ambassador said.
Yap said that based on the Singaporean government's protocol, Singapore will shoulder the hospital bills of the Filipino patient and all other novel coronavirus cases. (READ: Singapore announces $4.6-billion boost to fight virus)
But the Philippine embassy can help by contacting his relatives or flying them into Singapore, if needed, using the Philippine government's fund to assist overseas Filipinos.
""We stand ready to render all the assistance that he would need,"" Yap said.
'No reason to panic'
Singapore has at least 89 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus, according to data from the Singaporean government as of Sunday evening. Of these cases, 65 contracted the virus in Singapore while 24 got it outside the country.
The Singaporean government said 49 patients have been discharged, 35 remain stable, and 5 others remain in critical condition. No one has died due to the virus in Singapore.
Singapore now has the 3rd highest number of novel coronavirus patients outside China. The country used to have the biggest number of patients outside China, but South Korea now has at least 602 confirmed cases. Japan has 132.
These figures exclude the 634 patients from the cruise ship Diamond Princess, docked in Japan.
Sought for words of reassurance for Filipinos in Singapore, Yap said: ""My advice is still the same: We should remain calm. Yes, there is one case, but we should continue to remain calm and continue to exercise vigilance. We really should continue to follow the advisories from the Ministry of Health.""
He added that ""the Singapore government has actually been doing a good job in terms of implementing their protocols."" He pointed out, for instance, that the number of novel coronavirus cases has been going down while the number of discharged patients has been going up.
""The trend is positive, and I personally feel that the situation now is more stable than it was maybe one or two weeks ago. I think we should just continue to be careful, to be cautious, but there's no reason to be panicking,"" Yap said. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – The Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) advised Filipinos to ""delay non-essential travel"" to South Korea, as the East Asian country raised its alert level for the novel coronavirus to the highest on Sunday, February 23.
There is currently no ban on Filipinos traveling to South Korea, but the DFA said ""travelers are cautioned to delay non-essential travel to the country as a precaution.""
South Korea reported 169 new infections and 3 more deaths on Sunday, bringing the total number of infections to 602 and the total number of deaths to 5.
South Korea now has the most infections outside of China, aside from the Diamond Princess cruise ship docked in Japan. More than 600 passengers and crew of the cruise ship have tested positive.
The DFA said the Philippine embassy in Seoul is closely monitoring the situation and coordinating with the Filipino community.
""The embassy has not received information that there are Filipinos in South Korea infected by COVID-19,"" said the DFA, referring to the disease caused by the virus.
""Filipinos in South Korea experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 should immediately contact the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention at 1339.""
For emergencies, the DFA said Filipinos in South Korea may also call the Philippine embassy at (+82) 10-9263-8119.
As of Sunday, at least 55 Filipinos have contracted the virus, all based outside the Philippines. Two are in the United Arab Emirates, one in Hong Kong, one in Singapore, and 51 from the Diamond Princess. (READ: Filipino coronavirus case in Singapore didn't travel to China)
In the Philippines, there have been 3 confirmed cases, all Chinese. One of them died, while the other two recovered.

MANILA, Philippines – House Deputy Speaker Johnny Pimentel urged the government to brace for a drop in tourism resulting to loss of thousands of jobs due to the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) that broke out in China, a major market in the Philippine hospitality industry.
“We have to put together a plan to help these displaced workers transition to other jobs,” Pimentel said in a statement on Sunday, February 23.
Pimentel projected the Philippine stands to lose up to 1.2 million Chinese visitors in 2020, primarily because of the travel ban on mainland China. Even if the virus is suppressed and the travel ban lifted, he said “the damage has already been done” and that a rebound would take longer than the country would wish.
Pimentel urged the Department of Tourism (DOT) and the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) to draw up an emergency skills retooling and jobs plan for thousands of workers facing layoffs.
The House leader also reminded the Social Security System to give out P20,000 in unemployment insurance to workers who would be involuntarilty separated.
In 2019, a total of 1,743,309 vacationers from China arrived in the Philippines, according to the DOT.
Aside from China, the Philippines welcomed the most visitors from South Korea (1,989,322 visitors), United States (1,064,440 visitors), Japan (682,788 visitors), and Taiwan (327,273). In these countries, the DOT expects a dip in visits of at least 10%.

MANILA, Philippines – Families of hundreds of Filipino crew members still stuck on board the coronavirus-stricken Diamond Princess cruise ship are increasingly worried for their relatives' health, as the Philippines postponed on Saturday, February 22, a scheduled trip to bring them home.
The vessel, moored off the Japanese coast in Yokohama near Tokyo, has the biggest cluster of coronavirus infections outside the Chinese epicenter, with over 600 cases confirmed among the 3,700 passengers and crew.
While hundreds of travelers have disembarked more than 1,000 crew remain – including over 400 Filipinos whose return on Sunday, February 23, has been delayed until Japan clears them to travel, the Philippines said Saturday.
""[The task force] is adjusting the schedule out of an abundance of caution with a view of safeguarding the health and safety of our OFWs (overseas Filipinos) onboard,"" the health department said in a statement.
Adding to the families' worry, a Philippine foreign ministry official said Saturday 49 Filipinos on board have tested positive for the virus, two of whom were successfully treated and discharged from the hospital.
(READ: Quarantine nightmare still not over for left-behind cruise ship crew)
Norma Fajardo, whose daughter is part of the Diamond Princess security team, said the crew have been well treated and cared for, but she is worried her work makes her particularly vulnerable to the virus.
""We couldn't do anything because she works in security so she has to monitor passengers,"" Fajardo told AFP.
""We're worried. She could get infected anytime,"" she added.
Fajardo said crew who get sick are allowed to rest, but those without symptoms were encouraged to continue working.
Esther Rivera – whose son is a ship photographer – has urged the Philippine government to bring them home.
""I hope they get pulled out from the ship because they are infecting each other there,"" Rivera said.
Once flown home, the repatriated Filipinos will be quarantined for two weeks in a northern Philippine facility previously used to house athletes in the 2019 Southeast Asian Games.
Japan has faced mounting criticism for its quarantine arrangements as passengers disperse across the world.
The cruise ship was quarantined on February 5 – after a passenger who disembarked in Hong Kong tested positive for the virus – but many crew were not isolated because they were needed to keep the vessel running.
Some were preparing food and delivering meals to cabins, leading some critics to charge they were inadvertently spreading the virus throughout the boat.
Princess Cruises President Jan Swartz has written a letter to the crew, saying the firm was ""deeply grateful and incredibly proud of all of you.""
Around 10 million Filipinos work abroad and the money they send home spurs the local economy where many still live in deep poverty despite the country's robust growth.
The government has for decades hailed overseas workers as modern heroes, but advocacy groups have highlighted these Filipinos vulnerability in troubled countries, or during epidemics. – Rappler.com

MANILA, Philippines – The repatriation of Filipinos on a cruise ship in Japan has been tentatively moved to ""early next week"" instead of Sunday, February 23, the Department of Health (DOH) announced.
The DOH said in a statement on Saturday, February 22, that the Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Disease (IATF-EID) ""unanimously resolved"" to move the homecoming date of over 400 Filipinos aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship.
“This is to allow the Japanese health authorities to complete the laboratory testing of the 400-plus Filipino crew members aboard the ship and comply with established Japanese quarantine protocols,” the DOH said.
It added that the task force adjusted the schedule ""out of an abundance of caution with a view to safeguarding the health and safety of our overseas Filipinos onboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship.""
“The Japanese government has ensured that appropriate health services are being provided to affected overseas Filipinos aboard the ship. Our Tokyo Embassy is working closely with the Japanese health and foreign ministry to complete the quarantine protocols for the Philippine Government to repatriate our Filipino crew members as soon as possible,” the DOH said. 
The decision was made a day after two Australians evacuated from the cruise ship  tested positive for coronavirus on their return home, despite being cleared in Japan.
Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr earlier ordered the immediate repatriation of the Filipinos aboard the ship on Wednesday, February 19. This was just hours hours after ship passengers who tested negative for COVID-19 – the name of the disease caused by the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) – following a 14-day quarantine were allowed to disembark.
About 460 to 480 Filipinos were aboard the ship, both passengers and crew members.
 
Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said in an earlier press conference that the repatriation was originally set for Tuesday, February 25, but the DFA moved it to Sunday, February 23, after the Japanese government announced they would close down the cruise ship.
Earlier reports said the 52 Filipinos infected with 2019-nCoV would not be included in the repatriation.
As of Friday, February 21, a total of 634 confirmed cases of COVID-19 was recorded on the Diamond Cruise ship, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Two former passengers died.
Meanwhile, the DOH gave a clean bill of health to 30 Filipino repatriates from Wuhan, China, after a 14-day quarantine at the New Clark City in Tarlac.
 
The DOH said the 10-member Health Emergency Response Team (HERT) from the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) and the DOH, 6 flight crew members, and 3 ground crew operators involved in the Wuhan mission were also declared healthy and showed no signs and symptoms of COVID-19, the name of the disease from infection with nCoV-2019.
The 49 Filipinos were set to leave New Clark City on Saturday.
The Philippines has so far recorded 3 confirmed cases as of Friday noon, with one death and two recoveries. A total of 597 possible cases are currently under investigation. So far, there were no cases of local transmission. – Pauline Macaraeg/Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – The scores of Filipino passengers and crew members of Japanese cruise ship Diamond Princess who were infected by the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) will not be among those to be repatriated to the Philippines on Sunday, February 23.
Department of Health (DOH) Assistant Secretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said they received a report as of Friday morning, February 21, that 52 Filipinos aboard the ship have already tested positive with 2019-nCoV, after 8 new cases were recorded. But she clarified the DOH was still “verifying” the latest figure.
“At gaya po ng ating napag-usapan at napagkasunduan namin [sa Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF)] na wala hong sasama sa repatriation na may sintomas (And just like what we discussed and agreed upon in the Inter-Agency Task Force, none of those who showed symptoms will be repatriated yet),” Vergeire said in a press conference on Friday afternoon.
The DOH official said the IATF handling the coronavirus scare is yet to finalize plans for these 52 Filipinos, but she promised they will “not be left behind.”
“Paguusapan po uli yan sa Inter-Agency Task Force. But as we have heard from the President [Rodrigo Duterte] and even our Secretary [Francisco Duque III], sinasabi lagi no Filipino o wala tayong kababayan na iiwanan. We will not be leaving them behind,” Vergeire said.
(The Inter-Agency Task Force will still have to talk about that. But as we have heard from the President Rodrigo Duterte and even our Secretary Francisco Duque III, they always say no Filipino will be left behind.)
She said that because the 52 cases tested positive for COVID-19 – the disease caused by 2019-nCoV – on different days, there would be separate individual arrangements for their logistical needs. These include different days of stay in the hospital, of discharge, and trips back to the Philippines as well.
About 460 to 480 Filipino passengers and crew members of Diamond Princess are set to be repatriated on Sunday from Yokohama, Japan to New Clark City in Capas, Tarlac, the Philippine government’s designated quarantine facility for COVID-19.
The IATF agreed that the DOH and the Magsaysay Maritime Corporation, the employer of the Filipino crew members, will both primarily shoulder the expenses for the repatriation process.
The DOH will be deploying health personnel to watch over the quarantined Filipinos and will also pay for the costs of their transportation to New Clark City as well as the on-site medical needs of the repatriates, hospitalization expenses through Philhealth, and personal protective equipment (PPE) for the first 5 days of the quarantine period.
The Magsaysay Maritime Corporation, meanwhile, will bear the cost of all transportation expenses of the repatriates from Japan until the completion of the quarantine period, PPE for the remaining period of the quarantine, as well as, food, lodging, personal hygiene kits and disinfectants, waste disposal services, and other incidental expenses of the repatriated crew.
The Department of Transportation will be tasked to bring the repatriates from Haribon Airport in Pampanga to New Clark City in Tarlac. The Overseas Workers Welfare Administration will provide livelihood packages to the repatriates and also pay for their transportation from Manila to their respective destinations after the quarantine period.
Vergeire said the hundreds of repatriates from Diamond Princess are currently being checked for possible COVID-19 symptoms.
Medical teams from the DOH will also test them before they leave the cruise ship and right after they disembark from the two planes that will take them back to the Philippines. 
Just like the 30 overseas Filipino workers repatriated from Wuhan, China – the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak – the second batch of quarantined Filipinos would be subjected to twice-a-day monitoring during their 14-day quarantine at New Clark City.
As of Friday, the DOH has probed 597 patients in the Philippines for possible COVID-19 infection. Of this number, 139 patients are still admitted in various health facilities nationwide, while 455 have already been discharged.
The Philippines has, so far, recorded 3 confirmed cases of COVID-19. One of them died, but the other two recovered and have since been discharged from the hospital.
In mainland China, the new disease has killed 2,235 people and infected a total of 75,466 as of 3:45 pm on Friday. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – The first batch of 49 Filipinos quarantined in New Clark City will now be allowed to go home after showing no signs and symptoms of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). 
In a press conference on Friday, February 21, Department of Health (DOH) Assistant Secretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said they will be holding a send-off ceremony for the 49 Filipinos on Saturday, February 22, the last day of their 14-day mandatory quarantine.
New Clark City in Capas, Tarlac was designated as the country's quarantine facility to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus. The site was first used in December last year as the Athlete's Village of the Southeast Asian Games.
“On February 22, DOH is set to conduct a send-off ceremony for the 30 repatriates and 19 crew members [and members of the repatriation team] at the New Clark City quarantine facility, which marks their completion of the required 14-day quarantine,” Vergeire said.
“All the quarantined individuals have not shown signs and symptoms of fever, cough or sore throat during their 14-day stay. They will now be allowed to go back to their respective homes and places,” the DOH official added.  
Of the 49 repatriates, 30 are overseas Filipino workers who were based in the province of Hubei in China, where COVID-19 – the disease caused by 2019-nCoV – has killed 2,235 people and infected a total of 75,466 as of 3:45 pm on Friday.  
The rest of the Filipinos quarantined in New Clark City include government personnel who were part of the repatriation team, 6 flight crew members, and 3 ground crew operators. (READ: DOLE to assist OFWs repatriated due to novel coronavirus crisis)
“We are glad that our repatriates are all well and safe from COVID-19. Our repatriation mission is not possible without the dedication and cooperation of the entire Inter-agency Task Force for Emerging Infectious Diseases with all its member agencies. We are extremely grateful for the collective effort of the government,” Vergeire said.
This now means New Clark City will have been completely vacated and ready for occupancy by the time the 460 to 480 Filipinos who were quarantined for days inside the Japanese cruise ship M/V Diamond Princess will fly back to the Philippines on Sunday, February 23. 
Vergeire’s updated figure on the second batch of repatriates from Diamond Princess is about 20 to 40 people fewer than Health Secretary Francisco Duque III’s earlier estimate of “around 500.” 
At least 44 Filipino passengers and crew members of Diamond Princess have tested positive for COVID-19, though one case has already recovered from the disease and is the first Filipino to do so.  
Vergeire said the 43 Filipinos who are still COVID-19-positive will not be allowed to go back to the Philippines. 
As of Friday, the DOH has probed 597 patients in the Philippines for possible COVID-19 infection. Of this number, 139 patients are still admitted in various health facilities nationwide, while 455 have already been discharged.  
The Philippines has so far recorded 3 confirmed cases of COVID-19. One of them died, but the other two recovered and have since been discharged from the hospital. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – The Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) confirmed that 3 more Filipinos who were onboard the Japanese cruise ship M/V Diamond Princess were infected with the novel coronavirus.
""Yes, 41 plus 3 new cases. Minus one who has recovered,"" the DFA said in a statement on Thursday, February 20, when asked to confirm if there are additional Filipino cruise passengers who tested positive for the novel coronavirus.
This means there are now 44 Filipinos who got infected with the novel coronavirus after being onboard the Diamond Princess, which had been quarantined in the port of Yokohama, Japan. 
One of the 44, who was the first Filipino reported to have contracted the novel coronavirus, has already recovered from COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. 
Some 500 Filipino passengers of Diamond Princess are set to be repatriated back to the country on Sunday, February 23. 
Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said all of them will be brought to New Clark City in Tarlac to be quarantined for another 14 days. 
Medical personnel from 16 government hospitals across Luzon will be deployed to help oversee the health status of the repatriates during the quarantine period.
As of Thursday, the DOH has yet to report any case of local transmission of COVID-19, although the Philippines has recorded 3 confirmed cases of the new disease. One of them died, while the other two recovered.  
The Philippines has a total of 556 patients under investigtion for the novel coronavirus as of this posting.

MANILA, Philippines – Around 500 Filipinos who were quarantined onboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan due to the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) are set to be repatriated to the Philippines on Sunday, February 23. 
In a press conference on Thursday, February 20, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said the repatriation was originally set for Tuesday, February 25, but the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) adjusted the date after the Japanese government announced it will be closing down the cruise ship.
""The [original] date [was] February 25, [but] it will be advanced to February 23. That's on a Sunday. The exact time is being determined by DFA as they are coordinating the repatriation of not 400 but 500 Filipinos with their counterpart in Japan and with the Ministry of Health, [Labor, and Welfare],"" Duque said.  
Two planes, with a 2- to 3-hour interval between their arrival times, will be flying the Filipinos from Japan to the Clark Air Base on Sunday. From there, the repatriates will be brought to the Athletes' Village in New Clark City in Tarlac, where they will have to undergo another 14-day quarantine period.  
Once the repatriates arrive in New Clark City, at least 549 Filipinos will be quarantined there to be monitored for possible cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by 2019-nCoV.
The first batch of quarantined Filipinos used to work in the Chinese province of Hubei, the epicenter of the outbreak, which has so far killed 2,118 people and infected 74,500 across China.
Duque said the Department of Heath (DOH) will be implementing a 1:1 repatriate-to-room ratio during the quarantine. But passengers with family members will be asked to stay in one room.
The DOH will also be deploying health personnel from 16 government-run hospitals across Luzon to do shifts in New Clark City and watch over the health of the quarantined Filipinos.
Among those to be quarantined are at least 41 Filipinos who were aboard the cruise ship and later tested positive for COVID-19.
Duque said the first infected Filipino to recover from the disease – a crew member of Diamond Princess – will still be subjected to the 14-day quarantine in New Clark City.  
""Oh yes, ika-quarantine din 'yan (Oh yes, he has to be quarantined). Because number one, we don't know much of the virus. We don't know if there's going to be immunity or if there's going to be re-infection,"" Duque said. 
As of Thursday, the DOH has yet to report any case of local transmission of COVID-19, although the Philippines has recorded 3 confirmed cases of the new disease. One of them died, but the other two recovered. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – The first Filipino reported to have contracted the novel coronavirus has recovered from the infection, the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) said on Wednesday, February 19.
He is a crew member of the cruise ship Diamond Princess, which had been quarantined at the port of Yokohama, Japan, for 14 days as the virus infected more than 500 passengers and crew while onboard.
“The Department of Foreign Affairs, together with the Philippine Embassy in Tokyo, is pleased to announce that the first Filipino crew member who tested positive for COVID-19 and was admitted to the hospital on February 5 has been successfully treated and is scheduled to be discharged today, February 19,” the DFA said in a statement.
“COVID-19” is the term for the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.
Forty other Filipino crew members of the Diamond Princess cruise ship are being treated for the novel coronavirus in hospitals in and near the Tokyo Metropolitan Area. Six of them were diagnosed earlier on Wednesday.
The 14-day quarantine imposed on the ship's passengers ended on Wednesday, and authorities facilitated the disembarkation of some 500 passengers who tested negative for the virus.
There were a total of 538 Filipinos onboard the ship, including those who had tested positive for the virus.
The Philippine Embassy in Japan is working with Japanese authorities and the management of Princess Cruises “to finalize the details, logistics, and schedule of the repatriation” of the ship’s Filipino crew members and passengers. They will be flown home “at the soonest possible time,” the DFA said.
The DFA earlier on Wednesday ordered the “immediate repatriation” of Filipinos who were on the Diamond Princess.
As of Wednesday, the COVID-19 global death toll has reached 2,000 – 5 of the deaths outside China. There were more than 74,000 confirmed cases in China alone, and hundreds more reported in two dozen countries.
In the Philippines, there have been 3 confirmed cases – one death and two recoveries of Chinese tourists. A total of 527 possible cases are currently under investigation. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr has ordered the immediate repatriation of Filipinos on the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Yokohama, Japan.
Locsin announced this in a tweet on Wednesday, February 19, hours after ship passengers who tested negative for COVID-19 – the name of the disease caused by the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) – following a 14-day quarantine were allowed to disembark.
""I have ordered our Tokyo Embassy to immediately repatriate our people in the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Yokohoma, Japan,"" Locsin said.
""It’s our duty to take care our overseas Filipinos wherever they are. I want them home now!"" he added.

@DFAPHL I have ordered our Tokyo Embassy to immediately repatriate our people in the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Yokohoma Japan. It’s our duty to take care our Overseas Filipinos wherever they are. I want them home now!
— Teddy Locsin Jr. (@teddyboylocsin) February 19, 2020

As of Wednesday, 41 Filipino crew members of the ship tested positive for COVID-19. Like others on the ship confirmed to be infected with the virus, they were brought to hospitals in Japan for treatment. Including the 41 crew members, there were a total of 538 Filipinos on the ship.
Assistant Secretary Rosario Vergeire said in a news briefing on Wednesday that the Department of Health (DOH) was making all the necessary preparations for the returning Filipinos.
Vergeire said that the DOH was checking hospitals and facilities where the repatriates would be quarantined, in coordination with local governments, but did not specify them.
The Filipinos earlier repatriated from Wuhan in Hubei, China, were brought to New Clark City in Tarlac. The government had also earlier cited the unused drug rehabilitation facility in Fort Magsaysay, Nueva Ecija, as a quarantine site.
'Proper repatriation process'
Vergeire said that Philippine officials have been coordinating with the Japanese government and the cruise ship management since last week to ensure that everything would be in place once the repatriation of the Filipinos begin.
Apparently in response to some views that it was taking the Philippine government some time to repatriate the Filipinos on the ship, Vergeire noted that many things had to be arranged because it involved a large group of over 500 people.
""So ever since last week, our government has already been coordinating with the government of Japan, and also our ministry of foreign affairs nakikipag-usap na po doon. We sat down with the Diamond Princess handler here already to negotiate our terms para makuha na natin kung paano talaga natin gagawin itong pagrerepatriate. So I think hindi naman sa natagalan; ipinoproseso lang nang maayos,"" she explained.
(Ever since last week, our government has been coordinating with the government of Japan, and also our ministry of foreign affairs is also talking with their counterparts. We sat down with the Diamond Princess handler here already to negotiate our terms so we can determine how to carry out the repatriation. So I think it's not that the process was slow; we're just doing this properly.)
Additional quarantine period
Vergeire said that a 14-day quarantine would be strictly enforced on all repatriated Filipinos. When the decision was made to repatriate the Filipinos on the ship, one of the conditions was to conduct an additional quarantine period even though they were already quarantined on the ship, she added. 
“The 14-day period will somehow give us assurance,” the health official said.
The DOH also reported that its supplemental budget request was granted, and that most of the fund would be spent on personal protective equipment for healthcare workers. Vergeire did not disclose the amount, but said the DOH would release the breakdown of this budget in the coming days.
As for the possible procurement of Favilavir, the first anti-novel coronavirus drug approved by China’s regulatory body, Vergeire said it would first have to be endorsed by the World Health Organization and the Philippines' Food and Drug Administration before it can be used locally.
As  of Wednesday, the COVID-19 death toll reached 2,000 – 5 of the deaths outside China. There were more than 74,000 confirmed cases in China alone, and hundreds more reported in two dozen countries.
In the Philippines, there have been 3 confirmed cases – one death and two recoveries. A total of 527 possible cases are currently under investigation. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – Three Cabinet officials, including Health Secretary Francisco Duque III, on Tuesday, February 18, assured the public that it is “safe” to organize and attend public gatherings for as long as people follow the prescribed precautionary measures to protect themselves from the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).
Duque, Interior Secretary Eduardo Año, and Tourism Secretary Bernadette Romulo-Puyat issued the joint statement which is a modification of the Department of Health (DOH) advisory on February 7, “strongly” urging the public to avoid public gatherings to stem the spread of COVID-19, the disease caused by 2019-nCoV.
“The Department of Health (DOH), Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG), and the Department of Tourism (DOT) would like to assure everyone that it is safe to organize and attend public gatherings, meetings, and festivals as long as all precautionary measures identifed by the DOH are observed,” they said in the statement.
The DOH chairs the  Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF) for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases Meeting, while the DILG and the DOT are among its members.

The DOH reminded the public to wash hands regularly and seek medical attention for signs of cough, colds, sore throat, and fever, which are symptoms of COVID-19. 
“All preventive and precautionary measures have been put in place by the national government to contain the spread of the COVID-19,” said Duque, Año, and Puyat.
The Cabinet officials also said the guidelines in “handling guests” in tourism enterprises in the country are being implemented even before the government imposed a now-partially lifted temporary travel ban to and from Hong Kong, Macau, and China, the epicenter of COVID-19 which has so far killed 1,863 people and infected more than 72,300 people there. 
“The safety of the public, especially our tourists and employees in the tourism sector, remains the priority of the Philippine government,” the officials said.
The officials gave the assurance as the government moved to boost domestic tourism especially this summer season, after the COVID-19 outbreak slowed down the influx of foreign visitors, especially those from China.
Puyat had earlier told lawmakers that the Philippines stands to lose P42.9 billion in tourism revenues for the peak months of February to April due to the COVID-19 threat.
President Rodrigo Duterte himself had expressed willingness to be a domestic travel ambassador of sorts, to encourage Filipinos to patronize local tourist spots.
The DOT wants Duterte himself to travel to popular beach destinations like Boracay, Cebu, and Bohol – places frequented by Chinese tourists – to offset the death of foreign tourists. 
As of Tuesday, the DOH has yet to report any case of local transmission of COVID-19, although the Philippines has recorded 3 confirmed cases of the new disease. One of them died, but the other two recovered and had been discharged from the hospital. 
There are currently 49 Filipinos under quarantine in New Clark City in Tarlac, a majority of whom were repatriated from Hubei, China.

MANILA, Philippines – Eight more Filipinos working on the Japanese cruise ship Diamond Princess have contracted the novel coronavirus, bringing the total number of infected Filipino crew members to 35, the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) said on Tuesday, February 18.
On Sunday, February 16, 27 Filipinos were reported as positive for COVID-19, the term for the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.
“The Filipinos who tested positive for COVID-19 were immediately transferred to Japanese hospitals and are now undergoing treatment. The (Philippine Embassy in Japan) constantly communicates with all patients currently confined in Japanese hospitals to ensure their well-being and to provide assistance,” the DFA said in a statement.
The Japanese government is set to announce on Tuesday the disembarkation procedures as the ship’s quarantine period ends.
“The Embassy is coordinating with all relevant Philippine and Japanese government agencies and is meeting with senior management representatives of Princess Cruises to ensure an orderly and safe repatriation of Filipinos once they clear the Japanese quarantine requirements,” the DFA said.
All Filipino passengers and crew of the Diamond Princess who wish to be repatriated will be accommodated by the government, the Department of Health (DOH) said on Tuesday.
“The DOH will follow strict infection control and quarantine procedures to ensure the safety of our repatriates and health workers who will man the quarantine facility,” the Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases said in a statement.
There were a total of 538 Filipinos onboard the Diamond Princess. One of them became the first Filipino case of COVID-19. The ship has been on quarantine at the port of Yokahama since February 5.
On Monday, the DFA said the government sent “care packages” containing toiletries and other supplies to the Filipinos on the cruise ship.
As of Monday evening, Philippine health officials had monitored a total of 521 patients for the novel coronavirus. Only 171 of them remained at hospitals.
The country has had 3 confirmed cases of infection, all of whom were Chinese tourists. There have not been any new confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the Philippines since February 5.

MANILA, Philippines – Filipinos stranded in the Philippines because of the novel coronavirus outbreak are now allowed to return to their jobs in Hong Kong and Macau, the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) and the Deparetment of Health (DOH) said on Tuesday, February 18.
The Philippine government’s Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID) has exempted overseas Filipino workers (OFW) from the two special administrative regions of China from an outbound travel ban meant to prevent the spread of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, which originated from Wuhan City in Hubei province, China.
DFA Undersecretary for Civilian Security and Consular Concerns Brigido “Dodo” Dulay first made the announcement in a tweet on Tuesday afternoon.
""The Task Force also agreed to authorize travel to Hong Kong and Macau for permanent residents of the respective Special Administrative Regions, Filipinos leaving abroad for study, and Overseas Filipino Workers, provided that the travellers sign a declaration signifying their knowledge and understanding of the risks involved,"" the IATF-EID stated in its resolution released by the DOH also on Tuesday.
Some 25,000 OFWs and Filipino residents of Hong Kong had been urging the government to exempt them from the travel ban that has been in force since February 2, after health officials confirmed the first two cases of the virus in the Philippines, and following the death of one of the COVID-19 patients.
Today, DFA Sec Locsin’s advocacy has come true. OFWs returning for work in Hongkong and Macau have been exempted from the outbound travel ban by the IATF-EID, subject to certain procedural formalities. Woohoo!! @teddyboylocsin— Dodo Dulay (@dododulay) February 18, 2020
Several of the stranded OFWs organized themselves into a group called #StrandedPH and launched a social media campaign hoping to spark action on their plight. Members of the group have been interviewed by different news outlets including Rappler, explaining that their prolonged absence could cost them their jobs.
Aware that the ban was meant to protect them from catching COVID-19, the stranded OFWs said they were willing to sign a waiver absolving the Philippine government of any liability should they fall ill upon their return to Hong Kong.
Besides the risk of losing their income sources, some of the stranded Filipinos had invested a lot of money, even accumulated debts, for the opportunity to work in Hong Kong. In the case of Hong Kong residents, some have had to pay for accommodations during their unexpected prolonged stay in the Philippines.
Upon hearing of their exemption from the ban, #StrandedPH group administrator Edward Borja thanked the government agencies and media outlets for the publicity that “paved the way to help the government agencies make a final decision towards lifting the ban.”
“Me, my family, my co-admins and my fellow OFWs are overwhelmed with happiness with this decision by our government. Now we are all just waiting for airlines to reopen flights so we can book right away,” Borja said in a statement.
As of Monday evening, Philippine health officials had monitored a total of 521 patients for the novel coronavirus. Only 171 remained at hospitals. The country has had 3 confirmed cases of infection. There have not been any new confirmed cases since February 5.

MANILA, Philippines – Anticipating billions of pesos in revenue losses in the tourism industry, due to the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) scare, the Department of Tourism (DOT) is recommeding that President Rodrigo Duterte visits popular island destinations to help boost the domestic tourism industry.
DOT Undersecretary Arturo Boncato Jr said on Monday, February 17, they had so far chosen Boracay, Cebu, and Bohol as the initial destinations to be visited by Duterte, who had invited Filipinos to travel with him around the country amid the 2019-nCoV threat.  
“So, [we are doing this] just to arrest and to cushion whatever impact this crisis may bring to the tourism industry. As we see it, it’s still early and, as we all know, we are uncertain as to how long this would go on. And we’d like to have those measures as early as possible addressed,” said Boncato in a press briefing in Malacañang.
The DOT official said they wanted Duterte to begin his tour around the country by end of February or early March to “showcase the sites and attractions” that are popular among tourists. 
“So maaari pong ipapakita natin dito iyong mga pinakasikat na beaches, for example, ano, at saka iyong mga activities na nagbibigay ng mga unique experiences sa mga turista. At malamang ipapakita din natin iyong local communities ’no,” Boncato said. 
(So we can possibly showcase the most famous beaches, for example, and the activities that would give unique experiences to tourists. Of course, we would also feature the local communities.) 
It remains unclear, however, if Duterte himself already agreed to the itinerary. The President is also notorious for skipping pre-scheduled public engagements often due to health-related issues. (READ: LIST: Duterte's skipped events, long absences) 
Tourism Secretary Bernadette Romulo Puyat already told lawmakers the Philippines stands to lose P42.9 billion in tourism revenues for the peak months of February to April due to the COVID-19 threat.  
Boncato also said the DOT also estimates that the country would have a foregone revenue worth P14.8 billion alone following the ongoing travel ban covering China, Hong Kong, and Macau. 
As of Monday, the Department of Health has yet to report any case of local transmission of COVID-19, although the Philippines has recorded 3 confirmed cases of the new disease.

   CEBU CITY, Philippines – The Philippine National Police (PNP) filed charges against an optometrist here in Cebu for allegedly posting on Facebook unverified information related to the novel coronavirus.
According to a statement from the PNP, Josephil Brian Consuelo, an optometrist, erroneously posted on Facebook that a patient under observation had died at the University of Cebu Medical Center.   
No patients under observation in Cebu have died, according to the latest update from the Department of Health. Based on latest figures from the DOH, there are a total of 55 patients under investigation for the virus in the Central Visayas. 
 According to the PNP, Consuelo was arrested last Thursday, February 13.   The Central Visayas' anti-cybercrime unit checked the post and filed charges after finding out the information was false.   Consuelo's post could not be found as of this posting.   
Police Colonel Marlo Castillo, head of the Central Visayas' anti-cybercrime unit, said that the defendant would face the charges.
Castillo said they were in coordination with Cebu province to monitor any information about the virus that could cause unnecessary panic.
""We would like the public to know that spreading fake news and misinformation has equivalent legal consequences,"" Castillo said.
PNP chief General Archie Francisco Gamboa said the police would continue to act against the spread of misinformation amid the ongoing novel coronavirus crisis. 
""Again, we urge the public to refrain posting unverified information that creates panic and confusion and we will file criminal charges to those proven spreading these false reports,"" Gamboa said.   
Consuelo's arrest comes a week after the Cebu Provincial Board passed a resolution against spreading ""fake news"" related to the novel coronavirus. 
The National Bureau of Investigation said they would also go after those who ""peddle coronavirus fake news.""
Currently, at least 28 Filipinos have the novel coronavirus, but are all based outside the country. This includes one in the United Arab Emirates, and 27 aboard a cruise ship quarantined in Japan.

MANILA, Philippines – The Philippine government provided care packages to the 538 Filipinos still quarantined on the Japanese cruise ship Diamond Princess due to the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) scare.
Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) Assistant Secretary Eduardo Meñez said in a press conference on Monday, February 17, this is the initial assistance the Philippine government has provided the Filipinos onboard the cruise ship. 
""The Philippine embassy, as I said, is in constant contact [with them]. We have, through the Japanese government, delivered care packages containing toiletries and non-medical supplies, and are in constant contact with the medical authorities,"" Meñez told reporters in Malacañang.  
Of the 538 Filipinos onboard, at least 27 are confirmed to have COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus. The first case of COVID-19 in a Filipino was confirmed onboard the Diamond Princess. 
The cruise ship has been in quarantine since February 5 at the port of Yokohama near Tokyo following the 2019-nCoV outbreak.
For now, Meñez said it is ""not clear"" to him who is shouldering the medical expenses of the infected Filipinos. But he gave an assurance that the Philippine government would shoulder the costs if the need arises.
""At this point, it is not clear to me whether the medical expenses of those positive, of those identified to be COVID-positive are being shouldered by whom. I would imagine that in the initial case, it would be the Japanese government. But the employer as well will probably have some responsiblity for paying for the medical expenses,"" Meñez said.
""But if in the final analysis, the government needs to pay, the government will step up accordingly,"" he added. 
Asked further if the government would aid the Filipino passengers who would wish to be repatriated from the cruise ship, Meñez said, ""Of course.""

""President Duterte…said China has been kind to us, and we can only show the same favor to them,"" he added.
Malacañang has yet to publicize the letter as of this posting, but Huang said it will be made public soon.
In the forum, Huang defended the Chinese government's response to the viral outbreak amid criticism that it had been negligent in alerting the public during its early stages.
The envoy went on to thank Filipinos and their government for aid and assistance sent to China ""despite the urgent need in this country.""
""Despite their own difficulties,"" the Philippine government sent 42 boxes of relief goods on a chartered flight to Wuhan City in Hubei, China, the epicenter of the outbreak, Huang said.
""In our view, this move is not only material support but more importantly, spiritual inspiration to the Chinese people. That's what we need,"" he added.
Duterte has consistently tried to shield China from criticism. When he first publicly addressed Filipinos about the outbreak on February 3, he chided them for seeking a total travel ban of mainland Chinese. He called it ""xenophobia.""

MANILA, Philippines – Tales of misery continue for more than 25,000 stranded Filipinos who hope to return to Hong Kong for work as the Philippine government remains firm on its ban on travelers coming to and from China, Hong Kong, and Macau.
The Philippine government imposed the travel ban on February 2 as the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak worsened worldwide. 
The virus was discovered in the city of Wuhan in China, prompting the lockdown of several provinces, and several countries' travel ban covering the mainland and its special administrative regions. 
In a unity statement sent to media, a group of Filipino with contracts in Hong Kong appealed to the government to lift the ban as they fear losing their jobs due to their “prolonged absence.” 
The group is composed of foreign domestic workers, skilled workers, and permanent Hong Kong residents. 
“The burden is made heavier by the loans they had to take out to pay for placement fees and other expenses to secure their jobs,” the group said. 
The group added that some Filipino residents also worry about not being able to pay their monthly rent and bills on time. 
“In another category are those who have been raised in Hong Kong and don’t have houses in the Philippines anymore, and are thus forced to pay for accommodation and food [in the Philippines] while waiting for the ban to be lifted,” the group said. 
Edward Borja, 52, who works as a swimming teacher in Hong Kong, said he and his family initially planned to stay in Manila until February 6, but since the ban had been imposed, they could not leave the country. He worries not only about the bills they need to pay in Hong Kong, but he also fears not having an income if they won't be able to return to Hong Kong by March. 
“Ngayon, nakausap ko 'yung employer ko. Ibibigay niya raw ang full salary ko ngayong February, pero kapag tumagal pa kami rito hanggang March, no pay no work na ako noon. This is our struggle now. Paano pa ang hirap na dinaranas ng mga domestic helpers natin?” Borja told Rappler.
(My employer told me that she’d give my full salary for February, but if we can’t return to Hong Kong by March, it will be no work no pay. This is our struggle now. The domestic helpers must be having a harder time.)
Joms Ortega, 33, who works as a child play performer in Hong Kong, initiated the Facebook group #StrandedPH, which has now more than 1,000 members. 
Ortega said they sent a letter to the Overseas Workers Welfare Administration (OWWA) on Monday, February 17, appealing to lift the travel ban so they could return to Hong Kong.
“Pag-uusapan na nila (They will talk about it). There will be a meeting this afternoon and tomorrow. Hopefully, there will be a partial decision by then. But, of course, they can’t promise us anything. We hope this will be fixed in the next few days,” said Ortega. 
Better health care system
The Duterte administration's latest move banning travelers from and to China, Hong Kong, and Macau widens the scope of restrictions that had been put in place aimed at preventing the spread of the virus.
On Friday, January 31, Duterte eimposed a ban on travelers from Wuhan City and Hubei province – the epicenter of the 2019 novel coronavirus – as well as other affected regions of China.
But for Borja, the Hong Kong government is prepared for returning workers in their country. He said the health care system in Hong Kong ensures that “we all get excellent medical care at little or no cost to us, while some of us have private medical coverage that comes with our employment.”
“Dito nga sa atin, nagkakaubusan ng masks, pero kasi 'yung mga companies namin a Hong Kong, binibigyan kami ng masks at ng sanitizers,” said Borja. (Here in the Philippines, there is shortage of face masks, but in Hong Kong, our companies provide us with masks and sanitizers.)
“We don’t worry about our protection. We don’t need to pay anything. The Philippine government could not provide that. I’m not questioning the Department of Health. They’re really good but sa dami ng populasyon ng bansa natin, it’s impossible for them to match that. I feel safer there,” he added. 
The group said they are willing to sign a waiver absolving the Philippine government of any liability if they fall ill upon their return to Hong Kong.
“All we ask is the right to travel back to the city where we live and work,” the group statement read.

There are at least 12 Filipinos confirmed to have the virus, but all are based outside the Philippines, including one in the United Arab Emirates and 11 who were aboard a cruise ship quarantined in Japan.
The World Health Organization declared the outbreak an international emergency, warning that the novel coronavirus poses a ""very grave threat.""
So far, the virus has killed more than 1,660 and infected over 68,000 people in China. Cases have been recorded in more than two dozen countries. – Rappler.com "

AKLAN, Philippines – Malay acting town mayor Frolibar Bautista lifted the border checkpoints on Saturday, February 15, after placing restrictions on travelers who had been to mainland China.
The Malay task force reported a total of 45 foreigners without proper documents of history of travel, while 39 who had shown their passports had been to China within the last 14 days. They were refused entry to Boracay Island.
Executive Order Number 4, issued on February 6 by Bautista, directed health workers and law enforcement units to monitor the entry of any persons, regardless of nationality, before entering the town of Malay and Boracay Island over coronavirus concerns. (PH coronavirus watch: Suspected cases per region, as of February 15, 2020)
Border checkpoints were set up by the task force in Nabas-Malay boundary, barangay Dumlog, and Sitio Bacolod in barangay Caticlan, to check the passports and travel history of visitors.
All persons travelling from or transiting to China and its special administrative regions of Macau and Hong Kong for the past 14 days were temporarily banned from February 7 to 15 out of caution that travellers may be infected with the deadly virus.
Bautista said travellers to Boracay Island would receive further screening in Caticlan port. They would be advised to fill-up health declaration cards and get checked by the personnel there for common signs of coronavirus.
Visitors on roll-on roll-off vessels from Batangas and Mindoro are also required to submit their health declaration cards upon arrival at Caticlan port.
Negative for COVID-19
Meanwhile, 9 persons under investigation (PUIs) in Aklan were discharged from Aklan provincial hospital. The 9 cases had been found |negative for infection of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), according to the Provincial Health Office (PHO-Aklan).
A bus driver who was put in quarantine in Aklan training center in Kalibo, Aklan was also discharged on February 15. The male patient had no travel history to infected countries and had no close contact with confirmed coronavirus patients, but insisted on self-quarantine after experiencing flu-like symptoms.
With the lifting of the Taiwan travel ban, airports and seaports in Aklan are on heightened surveillance to examine passengers in a bid to stop the spread of coronavirus.
Taiwan is the third largest source market of Boracay Island, with 30,624 arrivals last year.
Provincial Health Officer I Dr. Cornelio Cuachon said the provincial inter-agency task force isolation rooms with 12 beds for PUIs in Dr. Rafael S. Tumbokon Memorial Hospital (DRSTMH) in Kalibo, Aklan and the Aklan training center as temporary holding area for persons under monitoring (PUMs).
Augmentation personnel from Department of Health (DOH) are also deployed in airports and district hospitals to help in monitoring coronavirus cases. – Rappler.com "

CEBU CITY, Philippines – At least 25 Filipinos who were quarantined in Busay village in Cebu, after disembarking from their Taiwan flight in Mactan-Cebu International Airport, are now home.
On Tuesday, February 11, 78 passengers were held at the Mactan airport when the Philippines included Taiwan in its temporary travel ban because of the novel coronavirus or COVID-19. They initially refused quarantine.
The 25 passengers were assigned to the provincial quarantine facility in Busay village, while the rest were sent to facilities provided by Cebu City and Department of Health Central Visayas. (READ: Cebu readies another quarantine area amid coronavirus threat)
Those assigned in the Busay quarantine unit complained of the poor facilities such as lack of electricity and running water, as well as, smelly blankets. They also said that they were not provided with bed sheets.
Apart from the 25, at least 5 were from Hong Kong.
Because of the complaints, the Cebu provincial government decided to move them, including those in the Hong Kong flight, to another quarantine facility in Pinamungajan on Friday, February 14.
Still, the 25 passengers from Taiwann opted to go home instead. Of the 25, 21 people went to their residences in Davao while the 4 others went home within the province.
The 4 from Cebu were made to sign a document committing to immediately get themselves checked into a hospital should they feel flu-like symptoms.
As of writing, no one checked in the Busay facility.
Meanwhile, there are 24 people being observed at the provincial quarantine facility in Lahug. They were from Hong Kong and Macau.
The Philippines on Friday lifted the travel ban imposed on Taiwan, after the latter protested.
The chairperson of the Manila Economic and Cultural Office in Taipei warned that Taiwan could cancel visa-free privileges for Filipinos in retaliation to the ban.
Philippine health officials said however that the lifting of the ban has nothing to do with the threat of cancelling the visa-free privileges.
There are 3 confirmed cases in the Philippines, including one death. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – The Philippine government's inter-agency task force (IATF) handling the novel coronavirus crisis has decided on Friday, February 14, to lift the travel ban imposed on Taiwan due to the virus. 
""The lifting of travel restrictions for Taiwan has been agreed by the members of the IATF by reason of the strict measures they (Taiwan) are undertaking, as well as the protocols they are implementing to address the COVID-19,"" Presidential Spokesperson Salvador Panelo said, referring to the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Disease. 
Panelo said the lifting of the ban is ""effective immediately.""
""Accordingly, travel may now be made by any national to Taiwan from the Philippines and vice versa,"" Panelo said.
Malacañang's announcement came 4 days after the Department of Health revealed that Taiwan was covered by the temporary travel ban imposed by the Philippines on mainland China and its special administrative regions to prevent the spread of the virus. 
Last Monday, February 10, Health Undersecretary Eric Domingo said Taiwan was included because the World Health Organization recognizes it as part of China.
Since Monday's announcement, the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in the Philippines has denounced the move, saying Taiwan was ""wrongly included"" in the ban. 
The chairperson of the Manila Economic and Cultural Office in Taipei warned that Taiwan could cancel visa-free privileges for Filipinos in retaliation to the ban. 
But Health Secretary Francisco Duque III, speaking to reporters after the IATF meeting on Friday, said the decision to lift the ban had nothing to do with the threat to cancel visa-free privileges.
""(This is) purely on public health and safety, and of course the need to see whether there is a threat or increased risk if we didn't allow the travel from Taiwan to the Philippines,"" Duque said.
Asked what specific protocols observed by Taiwan made the task force decide to lift the ban, Duque said the DOH would release a more detailed report next week.
But the health chief did imply that one of the reasons was that Taiwan has not yet reported local transmission of COVID-19. Outside of China, Singapore, Japan, Thailand, Hong Kong, Germany, France, Vietnam, South Korea, and Australia have reported local transmission of the disease.
Taiwan, a self-ruled democracy, has found itself increasingly caught up in travel restrictions aimed at China, where the outbreak has killed over 1,380 people and infected over 63,000, as of Friday.
On Friday, Panelo said the inter-agency task force will also evaluate other jurisdictions, including Macau, for possible lifting of the travel ban. 
""We have said from the very start that this (travel ban) will be subject to risk assessment. This has been a temporary ban to begin with, and there hasn't been any decision by the IATF that has been set in stone,"" Duque said. 
Health officials in the Philippines have so far probed 455 patients for the novel coronavirus, including 3 confirmed cases. Two of the cases have since recovered, while one died due to severe pneumonia because of the novel coronavirus. – Rappler.com "

Wondering how you can show your affection on Valentine’s Day amid the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) scare? Let Health Secretary Francisco Duque III count the ways.
Asked during a February 14 press briefing how best to celebrate Valentine’s given the health department’s advisory asking people to avoid crowded gatherings, Duque said, “The best greeting is like this,” then waved his hand in greeting. 
You can also acknowledge the other person by slightly bowing your head and putting your hand to the opposite chest “if you want the Namaste,” the health chief said, referring to a customary Hindu greeting.   
If you want to give your loved one a kiss, it would be best to give them a flying kiss, and this is how to do it correctly, according to the health chief, “When you do the flying kiss, make sure it (your hand) does not touch your lips, and you also don’t talk while you are delivering the kiss.”
Duque had a light exchange with Malacañang reporters amid immense pressure on the health department to level up its response to the new virus. So far, the Philippines only has 3 confirmed cases  and no case of human transmission. One of them died after developing severe pneumonia due to the virus, but the other two recovered from the respiratory disease and have since been discharged from the hospital. 
The virus has killed 1,383 people and infected over 64,400 others, mainly in China. The health department heads the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Infectious Diseases, which leads government efforts to contain the spread of the new disease. 
The task force’s resounding advice to the public has been to practice proper hygiene and coughing etiquette. The virus can be transmitted through respiratory droplets, which means that when an infected person coughs or sneezes, droplets carrying the virus could reach infect other people. 
In the meantime, the task force also recommended a temporary travel ban on travelers coming from mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan. Taiwan has since contested its inclusion, even warning that visa-free privileges for Filipinos there could be suspended due to the ban.  – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – Health Secretary Francsico Duque III said it is premature to assume that the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) crisis is stabilizing as “blindspots continue to characterize the virus.”  
The health chief said this during a Malacañang press briefing on Friday, February 14, discussing the government’s preparedness to respond to the disease, which has killed 1,383 people and infected over 64,400 others, mainly in China.  
Answering questions about whether there are signs that the situation could be stabilizing, Duque said, “I don’t want to be a killjoy, but it’s premature. We’ve seen some initial trending that it’s not consistent. We have to wait for more data to come in and to establish a trending that’s more consistent, whether it’s plateauing or going down. Still, the situation remains fluid.”
For this, the DOH relies on regular risk assessment reports from the World Health Organization (WHO), the UN agency working closely with Chinese authorities to establish more facts about the new virus and the disease it causes. For instance, there are still no conclusive reports to say that 2019-nCoV transmission could be airborne. 
“Blindspots here continue to characterize this virus and the efforts to familiarize ourselves with this virus is ongoing. Science has never been more active than it is today precisely to continue to characterize the very granular aspects of this virus,” the health chief added. 
According to a February 10 Agence France-Presse report, the WHO said there were “tentative signs the epidemic (was) stabilizing” but that there might “be more infections abroad in people who have never traveled to China.” 
So far, local transmission of 2019-nCoV has been reported in Singapore, Japan, Thailand, Hong Kong, Germany, France, Vietnam, South Korea, and Australia. There is no local transmission yet in the Philippines, but Duque said that the government is treating it as a possibility in the Philippines. 
455 patients probed
The health department has so far probed 455 patients for 2019-nCoV in the Philippines as of February 14. Of the 455, 191 remain admitted in hospitals across the country, while 258 have been discharged. 
Of the accumulated total of 455, 386 patients have already tested negative for the virus while 66 cases are still pending test results. 
The DOH on Friday also announced another death of a patient under investigation, but confirmed that the new fatality died due to cardiovascular attack and in fact tested negative for the virus. 
According to the DOH, the patient, a 71-year-old Filipino from La Union who had a history of travel to Taiwan, was admitted to the hospital after “manifesting with coughs.” He died Thursday night, February 13. 
Two other patients being probed for possible 2019-nCoV infection have died from other illnesses. All 3 fatalities subsequently tested negative for 2019-nCoV.
So far, the Philippines has confirmed 3 cases of 2019-nCoV in the country. One of them died after developing severe pneumonia due to the virus, but the other two recovered from the respiratory disease and have since been discharged from the hospital. – Rappler.com  "

City health officials immediately admitted the patient to the isolation room of the James L. Gordon Memorial Hospital here to undergo the mandatory two-week quarantine for travellers who have been to China during their trip abroad.
Mayor Rolen Paulino Jr said the traveller is now being monitored and is listed as Olongapo's first person under investigation for possibly contracting the  coronavirus disease or COVID-19.
Dr. Rodrick Bustamante, head of the city health office, said it was commendable that the patient voluntarily sought the assistance of local authorities upon showing flu-like symptoms.
Bustamante said the patient has undergone test for the COVID-19 virus. He said the results of the test would immediately be made public.
Health officials here have also started contact tracing to find out who were with the patient during the overseas trip. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – Labor Secretary Silvestre Bello III wants the Duterte administration's travel ban on Taiwan, which was imposed due to the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), to be lifted for overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) who wish to return there.
Though confident that the ban will be lifted soon, Bello said on Thursday, February 13, that he has asked the Department of Health (DOH) to exempt OFWs bound for Taiwan.
The DOH leads the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases and, along with agencies like the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Department of the Interior and Local Government, decides on matters like travel restrictions aimed at preventing the spread of 2019-nCoV.
""For those who are affected by the travel ban in Taiwan, we ask for your patience, and in a few days, there will be a review,"" Bello said.
""We are seeking understanding from our OFWs because the implementation of a temporary ban by the DOH is for your own safety as well. We hope for a possible lifting of the ban in a few days.""
In the meantime, the labor department will provide P10,000 in financial aid to OFWs stranded in the Philippines. It will also help OFWs with accommodation and transportation.
So far, the ban is in place for travelers to and from mainland China, its special administrative regions of Macau and Hong Kong, and Taiwan. Only Filipinos and permanent resident visa holders are allowed to enter the Philippines, while Filipinos cannot go to the areas included in the ban.
The DOH admitted that it initially overlooked the ban on Taiwan due to ""confusion"" among involved agencies, but started implementing it the weekend of February 8 to 9.
Taiwan is included in the ban as the Philippines has a One-China policy, meaning it ""respects the position of the Chinese government that there is but one China and that Taiwan is an integral part of Chinese territory."" The World Health Organization also recognizes Taiwan as part of China in its situation reports about 2019-nCoV. 
But Taiwan has since denounced the Philippine government's move, asserting it is not part of China.
There are now concerns that Taiwan may cancel visa-free privileges for Filipinos in retaliation for the travel ban.
So far, the Philippines has 3 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus. They are imported cases, the patients having traveled from China. One of them died, while the other two have since recovered.
As of Thursday noon, the novel coronavirus has killed 1,368 people and infected over 60,300 people worldwide. – Rappler.com

MANILA, Philippines – The Department of Health (DOH) has probed a total of 441 patients for the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) as of Thursday, February 13. 
This is an increase of  33 from the total of 408 the previous day, February 12. 
Of the 441patients, 230 are currently admitted in hospitals, while 206 have been discharged but are still being monitored daily by the DOH in case they develop symptoms. A total of 252 patients have already tested negative for the virus, while 186 samples are still being processed by the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM).

The DOH said there are no longer reports of patients refusing admission to hospitals. It was a problem the agency encountered last week, as at least 10 patients refused hospitalization, citing concerns about expenses. 
The health department assured those being treated in public hospitals that costs will be fully shouldered by the government. Meanwhile, for patients in private hospitals, the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation has an available insurance package for 2019-nCoV treatment.  
So far, there have been 3 confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV in the Philippines. One of them died due to severe pneumonia caused by the virus, while the other two have recovered from the infection and have since been discharged from the hospital.
All 3 are imported cases, as the patients traveled from China already carrying the virus. This means that there is still no local transmission of 2019-nCoV in the Philippines. But the health department said it was prepared in case of an outbreak of local transmission, as the World Health Organization has advised all countries to be prepared. Local transmission outside of China has so far been recorded in Singapore, Japan, Thailand, Hong Kong, Germany, France, Vietnam, South Korea, and Australia.  
The WHO has also said that the new virus constitutes a grave threat to the world, having already killed 1,369 people and infected more than 60,300, mostly in China. – Rappler.com "

'STAY CALM.' President Rodrigo Duterte delivers a taped message on the 2019 novel coronavirus. RTVM screengrab 
MANILA, Philippines – With over 400 persons under investigation for the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) in the Philippines, President Rodrigo Duterte urged Filipinos to trust in government efforts to quell the spread of the virus.
In a taped message aired on Thursday, February 13, Duterte called on Filipinos to “remain calm,” as he gave assurances that officials were working with the World Health Organization and private groups in facing the “challenge and preparing for any eventuality.”
Duterte's message comes nearly two weeks after the Philippines recorded its first confirmed case of the novel coronavirus on January 30. 

“To my fellow Filipinos, I understand that many of you are worried about the world health and the well being of our loved ones. It is normal to feel anxious, concerned, and even afraid,” he said.
“I call on our people to remain calm, vigilant, responsible and I also ask your trust and cooperation, support as we face the challenge. Tayo ay magkaisa (Let us unite) together as one nation, this challenge can be overcome,” the President added.
Apart from this, Duterte gave an update on the current situation of the virus in the country reiterating the findings of health officials that no local transmission has been found in the Philippines to date. He likewise gave a recap of measures taken by the government to address the virus, including the repatriation of 30 Filipinos from China – ground zero of the coronavirus outbreak.
Duterte said the government was ready to bring home more Filipinos from China should they wish to be repatriated.
Meanwhile, he reminded the public to observe good cough etiquette, maintain personal hygiene, and practice frequent hand washing to prevent the spread of the virus.
Slow to act? Duterte earlier got flak for his initial response to the virus, with many saying he was slow to act compared to other leaders who swiftly put in place sweeping restrictions to quell the spread of the virus.
In his initial messages on the coronavirus, Duterte told Filipinos ""everything is well"" in the Philippines and that there's ""nothing really to be extra scared of."" He said public ""hysteria"" over the coronavirus was ""unwarranted"" and that the virus would “die a natural death” as he expressed confidence in medical advances. 
Duterte had also hit xenophobic calls to bar all Chinese from entering the Philippines, saying it was in “bad taste.” He later joked he would “slap” the virus while later saying the government was “on top” of the coronavirus threat.
The Department of Health has confirmed 3 cases of the novel coronavirus in the Philippines. These include the first death outside China – a 44-year-old Chinese man who traveled to the Philippines from Wuhan. The other two cases had recovered from the virus.
Read President Duterte’s full message below:
To my fellow Filipinos,
Today, we face the very grave threat of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 or COVID-19. As of now there are only 3 confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection. None of those infected is a Filipino national. There is no evidence yet of local community transmission here in our country.
The government, together with the World Health Organization (WHO), medical societies and partners in private sectors is addressing the challenge and preparing for any eventuality.
Last Sunday, we repatriated several of our countrymen from the affected areas in China. The government is taking care of them while they are in quarantine.
To our kababayans who remain in lockdown areas in China, I assure you that the government is ready to bring you home if you want. Hindi naman kayo papabayaan.
To my fellow Filipinos, I understand that many of you are worried about the world health and the well being of our loved ones. It is normal to feel anxious, concerned and even afraid.
Maging malinis. Hugasan 'yung kamay frequently, 'yung paulit-ulit. Kung every handshake mo, kung humatsing ka, takpan mo bunganga mo at tingnan mo hindi ka makahawa sa ibang tao. Kung ikaw naman ay may ubo, magmask ka na lang.
Maging maingat at 'yung mga impormasyon na importante na manggaling sa WHO, ay ating pakinggan. At huwag makinig diyan sa mga haka-haka. Sa gobyerno kayo nakatutok.
Nandiyan ang totoo sa gobyerno, wala diyan sa mga taong haka-haka na wala namang ginawa kung hindi manakot para kapwa niya tao.
I call on our people to remain calm, vigilant, responsible and I also ask your trust and cooperation, support as we face the challenge. Tayo ay magkaisa together as one nation, this challenge can be overcome.
Maraming salamat po.

MANIILA, Philippines – Then chairperson of the Manila Economic and Cultural Office (MECO) in Taipei warned on Wednesday, February 12, that Taiwan could cancel visa-free privileges for Filipinos in retaliation for its inclusion in the travel restrictions imposed by the Philippines in relation to the novel coronavirus outbreak. 
MECO Chair Angelito Banayo said Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen met with her Cabinet and ordered that a list of possible retaliatory measures be drafted against the Philippines due to its the travel ban that covers Taiwan, based on Manila's adherence to a one-China policy.  
“Maraming (There are many) possible retaliatory measures.... One possible retaliatory measure is i-cancel ‘yun (they will cancel [visa-free entry for Filipinos]),” Banayo said in an interview with DZMM.
""Posible rin 'yun ang unang hakbang,"" he added. (It could be a first step.)
Taiwan earlier denounced the Duterte administration's move to include it in temporary travel restrictions, saying the Philippine government had ""wrongly included"" it in its ban against non-Filipino travelers coming from China, Hong Kong, and Macau.
The Philippines belatedly clarified that Taiwan was included in its travel ban since the World Health Organization (WHO) recognizes it as part of China.
Taiwan, a self-ruled democracy, has found itself increasingly caught up in travel restrictions aimed at China, where the outbreak has killed more than 1,100 people and infected over 44,600, as of Wednesday. It likewise maintained it is a ""factual error"" for the WHO to regard it as part of China.
""The Philippines should not be misled by WHO's wrong information on Taiwan.... We urge the Philippine government to immediately correct its decision on Taiwan and remove Taiwan from the travel ban,"" the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in the Philippines said in an earlier statement.
Taiwan started implementing a visa-free policy in 2017, allowing Filipinos to enter Taiwan and stay for up to 14 days. It extended the policy until July 2020 as ""a display of Taiwan's amity with the Philippines.""
Duterte to 'review' ban
Responding to Taiwan's protest, Presidential Spokesperson Salvador Panelo said concerns would be relayed to President Rodrigo Duterte, though he maintained the ban was in place as part of efforts to quell the spread of the coronavirus.
""We will relay to the President the request of certain quarters to reconsider the travel ban to Taiwan,"" Panelo told reporters in an interview.
""The reason why we are effecting the travel ban is because we are trying to protect our countrymen from the infected. If there is no infection there, we will give it to the President [to review],"" he added.
Taiwan earlier assured the public it has taken ""all measures needed"" to swiftly contain the spread of the novel coronavirus. As of Wednesday, Taiwan recorded 18 confirmed coronavirus cases.
The WHO earlier declared the outbreak a global emergency, triggering several countries, including the Philippines, to set travel restrictions largely focused on China. – with reports from Agence France-Presse/Rappler.com

CEBU CITY, Philippines – Seventy-eight passengers have been held at the Mactan Cebu International Airport (MCIA) since Tuesday, February 11, for refusing quarantine when they arrived. (READ: Taiwan covered by travel ban due to novel coronavirus – DOH)
The passengers were apparently in the air – or on a quick transit – when the Philippines issued a clarification on Monday, February 10, that Taiwan was among the countries included in the travel ban on China and its special administrative regions due to the novel coronavirus or Covid-19.  
The Philippines and the World Health Organization consider Taiwan as a part of China. Taiwan denounced its inclusion in the travel ban shortly after the announcement, asserting it is an independent state.
MCIA manager Steve Dicdican told reporters in a chance interview, streamed by local newspaper The Freeman, that the passengers were upset when they disembarked from their flight because they did not know about the clarification until they arrived in Cebu.
He said they protested the mandatory quarantine. Another staff member described the passengers as ""enraged."" “This started yesterday (Tuesday), a lot of them were transiting only from Taiwan. They're in the holding room. We're trying to convince them to go on 14-day quarantine,” Dicdican said
 Filipinos are not included in the ban, but in Cebu province, arriving passengers from banned countries must undergo a 14-day quarantine period. (READ: Cebu readies another quarantine area amid coronavirus threat)
 According to Dicdican, majority of them were only transiting in Taiwan. Many of the passengers are also not from Metro Cebu, and outside of areas where Department of Health can inspect if they are qualified for home quarantine.  To be qualified for home quarantine, a Bureau of Quarantine officer has to check if anyone living in the household might be susceptible to catching the virus.
Currently, there is space for 250 in the quarantine facilities prepared by the province of Cebu and the Department of Health.
Cebu is a major tourist destination in the country. All 3 of the confirmed cases of novel coronavirus in the country passed through Cebu en route to other destinations. One of them became the first Covid-19 death outside of China.
There are 54 patients under investigation by the DOH in Central Visayas for possible exposure to Covid-19. 
According to Dicdican, the passengers are being fed by the Cebu provincial government, and none are exhibiting flu-like symptoms.
 The airport has been under a state of emergency since the World Health Organization declared the novel coronavirus an international emergency on January 31.
The airport manager said they would continue convincing the passengers to go under quarantine. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – The Philippines stands to lose at least P42.9 billion in tourism revenues due to the threat of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), Tourism Secretary Bernadette Puyat said on Wednesday, February 12.
During the House hearing on the economic impact of 2019-nCoV, Cavite 7th District Representative Jesus Crispin Remulla asked Puyat how much the Philippines has lost in terms of tourism receipts.
Puyat explained that P42.9 billion ($848.62 million) is the projected revenue loss for February to April this year, as the Philippines banned non-Filipino travelers coming from China, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan.
""P42.9 billion, it's going to be for February, March, and April,"" Puyat said, explaining that it was computed based on the past 3 years' data.
Remulla pressed further, asking how much ""exactly"" has the Philippines lost since the travel ban was enforced.
But Puyat could only give the estimate of P16.8 billion ($332.33 million) for the month of February.
""If we compute the whole of February, it will be P16.8 billion, but we are still halfway. This is only based on our forecast,"" she said.
When it comes to flights, Puyat, citing Civil Aeronautics Board data, said 465 flights have been canceled as of Tuesday, February 11, totaling 101,452 seats.
The Philippines also lost at least 14,211 tourists from 11 canceled cruise calls to various ports in Luzon and the Visayas. (READ: Finance team says PH economy 'can handle' coronavirus effects)
Before the travel ban was enforced, the Department of Tourism (DOT) had projected a total of 795,250 visitors from China, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan from February to April. This is less than 10% of the 9.2 million tourist arrivals targeted for the entire 2020.
But other markets have decreased trips to the Philippines, too, because of the 2019-nCoV threat:

Europe - decreased bookings to the Philippines, some have canceled their trips
United States - reported cancellations in Philippine Airlines flights
Japan - 643 people have reportedly canceled their trips
Korea - 6,576 airline booking cancellations, while 2,368 people canceled package tours
Australia - government encourages domestic travel instead

To recover lost revenues, Puyat said the DOT is working with major airlines to roll out ""more value-added tour packages, discounted accommodation rates, and marked-down prices for domestic flights.""
Puyat added that ""summer packages and multi-destination"" packages will be promoted yearlong in a bid to boost domestic tourism. (READ: Businesses worry more about Duterte gov't than novel coronavirus)
The World Health Organization has warned that the 2019-nCoV outbreak is a ""very grave threat.""
So far, it has killed at least 1,115 people and infected over 45,000, surpassing figures from the SARS outbreak of 2002-2003. – Rappler.com

BAGUIO CITY, Philippines – A 10-month-old baby and her mother are among the 9 persons under investigation (PUI) for the coronavirus in the Cordillera region.  
Amelia Pangilinan, acting regional director of the Department of Health-Cordillera, said on Wednesday, February 12, that the spike in the number of PUI is nothing to worry about as all of them voluntarily brought themselves in as part of “health seeking behavior.”  
Three of the 9 are in Baguio while 3 others are in Abra. The rest are from Mountain Province and Benguet.  
The 5 previous PUI have been discharged. They included a Chinese student who came from a province near Wuhan, the ground zero of Covid-19. 
The infant and her mother just happened to make a stop-over in Hongkong. Many of the 9 also have history of travel to China, Pangilinan said. 
Some of them are domestic help while one is an English teacher in China who happens to be on vacation.  
Cagayan Valley remains to have the most number of PUI in Northern Luzon with 18 and no one discharged yet.  
Pangasinan also had its first PUI, a 28-year-old woman from Lingayen town who went to Taiwan for a vacation.
As of morning of Wednesday, February 12, there are 382 patients under investigation in the Philippines. Of the 3 confirmed cases, one died due to pneumonia, while the two others were discharged – meaning, they tested negative twice already.
Abroad, 6 Filipinos are confirmed to have contracted the virus: one the United Arab Emirates and 5 in Japan.

MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – The Department of Health (DOH) has probed a total of 408 patients for the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) as of Wednesday noon, February 12.
This marks an increase of 26 from the 382 reported on Tuesday, February 11.
A total of 208 have already tested negative for 2019-nCoV, while 197 cases are still pending test results from the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM).
Of the 408 patients under investigation, 238 are currently admitted in hospitals after showing symptoms, while 165 have already been discharged. Health Undersecretary Eric Domingo said none of the symptomatic patients have severe symptoms.

The discharged patients are still under strict monitoring, which means that the DOH communicates with them daily for updates in case they begin to show symptoms.
Domingo also said they have no longer received reports of patients refusing admission. The health official last week disclosed that at least 10 patients refused admission to hospitals, citing concerns about expenses.
The DOH has promised that treatment in public hospitals will be shouldered by the government, and that the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation has launched an assistance package for patients being probed for 2019-nCoV in private hospitals.
Here is the breakdown of patients per region:

Ilocos Region - 5

Still no local transmission
So far, there have been 3 confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV in the Philippines. One of them died due to severe pneumonia caused by the virus, while the other two have recovered from the infection and have since been discharged from the hospital.
All 3 are imported cases, as the patients traveled from China already carrying the virus. This means that there is no local transmission of 2019-nCoV in the Philippines yet, Domingo said. (READ: Time to prepare for possibility of wider coronavirus transmission in PH) 
Local transmission outside of China has so far been recorded in Singapore, Japan, Thailand, Hong Kong, Germany, France, Vietnam, South Korea, and Australia, according to Domingo.
The health official said the DOH and Philippine hospitals are ready for the possibility of local transmission.
""The WHO (World Health Organization) has signified that we should all get ready because they've been seeing it happen in other countries, even in countries that are far [from China]. So all countries must prepare,"" he said.
The DOH is looking to expand laboratory testing for the virus as part of its disease detection efforts. Domingo said the DOH is eyeing 4 subnational reference laboratories connected with the RITM for 2019-nCoV testing. He also said the RITM will readily train private hospitals interested in assisting with disease detection efforts.
The WHO declared the 2019-nCoV outbreak a global public health emergency, warning that it constitutes a ""very grave threat"" for the world. It has killed at least 1,115 people and infected over 45,000, surpassing figures from the SARS outbreak of 2002-2003. – Rappler.com  "

MANILA, Philippines – The Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in the Philippines (TECO) denounced the Duterte administration's move to include Taiwan in travel restrictions imposed over the novel coronavirus.
In a statement on Tuesday night, February 11, TECO said Taiwan was ""wrongly included"" in the ban against non-Filipino travelers coming from China, Hong Kong, and Macau.
""The Republic of China (Taiwan) is a sovereign and independent state. Taiwan issues its own passport and visas and has exclusive jurisdiction over its people and territory. In fact, Taiwan is not, nor has it ever been, part of the PRC (People's Republic of China),"" TECO said.
Taiwan, a self-ruled democracy, has found itself increasingly caught up in travel restrictions aimed at China, where the outbreak has killed more than 1,100 people and infected over 44,600.
The Philippines on Monday, February 10, announced Taiwan was included in a temporary travel ban imposed on mainland China and its special administrative regions since the World Health Organization (WHO) recognizes it as part of China.
The Philippines also observes a one-China policy as stated in the 1975 Joint Communique between the Chinese and Philippine governments, which ""respects the position of the Chinese government that there is but one China and that Taiwan is an integral part of Chinese territory.""
Health Undersecretary Eric Domingo, however, admitted that the inclusion of Taiwan in the expanded ban was not immediately implemented because of ""confusion"" among involved agencies. Implementation for non-Filipino travelers only began over the weekend.
Taiwan maintains it is a ""factual error"" for the WHO to regard it as part of China.
""To confuse Taiwan with China has caused troubles for our side and in the international community,"" Taiwan foreign ministry spokeswoman Joanne Ou said, adding the ""Chinese factor is obvious"" in Manila's decision to include Taiwan in travel restrictions.
""The Philippines should not be misled by WHO's wrong information on Taiwan.... We urge the Philippine government to immediately correct its decision on Taiwan and remove Taiwan from the travel ban,"" added TECO.
Taiwan likewise assured the public it has taken ""all measures needed"" to swiftly contain the spread of the novel coronavirus.
Aside from the Philippines, Italy has banned flights by Taiwanese carriers, Bangladesh has stopped Taiwanese travelers from entering, while Mongolia initially enacted a ban and then said it would review visa applications on a case-by-case basis.

Our region is at a critical juncture in the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak. The majority of cases are still in China, but the virus has now been confirmed in many parts of the world. While we must continue efforts to contain its spread, it is also time that all countries, including the Philippines, prepare for the possibility of wider transmission. (READ: Coronavirus death toll reaches 1,110 – gov't)
There are now some reports of clusters of cases with no apparent link to transmission in China. The latest information suggests that the virus may be more transmissible than early data suggested. This does not mean that the virus will start spreading easily within the Philippines or elsewhere tomorrow, or perhaps ever – of course, we hope that it won’t. But while countries are still working hard on containing the virus, we must be ready in case there is wider spread. This requires action today, because preparation takes time, especially to ensure that the response reaches everyone in all parts of the country. 
Responding to wider transmission would require shifting the focus of activities to protect the vulnerable and minimize the health and social impact. If we don’t prepare now, we will not be able to activate and implement those plans when they are needed. (READ: WHO warns of 'very grave' global virus threat)
For example, in case of wider community transmission, we would need to ensure health facilities can focus on treating the most vulnerable and severe cases. This may mean planning to switch away from medically isolating or quarantining everyone who is infected, to encouraging people with mild illness to stay at home to recover – so that health care facilities do not become overwhelmed. Steps must also be taken to ensure health facilities do not become places that amplify the virus’ spread, infecting staff and other patients. (READ: 382 patients probed for novel coronavirus in PH)
We must also be ready to make a switch away from testing all suspected cases and tracing the contacts of every person who has the virus, to instead applying limited testing capacity to monitor geographical spread and trends – and using this information to inform decisions about the most appropriate public health response.
In addition, we need to be ready to consider the possibility of closing schools or postponing mass gatherings, if necessary, to reduce opportunities for the virus to spread.
I understand why people are worried, as this is a new disease and there is much we still don’t know. The best thing we can do is to be prepared. In addition to those measures governments can take, we all share a collective responsibility to take simple measures to protect not just ourselves as individuals, but our communities, including the most vulnerable. These measures are important in any stage of an outbreak. 
Wash your hands – frequently, and thoroughly. If you are coughing or sneezing, cover your nose and mouth with a tissue or your elbow. Keep your distance – we recommend at least 1 meter – from people who are unwell. If you’re sick, stay home so you don’t risk infecting others – and seek medical care if you have trouble breathing. And please, don’t circulate rumors and misinformation online and to your friends and family. When people have the wrong information, they can make decisions which actually harm themselves, and others.
In addition to looking at the virus’ transmissibility, we are closely monitoring its severity. Of all cases reported in China to date, around 2% of people have died. Outside of Hubei province, the death rate among those infected is around 0.4%.
We must continue to watch the transmissibility and severity of the virus closely and assess the situation as it evolves. In the meantime, we urge countries to prepare. Even if, in the end, there is no need to switch on these measures in response to the COVID-19 outbreak, this is always time and effort well-spent – because it makes us better prepared for the next new disease or outbreak, whenever that may occur.
WHO will continue to support the Philippines and all countries in their preparedness and response efforts. The current outbreak is a test for all of us, but by focusing not only on what confronts us today, but planning ahead for tomorrow, taking steps to ensure preparedness efforts reach every corner of every country, together we will be able to limit the health, social, and economic impacts. – Rappler.com

MANILA, Philippines – President Rodrigo Duterte once again turned to the military when confronting problems faced by the government, saying he would tap uniformed personnel to ensure order in the country in the event the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak becomes a pandemic.
Duterte on Monday, February 10, said he wanted the military and police to instill public order should the spread of the coronavirus worsen. He likewise said that while the government was ""on top"" of the ""idiot"" coronavirus threat, doctors should work double-time to find a cure to the virus.
""Kung sabihin mo na ano, pandemic talaga (If you say it's really a pandemic already), then I will have to utilize for order and obedience of people, the military and the police,"" Duterte said in a speech before local chief executives.
Earlier in his speech, Duterte rejected criticisms his administration was slow to act on the coronavirus and that it lacked the infrastructure to deal with such an outbreak. He cited the expertise and restrictive measures taken by health officials as proof it was dealing with the disease.
Despite this, Duterte continued to downplay the spread of the coronavirus, saying the public would rely on the strength of Filipinos' antibodies to prevent the spread and further contamination from the virus.
""You want to shout to the heavens? Go ahead. Will it prevent the coronavirus from entering the country? Long before the alarm was raised marami nang mga (there were many) Chinese and Filipinos...na pumunta na doon (who went there [Wuhan]. So kung sabihin mo (So if you say) it's a matter of contamination, we will just have to rely on how strong the antibodies of the Philippines are,"" Duterte said.

Duterte also sought to give assurances once more that Filipinos had nothing to worry about as he said the government was ""doing its best"" to respond to the spread of the coronavirus in the Philippines.
""Maniwala lang kayo sa gobyerno (Just have faith in the government), in a crisis involving deaths and getting people sick, we will do our very best,"" he said.
While health officials have given assurances they are closely monitoring suspected novel coronavirus cases in the country, they repeatedly reminded the public to practice good personal hygiene such as frequent handwashing and to seek medical treatment immediately, if necessary.
So far, health officials announced 284 patients were under investigation for the coronavirus in the Philippines.
The Department of Health has confirmed 3 cases of the novel coronavirus in the Philippines. These include the first death outside China – a 44-year-old Chinese man who traveled to the Philippines from Wuhan. The man was the country's second confirmed case of the novel coronavirus, and a companion of the first patient, a 38-year-old Chinese woman, who has since recovered from the virus.
The Philippines' third confirmed case, a 60-year-old woman from China, also subsequently tested negative for the novel coronavirus after a few days in the hospital and has since returned to China.
As of Monday, the novel coronavirus has killed over 900 and sickened over 40,000 globally, with China as the worst-hit country. Meanwhile, at least 3,400 have reportedly recovered. – Rappler.com "

CEBU, Philippines – The Cebu Provincial Board on Monday, February 10, passed on first, second, and third reading an ordinance against the spread of false information regarding the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). 
The ordinance will penalize people spreading false information on social media or text about the disease. The penalties will range from a fine of up to P5,000 or less than one year of jail time.
Residents who see posts online containing fake nCoV-related news or who receive text messages on the 2019-nCoV should pass on their complaints to the Provincial Legal Office.
The ordinance also prohibits and penalizes any misdeclaration of information on Health Declaration Cards which passengers are required to fill in. 
Pertinent information filled in by passengers – such as whether or not passengers have been in China, Macau, or Hong Kong in the past 14 days – will be counterchecked by the Bureau of Immigration upon checking passports. The same penalties for fake news also apply for any falsification in the health cards.
The Office of the Governor cerified the ordinance as urgent.
According to 4th District Board Member Honorable Kerrie Shimura, chairperson on the Committee of Health and Social Services, the ordinance is in line with Executive Order (EO) 5 and 5-A series of 2020, recently signed by Governor Gwen Garcia.
Workers in local government offices violating the protocols provided by the preceding EOs will be dealt administrative disciplinary action, including civil or criminal actions allowed by the Local Government Code.
EO 5 explains the protocols on the travel ban along and the hybrid quarantine system. Filipinos and permanent visa holders from China, Macau or Hong Kong or any country but have been in the enumerated states for the past 14 weeks are given the option to choose to undergo a home-based quarantine or a facility quarantine. EO 5-A, meanwhile, is the protocol for seaports on both passenger and cargo vessels.
Both are preventive executive orders meant to address confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV.
As of Monday, February 10, the number of those who have died from 2019-nCoV has reached over 900. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – The first patient confirmed to have the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in the Philippines has recovered from the infection, the Department of Health (DOH) confirmed on Monday, February 10.  
Health Undersecretary Eric Domingo said that the 38-year-old woman from Wuhan, China, who was the Philippines' first case of the novel coronavirus, has tested negative for the virus twice and ""has in fact been discharged.""
Domingo could not confirm if the woman has already flown back to China since her release from the hospital on Saturday, February 8. 
Before testing negative for the virus, the woman had already been recovering in San Lazaro Hospital and had not been showing symptoms.  
The woman's recovery from the disease means that there are currently no living patients with the virus in the Philippines.  
The woman's traveling companion, a 44-year-old man who also tested positive for the novel coronavirus, died of complications due to severe pneumonia. 
The Philippines' third confirmed case, a 60-year-old woman from China, also subsequently tested negative for the novel coronavirus after a few days in the hospital. She has since returned to China, according to the DOH.  
The third case, Domingo had earlier said, was evidence that ""the virus can be eliminated as immune system mounts response against it.""
But the DOH still urges the public to remain vigilant and practice precautionary measures, as the disease continues to claim lives in China.
As of Monday, the novel coronavirus has killed 910 and sickened over 40,500 globally, with China as the worst-hit country. But at least 3,400 have reportedly recovered. 
As of Monday, the DOH has probed a total of 314 patients for possible novel coronavirus infection. A total of 261 patients under investigation are still admitted to hospitals, while 50 have been discharged. 
Here is the breakdown of patients under investigation per region:

Ilocos Region - 3
Cagayan Valley - 13 
Cordillera Administrative Region - 7
Central Luzon - 41
Metro Manila - 115

Only one person died due to the novel coronavirus in the Philippines, but it marked the first death due to the virus outside China. Two other patients under investigation, who both tested negative for the virus, died due to other illnesses, 
The Philippine government has imposed a temporary travel ban to mainland China and the special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau in an effort to curb the spread of the virus.
Some 30 Filipinos from Hubei province, the epicenter of the outbreak, were also repatriated on Sunday, February 9, and are currently under quarantine in New Clark City in Capas, Tarlac. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – Four more Filipinos aboard a cruise ship quarantined off Yokohama, Japan, tested positive for the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).
""The 4 Filipinos, who are all crew members, are among the 6 newly confirmed cases of the virus since the vessel was docked...on February 4,"" the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) said in a statement on Monday, February 10.
The total number of infected Filipinos on the Diamond Princess cruise ship is now at 5, with one other crew member earlier confirmed to have the virus. They are being treated in hospitals in Japan.
Dozens of other people aboard the Diamond Princess have also tested positive for 2019-nCoV.
The Japanese government quarantined the cruise ship after an 80-year-old passenger who departed from Hong Kong was found to have the virus. The ship, carrying some 3,700 passengers and crew, is anchored off a pier in the Kanagawa Prefecture capital.
The DFA earlier said 538 Filipinos were onboard the Diamond Princess.
The agency again assured the public that the Philippine embassy in Tokyo is ""closely coordinating with Japanese authorities, and is in constant communication with the Filipinos still onboard [the cruise ship], to provide them all possible assistance.""
As of Monday morning, the novel coronavirus has killed 908 people and infected over 40,000 people across 26 countries.

MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – Labor Secretary Silvestre Bello III said that financial and employment assistance will be readily available for overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) repatriated from novel coronavirus-hit areas such as China, Hong Kong, and Macau. 
Bello said the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) is ""ready with its reintegration program,"" which will consist of immediate financial assistance, as well as help with employment and livelihood opportunities. 
Repatriated OFWs will receive at least P20,000 from DOLE. ""When they come here, no questions asked, as long as they're an active member of the Overseas Workers Welfare Administration, we give financial assistance,"" Bello said.  
The labor secretary added that repatriated OFWs who choose to remain in the Philippines will get livelihood assistance from DOLE. The labor department will also assist those who end up seeking jobs abroad anew.
""We have been busy establishing labor relations with countries such as Canada, Russia, Czechoslovakia, Croatia, even China (for this purpose),"" Bello said. 
OFW parents can also apply for scholarships for their children. ""This is a long-term assistance,"" the labor chief added. 
So far, a total of 30 Filipinos have been repatriated from Hubei province in China, the epicenter of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak. 
They are now under a 14-day quarantine period at the Athletes' Village in New Clark City. None of them showed symptoms of the 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease, according to the Department of Health (DOH).  
It remains unclear whether there will be a second batch of OFWs to be repatriated and quarantined, but the Department of Foreign Affairs said it would be ready to assist them should they express interest in returning to the Philippines. 
The interagency task force on emerging infectious diseases led by the DOH is also mulling the expansion of the novel coronavirus travel ban from just mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau, to include Taiwan.
According to Bello, there are at least 120,000 documented OFWs in Taiwan.
""You can expect to add maybe another 20,000 of undocumented OFWs,"" he said. 
The DOH said the the decision will be finalized Monday, February 10, after a meeting of the task force. 
Under the current ban, all non-Filipinos traveling from China and its special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau are barred from entering the country. Travelers coming from transit points in Hong Kong are covered by the travel ban as well. Likewise, Filipinos are barred from traveling to China, Hong Kong, and Macau. 
DOLE had already said OFWs affected by the travel ban will be given P10,000, as well as assistance with accommodation and transportation from the government. The same benefits would be extended to OFWs affected by a travel ban to Taiwan, if imposed. 
Bello said that as of Monday, there are about 3,500 returning OFWs stranded in the Philippines due to the travel ban. He said that the number could rise to as high as 10,000 to 15,000. 
Department of Foreign Affairs Undersecretary Ernesto Abella said officials will reach out to the employers of the affected Filipinos to explain the government's ban.
""The consulates through POLO (Philippine Overseas Labor Office) will contact their employers and explain the situation to them,"" he said.
So far, the Philippines has 3 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus. They are imported cases, the patients having traveled from China. One of them died, one is recovering in a hospital, and the other already tested negative for the virus after a second round of tests.

MANILA, Philippines (5th UPDATE) Thirty Filipinos returned from China’s Hubei province, the epicenter of an outbreak of the deadly novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), are now back in the Philippines on Sunday morning, February 9.  
In a press statement, the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) said the repatriated Filipinos on the chartered flight which ""landed at the Haribon Hangar in Clark Air Base included 29 adults and one infant.""
Also quarantined are two individuals from the Philippine consulate in China who handled the repatriates' documents, said the Department of Health (DOH).

The DFA called for the repatriation of Filipinos in China on January 28.
However, only 30 returned to the Philippines, from the earlier announced 56, because of some circumstances on the ground.
One family, said the DFA, ""had a change of heart."" Some Filipinos there also cited the government's travel restrictions on flying back to China as their reason for staying behind, added the DFA.
Asked if there would be a 2nd batch of repatriates, the DFA said it depends on the demand. ""Also, please be reminded that the repatriation was organized mainly for the Filipinos and their families in Wuhan or Hubei because of the existing lockdown where they couldn’t move even if they wanted to.""
Levels of screening
In a separate statement, the DOH explained that the repatriates underwent 3 levels of screening before they were able to fly back home:

Only asymptomatic individuals, or those who do not show symptoms, were allowed to board.
During the flight, they were closely monitored for any symptoms.
Upon landing, they were checked again for symptoms.

Officials from the DFA and the DOH earlier said the 30 would be brought to the New Clark City Athletes’ Village and will be quarantined for 14 days, alongside the team assigned to repatriate them. 
Health Undersecretary Gerardo Bayugo said in a briefing on Sunday afternoon that ""no contamination"" happened and no one showed symptoms at the airport.
""So all the people who were repatriated are now safe and resting in the quarantine facilities in New Clark City,"" he said.
The DOH Central Luzon Center for Health Development has declared code blue for hospitals and health facilities in the region to immediately address medical needs of the repatriated Filipinos.
""If an individual, during his or her stay in the quarantine facility, suddenly shows signs and symptoms, the DOH had deployed medical teams to immediately assess and facilitate transfer to [a] hospital for close monitoring,"" added the DOH.
How the quarantine will work
Upon landing, the repatriates disembarked at the hangar, and not the passenger area, of the Clark International Airport. They will be transferred directly to the quarantine facilities at the Athletes’ Village.
There, they will each be given their own room. Medical staff will be on hand round the clock to monitor their health. Support staff will mostly be working in a separate building from the repatriates in quarantine.
The repatriates will be allowed to use mobile phones mainly to stay in touch with their families and relatives. The facility will have Wi-Fi.
The team of government representatives left Clark at 10:15 pm on Saturday, February 8, on a chartered flight from the Royal Air Charter Service, arriving in Wuhan Tianhe International Airport early morning on February 9.
In a statement on Sunday, Presidential Spokesperson Salvador Panelo said the safety of Filipinos here and abroad ""continues to be the paramount concern"" of the government.
""Let us pray for our fellow countrymen, as well as [for] the members of the repatriation team...that they do not show any symptom of having caught the virus,"" he added. – with reports from Janella Paris and Sofia Tomacruz/Rappler.com "

Of the 3 confirmed 2019-nCoV cases, the first patient, a Chinese woman, already tested negative for the virus after the most recent tests by the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine. The DOH said she was well and no longer showed symptoms.
The second patient, the first patient’s partner who traveled with her to the Philippines from Wuhan, China, died of complications due to the novel coronavirus. His was the first death due to the virus outside China.
The third patient has since returned to China after a second round of tests showed her negative for 2019-nCoV.
Outside the Philippines, two Filipinos were reported to have contracted 2019-nCov: one is based in Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates, and the other, a crew member of a Japanese cruise ship.
On Saturday night, the Philippine government sent a chartered flight to Wuhan, China, to repatriate at least 26 Filipinos from Hubei province, the epicenter of the 2019-nCoV outbreak.

MANILA, Philippines – The government on Saturday, February 8, started repatriating Filipinos from China’s Hubei province, the epicenter of the outbreak of the deadly novel coronavirus.
The first batch of at least 26 repatriates are expected to arrive at Clark International Airport in Pampanga at around 5 am on Sunday, February 9, and will then be brought to the New Clark City Athletes’ Village where they will be quarantined for 14 days, officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) and the Department of Health (DOH) said in a media briefing on Saturday evening.
A team of 8 representatives from the government were to depart from Clark at 10:15 pm on Saturday on board a chartered flight from the Royal Air Charter Service, and were expected to arrive at the Wuhan Tianhe International Airport at 1:15 am on Sunday.
The team consists of 3 officials from the DFA Office of the Undersecretary for Migrant Workers’ Affairs (OUMWA), and two doctors, two nurses, and one medical technologist from the DOH.
They will assist the repatriates and give them medical screenings during the 3-hour flight back to Clark onboard the same chartered plane.
Two officials from the Philippine Consulate General in Shanghai, China, accompanied the repatriates while waiting at the airport in Wuhan.
The members of the repatriation team from the DFA and DOH, and the flight crew will also be subjected to the 14-day quarantine, the officials said.
There were more than 40 people on the repatriation flight’s manifest but only 26 of them were at the airport as of 8 pm on Saturday, when the officials gave the media briefing. Only 10 more were expected to show up, but the repatriation team “will wait until the last minute,” said DFA-OUMWA Undersecretary Sarah Lou Arriola.
The others may have decided to stay behind or could not make the 10-hour trip to the airport in Wuhan, Hubei’s capital city. Still others may have problems with their visas or were caught up in cases that prevent them from exiting China, Arriola added.
The repatriates will be monitored throughout the flight home and be subjected to 3 levels of medical screenings, said DOH Undersecretary Dr. Gerardo Bayugo.
Upon landing, the repatriates will disembark at the hangar, not the passenger area, of the Clark International Airport. They will then be transferred directly to the quarantine facilities at the Athletes’ Village.
There, they will each be given their own room. Medical staff will be on hand round the clock to monitor their health. Support staff will mostly be working in a separate building from the repatriates in quarantine.
The repatriates will be allowed to use mobile phones mainly to stay in touch with their families and relatives. The facility will have WiFi connection.
Among the repatriates is an infant, Arriola said. Fearing stigma, they asked the DFA not to disclose their identities to the public.
The Philippines has had 3 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus, of whom one died on February 1. Philippine officials have so far placed a total of 267 people under a probe for the virus.
At least 722 people have died from the virus in China while more than 34,000 have been infected, according to the latest official figures.

PANIC BUYING. People look at the empty shelves at a local supermarket in Singapore after panic buying swept through the city after the government raised the alert level for a deadly novel coronavirus in Singapore on February 8. Photo by Roslan Rahman/AFP 
SINGAPORE – Philippine Ambassador Joseph Yap urged Filipinos to stay calm but vigilant after Singapore raised its disease alert level a notch higher to “code orange” due to the novel coronavirus threat.
“My personal appeal to all our kababayans (countrymen) is to stay calm, do not panic, but be vigilant. It is likely that the spread of the virus will get worse before it gets better,” Yap told Rappler on Saturday, February 8.
Yap said around 200,000 Filipinos work in Singapore – 40% as household service workers and 60% as service workers and professionals.
“I would like to emphasize that code orange encourages us to cancel or defer large-scale gatherings, avoid crowded places, and adopt heightened measures to prevent infection. Let us all do our share and contribute to the overall efforts of the Singapore government to address the problem,” the ambassador added.
Code orange refers to the 3rd highest level in Singapore’s 4-tier color-coded system for disease outbreaks, which Singapore developed after it battled the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003.
Under the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (Dorscon) of Singapore, code orange means that “the disease is severe and spreads easily from person to person, but the disease has not spread widely in Singapore and is being contained.”
Excluding the 64 novel coronavirus cases aboard a Japanese cruise ship, Singapore has the highest number of novel coronavirus cases outside China, based on data from the World Health Organization (WHO) as of Friday, February 7. No deaths linked to this virus, however, have been reported in Singapore.
China has at least 31,211 of the 31,481 novel coronavirus cases around the world. At least 637 people have died in China due to the novel coronavirus, while one has died in the Philippines.
Panic buying in Singapore
Singapore’s declaration of code orange on Friday prompted locals to rush to groceries and hoard vitamins, sanitizers, tissue papers, and instant noodles just hours after the announcement.
Many Singaporeans compared the panic buying to the “zombie apocalypse,” which, according to them, is typical of their “kiasu” culture – a fear of losing out in this highly-competitive country.
The panic buying worried the Singaporean government enough to issue an advisory against it on Friday. “Be responsible and do not hoard items. Panic and over-buying supplies will deprive others who really need these things,” the Singaporean government said.
In a video message on Saturday, Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong warned Singaporeans: “Fear can do more harm than the virus itself. It can make us panic, or do things which make matters worse, like circulating rumours online, hoarding face masks or food, or blaming particular groups for the outbreak.”

Singapore raised Dorscon code orange after a few of the 33 novel coronavirus positive cases in the country have been found to have neither links to previous coronavirus cases nor recent travels to China.
Does code orange mean the Philippines will also regulate travel by Filipinos to and from Singapore, as the Philippines did with mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau? The Philippines recently banned Filipinos from traveling to mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau, while requiring Filipinos coming from these areas to quarantine themselves for 14 days.
Yap said the embassy defers to the Philippine national government on any possible travel ban to and from Singapore.
“However, if our opinion is requested by Manila since we are more aware of the situation here in Singapore, we would suggest that there is no need for a travel advisory at this time. While there is some community spread of the virus, the spread of the virus is still very limited at 33 as of last count, and the well-organized efforts of the Singapore government to contain it, which to me are highly remarkable, should minimize the chances of widespread infection,” Yap said.
Read our full Q and A with the ambassador below:
RAPPLER: How prepared is the embassy to deal with possible coronavirus cases among the Filipinos here in Singapore?
AMBASSADOR YAP: The best preparation we are doing is basically information drive, that is to ensure that the reminders and advisories of both our government and the host country on preventive measures are properly cascaded to all Filipinos in Singapore.
Every day, the Ministry of Health (MOH) of Singapore gives updates on the status of the host government’s efforts to contain the spread of the virus. We are encouraging all our kababayans here in Singapore to do their share by keeping themselves updated and by doing their part to contribute to the overall efforts to stop the spread.
The Embassy issues regular advisories and updates to the Filipino community through its website and facebook page.
RAPPLER: What coordination is the Philippine embassy here making, if any, with the Singaporean government to protect our Filipino workers here, especially domestic helpers?
AMBASSADOR YAP: I share your particular interest in the safety of our domestic workers. But remember that the virus does not discriminate against anybody. so our reminders are directed to all our kababayans here in Singapore.
Before the Ministry of Health convened a meeting with the members of the diplomatic corps last Wednesday, we already made arrangements with them to inform us immediately if any Filipino national is confined for the 201-nCoV infection. I personally met with a Ministry official on 3 February to formally convey our request and get some updates on Singapore’s efforts to contain the spread of the virus and establish lines of communication.
The reminders and guidelines issued by the Ministry of Health of Singapore are applicable to all foreign workers, Filipinos included: observance of good personal hygiene, being socially responsible, monitoring of personal health condition, and now deferment or cancellation of large-scale events.
The Embassy has also coordinated with the MOH to ensure that our front line Filipino medical personnel are properly protected in the performance of their work. We have received the assurance of MOH that all necessary precautions and protocols are in place to protect all medical staff.
Another request we conveyed to the Ministry of Health is to inform us (Philippine Embassy) immediately if any Filipino national has been infected and confined so that our Assistance to Nationals SOP can be activated, which involves coordination with the family of the infected individual and monitoring of his or her health condition.
We will respond according to the needs of the affected individual and in coordination with the host country.
Internally, the Embassy has already organized ourselves. We have established a Task Force that is in charge of the action plans to deal with the problem.
RAPPLER: Is the Philippine government considering a travel ban to and from Singapore given the declaration of code orange? Why or why not?
AMBASSADOR YAP: Every country makes a decision on such a matter on the basis of its national interest. We leave it up to our national government officials to make a decision on this. However, if our opinion is requested by Manila since we are more aware of the situation here in Singapore, we would suggest that there is no need for a travel advisory at this time. While there is some community spread of the virus, the spread of the virus is still very limited at 33 as of last count, and the well-organized efforts of the Singapore government to contain it, which to me are highly remarkable, should minimize the chances of widespread infection. Therefore, the current situation does not require such an advisory at this time.
RAPPLER: What safety tips or perhaps words of assurance can you give our kababayans as Singapore is under code orange?
YAP: My personal appeal to all our kababayans is to stay calm, do not panic but be vigilant. It is likely that the spread of the virus will get worse before it gets better. The Singapore Government and the MOH are on top of the situation. They have a multi-ministry task force that is coordinating the response of Singapore to this virus. They are very well organized and they have the added advantage of having gone through the SARs outbreak.
Let us religiously observe the guidelines of the host government, particularly in relation to the monitoring of our personal health, good personal hygiene and tips on how to avoid getting the virus.
I would like to emphasize that code orange encourages us to cancel or defer large-scale gatherings, avoid crowded places, and adopt heightened measures to prevent infection. Let us all do our share and contribute to the overall efforts of the Singapore government to address the problem
To those who want to know more about the overall picture of the virus spread in Singapore, we encourage you to visit the MOH website: www.moh.og.sg or you can email us (atnsgpe@gmail.com) or you call us through our hotline: 9072 2797

MANILA, Philippines – Zambales Governor Hermogenes Ebdane said provincial health officials were currently monitoring a patient who shared he had traveled together with two patients in the Philippines earlier confirmed to have the 2019 novel coronavirus.
In a statement, Ebdane said the patient ""voluntarily reached out to the DOH [Department of Health], divulging a history of travel together with the two Chinese patients who were tested and confirmed to be positive for the virus.""
The patient has been confined at the Ramon Magsaysay Memorial Hospital since Thursday, February 6, and was among persons under Investigation by health officials.
Ebdane said that the patient, who remained in isolation, was assessed to be ""well and stable, exhibiting no pertinent symptoms such as fever, cough, or difficulty breathing.""
He added the hospital sent the patient's specimen samples to the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine to confirm if the patient had the coronavirus.
The latest in the Philippines. Philippine authorities said they were monitoring 215 persons for the novel coronavirus as Saturday, February 8. 
So far, the Department of Health has confirmed 3 cases of the novel coronavirus in the Philippines, including the first death outside China – a 44-year-old Chinese man who traveled to the Philippines from Wuhan. The man was the country's second confirmed case of 2019-nCoV, and a companion of the first patient, a 38-year-old Chinese woman.
As of Saturday morning, February 8, the novel coronavirus has killed 720 people and infected over 34,000 people across 26 countries.

AKLAN, Philippines – A multi-agency task force has put in place strict and intensified border checkpoints when entering Boracay Island in an effort to prevent the spread of the 2019 novel coronavirus.
Acting Malay town mayor Frolibar Bautista asked law enforcement agencies and health personnel to enforce travel restrictions on visitors who have recently travelled to China, Macau and Hong Kong.
There are no longer direct flights from Wuhan, China and other cities in mainland China to Kalibo International Airport, but authorities will continue to expand health screenings of travelers, not only in local airports.
In Executive Order No. 004 series of 2020 issued on Thursday, February 6, Bautista suspended the entry of all travelers with travel history from China and its special administrative regions for the past 14 days.
The Philippine National Police, Philippine Army, Philippine Coast Guard, Bureau of Immigration and the Bureau of Quarantine are also directed to coordinate with the Malay Municipal Health Office (MHO) and Municipal Tourism Office to check incoming travellers at Malay’s seaports, airport and roads.
What to expect. On February 7, Friday, 3 border checkpoints, located within the two kilometer radius of Caticlan port, were set up in the barangays of Union (Nabas) and Caticlan (Malay) near Nabas-Malay boundary, in barangay Dumlog in mainland Malay and Sitio Bacolod in Barangay Caticlan to monitor and identify people who may have coronavirus symptoms.
The new measure to operate border checkpoints in all entry points to Malay, Aklan and Boracay Island would be the first line of defense against individuals who experienced flu-like symptoms of the contagious disease.
Meanwhile, Foreigners and local tourists arriving through Kalibo and Caticlan airports, northern Antique and Iloilo, ports of Caticlan and Alegria (Buruanga) via roll-on, roll-off vessels from Batangas and Mindoro, and motorized pumpboats from Romblon would also be screened for signs of fever and cough.
Aside from this, handheld thermometers were also operational in border checkpoints where inbound travelers to Boracay Island would be required to present their passports for verification. Health personnel and law enforcers were also wearing surgical face masks for their protection.
If a traveller shows symptoms, MHO workers will perform a more detailed medical assessment, and the traveler is taken to a hospital for further care.
No coronavirus cases. So far, there have been no reported coronavirus cases in Malay, Aklan and Boracay Island, according to task force deputy information manager Madel Joy Tayco.
The local task force on coronavirus said some 180 persons were under monitoring (PUMS) in Boracay Island as of February 7.
MHO and the task force have been cooperating closely with hotels and establishments to ensure public safety and health of residents and other visitors, and have been keeping a close watch on PUMs in the island.
Tayco also reiterated the importance of proper hygiene and hand washing to prevent infection of coronavirus which has caused deaths and illnesses worldwide. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – The Department of Health (DOH) is now probing 215 persons for the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in the Philippines as of Friday noon, February 7.
The latest figure was higher than the 178 reported the previous day, February 6. Of the 215, 185 are admitted to hospitals, 17 have been discharged, while 3 have died, two of whom due to causes other than the novel coronavirus. 
Health Undersecretary Eric Domingo said that the latest death of a patient under investigation was confirmed Thursday, February 6.
The patient, a Chinese male whose age was not disclosed, died of ""underlying restrictive lung disease."" The DOH had earlier reported the death of a patient under investigation, but for preexisting medical conditions unrelated to the novel coronavirus (READ: TIMELINE: The novel coronavirus epidemic) 
Of the 215 patients, a total of 48 already tested negative for the virus. At least 127 test results are still pending as of this posting. 
So far, there are 3 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus in the country.
The first patient already tested negative for the novel coronavirus in the latest round of tests of the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine, but another test with negative results is needed before she can be discharged from the hospital. Domingo said she is well and no longer showing symptoms. 
The second patient, her partner who traveled with her to the Philippines from Wuhan, China, died of complications due to the novel coronavirus. His death marked the first death due to the virus outside China.
The third patient has since returned to China after a second round of tests showed she was already negative for the novel coronavirus.  
Domingo disclosed that 9 patients under investigation have refused to be admitted to hospitals. He said the DOH is working with local authorities to convince them to get admitted.
According to Domingo, some have refused admission due to anxieties over hospital expenses. He said they can rest assured that expenses for the novel coronavirus treatment will be shouldered by the government. 
The increase in the number of patients under investigation came after the DOH tracked down all 441 contacts of the first two confirmed cases. The couple, who was traveling from Wuhan, China, went to Cebu and Dumaguete City before seeking medical help in Manila. 
Of the 441 contacts, 32 are included in the 215 being probed by the DOH, while 203 are under home quarantine as they showed no symptoms. 
Domingo said 206 of the contacts have yet to be interviewed by the health department's Epidemiology Bureau due to erroneous contact details. Health officials are coordinating with local authorities in Cebu and Dumaguete City to get in touch with them. 
Below is the breakdown of patients per region:

Ilocos Region - 3
Cagayan - 4

Repatriation efforts
Repatriation efforts for the 45 Filipinos who had expressed desire to be brought home from Hubei province in China are underway, with the Department of Foreign Affairs personnel coordinating with Chinese authorities for the necessary clearance.
Once in the Philippines, the returnees will be quarantined in the Athletes' Village in New Clark City in Capas, Tarlac. 
They are expected to arrive on Sunday morning, February 9, but the date is not final as the Philippines has yet to get clearance from the Chinese government for repatriation. 
Efforts of the government's interagency task force on the novel coronavirus have also been met with resistance from the Capas local government, who said they were not consulted by the agencies involved that the quarantine area will be in their community. 
""DOH did not at all involve Capas LGU in its last-minute decision for New Clark City to be used as quarantine zone,"" Capas Mayor Reynaldo Catacutan said in a statement Friday.
But in an interview with CNN Philippines, the town's vice mayor admitted that the New Clark City is under the jurisdiction of the Bases Conversion and Development Authority, which offered the facility to the DOH for use in its quarantine procedure. 
Domingo said the DOH has since reached out to the local government of Capas. He said that repatriates will be isolated and not affect any member of the community. 
He reiterated that Filipinos who are cleared by the Chinese government for repatriation will first undergo screening by Chinese health officials before boarding the chartered plane that will take them to Clark. They will then undergo another screening by DOH personnel before takeoff. If they show symptoms in China, they will be sent to Chinese health facilities for treatment.

,"February 06, 2020",nCov,"Camiguin restricts entry of travelers from China, Hong Kong, Macau over coronavirus threat",Bobby Lagsa,"
 
CAGAYAN DE ORO, Philippines – Camiguin Island will now restrict the entry of foreign tourists with travel history to China, Hong Kong, and Macau in the last 3 months as a precautionary measure against the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). 
With summer just around the corner, Camiguin is expecting an influx of tourists, from 50,000 per month to a peak of 80,000 during Holy Week.
Camiguin Governor Jurdin Jesus Romualdo on January 31 issued Executive Order (EO) No. 5, which requires every tourist to disclose their travel history in the last 3 months prior to their arrival in the island.
The EO was issued days earlier than the national government's expanded ban on travelers from the 3 countries.
Tourists from other countries who merely had a layover in China, Hong Kong, and Macau will also not be allowed to enter the island. According to the governor, they simply followed the President's order not to allow even those with a layover in China to enter the country.
Romualdo said that they have deployed screeners in Camiguin Airport and two ports to individually interview foreign tourists about their travel history.
In January, a tourist in the island was put in isolation and considered a person under investigation for the novel coronavirus. The tourist tested negative for the virus.
There were at least 130 Chinese tourists in Camiguin in the last week of January.
""The province of Camiguin is one of the tourist destinations in the Philippines, making the introduction of the disease in the province a high probability,"" Romualdo said.
He said they cannot take chances in allowing tourists with travel history to the 3 countries.
The island province also created a novel coronavirus task force to implement measures that will prevent the virus from entering the island.
""It is important that precautionary measures and protocol are established to monitor the presence of the disease and make a timely response if it arises,"" Romualdo said.
Romualdo said they instructed and trained hotel staff to report tourists suspected to have the novel coronavirus to the Camiguin Provincial Health Office and the Camiguin General Hospital. They also asked hotels to refund accommodation bookings made by Chinese tourists even before coming to the island.
""We have met with hotel operators and asked for their cooperation,"" Romualdo said.
EO covers residents, too
The EO also covers residents in the island who have travel history to China, Hong Kong, and Macau.
""This requirement is also mandatory to every resident of Camiguin who has [traveled] to places where [the] novel coronavirus has been proven to exist,"" the EO stated.
It requires residents with travel history to undergo a medical check-up.
Romualdo said the government can prosecute any person found to have willfully hidden such required information when demanded. The person shall be subject to investigation and applicable criminal prosecution.
Meanwhile in Cagayan de Oro City, Mayor Oscar Moreno thumbed down a proposal to put a business park on lockdown following hearsay of Chinese residents who supposedly have the novel coronavirus.
Earlier this week, Councilor George Goking proposed that the city's 2019-nCoV task force order a lockdown on the Alwana Business Park in Barangay Cugman. Some Chinese citizens working in Cagayan de Oro City are living in the business park's residential buildings.
A fake news circulated this week that there was a Chinese who died in one of the hotels because of the novel coronavirus. The City Health Office and the Department of Health conducted an inspection and found nothing.
""The task force did not really push through with the idea due to legal implications,"" Goking told reporters here.
Goking said that he would request it if the Alwana Business Park management refuses to cooperate with government agencies who may be conducting an ocular inspection there.
Moreno said he will not be restricting the movement of people and vehicles in and out of the complex just because Chinese nationals are living there.
""Just because they are Chinese, [does not mean] we have to look at them differently,"" Moreno said in a radio interview.
""You don't order [a] lockdown simply because of the race issue. It's not doable. What we need is simply communication, and, of course, they have been very cooperative. Let's not jump to conclusions just because they're Chinese."" Moreno added.
The novel coronavirus that originated from Wuhan, China, has so far killed 564 and sickened over 28,000 people across the country and worldwide. The World Health Organization already declared an international emergency over the virus.

MANILA, Philippines – The Department of Health (DOH) on Thursday, February 6, confirmed that the 45 Filipinos to be repatriated from Hubei province in China – the epicenter of the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak – will be quarantined in New Clark City's Athletes' Village in Tarlac. 
Health Secretary Francisco Duque III inspected the facility on Thursday morning and said that the place is ready to house the returning Filipinos, who are expected to arrive early Sunday, February 9.
Upon arrival, the overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) from Hubei will immediately be counted as patients under investigation, of which there are 178 as of Thursday. (READ: 'Novel coronavirus' or 2019 nCoV: What we know so far)
Two buildings in New Clark City, which was used during the 2019 Southeast Asian Games, will be used for quarantine – one for asymptomatic patients and the other for those who develop symptoms.
There will also be a polyclinic in the facility, where returnees who develop symptoms throughout the 14-day quarantine period will be brought and treated. The two buildings will be cordoned off from the rest of New Clark City, according to Duque. 
Contact with the outside world will be minimal, Duque said. Patients will only be allowed to communicate with their families over the internet. 
The health chief also said that medical staff from 5 nearby hospitals will alternate shifts to tend to the returnees. 
""We will be providing the needed medical logistics including hygiene kits, disinfectant solutions, transportation, and other things that will be needed in the quarantine process,"" he added.  
How repatriation will work: According to Foreign Affairs Undersecretary Brigido Dulay, Filipinos who are cleared by the Chinese government for repatriation will first undergo screening by Chinese health officials before boarding the chartered plane that will take them to Clark. 
If they are found with symptoms by Chinese health officials, they will not be allowed to come back home to the Philippines. Instead, they will be brought to hospitals in China for treatment and observation. 
If they don't show any symptoms, they will be allowed to board the plane, where 5 DOH personnel will check them for symptoms a second time. If they are absolutely not symptomatic, they will be allowed to fly home to the Philippines. Otherwise, they will be treated in Chinese health facilities.
Upon arrival in Clark, they will again be checked for symptoms. Those who have fever, coughs, and colds will immediately be brought to the facility's polyclinic and be isolated from the rest of the returnees who show no symptoms. 
According to Dulay, a team from the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) in Wuhan, China, is already working with Chinese authorities to secure the necessary permits for the repatriation.  
""Today we already have our DFA team inside Wuhan City and they are there working on the ground preparing for the repatriation of our OFWs. They are on the ground and they're taking the risk,"" Dulay said.  
He also revealed that 4 of the 45 Filipinos who want to be repatriated have problems with their immigration status, which means it remains uncertain if they will be able to come home on Sunday. 
After the quarantine period, the returning OFWs will be assisted by the Overseas Workers Welfare Authority for employment concerns, the DOH and the DFA said.
The novel coronavirus that originated from Wuhan, China, has so far killed 564 and sickened over 28,000 people across the country and worldwide. The World Health Organization already declared an international emergency over the virus.

LEGAZPI CITY, Philippines – Albay's famed Magayon Festival has joined the list of the country's tourist-magnet events scrapped because of health fears caused by the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).
Albay Governor Al Francis Bichara announced the cancellation of the month-long Magayon Festival Wednesday, February 5, during a meeting with all department heads of the provincial government at the Governor's Guest House.
The Magayon Festival is held every April in honor of the Bicol Region's iconic Mount Mayon.
""We need to avoid events that will draw in crowds,"" said Dorothy Colle, provincial tourism officer.
As of this posting, there are still no recorded incidents of nCoV infections in the Bicol Region.
In the same meeting, Bichara approved Albay's purchase of 4 thermal scanners to identify people with fever and other flu-like symptoms.
These thermal scanners will be placed at the Legazpi City Domestic Airport, Legazpi City Grand Bus terminal, malls and a a still unspecified public place.
The Provincial Government of Albay  advised the public to practice proper hygiene to prevent the spread of  infections. It also advised anyone showing symptoms of the virus such as coughing, sneezing, having hard time to breathe and respiratory ailment, toseek medical doctors and to do self-quarantine.
Isolation hospitals
The Department of Health in Bicol designated 3 government hospitals to be used in case of an nCoV outbreak in the province. These are the Bicol Regional Training and Teaching Hospital in Albay, Bicol Medical Center in Naga City and Bicol Sanitarium in Cabusao, Camarines Sur.
Dr. Ernie Vera, DOH Bicol director, said during the Regional Disaster Risk Reduction Management Council meeting held at the Office of Civil Defense Wednesday, that all referrals for suspected nCov patients will be referred to these hospitals.
The BRRTH, BMC and Bicol Sanitarium hospitals passed through the medical examination of Regional Epidemiology and Surveillance Unit (RESU) of Department of Health regional office here.
Vera said that BRTTH would admit persons under investigation (PUIs) for the virus from the provinces of Albay, Sorsogon, Masbate and Catanduanes; while the Bicol Medical Center will take PUIs coming from the provinces of Camarines Sur and Camarines Norte.
The Bicol Sanitarium would be the alternative facility in case of th high number of PUIs in the two identified government referral hospitals.

MANILA, Philippines – Rapid test kits that could expedite the process of confirming 2019 novel coronavirus cases in the Philippines need to be validated first by the World Health Organization (WHO) before use, the Department of Health (DOH) said.
As of Wednesday, February 5, the WHO has not validated a single rapid test kit for use of laboratories, according to Health Undersecretary Eric Domingo. This effectively means that no test kit has yet been approved by the Philippines' Food and Drug Administration (FDA). 
""There are actually test kits available, you can probably buy them online, but the WHO has not yet validated any test kit,"" Domingo said. 
Right now, the WHO-approved protocol is ""still the long laboratory test"" done by the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM), according to the health official. 
Currently, the RITM is running tests with primers from a referral laboratory in Japan, of which it has a limited supply. The DOH had initially sent samples to a referral laboratory in Australia to confirm the presence of the novel coronavirus – a process that took more than 48 hours.
With testing capacities in place locally, results can be expected within 24 to 48 hours. Rapid test kits would expedite the process of confirming novel coronavirus cases, making it more efficient for the government to perform disease detection.
""WHO told us that they're validating a test kit right now, and it might take one to two weeks before they come up with the recommendation,"" Domingo added. 
Scientists at the University of the Philippines' (UP) National Institutes of Health said on Tuesday, February 4, that they had developed test kits for the novel coronavirus and would release them next week to the RITM for validation. 
Domingo said that WHO also told the UP institute to send them the kits for validation. ""Once it's validated and it is very clear that it is accurate, then it can be used,"" Domingo said. 
While there are no commercial test kits cleared by the FDA for use as of Wednesday, infectious disease expert Edsel Salvana said that the FDA can fast-track the verification of such products in times of health emergencies.
Salvana also stressed that it is important for the RITM to test the validity of such kits first to ensure their efficacy.
""We don't want false positive and false negative results,"" he said. 
More persons in the Philippines are expected to be probed for the novel coronavirus after the DOH expanded its criteria for monitoring. 
It had initially screened only people coming from Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the outbreak, but has since expanded it to cover the rest of China. The DOH is now monitoring even asymptomatic people traveling from China.  
As of Wednesday noon, February 5, there are 133 patients under investigation for the novel coronavirus, 3 of whom tested positive. The virus has killed 492 and infected 23,939 across China and 24 other countries. (READ: First nCoV-related death outside China as patient dies in PH)

She added that a number of PHAP partner companies in Southeast Asia have commercially available test kits that have passed regulations in their own countries, though she did not reveal what these companies were and how many. 
She said, however, that PHAP would make sure that prospective test kits go through proper FDA screenings before being used locally. 
As testing capacities are being improved, medical experts like Edralin and Salvana echoed advisories from the DOH and WHO to remain calm and practice proper hygiene.

The Japanese government quarantined the Diamond Princess cruise ship after an 80-year-old passenger who departed from Hong Kong tested positive for 2019-nCoV.
The ship, carrying some 3,700 passengers, was prevented from sailing and is anchored off a pier in the Kanagawa Prefecture capital.
The Japanese Health Ministry said 10 individuals were later found to be infected, including 9 passengers and a crew member. All would be transferred to a health care facility for treatment.
Carnival Japan Incorporated, operator of the Diamond Princess, said the 10 infected include 3 Japanese, 3 Chinese, 2 Australians, an American, and a Filipino.
The DFA confirmed a Filipino was indeed among those who tested positive for the novel coronavirus. This marked the first confirmed case of 2019-nCoV in a Filipino.
The DFA gave assurances that the Philippine embassy in Tokyo is in ""constant communication"" with the remaining Filipinos on the ship.
The agency added that it is closely coordinating with Japanese authorities to provide all possible assistance to the Filipinos.
""The Philippine embassy in Tokyo is closely and actively monitoring the welfare of Filipinos onboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which is currently docked off the port of Yokohama, Japan, under a quarantine implemented by the Japanese government,"" the DFA said.
As of Wednesday morning, the novel coronavirus has killed 492 people and infected over 23,000 people across 25 countries.
The World Health Organization declared a global health emergency over the outbreak, which has prompted countries such as the Philippines and the United States to impose strict travel restrictions. – with reports from Kyodo News/Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – The provinces of Pampanga and Iloilo designated their respective isolation facilities Wednesday, February 5, in preparation for the possibility of a 2019 novel corona virus (nCoV) outbreak in the areas. 
In Pampanga, the  Bureau of Quarantine of the Clark International Airport (CRK) said the provincial government provided additional personnel to help monitor arrivals. The BOQ would train the new manpower on how to identify suspected cases of nCoV from arriving passengers.
Pampanga Governor Dennis Delta Pineda also said they were providing a 40-foot aluminum container van that would  be used as an isolation area for suspected nCoV 2019 positive passengers going through Clark airport.
Mabalacat City Mayor Crisostomo Garbo said they would  provide two ambulances for the Clark airport.
Iloilo isolation hospitals
Meanwhile, in Iloilo, the provincial government has designated the Dr. Ricardo Y. Ladrido Memorial District Hospital (DRYLMDH) in Lambunao town as the facility for the confinement of identified persons under investigation (PUI). PUIs are those who are manifesting flu-like symptoms.
Hospital Management Office Chief Dr. Cynthia Cabangal-Ng said DRYLMDH has has 6 isolation units and is capable of providing extension rooms.
“If ever there will be a spillover, we can possibly transfer all patients of Lambunao to other district hospitals. Lambunao will then be dedicated to PUIs only,” she said.
She added that the hospital personnel who will handle the patients will undergo training on self-protection.
But Dr. Cabangan-Ng said the province remains coronavirus-free.
Iloilo Governor Arthur Defensor Jr said the provincial government was also purchasing protective gears for hospital personnel, as well as, additional thermal scanners.
Defensor also appealed for donations of hospital equipment from the private sector. – Rappler.com "

FIGHT VS FAKE NEWS. The police joins the campaign against misinformation on the 2019 novel coronavirus. PNP file photo 
MANILA, Philippines – The Philippine National Police (PNP) is citing a repealed Marcos-era decree in its fight against fake news peddlers in the wake of misinformation and panic amid the global outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).
In a statement on Wednesday, February 5, the PNP announced that they would join the lookout for sources of false information. They cited two laws as basis:

Presidential Decree 90, which bans unlawful rumor-mongering and spreading false information;
Unlawful means of publication and utterances under Article 154 of the Revised Penal Code in relation to Republic Act 10175 or the Anti-Cybercrime Law

Rappler has sought comment on the possible oversight, but the PNP's spokesman has yet to reply as of posting.
The first problem: Presidential Decree 90 has been voided 34 years ago by former president Corazon Aquino after the ouster of the dictatorship of Ferdinand Marcos. “[I]nstead of promoting the said objective, the aforesaid issuances in effect paved the way for violations of the freedom of expression of the people,” Aquino said in Executive Order No. 65, which repealed the Marcos decree.
The second problem: It is unclear whether those who share fake news will be punished too. The Supreme Court has declared as unconstitutional the provision of the Cybercrime Law that punishes aiding and abetting crime, or in this context, sharing fake news.
Justice Secretary Menardo Guevarra did not directlty address questions about this, saying that law enforcers would first need to scout for a “malicious scheme” or “pattern” of the act. – with a report from Lian Buan/Rappler.com

FREEDOM OF SPEECH. Justice Secretary Menardo Guevarra defends his order of investigating 2019-nCoV fake news saying the freedom of speech has limitations. File photo by Angie de Silva/Rappler 
MANILA, Philippines – Justice Secretary Menardo Guevarra on Wednesday, February 5, defended his department order to investigate fake news on the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), saying there are ""limitations to the constitutional right"" to free speech. 
""I expect that freedom of speech issues will be raised, but as lawyers we all know that there are limitations to this constitutional right, including the greater interest of the public,"" Guevarra said in a message exchange with reporters on Wednesday.
Guevarra signed on Tuesday, February 4, Department Order No. 052 that tasked the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) to investigate and prosecute ""alleged deliberate spread of misinformation and fake news"" about the 2019-nCoV, even though there is no law in the Philippines that defines and punishes ""fake news.""
Pressed for a law that would cover this order, Guevarra said that if technology would be used, it would be ""appropriate charges under the Revised Penal Code in relation to the cybercrime prevention law.""
Cybercrime and warrantless arrest
The Supreme Court has declared as unconstitutional the provision of Republic Act No. 10175 or the Cybercrime Prevention Act that punishes aiding and abetting crime, or in this context, sharing fake news.
Guevarra did not categorically answer whether those who share fake news would be punished, saying the NBI ""will scope the field first and see if there's a malicious scheme or pattern somewhere.""
""No further comments for now,"" Guevarra said.
Guevarra was asked whether there is a possibility of a warrantless arrest because Rodel Jayme, the web administrator who was accused of uploading the Bikoy narcolist videos, was arrested without a warrant on the basis of a cybercrime investigation. 
The Department of Justice (DOJ) upheld the warrantless arrest, citing ""hot pursuit."" Jayme was eventually charged of inciting to sedition.
""It will all depend on the factual circumstances,"" said Guevarra.
Free speech
Law professor Ted Te said the department order ""directly contradicts freedom of expression,"" citing the decision of the High Court in Chavez vs Gonzales that declared as unconstitutional a government press release against the publication of the ""Hello, Garci"" tape.
That decision, as in other decisions on free speech, said government regulations that restrict free speech must have a compelling state interest. One of the tests to determine this is the presence of a clear and present danger to the public. 
Guevarra said the clear and present danger is ""causing undue panic and alarm in part, but also undermining government efforts for a unified and coordinated approach to a common threat that affects us all.""
Te said that the DOJ must give the NBI clear guidelines on what to define as fake news.
""The DOJ and the NBI have their own cybercrime experts. I suppose they’ll scope the field first and see if there’s a malicious scheme or pattern somewhere,"" said Guevarra.
Guevarra said ""Malacañang had nothing to do"" with the DOJ order. – Rappler.com "

CORONAVIRUS SCARE. Lawmakers want to augment the Department of Health's budget in 2020 to help buy face masks and protective equipment against the novel coronavirus. File photo by Ben Nabong/Rappler 
MANILA, Philippines – Two ranking lawmakers are now proposing to give at least a P2-billion supplemental budget to the Department of Health (DOH) to purchase surgical masks and personal protective equipment (PPE) amid the ongoing threat of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). 
On Tuesday, February 4, House committee on health chair Angelina Tan filed House Bill (HB) No. 6166 seeking P2.04 billion for the DOH, while House committee on ways and means chair Joey Salceda's HB No. 6177 pegged the amount at P2.24 billion. 
Salceda's HB No. 6177 explicitly said P2.04 billion would primarily be used to buy surgical masks and PPE for the following:

P945,000 for persons under investigation by the DOH
P9.45 million for health care workers
P2.025 billion for the PPE of health care workers
P4.522 million for 40 Filipinos to be repatriated from China

Another P20 million would be allotted for the hazard pay and benefits of epidemiologists on the frontlines of fighting the new disease.
Tan's HB No. 6166 was more general, as its Section 1 states the proposed supplemental budget would be for ""augmenting the budget for the health system response"" of the DOH. 
But in her media statement on Wednesday, February 5, Tan said the P2.04 billion is the ""estimated amount needed to buy additional surgical masks and personal protective equipment over the next 3 months.""
She previously sought just a P1-billion supplemental budget for the DOH to help fight the coronavirus threat.
HB No. 6166 would require the DOH to submit a report to the Senate committees on finance, and health and demography as well as the House committees on appropriations and health to give a detailed account of how the supplemental budget would be used.
But World Health Organization country representative to the Philippines Rabindra Abeyasinghe already said they are not recommending the use of surgical masks for the general public amid the 2019-nCoV scare.
He said it would be ""preferable"" if the masks were instead reserved for high-risk individuals and health workers. 
President Rodrigo Duterte also said the public ""hysteria"" over the new disease is ""not needed,"" though he also said the government is set to procure face masks for Filipinos amid the ongoing shortage in the market.
As of Wednesday afternoon, the Philippines has recorded one death due to 2019-nCoV, the first Chinese to die from the new disease outside of China.
This 44-year-old Chinese man is one of 3 confirmed coronavirus cases in the country along with a 38-year-old woman, with whom he traveled from Wuhan, and a 60-year-old woman, who also came from Wuhan.
The DOH is currently monitoring 133 patients for possible 2019-nCoV.
Globally, the coronavirus has already infected 23,939 people and killed 492.

CORONAVIRUS MONITORING. Background photo by Louie Lapat/Rappler 
KALIBO, Philippines – Around 350 Chinese tourists in Boracay Island are being monitored by a local task force of Malay, Aklan to control the spread of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). 
Deputy task force information manager Madel Joy Tayco said the Chinese nationals arrived in Boracay Island before the government issued a directive for the temporary banning of foreigners and Filipinos coming from China and its special administrative regions of Macau and Hong Kong.
The number of persons for monitoring in Boracay Island has dwindled from a high of 2,000 tourists after direct flights to and from mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau were cancelled. 
“The tourists with travel history to China were cleared by Bureau of Quarantine (BOQ) in local airports...it is now our task to monitor and manage them based on the guidelines of the World Health Organization and Department of Health until they leave Boracay Island,” said Tayco, also working as Nurse II of Municipal Health Office (MHO) of Malay, Aklan. 
Contrary to.media reports, the Chinese tourists are persons for monitoring and not persons under investigation (PUIs) with no flu-like symptoms associated with the Wuhan coronavirus. The disease, as of February 5, has killed at least 490 people.
Tayco clarified the Chinese nationals were closely monitored in their hotels in coordination with hotel nurses and medical team, and not isolated in the island by health authorities.
“The monitoring of these foreigners include the checking of body temperature and other symptoms like difficulty of breathing and cough, which are done twice a day. So far, wala naman silang signs or symptoms,” she stressed.
On January 28, MHO Malay also started an information education dissemination campaign with resorts, hotels, schools, and other establishments to prevent the possible transmission of virus.
“We aim to educate and inform the public in Malay, Aklan, especially Boracay Island about the novel coronavirus and how they could protect themselves,” Tayco added.
As this developed, Provincial Health Officer I Dr. Cornelio Cuachon, Jr. identified Gov. Corazon L. Cabagnot Tourism and Training Center in Old Buswang, Kalibo, Aklan as a temporary holding facility for inbound travelers from China, Macau, and Hong Kong to undergo a 14-day quarantine period.
The Aklan training center was recommended by BOQ and the provincial inter-agency task force. The facility earlier handled 11 Chinese nationals on January 25 to monitor their conditions.
They were spending their vacation in Boracay Island when the Provincial Health Office-Aklan was alerted by DOH after four of them had close contacts with a coronavirus patient in Hong Kong.
The foreigners - 7 adults and 4 children - returned home on January 31 to Chengdu, China via Kalibo International Airport.
As a precautionary measure, BOQ and DOH personnel also conducted mandatory thermal scans of domestic tourists coming from Cebu, Manila and Clark to Kalibo International Airport and Caticlan airport in Malay, Aklan.
Health declaration cards are also collected and checked by health authorities for every incoming travelers. (READ: Philippines confirms 3rd case of novel coronavirus)

""We deem it prudent to avoid situations where the health and safety of our cadets, PMA alumni, and their families are put at risk,"" said Lorenzana.
Magalong, who is a member of PMA Class of 1982 denied there was  lockdown.

MANILA, Philippines (6th UPDATE) – The Department of Health (DOH) on Wednesday, February 5, reported the Philippines’ 3rd confirmed case of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).
Health Undersecretary Eric Domingo said that a 60-year-old woman from Wuhan, China, tested postive for 2019-nCoV. She traveled from Wuhan through Hong Kong and arrived in Cebu on January 20, and headed directly  to Bohol.

Domingo said that on January 22, the woman consulted a private hospital after developing fever and colds, and was admitted to a  hospital in Bohol.
Several samples were taken from the woman on January 23 and January 24. The latter samples were sent to the Victorian Infectious Disease Reference Laboratory in Australia and the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM).
Domingo said that the Victorian Infectious Disease Reference Laboratory sent back the test results on the January 24 samples on January 29, and RITM on January 30 – both came out negative.
With her test result for 2019-nCoV negative, the woman was discharged from the hospital 9 days after admission and was allowed to travel back to China on January 31.
Domingo said that the RITM later ran tests on the first sample taken from the woman on January 23 after it became capable of testing samples for 2019-nCoV. 
Domingo said that on February 3, RITM notified the DOH that the January 23 samples tested positive for 2019-nCoV. This showed that the woman was able to mount immunity against the virus by the time the January 24 samples were taken. 
Asked why it took the DOH two days to report the third confirmed case, Domingo said: ""We found out evening of February 3, and yesterday we were at the Senate. As you well know, the secretary was there the whole day, so we couldn’t have a press conference yesterday."" 
He added that the the DOH's regional office in Central Visayas was immediately notified and that they were able to begin contact tracing on Tuesday, February 4.
""Before we announce it, we make sure the regional office and the local government units already know,"" Domingo said.
The first two 2019-nCoV cases in the country were a couple who traveled to the Philippines from Wuhan, China, the center of the outbreak. The man died on February 1, the first death due to the virus outside China.
133 cases probed
The DOH said it is now probing a total of 133 patients for 2019-nCoV. 
As of February 5, 115 patients are admitted to hospitals, while 16 were discharged but were being contacted by DOH surveillance officers daily for updates on their symptoms. Two patients under investigation have died, one of whom tested negative for the virus and died due to other complications.
The DOH added that 63 of the patients under investigation are Filipinos, 54 are Chinese, and 16 other foreign nationals. Of this number, 32 traveled from Wuhan, China, while others came from Hong Kong and other parts of China.
The DOH also confirmed that health workers are included in the 54 Filipino patients under investigation.

Drilon said the 43-year-old patient, who came from Taiwan, tested negative in the confirmatory test conducted by the RITM.
He said the patient was set to be discharged from the government hospital.
Drilon added that two more persons under investigation were still confined at the hospital's Emerging Infectious Disease Facility, awaiting for the laboratory results from RITM.
In a statement, AirAsia said it was working closely with the government, especially the DOH, after it was confirmed that the Philippines’ 3rd case of 2019-nCoV took an AirAsia flight from Cebu to Shenzhen, China, on January 31.
“AirAsia is ready and willing to provide relevant documents to the DOH, including the flight manifest and available contact details of guests on board the flight, given the urgency of this situation. The operating flight crew have also been quarantined in compliance with the Philippine government’s travel ban,” it said.
“All AirAsia aircraft undergo disinfection procedures according to prescribed protocol,” the airline added.

MISPLACED PRIORITIES? DOH Secretary Francisco Duque lll skipped the House hearing on the novel coronavirus on February 5, 2020 to inspect a quarantine facility in Nueva Ecija. File photo by Darren Langit/Rappler 
MANILA, Philippines – Visibly upset legislators told Health Secretary Francisco Duque III he needs to get his priorities in order after he failed to attend a House hearing on Metro Manila’s response to the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). 
On Wednesday, February 5, Muntinlupa Representative Ruffy Biazon called out Duque for begging off from attending the House committee on Metro Manila development’s hearing to inspect a quarantine facility in Fort Magsaysay in Nueva Ecija.
Duque went to Fort Magsaysay on orders of President Rodrigo Duterte. The facility in the military reserve will serve as a quarantine area for Filipinos set to be repatriated from China on Saturday, February 8.
""Pakiparating po kay Secretary Duque: Ayusin ho niya ang kanyang priorities (Please tell this to Secretary Duque: He should get his priorities straight),"" Biazon told heads of various DOH bureaus present during the hearing. 
“So I guess this shows the type of priorities that the Secretary has. As the overall in-charge of handling this crisis, I believe he should have been there. Hindi ‘yong pag-iinspekto na lang ng mga kuwarto (He should not just spend time inspecting rooms). So to the DOH, we appreciate your presence but I am very sure there will be questions here that you wouldn’t be able to answer,” he added.
A few minutes later, Biazon recalled the Senate hearing on Tuesday, February 4, which revealed an apparent lack of communication between the DOH, and the Civil Aeronautics Board and the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines on contact tracing for possible 2019-nCoV cases.  
Duque had even threatened to fire “incompetent” officials from the DOH’s Epidemiology Bureau. But for Biazon, no one is to be blamed but the health secretary himself. 
The Muntinlupa congressman cited Republic Act No. 11332 or the “Mandatory Reporting of Notifiable Diseases and Health Events of Public Health Concerns Act,” which gives the DOH chief the power to “declare epidemics of national and/or international concerns except when the same threatens national security.” 
“Itong krisis na hinaharap natin sa kalusugan ng mga Pilipino, siya ang incident commander. Sa kanya manggagaling ang kautusan. Lahat ng ahensiya – DFA (Department of Foreign Affairs) and others – mapapasailalim sa kanya. Kaya ito ho tayo nababahala kung ano ba ang priorities dito sa pag-attend sa problemang ito,” Biazon said. 
(He is the incident commander of this crisis involving the health of Filipinos. The orders should be coming from him. All agencies – including the DFA and others – would fall under him. That's why we are concerned over his priorities in attending to this problem.)
Manila 1st District Representative Manuel Lopez, House committee on Metro Manila development chair, agreed with Biazon. 
“We would not like to lambast the Secretary...pero ang nais lang po namin ipaalam sa kanya [ay] baka nakakalimutan niya ang paalala namin kung anu-ano po ang kapangyarihan na binigay po sa kanya ng Republika ng Pilipinas (But we want to remind him that he may be forgetting the powers given to him under the Republic of the Philippines),” Lopez said.
Duque had already appeared before the House during the question hour in the plenary session on January 29. But only a few lawmakers lined up to interpellate the DOH chief, excluding Biazon and Lopez. 
As of 9 pm on Tuesday, the Philippines recorded one death due to the 2019-nCoV, the first to die from the disease outside of China. 
This 44-year-old Chinese man is one of two confirmed coronavirus cases in the country along with a 38-year-old woman, with whom he traveled from Wuhan via Hong Kong, to the Philippines.
The DOH is currently monitoring 105 patients for possible 2019-nCoV. Of this number, 91 were still in hospitals while 12 had been discharged.
Globally, the coronavirus has already infected 23,939 people and killed 492, as of Wednesday morning.

This means that if you bought stocks at the start of 2020, priced at almost 7,800 each, you have lost over 8% of your investments.

While the stock market is not totally indicative of the economy’s health, it does tell quite a lot about business sentiment. So far, it seems that sentiment does not go with some of the numbers.
Analysts and even the government’s economic team have all been somewhat unanimous in saying that while the impact of the novel coronavirus is hard to price in, the economy, so far, can take the hit.
The Philippines is also a domestic consumption-driven economy, which means that the economy is not very reliant on trade to grow. Trade-driven economies like China have taken a direct hit on both the lingering trade war and the spread of the coronavirus.
So why are investors still fleeing the Philippines?
It seems that more than the virus, businesses are getting more worried over the political climate under the Duterte administration.
“Investors are definitely worried and they are waiting for decisive action from the government to contain the virus. But remember this is not the only thing that investors are worried about, there's lots of domestic developments too,” said Jun Calaycay, chief of research of Philstocks.
With no clear gameplan and a credible, assuring tone in containing the virus, the business community is more jittery.
Business as usual?
Strictly looking at the numbers and somewhat excluding all other factors, the Philippine economy is perceived to be surviving the novel coronavirus.
All the market experts and economists whom Rappler was able to interview agree that the economic impact is ""minimal,"" provided that the situation does not escalate further.
Carlo Asuncion, Unionbank's chief economist, said that the tourism and trade sectors will be the most affected.
""In 2010, the PSA [Philippine Statistics Authority] put the average foreign tourist spend at $84/day, and last year, tourists visiting from China were approximately about 1.5 million. Thus, the Philippines may stand to lose a minimum of $126 million worth of foreign tourist spending this 2020 as the coronavirus scare continues to sow fear in the short-term,"" Asuncion said.

""People-movement-related businesses may also lose in the short-term as people tend to stay rather than roam around risking unnecessary exposure to the largely unknown disease.""
If the novel coronavirus delivers a “severe, but temporary impact” or an outbreak lasts 6 months, Unionbank’s economic research unit expects Philippine full-year economic growth to decline at least 0.3% to at most 0.8% in 2020. 
Calaycay added that while the overall economy remains robust, he warned that flight restrictions and cancellations have a ""spillover effect."" 
""It does not end in flights and tourism. There are jobs not necessarily related to these sectors but are dependent or somewhat connected to them, so we need to watch out for that as well,"" Calaycay said.

Meanwhile, ING Bank Manila chief economist Nicholas Mapa noted that the warm ties between the Philippines and China mean that Duterte also inherits Beijing's problems.
""When China sneezes, the Philippines catches a cold and picks up a cough given recent developments in economic ties,"" Mapa said.
China is currently the Philippines' top trading partner. Exports to China from January to November 2019 improved 6.3% to $8.8 billion, from $8.3 billion during the same period in 2018, according to PSA. Over 56% comprised electronic parts.
Mapa estimated losses to hit as high as $600 million due to the slowdown in tourist arrivals, effectively hitting overall consumption from retail sales, restaurants to hotels. (READ: Duterte expands ban on travelers from China, Hong Kong, Macau over coronavirus fears)
""Another possible hit would be the restricted movement of Chinese to and from the mainland, with POGO [Philippine offshore gambling operators] workers not able to return or incomes curtailed by the slowdown in business,"" Mapa said.
Meanwhile, Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation economist Michael Ricafort noted that consumers can expect lower oil prices due to the coronavirus outbreak.
He noted that global crude oil prices have already declined to a new 3-month low, which is already lower compared to the levels during the US-Iran tensions in early January 2020. The decline is due to the anticipation for lower global oil demand for oil especially in China, which is the world’s biggest oil importer.
While economists have estimated the impact to be minimal so far, the novel coronavirus scare is fueling the business community's jitters.
""For as long as uncertainty hangs over the Philippines, we can expect anxiety to weigh on the economy the same way a cold or cough curtails all of us. For the most part, we can still operate as business as usual, albeit stopping from time to time to wipe our noses or cough into a tissue,"" Mapa said.
Uncertainty
The presence of the novel coronavirus in the Philippines comes at a time where Duterte has weaponized contract reviews, seen by some as a move to favor allied businessmen. 
The elite, not used to attacks by a strongman, were quite unsure about how to handle such a scenario they never saw coming.
Duterte's rants against Ayala-led Manila Water and Manny V. Pangilinan's Maynilad has sent stock prices so low, the market has not seen such prices in over a decade.
Earlier this week, investors were somewhat given a boost when Enrique Razon, a perceived ally of Duterte, took a slice or 25% of Ayala's Manila Water. After the announcement, euphoric investors pushed stock prices back in the green.
""Yes, it somewhat calmed down the market. But it is still bad for the business environment overall. Does this mean that the whole contract review is all over? It does not feel right,"" said an analyst who requested anonymity.
The business community is also awaiting the fate of the Lopez's ABS-CBN, as well as keeping a close eye on the economic impact of Taal Volcano, and the reported cases of African swine fever outside Luzon.
Prior to these negative developments, the Duterte administration has already started to show signs of having difficulty attracting investors.
Foreign direct investments (FDIs) fom January to September 2019 posted $5.1 billion only, down nearly 37% compared to the $8.1 billion recorded in the same period in 2018. This brings the net FDI inflows for the 9-month period to only $5.12 billion down by nearly 37% compared to the $8.11 billion recorded in the same period in 2019. (READ: [OPINION | Point of Law] Challenges in business that cannot scare us)
Hot money or portfolio investments also showed weakness, as it saw a net outflow of $1.9 billion last year, according to the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas. This is a turnaround from the inflows of $1.2 billion in 2018. The BSP projected portfolio investments to register inflows worth $8 billion last year.
How soon can we see the impact of all these uncertainties? 
University of Asia and the Pacific economist Victor Abola said in a recent press briefing that in general, there is a ""lag"" before the real impact of uncertainties can be felt.
""Real effect can be felt after a year or so. For the current year, plans are there already and people will not stop executing plans because of certain negative actions,"" Abola said.
After missing its growth targets and struggling to attract more investors, the government now has the additional task of stemming the domino effect that the new virus has triggered. – Rappler.com "

CEBU CITY, Philippines – Cebu Governor Gwendolyn Garcia signed an executive order Tuesday, February 4, placing this province under a state of preparedness because of the threat of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) and designating 4 public facilities to be used as quarantine areas.
As part of this levelled up preparation the provincial government has identified the Eversly Child Sanitarium in Consolacion, Cebu, as the primary public facility where all Filipinos coming from  mainland China and the special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau will be committed to undergo a mandatory 14-day quarantine.
Aside from Eversly, the other quarantine facilities tapped by the provincial government are the Mandaue General Hospital, the New Life Facility in Pinamungajan town, and the Women and Children Development Center in Lahug, Cebu CIty.   All in all, the 3 facilities could handle up to 250 people.
 These facilities were set up when Cebu was planning to quarantine all passengers coming in from mainland China, even before President Rodrigo Duterte ordered a travel ban last week.
Also an author of Garcia's resolution was 4th District Provincial Board Member Kerrie Shimura, the Chairperson of the Committee on Health and Social Services.
“There is a clear and present danger of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus entering Cebu that warrants an immediate need for the implementation of measures to prevent its entry while establishing protocols for the quarantine of infected individuals in case entry;” the resolution read. The declaration empowered local government Disaster Risk Reduction Management offices to take actions to minimize the adverse effects of a recognized danger.  
At least 4 of the 31 patients under investigation by the Department of Health for the coronavirus are from the Central Visayas.   
The Cebu provincial government is also preparing protocols for home quarantine for arriving Filipinos.    The process for home quarantine was still being discussed with the local government units and Philippine National Police. 
""We have not established the protocols on homestay, we will have to bring them directly straight to the Eversely facility,"" Garcia said.
""Right now, we need to know where are their homes… we need to identify what times these are so that the mayors themselves will also be on board including the barangay kapitan,"" she added.The first death due to the coronavirus outside of China happened in the Philippines. The tourist came from Wuhan City to the Philippines via Dumaguete and Cebu. The Epidemiology Bureau of the DOH has found a total of 74 contacts the couple interacted with in Cebu and Dumaguete As of Tuesday, February 4, the DOH was looking into 80 people for 2019-nCoV. This includes 2 confirmed cases and 68 others who were still confined in hospitals, while 10 who have been discharged but are still being monitored. Of these, 48 samples are awaiting confirmation for the 2019-nCoV, while 30 have tested negative.– Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – Scientists at the National Institutes of Health of the University of the Philippines (UP) Manila said they have developed a test kit that would help the Department of Health (DOH) confirm more cases of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in the country.
The test kit will be released next week for evaluation of the DOH, said scientist Raul Destura during a Senate hearing assessing the government's response to 2019-nCoV on Tuesday, February 4.
""Hopefully by next week, it will be ready for the DOH to verify and validate before they give their recommendation for use in the country,"" Destura said.
He added that UP scientists developed the test kit after Chinese scientists released the whole genome sequence of the virus to the public.
The test kit would allow the DOH to more rapidly detect the presence of 2019-nCoV in samples taken from patients ""under investigation"" or observation, which are now at 105.
Currently, the DOH is using the primer it had acquired from Japan, which allows its research arm, the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine, to determine ""within 48 hours"" whether samples are positive for 2019-nCoV.
""[What we're using is] like a code that more or less it will guide us to identify [the virus]. This is exactly the virus that's similar to the one in Wuhan,"" Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said.
But the primer is not yet commercially available, making it difficult for the DOH to acquire it in big batches.
World Health Organization country representative to the Philippines Rabindra Abeyasinghe said several research groups around the world are still racing to develop rapid test kits for the virus.
""Test kits will not be completed for about another week to 10 days, after which we have agreed that we will provide the test kits to the Philippines and other member states that are at risk,"" he said.
Senators on Tuesday criticized the DOH for apparent lapses in leadership especially in its protocols for contact tracing. In about a week, the health department has only traced 17% or around 50 of the 331 people who came into contact with the Philippines' two confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV.
Duque blamed the lapses on incompetent individuals in the DOH's Epidemiology Bureau. He also promised ""aggressive contact tracing"" which would involve police.
As of Tuesday, the virus has infected more than 20,000 and killed over 400, nearly all in China. (READ: World currently 'not in a pandemic' of China virus – WHO) – Rappler.com

NEGROS ORIENTAL, Philippines – Negros Oriental Governor Roel Degamo issued an executive order (EO) suspending classes in all levels in public schools from Wednesday, February 5, to Friday, February 7.
This is part of the precautionary measures of the provincial government to contain and mitigate the spread of the deadly novel coronavirus, the governor said in his EO issued Tuesday, February 4.
The governor also said that private schools may suspend their classes in their respective schools at their own discretion. 
Silliman University in Dumaguete City had earlier announced that its classes from preschool to senior high school will be conducted online starting February 5.
Five individuals in this province who came in contact with the two confirmed cases of novel coronavirus in the Philippines were placed under quarantine at a hospital after they exhibited flu-like symptoms.
Another 25 persons were also being monitored after they came in contact with the two confirmed patients, a Chinese couple. They were also required to be quarantined for 14 days.
The driver of the tricycle hired by the Chinese couple is now being assessed by health authorities in Negros Oriental, Provincial Information Officer Bimbo Miraflor said.
He ferried the couple to a resort in Dauin town.
He was also advised to place himself in quarantine and avoid close contact with family members, neighbors, and friends.
He will also receive financial assistance worth P5,000 from the provincial government, according to Miraflor. 
The Philippines' health department confirmed the second case of the novel coronavirus in the Philippines on Sunday, February 2. Both confirmed cases traveled to the Philippines from Wuhan, China.
The second patient died on Saturday, February 1 – the first death recorded outside China. 
The novel coronavirus that originated from Wuhan, China, has so far killed 426 and sickened over 20,000 people across the country and worldwide. The World Health Organization already declared an international emergency over the virus. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – The Department of Health (DOH) is now probing 105 persons for the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) as of noon on Tuesday, February 4. 
This is up from the 80 initially reported by the DOH at the Senate hearing on the government’s response to 2019-nCoV earlier on the same day. 
Most of the patients under investigation are being observed in Metro Manila, where 36 patients are being probed. This includes the Chinese couple from Wuhan, China, who were the first two confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV in the Philippines. One of them eventually died due to severe pneumonia resulting from the virus, which has killed over 400 people and infected over 20,000 people in 25 countries, mostly in China.

Here is the breakdown of cases per region:

Calabarzon - 4
Mimaropa - 4
Western Visayas - 10
Central Visayas - 16
Eastern Visayas - 3
Northern Mindanao - 5
Davao region - 6

Of the 105, 91 are currently admitted to hospitals while 12 have been discharged but are under strict monitoring. Strict monitoring means that the the DOH’s epidemiology bureau checks up on them daily for symptoms.  
Health Secretary Francisco Duque III also told reporters after the Senate hearing on Tuesday that the DOH is verifying a third possible case of 2019-nCoV, but said more details would be revealed on Wednesday, February 5.  
The increase in cases being probed comes as the criteria for probing expanded to persons coming not just from Hubei province but also from all of mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau. 
Duque also said the increase was “due to the strengthened surveillance system and contact tracing of the Epidemiology Bureau,"" but the Tuesday Senate hearing revealed lapses in the DOH’s protocols, particularly in contact tracing. 
The health chief said that that he would hold officials in the DOH’s epidemiology bureau accountable for their incompetence in dealing with the urgent health crisis. – Rappler.com  "

MANILA, Philippines – Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said “heads will roll” in the health department’s Epidemiology Bureau as a Senate hearing revealed gaps in its work identifying people who possibly came in contact with patients who tested positive for the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). 
Speaking to reporters after the Senate hearing on the 2019-nCoV on Tuesday, February 4, Duque dodged criticisms of his “failure of leadership” and said that the problem was “within some of the operating units of the Department of Health (DOH).” 
The epidemiology bureau of the DOH monitors the spread of infectious diseases, the latest of which is the emerging 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease. The bureau is also supposed to take the lead in contact tracing, or tracking down people who have interacted with those positive for the virus. This included co-passengers on the flights they were on, as well as personnel in establishments and hotels they went to.  
“I've always assumed that they already have the competence, that they already know what they're doing, and that they are familiar with the protocols,” he said, adding that it is not his job to “get into operational details.”
“The secretary of health orchestrates everyone. When you orchestrate an ensemble, I am not going to get somebody to teach him to play the violin, I already expect him to know how to play the violin as the orchestrator. It is not a failure of leadership. It is probably a question of incompetence on the part of some of those who form part of the orchestra,” Duque added.
Senators took turns grilling Duque on the issue of contact tracing, which is crucial in quelling the spread of the virus, which has killed over 400 people and infected over 20,000 people in 25 countries, mostly in China. 
The lawmakers pointed out the apparent lack of communication between the DOH and the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) and the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP).   It was revealed in the hearing that the government has reached out to only 17% or around 50 of the 331 passengers who may have come in contact with the country's first two confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV.
Duque said that Cebu Pacific and Philippine Airlines, whose flights the carried the two confirmed cases, provided the DOH redacted flight manifestos, withholding the passengers' contact information. But airlines invoked the Data Privacy Act. 
But CAB and CAAP said it was unlikely that airlines would do this given the circumstances.
“We need to assess (the epidemiology bureau) for their competencies for that particular job. We will have to assess them right now. We will convene the epidemiology bureau to really find out,” Duque said. 
Duque also said “aggressive contact tracing” would begin Wednesday, February 5. Upon the recommendation of Senator Ronald dela Rosa,  the police would now be involved  in the process of finding people who were possibly infected. “We need to talk to PNP to tell us exactly the cooperation that is needed, the coordination that is needed on the ground level when the contact tracing ought to be done,” Duque said. 
As of Tuesday, February 4, the DOH was probing 80 people for 2019-nCoV. This figure included the 2 confirmed cases, 68 others who were still in hospitals, and 10 who have been discharged but are under monitoring. Of these, 48 samples are awaiting confirmation for the 2019-nCoV while 30 have tested negative. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – Justice Secretary Menardo Guevarra on Tuesday, February 4, ordered the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) to go after peddlers of fake news involving the 2019 novel coronavirus or the 2019-nCoV.
""The NBI, through Director Dante A. Gierran, is hereby directed and granted authority to conduct an investigation and case build-up on the alleged deliberate spread of misinformation and fake news about the 2019-nCov ARD and false reporting of 2019-nCov ARD (Acute Respiratory Disease) cases and, if evidence warrants, to file the appropriate charges against persons found responsible thereof,"" Guevarra said in Department Order No. 052 signed on Tuesday.
But what law covers fake news, if there is no law that defines and punishes it?
As of posting, Department of Justice (DOJ) Spokesperson Undersecretary Markk Perete was unable to name a specific law that can potentially cover fake news in the context of the 2019-nCov. 
""We cannot, at this point, speculate on the charge/s as these will depend on the evidence gathered during the investigation process,"" said Perete.
""Laws exist to ensure, among others, public order and safety. Upholding such laws becomes even more important when circumstances that agitate the public emerge,"" Perete added.
The anti-fake news bill, introduced by Senate President Vicente ""Tito"" Sotto III, will empower the DOJ to take down websites it deems to contain fake news. The Human Rights Watch has slammed this bill for infringing on the right to free speech.
Sotto himself peddled fake news on Tuesday when he showed at a Senate hearing a video of 2019-nCov conspiracy theories, which Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr dismissed as the ""craziest video.""
Will Sotto be investigated too?
""All leads will have to be considered, including those presented at the Senate,"" Perete said.
Free speech
The Legazpi City police filed on Tuesday a complaint for alarm and scandal against a vlogger who pulled a prank by laying down and acting sick in front of Yashano Mall in the city's port district on Sunday afternoon.
Will the right to free speech protect people in this case?
""Persons who unnecessarily aggravate such agitation through actions violative of our laws cannot be allowed to unjustly claim protection under the basic guarantees of our Constitution. To hold otherwise will invite chaos and disorder,"" said Perete.
Law professor Ted Te, however, said Guevarra's department order ""directly contradicts freedom of expression.""
Te cited the 2008 Supreme Court case Chavez vs Gonzales which declared as unconstitutional the press release of the National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) warning against the publication of the ""Hello Garci"" recording. The Supreme Court said the press release constituted prior restraint.
""Alarms and scandals is a felony; the Department Order deals specifically with 'fake news' and makes it a basis for case build-up, possible arrest and prosecution. This directly contradicts freedom of expression,"" Te said.
Perete denied that the department order restrains free speech, saying it does not restrict action.
""It merely directs the NBI to investigate certain acts already committed, and if warranted, to file the appropriate complaint before the proper body,"" said Perete.
Can the Cybercrime Law kick in for ""fake news"" posted online?
""While Cybercrime Law specifically mentions 'content-based restrictions' it does not specifically refer to spreading 'fake news,'"" said Te. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – As the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak continued to stir public concern, Senate President Vicente Sotto III showed a conspiracy theory video that  claimed the coronavirus to be a form of ""biowarfare"" developed by the United States against China.
Sotto used his question time at a Senate hearing into the Philippine government's measures against the novel coronavirus to play the video that he said his office had received, saying it was among his and other senators' ""concern.""
""Mr Chair, I will not ask any questions. Instead I would like to focus on the concern, of my concern and some other members of the Senate and of course our people – of the unknown origin [of the novel coronavirus] as quoted by the WHO. Meron tayong kasabihan eh (We have a saying). If you want to defeat an enemy, know the enemy. Ano ba itong virus na ito (What is this virus all about)?"" Sotto said on Tuesday, February 4.

Before playing the video, Sotto called the report ""somehow very interesting, if not revealing"" as he called on those present to pay close attention to it.
The video, which cited no official information or sources and was already debunked by experts, suggested Western countries ""developed"" the coronavirus as biowarfare against China in an effort to stop its rise as a global power. The theory has been debunked by experts.
'Craziest video.' After playing portions of the video, Sotto then asked Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr for his comments on the video. Sotto did not ask for the opinions of health officials such as Health Secretary Francisco Duque III or WHO country representative Rabindra Abeyasinghe who were at the hearing.
Locsin said it was an example of the ""craziest video"" he has ever seen and proceeded to debunk its contents and said it was illogical for the coronavirus to be created as a biowarfare weapon.
The DFA chief pointed out information presented in the video clashed with other supposed reports it showed, saying, ""In this video, there are the suspects: China inflicting it on itself – 99% of infections are all Chinese so why would they do that?""  
Locsin added, ""Again, [the claim is] this is a plan of the US and the West to destroy China by first destroying itself. This is really clever, so I don't know if you can believe this.""
Responding to this, Sotto said though he and others in the Senate were ""not prepared to take the content of the video hook line and sinker,"" and it was ""best"" officials were ""aware"" of what is being spread about the virus.
Dangerous fake news.  At the start of hearing, Senator Christopher ""Bong"" Go, chairman of the Senate committee on health and demography, cautioned the public against spreading fake news during the outbreak, saying fake news peddlers should be ""quarantined."" 
""'Yung mga panay dada naman diyan para makapagsalita, mga bashers sumasakay sa sitwasyon para sa pansariling interes, mga tao gusto lang magdulot ng panic ang mga nagpapakalat ng fake news, kayo ang dapat maquarantine para di makahawa,"" said Go.
(Those who want to just say something, bashers who are riding on the situation for their own self-interest, people who want to cause panic and spread fake news, you should be the ones quarantined.)
With the outbreak of the coronavirus, false news and misinformation have mushroomed online, prompting medical experts to warn that these were not only false but dangerous.
""Fake news in a health setting is dangerous. Fake news in an emergency public health situation is deadly so it's very, very important we only consume verified sources of news,"" said infectious disease expert Dr Edsel Salvana in an interview with ABS-CBN News. (LIST: Where to get official, reliable info on novel coronavirus)
In fact, the World Health Organization and medical experts previously explained what they know so far about the 2019 novel coronavirus: that it is from a family of coronaviruses that can cause illnesses ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome. (READ: FAQs: Ano-ano ang alam natin tungkol sa 2019 novel coronavirus?)
The new coronavirus was also believed to have originated in a market in Wuhan City, China, where wildlife was sold and sanitary conditions subpar.
In defense of China. While talking about the video showed by Sotto, Locsin praised and defended China's handling of the coronavirus outbreak even as China's top leadership itself had admitted ""shortcomings and difficulties"" in government response and handling of the outbreak.
Locsin believed China's handling of the coronavirus outbreak further cemented the country as a global power for effectively handling the disease.
""This disease is only proving the resilience and strength of China. In 10 days they have built a massive containment facility. That only shows that...this challenge will not weaken China but will strengthen it in the eyes of the world as a power that just cannot be defeated even by nature,"" he said.

In a phone interview with Rappler, Legazpi City acting police chief Lieutenant Colonel Aldwin Gamboa confirmed that they had filed a case on Tuesday afternoon accusing the man of violating Article 155 of the Revised Penal Code, which bans inappropriately causing alarm and scandal.
Gamboa said the man apparently laid down and acted sick in front of Yashano Mall in the city's port district on Sunday afternoon, but ended up causing unnecessary panic.
There's no arrest yet: Gamboa clarified that the man who pulled the apparent prank has not been arrested as they have not secured an arrest warrant.
If the case prospers, the man could be imprisoned from 1 to 30 days, or could be fined at most P200.

,"February 04, 2020",nCov,Senate hearing bares gaps in PH contact tracing for novel coronavirus,Janella Paris,"
HEALTH CHIEF. Health Secretary Francisco Duque III attends the Senate hearing on the Philippines' preparedness on the 2019 novel coronavirus on February 4, 2020. 
MANILA, Philippines – The Department of Health (DOH) has only contacted 17% or around 50 of the 331 passengers who may have come in contact with the country's first two confirmed cases of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), revealing gaps in the government’s protocol for tracking down potentially infected persons. 
Health Secretary Francisco Duque III made the statement in a Senate hearing on Tuesday, February 4, after Senator Nancy Binay asked for a  progress report on DOH efforts to track down passengers on the same flights as the couple from Wuhan, China, one of whom became the first person to die of the virus outside China.  (READ: TIMELINE: The novel coronavirus epidemic)
“I’ll be the first one to admit, it’s not easy to do this,” Duque said, referring to contact tracing, during the Senate hearing on the Philippine government's preparedness against the 2019-nCoV attended by a number of Cabinet officials led by Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea.
The Philippines' 2019 nCoV cases – a 38-year-old woman and 44-year-old man – traveled from Wuhan via Hong Kong, and from there took a Cebu Pacific flight to Cebu, then later another Cebu Pacific flight to Dumaguete.  Days later, they a took Philippine Airlines flight to Manila. They were both admitted to the San Lazaro Hospital in Manila upon arrival but the man died nearly a week later, on February 1.
Senators took turns grilling government officials on the issue of contact tracing, which is crucial in stemming the spread of the dread virus, which has killed over 400 people and infected over 20,000 people in 25 countries, mostly in China.
Senators noted the apparent lack of communication between the DOH and the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) and the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP) regarding contact tracing.
“Nakakalungkot na parang hindi kayo nag-uusap (It's disappointing to see that it seems you haven’t been speaking to each other). Secretary Duque, you could have coordinated with CAAP and CAB if you are having these difficulties,” said Binay.
Though Cebu Pacific and Philippine Airlines had both released statements about cooperating with the health department’s Bureau of Quarantine (BOQ) and providing the necessary flight manifest data, Duque said airlines had shared flight manifests but had “not been sharing contact details of passengers and invoking confidentiality.”
“They are invoking Data Privacy. This is rather strange, in this urgent situation, I do not understand why this is the case. But I think this has to be investigated,” Duque said.  
But CAB Executive Director Carmelo Arcilla said airlines would readily give such information under current circumstances. “In my experience, the experience of our office, they would be willing to share it, especially during an event like this,” he said. 
CAAP General Manager Eddie Monreal said, “People, as long as you tell them the flight number, I’m sure, if they were on board, they would also volunteer themselves, so I don’t see a reason why the airlines would withhold the names.” 
Monreal added that only the passengers who occupied the 4 seats in front, 4 seats behind, 4 seats to the left, and 4 seats to the right of infected people – not all plane passengers – have to be contacted, as planes have hospital-grade HEPA filters, which clear the air of airborne particles and viruses.  
But Duque also admitted that there might be a “lack of transparency on the part of some (DOH) people.” Visibly flustered, Duque said, “In all of our meetings, there have been no indications raised to me that this has been a problem.” 
Senator Francis Pangilinan said of the apparent lapse, ""When only 17% of those passengers have been contacted since this issue erupted, I don’t think it’s only a failure of communication, I think it is also a failure of leadership on the part of the health department.""
The DOH had said since the confirmation of the first 2019-nCoV case in the Philippines on January 30 that it was on top of identifying people the patient interacted with, as well as the establishments that she went to and employees she had been in contact with. So far, it has established 8 of these people as persons under investigation, meaning they showed symptoms of respiratory illness. 
As of Tuesday, February 4, the DOH was probing 80 people for 2019-nCoV. This figure includes the 2 confirmed cases, 68 others who were still in hospitals, and 10 who have been discharged but are under monitoring. Of these, 48 samples are awaiting confirmation for the 2019-nCoV while 30 have tested negative. – Rappler.com  "

MANILA, Philippines – The Senate committees on health and demography and finance on Tuesday, February 4, hold a hearing to discuss the government’s preparedness to respond to the 2019 novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV threat, which has been declared a public health emergency of international concern by the World Health Organization.
The Philippines has so far confirmed 2 cases of 2019-nCoV, one of whom died due to pneumonia as a result of being infected by the virus. Currently, the Department of Health (DOH) is investigating 78 other patients who have shown symptoms of respiratory illness and have had history of travel to Wuhan, China, the outbreak’s epicenter.
The government has also imposed a temporary travel ban to and from mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau. The government is also seeking to repatriate the over 300 Filipinos in Hubei province, where Wuhan is. Have these measures been enough? – Rappler.com

AKLAN, Philippines – The impact of the coronavirus outbreak on Boracay's tourism industry could be worse than the Boracay closure.
Peter Tay, liaison officer to Boracay for the Chinese Embassy in the Philippines, expressed fears that travel restrictions could further hurt tourism businesseses and tourist spending. 
 
""It is going [from] bad to worse. When the Boracay closure happened, you could look forward [to the] October 26 re-opening. Itong situation ngayon, hindi natin alam when it will end, (We don't know when this current situation will end),"" Tay said on a Radyo Todo Aklan interview on Monday, February 3. 
On Sunday, February 2, President Rodrigo Duterte restricted the inbound travel of foreigners from China and its special administrative regions to the Philippines, and required Filipinos and those holding permanent resident visas to undergo a 14-day quarantine. (READ: China coronavirus death toll rises to 425 – gov't)
The directive, however, didn't mention how long the temporary ban would last. 
Carriers including Philippine Airlines, Cebu Pacific, Xiamen Air, China Eastern Air, OK Air, and Air Asia have suspended or canceled flights to and from China, Macau, and Hong Kong. (READ: Traveling amid coronavirus outbreak? Here's what you need to know)
Almost 60% of island hopping and water sports activities, as well as majority of vendors, tattoo artists, and beach masseuses will be affected by the temporary ban. Chinese restaurants owners have decided to close shop, while hotels across the island have recorded cancelations. 
The island – which saw 434,175 Chinese tourists, or 50% of its 865,419 foreign visitors, last year – is usually packed with travelers during the peak season of January to May. 
“We were caught by surprise, but we have to accept that this is actually happening. No hard feelings. I am more concerned [for] the livelihood  of the local workers affected by the situation,"" Tay added. 
As a precaution, Tay also encouraged hotel workers to visit hospitals or medical care facilities if they experience coughing and difficulty in breathing.
Meanwhile, acting Malay town mayor Frolibar Bautista said he will no longer declare a temporary ban on tourists from China and its special administrative regions in the area since President Duterte already issued a directive. 
Boracay hasn't come to complete standstill, however, as the island continues to accommodate Koreans, Taiwanese, and tourists from long-haul destinations.

HEALTH PRECAUTIONS. Metro Manila commuters wear face masks as protection from the novel coronavirus on February 3, 2020. Photo by Jire Carreon/Rappler  
MANILA, Philippines – President Rodrigo Duterte on Monday, February 3, said the government would procure face masks for Filipinos as stockpiles of surgical face masks were depleted amid fears over the spread of the 2019 novel coronavirus.
Duterte made the announcement after holding a meeting with Cabinet members regarding the Philippine government's response to the novel coronavirus outbreak.
""Is government doing something to buy more, to protect more? Yes we are doing it (procuring masks). We are not just sitting down here. We have resources coming,"" Duterte told reporters in a press briefing in Malacañang on Monday night.
Panic buying. After the Department of Health confirmed the first case of coronavirus in the Philippines on January 30, Filipinos raced to drugstores to purchase face masks out of fear of contracting the virus.
In areas such as Cebu City, suppliers were forced to ration masks while pharmacies implemented a ""one box per person"" policy to prevent hoarding. In Metro Manila, individuals likewise emptied pharmacies' and medical supply stores' shelves of masks, prompting the police to deploy personnel to manage crowds.
This came despite the World Health Organization saying that masks are not needed by healthy people with no respiratory symptoms.
Downplaying outbreak. Meanwhile, Duterte downplayed the spread of the novel coronavirus to the country, saying the public's ""hysteria"" over the virus was unwarranted.
""This coronavirus is scaring people all over. The response of the people from the initial reports of the coronavirus was almost hysterical when there was really no need for it, actually,"" Duterte said.
""Why do you have to be hysterical? Why don't you just go to the hospital and have yourself treated?"" he added.
So far, the Department of Health has confirmed two cases of the novel coronavirus in the Philippines. On Monday, health officials said they were also monitoring 80 persons under investigation for the virus.
The Philippines recorded the first death due to the novel coronavirus outside China in a 44-year-old Chinese man who traveled to the Philippines from Wuhan. The man was the country's second confirmed case of the novel coronavirus, and a companion of the first patient, a 38-year-old Chinese woman.
As of Monday, the virus has killed 362 people and infected over 17,000 people worldwide. – Rappler.com

CORONAVIRUS RESTRICTIONS. President Rodrigo Duterte reiterates travel restrictions against non-Filipinos coming to the country directly from China, Hong Kong, and Macau as the novel coronavirus spreads. Malacañang photo 
MANILA, Philippines – President Rodrigo Duterte on Monday, February 3, rejected calls for the Philippine government to bar all Chinese from entering the country as he hit the display of xenophobia against Chinese amid the global spread of the 2019 novel coronavirus.
Duterte made the statement Monday night, addressing calls online that supposedly urged the Philippine government to bar all Chinese from entering and send those in the country back to China.
""If the question is if I will bar Chinese from entering, the answer of course is no. That is an utter disrespect to a human being.... This mentioning [of] the Chinese and blaming them is xenophobia,"" Duterte said in a press conference Monday night.
""Stop this xenophobia thing,"" he added.
Duterte said calls to have Chinese in the Philippines return to China were ""a case of bad taste."" He sought to remind Filipinos that Chinese were not at fault for the emergence of the disease, which could have propagated in other places. (READ: Robredo urges Filipinos to respect Chinese amid coronavirus spread)
""It happened in China – at least the first [case] – but that is not the fault of anybody. Not of the Chinese, not the Filipinos, not of anyone,"" he said.
The President then urged the public to ""remember"" the thousands of Filipinos who are in China, saying countries should help one another take care of its citizens.
""We have many Filipinos in China. Even if we have none, we are a community of nations, we cooperate. China has been kind to us, we can only show the same,"" Duterte said.
Travel restrictions. The Philippine government on Sunday, February 2, implemented a ban against non-Filipinos coming to the country directly from China, Hong Kong, and Macau in an effort to quell the spread of the virus.
The restrictions, Duterte said, do not cover Chinese who hold valid Philippine visas and are coming from other countries outside China. 
Aside from this, the Philippines also temporarily stopped issuing visas to travelers from China, Hong Kong, and Macau, while immigration officials suspended the visa upon arrival mechanism for Chinese tourists and businessmen.
Asked if the government is considering expanding travel bans to include other countries with confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus, Duterte said the Philippines would follow the advice of the World Health Organization (WHO).
""They (WHO) have all the inputs and they would know what to do...we go by the regulations that will be given out by the WHO. We cannot act on our own,"" he said.
Travel bans, though, were imposed even if the World Health Organization warned that closing borders was likely ineffective in halting transmission of the virus. 
Slow to act? Duterte has been criticized for being slow to act on the novel coronavirus compared to other countries which swiftly put in place sweeping restrictions to quell the spread of the virus and informed the public of such measures.
Despite this, the President said ""everything is well"" in the Philippines and that there's ""nothing really to be extra scared of.""
""It will die a natural death, ito matatapos rin ito (this too shall pass), will it worsen in the meantime? Maybe.... [But] the progress of medical science now is far different than the yesteryears,"" Duterte said as he expressed confidence that health experts would find a ""solution"" to the novel coronavirus. 
While health officials have given assurances they are closely monitoring suspected novel coronavirus cases in the country, they repeatedly reminded the public to practice good personal hygiene such as frequent handwashing and to seek medical treatment immediately, if necessary.
So far, the Department of Health has confirmed two cases of the novel coronavirus in the Philippines.
These include the first death outside China – a 44-year-old Chinese man who traveled to the Philippines from Wuhan. The man was the country's second confirmed case of the novel coronavirus, and a companion of the first patient, a 38-year-old Chinese woman.

BACOLOD, Philippines – At least 5 individuals were quarantined at a hospital in Negros Oriental while two others were quarantined at another hospital in Bacolod City after exhibiting flu-like symptoms.
The Department of Health (DOH) on Sunday, February 2, confirmed the second case of the novel coronavirus in the Philippines. Both confirmed cases traveled to the Philippines from Wuhan, China.
The second patient, who was the traveling companion of the first confirmed case, died on Saturday, February 1 – the first death recorded outside China. The DOH is currently monitoring 80 patients for possible infection.
The 5 persons being monitored in Negros Oriental came in contact with the two confirmed cases, who both had a travel history to Dumaguete City.
Provincial Information Officer Bimbo Miraflor, in a press conference on Monday, February 3, said swab samples were already taken from the 5 individuals – a plane passenger, two hotel employees, and two from a resort – and were sent to the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine for tests.
Miraflor said two of these persons have fever, while the others have cough and sore throat.
He said another 25 individuals who came in contact with the two confirmed cases were also being monitored. Although they were not exhibiting flu-like symptoms, they were required to be quarantined in 14 days. 
Negros Oriental Governor Roel Degamo instructed the Provincial Social Welfare and Development Office to assist those who were identified to have direct contact with the two confirmed cases. The provincial government will provide them P5,000 assistance as they will not be able to work while under quarantine.
The provincial government again called on those who came in contact with the two confirmed cases to visit or present themselves to the Provincial Epidemiology and Surveillance Unit or the Negros Oriental Provincial Hospital. 
Due diligence
Meanwhile, Negros Occidental Governor Eugenio Jose Lacson announced on Monday that two patients were also quarantined in a hospital in Bacolod City.
The suspected patients are a 43-year-old Canadian who came from Taiwan, and a 12-year-old Filipino who traveled from Macau, China, and Hong Kong. 
Lacson said the Canadian was admitted to a hospital on Friday, January 31, adding that a private hospital initially refused the admission of the patient.
The Filipino was admitted to a hospital the following day, February 1, he said.
Lacson said the patients did not travel together.
He called on the public not to panic. ""We're debating [whether] to announce this or not, but it is not fair [if we will not announce it].... I can't just keep it from the public. Because of due diligence, we monitored two persons under investigation,"" he said.
""We don't want to create a scare. It's good [that we know] because they are now being quarantined,"" he said.
Lacson said the results will be out in 48 hours, and that the provincial government will continue to trace those who had direct contact with the patients. He also advised them to submit to the quarantine procedure.
He stressed that there is still no confirmed case of the novel coronavirus in Negros Occidental.
Lacson said the provincial government will reactivate its Provincial Infectious Disease Action and Control Committee to curb the possible spread of the virus.
Lacson also called on private hospitals to be prepared.
""I hope, if there is a need for them to admit a patient with suspected symptoms, just in case, I hope these private hospitals will be willing to treat these patients,"" he added.

MANILA, Philippines – Overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) affected by the temporary travel ban to mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau will receive assistance in the form of cash, accommodation, and transportation from the government. 
The Overseas Workers Welfare Administration (OWWA) said in a Monday, February 3, memorandum that it would provide P10,000 to each OFW supposed to travel back to mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau, but was instead stranded in Manila airports after the announcement of a travel ban to and from the said areas affected by the 2019 novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV outbreak. 
Aside from cash, they will also be accommodated in a OWWA halfway house. The agency will pay for their travel back to their provinces of origin. OWWA said OFWs may avail of the assistance from OWWA officers at the aiports or through the OWWA hotline at 1348.
Though they have no precise numbers, the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) estimated that around 300 OFWs were stranded in Manila airports on Monday, February 3, after the travel ban was imposed. Most of them were bound for Hong Kong and Macau, DOLE added.  
Malacañang had initially announced a travel ban to and from Hubei province, whose capital is Wuhan, ground zero of the outbreak. (READ: PH expands visa suspension for travelers from China, Hong Kong, Macau)
But the travel ban was expanded Sunday, February 2, to cover all of mainland China and the special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau, shortly before the Department of Health (DOH) announced the second case of 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease in the country. 
The ban means that all non-Filipinos traveling from China and its special administrative regions would be barred from entering the country. Travelers coming from transit points in Hong Kong will be covered by the travel ban as well. Likewise, Filipinos would be barred from departing for China, Hong Kong, and Macau. 
Airlines have also followed suit, with several flights to the 3 areas canceled in an effort to contain the spread of the virus.
The Philippines also temporarily stopped issuing visas to travelers from China, Hong Kong, and Macau.

As of Monday, the virus has killed at least 360 people, including one in the Philippines. As of 12 pm on Monday, there are a total of 27 patients under investigation in the National Capital Region..
President Rodrigo Duterte expanded the Philippine government's ban on travelers, covering any person coming directly from China, Hong Kong, and Macau within the last two weeks. 
Here is how LGUs in Metro Manila are preparing for possible new cases of the highly infective virus.
Quezon City
Quezon City Mayor Joy Belmonte is set to inspect 3 government-run hospitals – Quezon City Medical Center, Rosario Maclang Bautista General Hospital, and Novaliches District Hospital – for their readiness in the event of more 2019-nCoV cases.
The 3 hospitals have been equipped with the necessary safety equipment, such as an isolation tent, to take in people suspected of carrying the virus. The tent would allow patients to be isolated from other hospital patients.
These hospitals are also part of the task force for monitoring and responding to the virus.
Private hospitals have also been briefed with regard to the protocols in handling suspected nCoV patients.
Further, 80 frontline responders and logistics personnel of the Quezon City DRRMO were trained on the proper use of personal protective equipment, proper handling of patients, and proper disposal and disinfection of equipment.
Quezon City Health Department Head Dr. Esperanza Arias has also oriented doctors on the virus and activated fever lanes in multiple health facilities to expedite the response to 2019-nCoV concerns.
Quezon City residents may contact the city's 122 hotline for information on nCoV.
Parañaque City
According to Parañaque City Health Office head Olga Virtusio, all medical officers have already been informed about the virus, and hospitals have already prepared for isolation of persons under investigation. 
Virtusio said that while they have a makeshift tent, they are lobbying for another isolation tent of better quality.
She added that triaging is already in place as well. Triage involves the assessment and immediate isolation of carriers of 2019-nCoV away from other patients, according to the World Health Organization. 
Moreover, information on the virus is being printed for dissemination, said Virtusio. 
Pasig City
In a Facebook post, Pasig City Mayor Vico Sotto said that a quarantine tent has been set up at the Pasig City General Hospital for those with symptoms of the flu.
In addition, Sotto said healthcare professionals in the emergency room are implementing the triage algorithm of patients with suspected nCoV infection.
Further, infrared thermometers have been turned over to the Department of Education-Pasig, to be distributed to 44 public schools. The thermometers will be used at the entrances of schools starting Monday to check if students have a fever.

The measure must be able to go through 3 successful readings in the House and in the Senate before it can be transmitted to Malacañang for President Rodrigo Duterte's signature.

Only Filipino citizens and permanent resident visa holders are exempted from the ban.
""We implement the directive to the letter. What we are looking at is not the nationality, but where they came from,"" Sandoval said.

Epidemiology Bureau Director Ferchito Avelino said that 8 of the new cases being monitored are people who came in contact with the couple from Wuhan, China, who were the first positive cases of 2019-nCoV in the Philippines. The 8 people showed signs of coughs and colds, according to Avelino. 
Avelino added that the Epidemiology Bureau has found a total of 74 contacts the couple interacted with in Cebu and Dumaguete. They have been advised to go on home quarantine and are discouraged from interacting with other people within 14 days. 
The increase in cases being probed comes as the criteria for probing expanded to persons coming not just from Hubei province but also from all of mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau. 
Health Francisco Duque III also said the increase was “due to the strengthened surveillance system and contact tracing of the Epidemiology Bureau,"" but this is amid criticism that the health department has been very late in its response to the virus that has claimed more than 360 lives and sickened 16,823 as of Februrary 3.
Lawmakers, as well as the public, had been calling for a travel ban on all of mainland China even before the first case of 2019-nCoV was confirmed in the Philippines, but their calls were met with the president’s statement saying a ban would imperil economic and diplomatic relations with China.
Duterte finally answered the call for a ban on travelers from mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau, on the same day that the DOH announced the first 2019-nCoV-related death in the Philippines – the first one outside of China. 
The DOH continues to urge the public to remain calm and practice proper hygiene and coughing etiquette to prevent infection. It also calls on the public not to hoard surgical masks, as they are only needed by people showing symptoms. The DOH is asking that they be reserved to ""people who need them most, especially medical personnel.""
Duterte is set to meet with the DOH and other medical experts on Monday to discuss government response to the disease. Health officials are looking at two military facilities as possible quarantine areas for Filipinos returning from Wuhan, China, Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana said on Saturday, February 1. These sites are not final, Duque said, but they will be discussed in Monday's cabinet meeting. The Department of Foreign Affairs said that 42 Filipinos have so far requested for repatriation from Wuhan, the epicenter of the viral outbreak. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – About 300 Chinese were left stranded at several terminals across the country, following the Philippine government's sweeping travel restrictions imposed amid the global spread of the 2019 novel coronavirus.
Bureau of Immigration Spokesperson Dana Sandoval disclosed this during a press briefing at Malacañang on Monday, February 3, adding the number included Chinese who wished to return home to China after trips to the Philippines.
""Three hundred Chinese nationals are stranded...because most airlines cancelled their flights [to China],"" Sandoval said.
Apart from the 300 Chinese, Sandoval said other foreigners were also stranded at several terminals, though most have been able to depart as of Monday.
In limbo. The Duterte government on Sunday, February 2, implemented an entry ban against non-Filipinos coming to the country from China, Hong Kong, and Macau. Government authorities have likewise barred Filipinos from leaving the country to travel to China and its special administrative regions.
The sweeping travel restrictions have prompted airlines to follow suit, with several flights to China, Hong Kong, and Macau cancelled in an effort to quell the spread of the coronavirus.
What will happen to Chinese nationals? Sandoval gave assurances affected Chinese who were stranded in the country will be able to return home as the Chinese embassy has pledged to send an aircraft to fetch their nationals stranded in the Philippines.
She likewise urged the public to refrain from unnecessary travel and to bear with government restrictions in the meantime.
The Philippines joined a growing list of countries that have put in place temporary but sweeping travel restrictions on travelers coming from China within the last two weeks. Such bans followed the health officials' announcement that the coronavirus spread to the Philippines and the World Health Organization's (WHO) declaration the outbreak as a global emergency.
Despite this, the WHO warned that closing borders was probably ineffective in halting transmission and could accelerate the virus's spread. Travel restrictions, they added, could also slow the arrival of assistance and support for the management of the virus.
As of Monday morning, February 3, the virus has killed 360 people and infected over 17,000 people worldwide. – Rappler.com

MANILA, Philippines – Vice President Leni Robredo on Sunday, February 2, urged the public not to resort to discrimination against Chinese in the Philippines amid fears over the global spread of the 2019 novel coronavirus .
Robredo said doing so would be ""wrong"" as it was akin to subjecting Chinese nationals , who likewise suffered from the virus, to further difficulty while already being on the frontlines of the infection.
Robredo sought to remind Filipinos that Chinese were not at fault for the emergence of the disease and that the public should focus on battling the virus rather than discriminating against others.
""Lahat naman ginagawa para mahanapan ng lunas iyong sakit na ito. Pero ang pakiusap lang po natin...huwag namang huhusgahan iyong lahat na mga...Chinese citizens, iyong lahat na mga bumibisita dito sa atin. Iyong sa atin po, tama na nag-iingat tayo, tama na temporarily suspended iyong mga flights. Pero ito po, walang iisang may kasalanan tayo, kaya tayo, magtulungan"" Robredo said.
(We're doing everything necessary to find a cure for this disease. What we're asking is do not judge all Chinese citizens in the Philippines. It's okay to be cautious, it is good were being careful, it is right that flights have been temporarily suspended. But this (virus) is not any one person's fault so we should help one another.)
""Hindi po nakakatulong iyong pagbabatikos, hindi po nakakatulong iyong paghuhusga sa iba pang mga nakakasalamuha natin, kasi pare-pareho lang naman po tayo,"" she added. (READ: Racism more dangerous than novel coronavirus – FilChi business group)
(It does not help to ridicule and judge others who we encounter because we're all the same.)
Robredo's reaction to government measures: Meanwhile, the Vice President said the Duterte administration's ban on travelers coming directly from China, Hong Kong, and Macau was a ""welcome development,"" though she lamented restrictions should have been taken sooner.
Robredo likewise downplayed calls for her to lead the country as she urged the Duterte government to take swift precautions against the spread of the coronavirus in the Philippines.
Robredo was referring to a Twitter poll where respondents said they wanted her to lead the country following dissatisfaction over the government's current handling of the situation.
""Iyong solusyon hindi naman ganoon. Pero ang solusyon, mas maging swift lang sana, mas maging aggressive iyong response ng gobyerno, kasi natatakot iyong tao, eh.... Hindi naman natin sinasabi na walang ginagawa, pero hanggang kasi hindi alam ng tao kung ano iyong ginagawa, iyong takot nandoon, eh,"" Robredo said.
(That's not the solution. The solution is to act swiftly and aggressively because the public is worried.... We're not saying the government isn't doing anything but until Filipinos know what is being done, the fear is there.)
Robredo urged President Rodrigo Duterte to publicly address the Filipino people when making statements, saying the public was only looking for assurances the government was taking all necessary steps to protect them.
""Alam natin na very popular si Pangulo, na kapag siya iyong mag-assure sa mga kababayan natin na lahat ginagawa ng pamahalaan, tingin ko hindi ganoon kagrabe iyong takot, eh,"" Robredo said.
(We all know the President is very popular so if he assures our countrymen that the government is doing everything it can, I don't think people will be as scared.)
The latest in the Philippines. Health officials on Sunday confirmed the second case of coronavirus in the country.
The patient, who already died, was said the be the companion of the Philippines' first confirmed case, according to health authorities. Both patients travelled to the Philippines from Wuhan, China.
The patient's death marks the first confirmed death outside of China due to the coronavirus. The WHO stressed, though, the case was not a ""locally-acquired"" as the fatality came from Wuhan.
Robredo reminded the public to practice proper personal hygiene and urged Filipinos to stay calm amid the spread of the coronavirus. 
As of early morning Sunday, February 2, the virus has killed 304 people and infected over 14,000 people worldwide. – Rappler.com

CEBU CITY, Philippines – As fear of being infected with the coronavirus grips Metro Cebu, drugstores here are forced to ration surgical face masks to meet the high demand.
Pharmacies are implementing a ""one box per person"" policy in the purchase of face masks to prevent hoarding.
  During a meeting on Friday, January 31, Cebu City Mayor Edgardo Labella requested the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) to monitor prices of face masks and to also sanction those who are hoarding these.  David Tumulak, chairperson of the City Council Committee on Disaster Risk Reduction and Management,  said that pharmacies caught selling overpriced masks will be charged with violating the Consumer’s Act and the Disaster Risk Reduction Law for hoarding. 
He said 7 pharmacies here are now being investigated for allegedly overpricing the masks.
An official statement by DTI representative Dinah Gladys Oro said there should not be a shortage of face masks in Cebu City as supplies for the Central Visayas region directly arrive here from the National Capital Region (NCR).
The DOH-Central Visayas Center for Health Development said face masks were not the only means to prevent respiratory tract infections. DOH said individuals can have good health through proper rest, diet, proper handwashing and cough etiquette. (READ: Novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV: What we know so far)
Department of Health Central Visayas Director Jaime Bernadas said that the 38-year-old Chinese national from Wuhan, who was the first confirmed patient of the coronavirus in the Philippines, had been in Cebu for only 3 hours as a transit passenger. 
“What we need to do is to be vigilant and to be healthy so we are not susceptible to the virus,” said Bernadas.
The World Health Organization declared the outbreak an international emergency. The death toll is currently at 212 as of Friday, January 31. 
The DOH recommended the use of face masks for those who are sick to help contain spreading the virus. For those going to crowded places and have pre-existing conditions, face masks may help prevent infections. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines– The Federation of Filipino Chinese Chambers of Commerce and Industry Incorporated (FFCCCII) cautioned the public not to resort to racism as the novel coronavirus spreads worldwide, adding that discrimination is more dangerous than the disease.
“Spreading fake news and racist, xenophobic messages can be more dangerous than the virus itself due to their negative effects of causing confusion, fears, rancor and instability,” FFCCCII said in a statement on Saturday, February 1.
The business chamber also reminded Filipinos that China is an important economic partner of the Philippines for a thousand years.
“In fact, we should give moral support and encouragements to China in their valiant efforts to contain this ailment,” FFCCCII said.
The group said it plans to donate a million or more face masks to Filipinos, although the World Health Organization already said that masks are not needed by healthy people with no respiratory symptoms. (READ: FAST FACTS: What's next after novel coronavirus declared an int'l emergency?)

MANILA, Philippines – Adamson University (AdU) drew flak online after it released a memorandum on Friday, January 31, directing Chinese students to observe self-quarantine for two weeks as a precautionary measure against the 2019 novel coronavirus (nCoV). 
This memorandum was released a day after the Department of Health (DOH) confirmed the first case of nCoV in the country – a 38-year-old woman who came from virus epicenter Wuhan and traveled to Cebu and Dumaguete before she was admitted to a government hospital in Manila.
Issued from the Office of the President of Adamson University and posted online by the AdU Student Government, the memorandum stated that this decision was made “to ensure a healthy and virus-free environment.” 
“Thus, we have made a decision that all Chinese students, both graduate and undergraduate, observe self-quarantine starting today until February 14, 2020,” the statement reads.
  
It added that Chinese nationals are advised to postpone all transactions inside the university for the stated period of 2 weeks. 
It also urged professors and students to maximize use of the e-learning system so as not to hamper the continuous delivery of learning for the affected students. 
Meanwhile, local students and all other students will continue with their classes.  
Racism? 
But Filipinos on social media aren’t pleased with the safety precaution ordered by Adamson University to its Chinese students. 
Some of them pointed out how this decision from the University stirred racist attacks on Chinese nationals. 
 




  
Nearly 10,000 people have been infected in China and new cases were found abroad, with more than 20 countries now affected by the disease. (READ: FAQs: Ano-ano ang alam natin tungkol sa 2019 novel coronavirus?)
Why not include travel history?
Some netizens also questioned the memorandum for singling out Chinese students and not the others with a travel history to the affected countries. 
  
  
  
Better communicated
Others defended the university saying that the memorandum was intended for good. Some said that the use of words in the memo should be phrased better. 
  
  
  
  
Soon after the memorandum posted online went on fire, the university apologized to the public. It also made clarifications to its earlier memorandum. 
“The Memorandum modifies the previous one released, and we apologize for the misimpression it may have created,” the statement reads. 
 
It clarified that those ""who travelled to and from countries with confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV, including China and/or Hongkong, within the last month, or who may have in close contact or had exposure to a potential source of infection during their travel abroad” were ordered to observe self-quarantine and seek medical attention for at least 2 weeks. 
It further noted that Chinese students and guests who were not limited by the conditions earlier stated, were not included in those directed to undergo the self-quarantine advisory and would be allowed to enter the campus, as opposed to their earlier statement. 
The university also assured its community that it was working its best to ensure the health and safety of everyone. 
The 2019-nCoV that originated from Wuhan, China, has so far killed 213 and sickened nearly 10,000 people across the country and worldwide. The World Health Organization already declared an international emergency over the virus.

AKLAN, Philippines (UPDATED) – Authorities are monitoring two persons in Dr. Rafael S. Tumbokon Memorial Hospital in Kalibo, Aklan to minimize any chance of exposure to 2019 novel coronavirus acute respiratory disease (2019-nCov ARD).
The first is a 23-year-old flight attendant who came from Wuhan, China on January 21 where she developed cough after 3 days. The cabin crew of that same flight was quarantined in a private isolation room since Thursday, January 30.
Wuhan is considered the epicenter of the 2019-nCov ARD outbreak.
The second, a 17-year-old male Chinese tourist, was also referred by a local hospital in Boracay Island to the Aklan provincial hospital after experiencing flu-like symptoms.
Meanwhile, a flight attendant from Palawan with travel history in Taiwan and Shanghai, China, however, denied she was quarantined in Aklan provincial hospital. She said she was in the hospital to get her medical clearance on January 31, Friday.
On January 28, 3 foreigners were discharged from the Aklan provincial hospital after the results of their tests for the 2019-nCov came out negative.
Provincial Health Officer I Dr. Cornelio Cuachon, Jr. said seaports and airports in Aklan were on heightened alert to step up precautions for the deadly and highly-contagious Wuhan coronavirus. PHO-Aklan was also closely coordinating with Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP) and Bureau of Quarantine (BOQ) to check incoming travelers from other countries.
Kalibo airport manager Eusebio Monserate, Jr said passengers flying to and from Shanghai, Tianjin, Fuzhou, Chengdu, Peking, Nanjing, Hangzhou, Changsha and Wuhan in China on February 1 were affected by the indefinite cancellation of flights.
""Magiging drastic ang pagbaba ng numero ng flights at arrivals ng visitors natin in Kalibo airport. Lahat ng flights to China are suspended until further notice,"" he added.
(The number of flights and arrivals of visitors in Kalibo airport will go down drastically. All of the flights to China are suspended until further notice.)
Monserate said the cancellation of around 20 commercial flights was a precautionary measure to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus, which has killed 213 people in mainland China.
Amid the coronavirus outbreak in Hubei province, the Aklan Medical Society urged the public on January 31 to observe good personal hygiene and stay healthy at all times to contain the 2019-nCOv ARD.
The common symptoms of coronavirus include breathing difficulties, cough and cold, fever and shortness of breath.
Meantime, the 11 Chinese tourists under medical observation in Kalibo, Aklan returned to China on January 31. They boarded a China Eastern Airlines plane around 2:40 pm, Friday, in Kalibo International Airport to take a four-hour flight en route to Chengdu, China.
Cuachon said the tourists were fit to travel to China after they secured medical clearances from attending doctors.
""They had no flu-like symptoms and they will be closely monitored also in China,"" he added.
The foreigners, who were spending their vacation in Boracay Island, were tracked down by health authorities. Four of them had close contacts with a coronavirus patient in Hong Kong.
On January 24, the Chinese tourists – 7 adults and 4 children – were admitted in Aklan provincial hospital in Kalibo, Aklan. The Chinese nationals were asked to stay in the Gov. Corazon L. Cabagnot Tourism and Training Center in Old Buswang, Kalibo since January 25 for medical observation for 10 to 14 days even without flu-like symptoms.
However, the anxiety of parents and students had grown after health authorities in Aklan confirmed 11 tourists have been isolated. The 'virus scare' also prompted the suspension of classes near the Aklan training center on January 29. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – Health officials are looking at two military facilities as possible quarantine areas for Filipinos returning from Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the outbreak of the novel coronavirus, Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana told reporters on Saturday morning, February 1.
Department of Health (DOH) officials visited the naval station on Caballo Island in Manila Bay on Friday, January 31, and will visit the Drug Rehabilitation Center in Fort Magsaysay in Nueva Ecija on Saturday, Lorenzana added.
In November 2014, the naval station on Caballo Island, near Corregidor Island and a part of Cavite City, served as a quarantine area for least 133 Filipino soldiers who were United Nations Peacekeepers. They had then just arrived in the Philippines after a mission in Liberia amid an outbreak of the Ebola virus in West Africa. None of the peacekeepers tested positive for Ebola.
Meanwhile, the drug treatment and rehabilitation center in Fort Magsaysay was built in late 2016 to house up to 10,000 drug dependents who were expected to surrender to the government in its “war on drugs.”
However, the facility has been mostly vacant, as most illegal drug users who surrendered to authorities were placed on community-based rehabilitation.

CEBU CITY, Philippines – Cebu’s annual water shortage could make the potential novel cornavirus (nCoV 2019) outbreak difficult to control, the World Health Organization (WHO) Philippines told Rappler on Friday, January 31.
“Water shortages affect the spread of the pathogenic organisms, such as bacteria and viruses, because lack of water will limit handwashing and compromise the cleaning and sanitation of health care facilities,” the international health body said in a statement. 
WHO Philippines was responding to our question about the impact of water scarcity, particularly in Cebu, on efforts to combat an outbreak of the 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease.    The Department of Health also recommends frequent hand washing and “good hygiene” to combat the spread of the virus. (READ: Novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV: What we know so far) “It is important that communities and health workers have access to safe and adequate water at all times to protect them from the spread of infection,” the WHO said.Water crisisSince the mid-2000s, however, Metro Cebu, an area where over 2.5 million people live, has been grappling with prolonged rotating water interruptions.   Periods of no water flow can last longer hours and affect more barangays going into the summer months, when there is little to no rainfall.  But even during the most recent rainy season, barangays across Metro Cebu experienced long water interruptions in their homes.  A resident of Barangay Kamputhaw in Cebu City told Rappler through direct message that the village often only gets water between 12 am and 5 am daily, but sometimes for less time than that.  Cebu City resident Jann Banguis sent a video to Rappler of Kamputhaw residents lining up with buckets to get water from a truck.

JM dela Mer of San Isidro, Talisay City, said his barangay currently only gets water from 4 am to 6 am daily.A resident of Barangay Luz in Cebu City reported not having water flow entirely since Thursday, January 30.  The WHO said lack of water would threaten infection prevention and control measures and “will have an impact on health.”   In the summer of 2019, over 30 barangays in Metro Cebu experienced up to 22-hour water outages because both the Jaclupan and Buhisan dams in Metro Cebu had completely dried up. (READ: 22-hour water interruptions expected as Jaclupan dam dries up)  Mayor Edgar Labella met with heads of regional government agencies on Friday to assist the city in planning its response to a potential outbreak.   Much of the discussion was focused on the quarantine of possible virus carriers, making sure hospitals were equipped to deal with patients infected by the virus, and the supply of masks.  Multiple attempts to reach Labella to ask if water distribution or sanitizer supply plans were part of the discussion went unanswered. But he is scheduled to discuss the water crisis in a public forum at the Cebu City Sports Complex on Monday, February 3. More water sources to open In January alone, the Metro Cebu Water District (MCWD) announced 15 separate water interruptions for different barangays.
MCWD spokesperson Charmaine Kara Rodriguez said the supply deficit is currently at 10,000 cubic meters per day, with a total production of 223,000 cubic meters per day. The total demand for water in Metro Cebu was an average of 500,000 cubic meters.   “Supply problems were experienced this month in areas due to leaks, non-operation of wells due to power outages, and maintenance of MCWD facilities,” Kara explained.
She said, however, that new wells scheduled to open in February and March should help add to the daily output of water production.   Additional water supply from Pilipinas Water Resources Incorporated in Mambaling is expected to add 5,000 cubic meters per day, while water sourced from Danao City is expected to add an additional 10,000 cubic meters per day.  But even with the additional sources of water, the supply would still be producing only 47% of total water demand in Metro Cebu.
The MCWD, however, acknowledged that the amount of rainfall that will come in the summer months to replenish the water supply in the Buhisan and Jaclupan dams is unpredictable. While they recognized the important of water in combating the spread of viruses, they still encouraged the public to practice water conservation in their homes.
“MCWD is advising the public to use water wisely so everyone can enjoy it. Let’s conserve where we can so we will have enough supply even during the summer months.” Kara said.   
From 2016 to 2019, Cebu City and the Province of Cebu had declared a state of calamity on diffent occasions due to drought, brought about by El Niño.  When water supply is low, the MCWD said they could deliver water to barangays where there is no service. The water district spokesperson said coordination for water deliveries would be done through the barangays and local government units.The World Health Organization declared the outbreak an international emergency. The death is currently at 212 as of Friday. After the first case of nCoV-2019 was confirmed in the Philippines – a woman who traveled to Manila via Cebu and Dumaguete – President Rodrigo Duterte imposed a ban on travelers from the Wuhan City, the epicenter of the outbreak. The ban includes flights from the rest of Hubei province, China. This would last until the 2019-nCoV threat was over. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – Several schools took extra precautionary measures Friday, January 31, to protect its employees and students from the 2019 novel coronavirus (nCoV).
This move to prevent the spread of the virus came a day after the Department of Health (DOH) confirmed the first case of nCoV in the country.   
Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said that the confirmed patient was a 38-year-old woman who came from virus epicenter Wuhan and traveled to Cebu and Dumaguete before she was admitted to a government hospital in Manila. (READ: FAQs: Ano-ano ang alam natin tungkol sa 2019 novel coronavirus?) 
Close coordination 
In a statement, the Department of Education (DepEd) said that it was in close coordination with DOH officials to implement health guidelines in schools, particularly on decisions for  lockdowns in specific communities. It also urged the schools to cooperate with DOH.
Currently, its efforts are focused on promoting awareness and precautionary measures in schools and their immediate communities, using the information materials from DOH.
“We will consolidate available information from official sources, and discuss further actions, measures and mechanisms for readiness and response,” DepEd assured. 
As of Friday, January 31, DOH added that the number of patients being monitored for 2019-nCoV climbed up to 31 from the 29 people cited by the DOH on Thursday. 
Of the 31, 25 were admitted to hospitals, 5 had been discharged but were still being strictly monitored, and one – a man with a preexisting illness – died but it had yet to be determined if he also had 2019-nCoV.
Due to the increasing number of confirmed cases and deaths, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared an international emergency over the deadly novel coronavirus that killed 212 people and infected over 8,000 worldwide as of early Friday, January 31.  
Reducing the risks
Meanwhile, to reduce the risk of infections, schools in Metro Manila and in some provinces took on the necessary steps to promote the antiseptic technique among students and employees. 
It provided hand sanitizers and rubbing alochol at the entrance of the building and in various counters inside the campus. 
According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), practicing hand hygiene is a simple yet effective way to prevent infection. 
Temperature checks were also done at school entrances.
Face masks were also given to students in some public schools. In Araullo High School for example, face masks were distributed to the students by the Manila City local government. 
According to the Philippine Society for Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (PSMID) and Philippine Hospital Infection Control Society (PHICS), face masks or surgical masks are designed to protect users from droplets and splashes that might cause possible infection. 
Both groups also reminded the public that masks are always worn colored side out.

MANILA, Philippines – Philippine Airlines (PAL) and Cebu Pacific said on Friday, January 31, they had pulled out the planes that were boarded by the Philippines' first novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) patient.
The two airlines issued separate statements on Friday, a day after the Department of Health confirmed a 38-year-old woman as the country's first case of 2019-nCoV. The woman, who also visited Cebu and Dumaguete before heading to Manila, took Cebu Pacific flights on January 21 and a PAL flight on January 25.
PAL said it placed two pilots and 4 cabin crew under quarantine. Meanwhile, the cabin crew and pilots on affected Cebu Pacific flights were also informed about the development, but Cebu Pacific said they showed no symptoms of illness.
Cebu Pacific said the planes that the nCoV patient boarded had been pulled out and disinfected. It said it was also implementing the following preventive measures:

Cleaning and disinfection of aircraft between flights
Ensuring that employees, frontline personnel, and cabin crew wear face masks while on duty
Providing face masks to passengers who show symptoms of illness
Isolating passengers who manifest symptoms of illness in empty rows inside the aircraft during the flight
Coordinating with health authorities in the event that there are passengers suspected of carrying the virus for immediate turnover and further observation

PAL said it was conducting these preventive measures:

Intensive cleaning and disinfection of aircraft used on routes to and from China
Assigning specific aircraft to be used only on China routes, arranging for these aircraft to park at designated remote areas of the Ninoy Aquino International Airport
Filtering of cabin air using special filters and air circulation systems that constantly refresh air on board and filter most coronaviruses
Thermal scanning of all arriving passengers; contributing thermal scanners to domestic airports which may not have the latest facilities
Ensuring the use of face masks by cabin crew and providing face masks to passengers upon request
Adjusting inflight service on China flights
Conducting information campaign at airports and onboard flights
reporting medical concerns in coordinating with health authorities and BoQ

The airlines also tracked down the passengers who might have come into contact with the woman who took flights on both airlines.
In coordination with the DOH and the Bureau of Quarantine, the two airlines informed the patient's co-passengers about the confirmed case so they could have themselves checked. The BoQ will handle the medical observation of the concerned passengers and airline crew.
""We are also working to trace any onward journeys made by these passengers and crew on other flights, in case there is a need for BoQ to contact other people for precautionary medical observation,"" PAL said in a statement on Friday.
Cebu Pacific has reduced its flights between the Philippines, mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau.
PAL is set to reduce flights between Manila and mainland China by more than 50%, starting February 1. PAL has canceled all charter flights from China and has also prohibited accepting passengers from the Hubei province of China.

The World Health Organization declared the outbreak an international emergency, as the death toll climbs to 212 as of Friday. In the Philippines, President Rodrigo Duterte imposed a ban on travelers from Wuhan City – the epicenter of the outbreak – and the rest of Hubei province, China, which would last until the 2019-nCoV threat was over.
The Department of the Interior and Local Government also urged local government units to create their respective coronavirus task force, and to cooperate with the DOH in contact-tracing individuals who encountered the confirmed 2019-nCoV patient.
Health officials advised the public to practice proper hygiene and coughing etiquette, including constant washing of hands and coughing into the crook of the elbow. ('Novel coronavirus or 2019 nCoV: What we know so far) – Rappler.com

MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – The Department of Health (DOH) said on Friday, January 31, that it was monitoring 31 patients for the 2019 novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV.
The latest number is up from the 29 people cited by the DOH on Thursday, January 30.
The DOH said the new patients, admitted to hospitals in Metro Manila and Eastern Visayas, were a Chinese and an American. They traveled separately and came from different regions in China, said Epidemiology Bureau Director Ferchito Avelino. (READ: ‘Novel coronavirus' or 2019 nCoV: What we know so far)
Of the 31, 25 were admitted to hospitals, 5 had been discharged but were still being strictly monitored, and 1 – a man with a preexisting illness – died but it had yet to be determined if he also had 2019-nCoV.
The cases being investigated are in the following regions:

Metro Manila - 19
Mimaropa - 1
Western Visayas - 3
Eastern Visayas - 2
Central Visayas - 4
Northern Mindanao - 1
Davao - 1

Contact tracing
Health officials announced the latest number of PUIs a day after the Philippines confirmed its first case of 2019-nCoV, a 38-year-old woman who came from virus epicenter Wuhan and traveled to Cebu and Dumaguete before she was admitted to a government hospital in Manila to be isolated. 
The DOH said it had begun contact tracing or tracking down people who were on the same flight as the patient Once identified, they would also be isolated and monitored. 
The Philippines' first nCoV patient took a Cebu Pacific flight from Hong Kong to Cebu, a CebGo flight from Cebu to Dumaguete, and a Philippine Airlines flight from Dumaguete to Manila, the DOH said. The DOH said the airlines were cooperating with them.
The DOH said it was also in the process of identifying people other people the patient might have interacted with. This would include finding personnel in hotels and other establishments that the patient went to and putting them under monitoring, but not isolation. 
“We are doing this carefully so we may release the proper advice to the contacts. We don’t want them to hide,” epidemiology bureau head Avelino said.  
Travel ban 
Amid the scare, President Rodrigo Duterte banned travel from Wuhan City and the rest of Hubei province. The Department of Foreign Affairs also said it would repatriate Filipinos in Hubei starting next week. 
The inter-agency task force headed by the DOH was set to meet on Friday to discuss a possible expansion of the travel ban to other regions in China with high incidences of the disease, especially after the World Health Organization declared an international emergency over the deadly novel coronavirus from China.
“What we want is to see the magnitude of cases in (other provinces)…. We’re thinking of setting it to at least 100 cases (before we impose a a ban),” said Health Undersecretary Eric Domingo, adding that they were coordinating with WHO for guidance on the matter.  
Lawmakers had called for a travel ban on all of China and not just Hubei province amid fears of more cases reaching the Philippines. 
As of early morning Friday, January 31, the virus has killed 212 people and infected over 8,000 people worldwide. – Rappler.com

COLD HUNTERS. Tourists enjoy the cold weather at Northern Blossom Flower Park in Atok Benguet. Photo by Mau Victa/Rappler

BAGUIO CITY – Usually cold weather is most welcome here in Baguio. 
But when the temperature dipped to 11.2 degrees at 5 am Friday, January 31, it was met with more anxiety than excitement.
It is the coldest temperature for Baguio this year. Last January 4, the temperature dipped to 11.4 degrees.
In the higher reaches of Benguet, the cold reached 10 degrees, this does not even include the wind chill factor which can bring the cold down to 5 degrees.
If the tailend of amihan or easterly winds is at its last blast, the weather might still get colder.
Last year, it reached its coldest at 9.8 degrees on January 28.
This may be good for the cold hunters. But with the first victim of coronavirus in the Philippines identified last Thursday, January 31, and persons under investigation reaching 53, the cold is actually bad news.
Cold weather is known to serve as an ideal ground for viruses like the common cold and the flu. These viruses  have achieved the ability to spread between people, as they are more stable in cold air, and low humidity helps them to “float” for longer. 
Cold weather also decreases the bodily defenses, allowing viruses to enter the body with ease.
But so far, Baguio is safe from the dreaded coronavirus.
Department of Health-Cordillera (Kagawaran Ng Kalusugan - Cordillera) Infectious Disease Cluster Head Dr. Jennifer Joyce Pira said that there are no persons under investigation (PUI) with regards to the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).
Pira said the DOH-CAR only monitored an individual who arrived from Guangzhou, China but has no history of travel to Wuhan, China and without any known contact with a confirmed 2019-nCoV case. The person also has no known contact with individuals with severe acute respiratory illness or sick animals.
She said that although the individual and two of his roommates are under quarantine, they are all doing well and show no signs of illnesses.
The DOH-CAR stressed that there are no cases of 2019-nCoV in the Cordillera region to date. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – A day after the Department of Health (DOH) confirmed the Philippines' first case of novel coronavirus, the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) called on all local government units (LGUs) to create their respective task forces to help contain the spread of the virus.
""All LGUs nationwide are advised to create their respective task forces to implement DOH protocols and guidelines and extend full cooperation to the DOH and other government agencies to meet the world health emergency,"" DILG Undersecretary Jonathan Malaya said in a statement on Friday, January 31.
Malaya said Interior Secretary Eduardo Año was prompted to give the directive after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared an international emergency in relation to the novel coronavirus outbreak that has killed 212  people in China alone as of Friday.
The DILG said the task force will be led either by the governor or the mayor, who will ensure that local health personnel have the necessary equipment and protective gear.
The task force will also handle the referral and transport of constituents suspected of  2019-nCoV infection to a DOH-designated hospital.
Local chief executives,  in coordination with the DOH, are also expected to train health workers on 2019-nCoV prevention, containment, and control. LGUs must also conduct information campaigns on the virus in their areas.
The DILG said that LGUs hosting international airports must coordinate with the Bureau of Immigration and airport authorities to ensure the implementation of quarantine procedures. 
LGUs are expected to cooperate with the DOH in the latter's contact-tracing of individuals who encountered a confirmed 2019-nCoV patient.
""The mayor should immediately inform the DOH should there be reasonable basis to place an individual under quarantine. The DOH needs the support of all LGUs in this important matter and local and police authorities should extend all possible assistance in this regard,"" Malaya said.
On Friday, the WHO declared a public health emergency of international concern, citing ""potential for the virus to spread to countries with weaker health systems.""
In the Philippines, President Rodrigo Duterte imposed a ban on travelers from Wuhan City – the epicenter of the outbreak – and the rest of Hubei province, China, which would last until the 2019-nCoV threat was over.
Other countries have taken their own precautionary measures to stem the disease. Russia had shut its border with China and would stop issuing electronic visas to Chinese nationals. A number of airlines had either halted or reduced flights to China.
The public is advised to practice proper hygiene and coughing etiquette, including constant washing of hands and coughing into the crook of the elbow. ('Novel coronavirus or 2019 nCoV: What we know so far) – Rappler.com "

BATANGAS, Philippines – Vice President Leni Robredo urged President Rodrigo Duterte’s administration to take “immediate action” on recommendations to impose a travel ban on all tourists coming from mainland China as the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a global health emergency  on the novel coronavirus or 2019-nCov.
On Friday, January 31, Robredo said the government should not waste time in ensuring Filipinos are safe, especially after the World Health Organization declaring an international emergency over the deadly new disease. 
“Wala na tayong panahon para sa mahabang usapan. Buhay ng tao ang nakasalalay kaya agarang aksyon, tamang impormasyon at mabilisang desisyon ang kailangan,” the Vice President said.
(We should not waste time by holding long discussions. The lives of people are at stake here, so immediate action, the right information, and fast decision-making are needed.)
As of Friday, the number of confirmed deaths from the coronavirus outbreak has risen to 212  after worst-hit Hubei province reported 42 new fatalities. (READ: What we know so far on the novel coronavirus)
Robredo cited several recommendations to respond to the new disease, including a temporary travel ban on all Chinese mainlanders as well as putting in place the necessary support system for Filipinos in areas with recorded cases, including possible evacuation procedures.
“Bawat minutong ipapagbukas pa ang pag-aksyon sa mga rekomendasyong ito, lalong nailalagay sa panganib ang kapakanan at kalusugan ng ating mga mamamayan,” Robredo said. 
(Every minute we spend delaying actions on these recommendations means further risking the well-being and health of our people.)
What now?
Philippine lawmakers have already urged the government to issue a temporary travel ban to and from China. The country has only temporarily stopped issuing visas to travelers from Hubei, China, the epicenter of the novel coronavirus that has so far killed 212 people there.
The government is calling for the repatriation of Filipino workers in China. On Thursday, January 30, the governor of Iloilo province called on Cebu Pacific airline to stop its flights from Hong Kong to the province's international airport. Boracay Island is considering  a ban on tourists from China. 
But WHO's emergency committee, an advisory body of international experts, said in a statement that evidence had shown that restricting movement of people and goods during public health emergencies ""may be ineffective and may divert resources from other interventions."" 
""Further, restrictions may interrupt needed aid and technical support, may disrupt businesses, and may have negative effects on the economies of countries affected by the emergencies,"" the committee said.
Asked about the proposed travel ban involving China, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said on Wednesday, January 29, that it would be “very tricky” if the Philippines only imposes it on the neighboring giant, as other countries have recorded cases of the novel coronavirus as well.
A day after Duque’s statement before the House, he confirmed the country’s first case of the 2019-nCov: a 38-year-old Chinese national who flew to Cebu, then Dumaguete in the Philippines from Wuhan City, Hubei’s capital. 
She was later admitted at a government hospital in Manila on January 25, though she was no longer showing symptoms. 
Robredo said on Friday that this health crisis means Filipinos need, now more than ever, a government that would prioritize health.
“Sa panahon ng krisis, dapat makaasa ang taumbayan sa kanyang pamahalaan na walang aaksayahing oras para unahin ang kanilang kapakanan,” she said.

'MINIMAL' ECONOMIC EFFECT. Chinese nationals arriving from Guangzhou are seen wearing face masks at the arrival area of the Ninoy Aquino International Airport in Pasay City. File photo by Ben Nabong/Rappler 
MANILA, Philippines – The government's economic managers are confident that the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) scare would have a minimal impact on Philippine growth.
Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III downplayed the possible effects of the 2019-nCov on the economy, saying that the Philippines has not been widely affected by the virus. (READ: Philippines confirms 1st case of novel coronavirus)
""We are a big enough economy that can handle this thing. We are not going into recession because of it,"" Dominguez said.
Socioeconomic Planning Secretary Ernesto Pernia, meanwhile, said the effect on tourism would be ""short-term.""
The Philippines has so far suspended visa upon arrival for Chinese tourists and businessmen, and temporarily stopped issuing visas to travelers from the Chinese province of Hubei. Wuhan, the city where the virus originated, is in Hubei.
There are strong calls to impose a temporary ban on all travel to and from China.
While the Philippine officials said the health scare would not make much of a dent in the economy internally, they acknowledged that it could be among the external factors that may affect growth in the medium term.
The economic team, composed of Dominguez, Pernia, and Budget Secretary Wendel Avisado, met on Thursday to discuss the country's economic performance and to ""forge a strategy"" to achieve the gross domestic product (GDP) growth target of 6.5% to 7.5% in 2020.
Aside from the 2019-nCov, the economic team identified the slowdown in global economic growth, lackluster recovery in trade, protectionist policies, and volatile oil prices, among others, as possible primary downside risks externally.
On the domestic front, the economic team said natural hazards, African swine fever, water supply disruptions, slow implementation of infrastructure projects, and policy ""uncertainties"" – such as the delayed passage of tax reform packages – could hinder the economic growth trajectory in the medium term.
They also said that the implementation of the Supreme Court ruling increasing local government units' share of national taxes may hinder growth, citing inefficient spending by LGUs.
Because of the risks, Dominguez said infrastructure agencies should accelerate the implementation of priority projects.
He added that the agriculture sector should grow at least 2% annually. In 2019, agriculture posted the slowest growth among major sectors at 1.5%.
Digital trade, speeding up the rollout of the 3rd major telecommunications player, and addressing regulatory issues in the e-commerce industry, among others, were seen as part of strategies to address the risks to economic growth.
The Philippines missed its GDP growth target in 2019, growing by 5.9% – the slowest in 8 years.
The economic team largely attributed that to the delayed passage of the national budget, which had stalled infrastructure projects. – Rappler.com "

On Thursday, January 30, Filipinos expressed their dismay over the Philippine government’s refusal to ban travels to and from mainland China. This, after the Department of Health (DOH) confirmed the Philippines’ first case of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).
During the House of Representatives’ question hour on Wednesday, January 29, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III explained that the government is not yet considering imposing a travel ban on tourists coming from mainland China because “confirmed cases are not limited to China.”
“If we do this, then the concerned country – China in this case – might question why we’re not doing the same for all other countries that have reported cases of the new coronavirus. It’s very tricky… but we commit to take this into consideration,” Duque said. 
Netizens slammed the decision, saying that the government’s actions – or the lack of which – would kill Filipinos faster than the virus could.

MANILA, Philippines – As the Philippines confirmed its first case of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), senators are urging the government to issue a temporary travel ban to and from China.
In separate statements, Senate President Pro-Tempore Ralph Recto, senators Risa Hontiveros, Joel Villanueva, and Christopher ""Bong"" Go supported the call.
Hontiveros proposed a temporary travel ban of at least 30 days on all individuals traveling from China, as well as travellers who passed through China within the past two weeks.  (READ: ’Novel coronavirus’ or 2019 nCoV: What we know so far)
""Our travel ban must firmly include both air and sea travel to prevent a local outbreak. This includes a temporary ban on all cruise ships from docking at any of our ports,"" Hontiveros said.
Recto questioned why the Philippines has yet to implement a travel ban, saying that Hong Kong, a special administrative region of China, had already announced plans to slash cross-border travel.
""I think it is time to put a temporary 'Do not enter sign' on our doorstep for visitors from China. Let us explain to them that we are not permanently closing our doors. This is not a permanent Great Wall. This is only during the duration of the coronavirus crisis,"" Recto said.
""If many of their (Chinese) people are not allowed to travel from Point A to B in China, then why are we allowing travel from most points in China to all points in the Philippines?"" Recto added.
The Senate president pro-tempore said that this was not an issue of racism.
""There is no hint of racism or xenophobia in this policy. This is an assertion of the national wellbeing. And an acceptance of the fact that our defenses and capacity to respond to a health emergency is not that strong,"" Recto said.
Go, meanwhile, said that he supports the call for a travel ban but will wait for the recommendation of health officials. Go, the Senate health committee head, will hold a hearing on the novel coronavirus on Tuesday, February 4.
""Antayin lang natin ang kanilang rekomendasyon. Kung sakali, pabor ako diyan para maiwasan po itong pagkalat. (Let's wait for their recommendation. If ever, I am in favor of this call to prevent it from spreading),"" Go said in an interview with Radyo Pilinas.
Deployment to China
Villanueva, the Senate labor committee chairperson, urged overseas Filipino workers to postpone their deployment to China to minimize the risk of getting affected.
For those already in quaratined areas in China, Villanueva said: ""Please follow the health protocol being observed in the area. Help our diplomatic staff there by notifying your status so that every Filipino is accounted for.""
Villanueva also urged the Department of Labor and Employment to issue a labor advisory that would remind private companies of their obligations with labor standards, particulary the Occupational Safety and Health Standards law.
""Our labor officials should seize the moment to reiterate that the health and safety of our workers must be of paramount concern to employers. Our OSHS law states this principal clearly and unequivocally,"" Villanueva said.
Health Secretary Francisco Duque III on Thursday, January 30, announced the first confirmed case of 2019-nCoV in the country. The patient is a 38-year-old woman who traveled from Wuhan, China, the ground zero of the outbreak, via Hong Kong, on January 21. 
The virus has claimed 170 lives in China and infected thousands of people in that country alone.  Travel to and from Wuhan had been restricted, as the government halted the issuance of visas to travelers from Hubei province.
The Philippines on Tuesday, January 28 had already suspended visa upon arrival for Chinese visitors due to health threat. The Civil Aeronautics Board had also suspended all airline operations between Wuhan and any destination in the Philippines. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – The Philippine Stock Exchange index (PSEi) continued to slip on Thursday, January 30, as concerns surrounding the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) lingered globally.
The bellwether PSEi lost over 69 points or 0.9% and fell to 7,392. This is the PSEi’s new one-year low since December 26, 2018. 
Net foreign selling at the local stock market stood at -$10.1 million after the -$6.9 million registered on Wednesday, January 29.
Note that the local bourse closed ahead of the Department of Health's announcement of the first case of the 2019-nCoV in the Philippines. (READ: Novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV: What we know so far)
The peso also weakened to P50.96 to $1 on Thursday, the weakest in a week and among the weakest in 3 weeks.
Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation chief economist Michael Ricafort attributed the depreciation to ""increased global risk aversion"" of investors to most Asian currencies due to the novel coronavirus cases.
Ricafort said the following businesses are likely to take a hit due to the coronavirus scare:

Travel
Tourism
MICE (meetings, incentives, conventions, exhibitions)
Airlines
Hotels and accommodation
Leisure
Entertainment
Gaming and casinos
Restaurants
Catering
Retail trade

However, Ricafort noted that the Philippine economy is less dependent on foreign tourism as the main source of economic growth. 
""Thus, the adverse effects of any slowdown in tourism business due to the coronavirus, especially if temporary and eventually contained, could have less or minimal impact on the local economy or GDP (gross domestic product) growth compared to other ASEAN or Asian countries that are more dependent on tourism and exports as major contributors to their respective economies or GDP,"" Ricafort said.
The novel coronavirus is expected to hit the global economy, especially China. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – Health Secretary Francisco Duque III confirmed that the Department of Health (DOH) now has the capability to test samples for the novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV, no longer needing to send them to Australia for confirmation.
The primer needed to identify if suspected cases are positive for 2019 nCoV have been acquired from Japan, Duque said during a question hour before the House of Representatives on Wednesday, January 29. (WATCH: House question hour with health chief Duque on novel coronavirus)
The primer will allow the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM), the health department’s research arm, to determine ""within 48 hours"" whether samples from persons under investigation are positive for 2019-nCoV, which has infected over 6,000 in China and beyond, and killed over 130 in China, most of them in the city of Wuhan.
Initially, the RITM could only test samples for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the coronaviruses that caused outbreaks of SARS or severe acute respiratory syndrome and MERS or Middle East respiratory syndrome. 
The DOH had been sending samples to the Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory in Melbourne, Australia, prior to the acquisition of the 2019-nCoV primer. Duque said the 2019-nCoV primer would cut testing time “by 50%.” 
The Australian laboratory is currently processing 6 samples from the Philippines for 2019-nCoV, the results of which are expected either by Thursday, January 30, or Friday, January 31. All samples after these will be tested by the RITM.
What’s the latest on 2019-nCoV? The DOH confirmed on Wednesday, January 29, that a man under investigation for 2019-nCoV died early that day of complications due to pneumonia. (READ: 'Novel coronavirus' or 2019 nCoV: What we know so far)
The 29-year-old was a man from Yunnan, China, and had “many swollen lymph nodes,” renal warts, and was tested for HIV. The hospital director of San Lazaro Hospital in Manila, where the patient had been admitted since Monday, January 27, said the man tested positive for HIV. The DOH said it would still run tests on samples collected from the deceased patients to confirm if he had 2019-nCoV. 
Meanwhile, the government temporarily stopped issuing visas to travelers not just from Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, but also Hubei province on Tuesday night, January 28. The Department of Foreign Affairs also said it would assist all Filipinos in Wuhan who wish to be repatriated. So far, two have come home and are under self-quarantine, the DOH confirmed. 
The DOH also met with all regional health directors on Wednesday to discuss local response to the emerging threat. – Rappler.com "

San Lazaro Hospital Director Edmundo Lopez said in a news briefing that the 29-year-old man from Yunnan, China, died early Wednesday morning but stressed that he was not yet a confirmed case of 2019-nCoV. Tests would still be conducted on samples to be taken from him.
""Cause of death is pneumonia.... The patient was seen with various symptoms upon admission,"" Lopez said, when asked to confirm if one of the patients under investigation had died.
Lopez said the man was admitted to San Lazaro Hospital in Manila on Monday, January 27. Upon admission, Lopez said the man had ""many swollen lymph nodes,"" renal warts, and was tested for HIV.

PROTEST. Residents and local leaders ask the Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority to temporarily ban the arrival of cruise ships in Subic. All photos from Randy Datu/Rappler 
ZAMBALES, Philippines – The Subic tour of cruise ship MV World Dream was canceled due to intense pressure from residents and local leaders for the Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority (SBMA) to temporarily stop accepting cruise ships amid the novel coronavirus scare.
The cruise ship from China arrived in Manila on Tuesday, January 28, and its 778 passengers were ""authorized to travel"" by the Bureau of Quarantine.
Scheduled to arrive in Subic on Wednesday, January 29, the ship instead decided to cancel its arrival and head back to Hong Kong.
In a January 28 letter, Olongapo Mayor Rolen Paulino Jr urged SBMA Chairman and Administrator Wilma Eisma to ""temporarily stop accepting cruise ships until the (novel coronavirus) threat has been controlled.""
He cited the ""uncertainty and lack of information"" on the novel coronavirus, the virus that originated from Wuhan, China, and has so far killed at least 106 and sickened thousands across China and several other countries. 
Paulino also noted that ""infected persons do not manifest any of its symptoms until much later.""
He said temporarily stopping cruise ships from docking in Subic ""would not be unprecedented considering that various cities worldwide have implemented lockdowns in response to this disease.""
'Loss of income'
The night before, Eisma issued a statement that said, ""I have personally discussed the Subic situation with Health Secretary Francisco Duque today and confirmed to him that safety protocols are in place at the Port of Subic.""
""He advised that there is not a need just yet to stop the entry of cruise ships in Subic in view of established safety measures in the Freeport,"" she added. 
The SBMA initially highlighted the supposed loss of income that could occur if the arrival of cruise ships was rejected, but this only angered residents even more.
""As an emerging cruise ship destination in Southeast Asia, Subic expects to be adversely affected by this ongoing health emergency,"" Eisma earlier said. 
Eisma was also in the habit of asking SBMA employees to physically welcome passengers of cruise ships at the dock upon their arrival, but none were willing this time. A rumor even circulated that SBMA tourism employees would not report for work if the cruise ship was allowed to dock. 
On Tuesday, as the uproar from residents and Subic workers grew, Paulino pleaded with Eisma to ""please err on the side of caution and put primacy in the health and safety of the residents and workers of SBFZ (Subic Bay Freeport Zone) and the city and municipalities surrounding it.""
Subic Mayor Jonathan John Khonghun also sent a letter to Eisma, saying ""let us join hands to be more cautious, giving priority to the health and safety of the people in our locality.""

Backlash
It was also reported that tourism establishments in the Subic Freeport were pushing behind the scenes and working with the Subic Bay Freeport Chamber of Commerce to temporarily suspend the arrival of cruise ships.
Robert Gonzaga, president and CEO of Subic Bay Marine Exploratorium Inc (SBMEI), said in a statement: ""The SBMA has issued guidelines on how to deal with this, but they should do more to address the core issue of a temporary ban on cruise ship visits. For our part, we will refuse access to our park to cruise ship visitors if they do not comply with SBMA guidelines, and our [government's] health and safety policies."" 
SBMEI is the corporate owner and operator of Ocean Adventure, Adventure Beach Waterpark, and Camayan Beach Resort and Hotel – top attractions in the Freeport.
Gonzaga said that more important considerations should be prioritized over short-term income.
""We have put in place several measures to protect our guests, as well as our employees, from any health risk associated with the coronavirus. We want to reassure the public that safety comes first, last, and always for SBMEI,"" he added.
The backlash to Eisma's stance on the issue culminated in a rally in front of the main gate of the Subic Freeport, where about 200 residents and Freeport workers brandished signs that read: ""No to cruise ships in the meantime,"" ""Konting malasakit naman SBMA,"" and ""Mas mahalaga ba ang kita kesa sa kaligtasan ng mamamayan ng Olongapo?""
While the rally was ongoing, cheers went up as news broke that the MV World Dream has decided to cancel its visit to Subic.
For her part, Eisma immediately took to Facebook and posted a statement saying, in part, that the cruise visit ""has been canceled by Genting Cruise Lines, the operator of the cruise liner, in face of the circumstances on the ground.""
She said that the Subic Bay Freeport community can ""breathe a sigh of relief in the outcome that, we hope, is acceptable and satisfactory to all.""
Despite this announcement, however, the SBMA is still silent on whether or not a temporary ban on cruise ships is already in place in the Subic Bay Freeport. 
Among the groups that exerted pressure on the SBMA were Batang Gapo People's Organization Incorporated, Olongapo City local government units, Aeta leaders, all 17 barangay captains, and other people's organizations.
""Why would we put ourselves in harm's way if we can prevent it? If in their own country, they have already implemented a lockdown, why can't we do the same here?"" Barangay Gordon Heights Captain Priscilla Echie Ponge, one of the 17 barangay captains, said. – Rappler.com "

AKLAN, Philippines – Eleven Chinese tourists – 7 adults and 4 children – tracked down in a resort on Boracay Island are under medical observation by the Provincial Health Office (PHO) of Aklan for possible exposure to the novel coronavirus. 
Four of them were in close contact with an infected coronavirus patient in Hong Kong, Provincial Health Officer I Dr. Cornelio Cuachon Jr said on Tuesday, January 28.  
The 11 Chinese nationals from Hubei province were supposed to spend a one-month vacation in Boracay when Hong Kong authorities alerted the Philippine health officials to conduct intensive contact-tracing. Hubei has been on lockdown, limiting the movements of some 60 million people, since the new coronavirus broke out in its capital city of Wuhan last December.  
The tourists traveled from Hong Kong to Kalibo via Manila on January 22. Seven other Chinese people were traced by health authorities in close contacts with the 4 Chinese tourists in Boracay Island. 
It was not immediately known if the 4 Chinese who were in close contact with a confirmed case in Hong Kong were the family who landed in Manila on January 22 via Cebu Pacific, and which the Bureau of Immigration was supposed to have already tracked.  
The patients were transported to Kalibo town on Friday evening, January 24, for medical observation.  
They are staying in hotel rooms at the government-run Governor Corazon L. Cabagnot Tourism and Training Center in Old Buswang, Kalibo Old Buswang, Kalibo for the next 14 days. 
Cuachon emphasized there is still no confirmed cases of 2019-nCov in the province of Aklan and in the Philippines.   
""They had no flu-like symptoms, no cough or fever. They are made to stay at the training center because they might be at risk of hospital acquired-pneumonia if we admitted them. The 4 Chinese tourists had close contacts with one confirmed coronavirus patient in Hong Kong. The 7 other Chinese who are with these 4 in Boracay are also under medical observation,"" Cuachon said in a mix of English and Filipino. 
“We are monitoring them every day. After the 14-day incubation period, they will be allowed to go back to China, with the help of the Chinese embassy, and will have to cut short their vacation in Boracay,” Cuachon added. 
3 earlier patients discharged 
Meanwhile, the 3 patients were discharged from isolation rooms at the Dr. Rafael S. Tumbokon Memorial Hospital (DRSTMH) in Kalibo were discharged by attending doctors on January 28. 
A 6-year-old boy initially admitted in the Dr. Ciriaco H. Tirol Hospital in Boracay Island was referred to the Aklan provincial hospital on January 23 for exhibiting flu-like symptoms. 
Cuachon said the child, who had a history of travel to Wuhan in Hubei province, yielded negative results on coronavirus infection, based on tests conducted by the Philippines Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM). 
“He had influenza, not novel coronavirus,” Cuachon said. 
Sample specimens were also taken from two female siblings, aged 8 and 6, from Shanghai, China, who had been admitted to the Aklan provincial hospital on January 26. These were sent to RITM for confirmatory tests. 
In efforts to keep coronavirus from spreading, PHO-Aklan is coordinating with the Department of Health and the Bureau of Quarantine in monitoring the arrival of passengers in ports and airports in the province.
Cuachon urged the public to avoid contact with farm and wild animals, going to crowded places, and contact with sick individuals.  
On Saturday, January 25, Aklan health authorities sent back to Wuhan 80 Boracay-bound tourists. They were part of the group which left the epicenter city a few hours before it was locked down by Chinese authorities. 
Since December 2019, the Wuhan coronavirus has been reported in China, France, Australia, Vietnam, South Korea, Singapore, Nepal, Germany, Japan, Macau, Thailand, Taiwan, Malaysia, Canada, Hong Kong, United States, and Sri Lanka.
The World Health Organization said the common symptoms of novel coronavirus include cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties, and fever. – Rappler.com

Rating: FALSE 
The facts: In a press briefing on Tuesday, January 28, the Department of Health (DOH) announced that there was still no confirmed case of 2019 nCoV in the country. The patient at Asian Hospital and Medical Center in Alabang, Muntinlupa City is among the 24 persons under investigation (PUIs) for the possible 2019 nCoV infection.
The Asian Hospital and Medical Center also denied the allegations that they have a patient who was tested positive with 2019 nCoV. 

The Hi-Precision Diagnostics, a medical diagnostic center, also released a statement on its official Facebook page denying the claim. According to their post, “as of writing, no reported nor suspected Novel Coronavirus cases have been seen in any Hi-Precision Diagnostics branch nationwide.” 
Since the 2019 nCoV outbreak, many false claims about it have circulated on social media including a SARS case in Shangri-la Plaza clinic and the supposed confirmed cases of coronavirus at PBCom Tower in Makati. – Glenda Marie Castro/Rappler.com
