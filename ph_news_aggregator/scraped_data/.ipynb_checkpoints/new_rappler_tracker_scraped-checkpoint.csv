Bureau of Quarantine Central Visayas chief Dr. Terrence Anthony Bernejo said in a press conference on Monday, March 9, that currently, only passengers coming out of the domestic airport are being scanned for high fever.
As of Monday, Department of Health Region 7 head Dr. Jaime Bernadas said that there are no more patients under investigation or persons under monitoring in Central Visayas.
Cebu Governor Gwendolyn Garcia, who held an emergency meeting on the novel coronavirus outbreak on Monday afternoon, expressed concern that  none of the confirmed cases came from countries that were included in the Philippines’ travel ban.After the travel ban on mainland China and special administrative regions was announced in late January, Cebu has been requiring returning Filipinos from these areas to go under quarantine.

AKLAN, Philippines – Businesses in Boracay have slashed prices by as much as 50%, just to stay open and attract local tourists as the novel coronavirus spooks the foreign market.
One can now enjoy a sumptuous buffet under P300. Some luxury hotels offer rooms for as low as P3,800 a night (before taxes) from the normal rate of P8,000 to P10,000.
Boracay is now hoping for a surge in local tourists to offset losses from the decline in foreign visitors.
Total tourists in January dwindled by 40% from 172,695 visitors to just 103,834, according to the Malay Municipal Tourism Office.
Bulk of the tourists that visit Boracay are from China. With the travel ban in place, businesses relying mostly on the Chinese market have shut down.
Domestic boost
Domestic tourists increased by 6% to 117,359 in the first two months of 2020. However, this rate is still not enough to keep businesses open.
While prices have gone down, businesses are relying on volume just to break even. So far, the strategy has not worked.
""It's probably the most empty I've seen in almost 20 years of coming to the island,"" said Nowie Potenciano, a local business owner.
He has already closed one restaurant and moved the staff there to his 5 other shops that are struggling to remain open.
""We've heard businesses ask their staff to go on leave for a large amount of time. And when they come back, they don't have long duty days either,"" Potenciano said.
""We're lucky that we haven't reached that point yet. But at the rate that it has been going down, the situation is not looking good,"" he added.

Messaging mess
The Department of Tourism is set to spend over P800 million to promote tourist destinations to countries which do not have reported cases of the novel coronavirus.
But the Department of Health (DOH) is advising the public not to go to crowded places.
What should the public really do?
Health Secretary Francisco Duque III clarified on Monday, March 9, that prior to the Philippines declaring local transmission of the virus, it was alright to visit crowded places like malls and hotels, as long as precautionary measures are in place.
He said establishments should have sufficient disinfectants and thermal machines at entry points.
However, government agencies will have to further refine their messaging and protocols now, as local transmission has been confirmed.

MANILA, Philippines – Senior management of budget airline Cebu Pacific voluntarily took a pay cut to avoid layoffs, as the novel coronavirus continues to bite into its profits.
""It's the least that can be done given the challenging situation and it's the right thing to do,"" said Cebu Pacific spokesperson Charo Logarta Lagamon in a text message to Rappler.
Lagamon did not disclose just how drastic the pay cut was, but Gokongwei-led Esquire magazine reported that officials took a 10% cut.
Cebu Pacific expects losses to reach as much as P4 billion due to travel bans and fewer bookings.
It is now relying on volume to offset losses, as it had already offered lower rates to encourage travel. (READ: Airlines grim as trade group sees potential $113-billion hit from virus)
Cebu Pacific earned P7.1 billion in net income in the 1st half of 2019, an increase of 115.7% from the same period in 2018.
In 2018, it reported a 50.6% decline in its earnings due to a ""challenging macro environment.""

MANILA, Philippines – Aviation officials announced on Monday, March 9, that payment of charges for takeoff, landing, and parking will be deferred for local airlines, as the novel coronavirus cripples the industry.
In a press briefing on Monday, Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines Director General Jim Sydiongco said the payment will be deferred for one year.
""We have considered the deferring [of] payment [for] landing and parking while the impact of COVID-19 is present, or even up to a year. Deferment or payable after one year,"" Sydiongco said, referring to the disease caused by the virus.
""Our timeline is, we look at it up to a point of a year of deferment, and payment after one year,"" he added.
Manila International Airport Authority General Manager Ed Monreal clarified that the announcement does not mean waiver of fees. Guidelines will be released on the matter.
Monreal added that recovery is seen to slowly build up after the COVID-19 threat wanes.
""Kahit naman wala nang COVID-19, siyempre ang confidence kasi ng traveling public will still slowly go back. So kailangan natin tantiyahin kung kailan babalik at kailan katagal,"" he said.
(Even if the threat of COVID-19 is no longer there, of course the confidence of the traveling public will still slowly go back. So we need to consider when the demand will go up and when.)
The move would cause at least P58 million worth of deferred payments to the government per month, solely coming from the main gateway, the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA).
""We're seeing around P58 million a month in terms of expenses that cover takeoff and landing, parking, and tracking fees here in NAIA,"" Monreal said.
Despite that, Monreal explained that airports will be able to survive the deferment of fees, as it only covers local airlines.
""Meron po kaming recovery fund so we can still survive. Kasi 'di naman lahat, so we're just deferring payments for landing, takeoff, and parking. Mga terminal fee, babayad pa rin sila. So may portion pa rin to keep us afloat,"" he said.
(We still have a recovery fund so we can still survive. The deferment isn't for everything, just deferring payments for landing, takeoff, and parking. Terminal fees will still be paid. So there's still a portion that will keep us afloat.)
Sydiongco said regional airports have suffered from a 20% to 30% decrease in passengers, while Monreal said NAIA has seen around a 30% drop in passengers or about 476,000 passengers, mostly foreigners.
Monreal hopes local carriers will use their aircraft slots to boost local tourism.
The airline industry has taken a huge hit because of the virus, with flag carrier Philippine Airlines terminating some 300 employees due to losses.
As of Monday, the Philippines has had 10 confirmed cases of the virus. Of the total, 7 are confined, 2 have recovered, while a Chinese tourist died.

SBMA Chairman and Administrator Wilma T. Eisma said that the disinfection protocol will be carried out by the SBMA Public Health and Safety Department initially in all SBMA offices and public areas using agents prescribed by the Department of Health (DOH).
“We will be disinfecting SBMA offices, especially the areas and surfaces most often touched by people who do business in our offices. But we also encourage business locators and other Subic stakeholders to do the same,” Eisma said. 
“I call on all Subic stakeholders to support this measure because we all need to observe cleanliness and practice proper hygiene in face of heightened coronavirus threat in the country. We need to protect ourselves and keep the Subic community safe,” Eisma added.
On Saturday, Health Secretary Francisco Duque said that the COVID-19 alert system has been raised to Code Red sublevel 1 ""in anticipation of possible sustained community transmission,"" after the Department of Health (DOH) confirmed the first case of local transmission in the country.
 The DOH said over the weekend that the Philippines has 10 confirmed cases.
Worldwide, the death toll from the coronavirus stood at 3,803, while over 109,000 were infected across 104 countries as of Monday morning.

MANILA, Philippines – The Presidential Security Group (PSG) announced on Monday, March 9, that it will be implementing a ""no-touch"" policy between President Rodrigo Duterte and the public after health officials reported additional cases of the novel coronavirus in the Philippines.
PSG Group Commander Coloner Jesus Durante III made the statement in an advisory on Monday, saying the move was part of preventive measures taken to ensure Duterte and his family's safety.
Durante said that people expected to ""get near"" Duterte during events and meetings will be subject to ""thorough screening"" and will be tested for any illnesses and signs of symptoms related to COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.
""PSG...is observing these preventive measures based on the guidelines set forth by the Department of Health. PSG Troopers ask for the public’s utmost understanding and cooperation,"" Durante said.
Aside from this, the PSG announced it will also assess ""large crowd gatherings"" where Duterte is scheduled to attend as a guest of honor and speaker. Such events may be cancelled for Duterte and the wider public's safety.
Durante assured the public that health protocols and measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19 were in place and in effect for all PSG personnel and the entire Malacañang complex.
In various public addresses, Duterte, who is 74-years-old, claimed he suffered from a slew of medical conditions that include myasthenia gravis, Buerger's disease, Barrett's esophagus, and ""spinal issues,"" among others. In October 2018, Duterte also said he tested for cancer but that it came back negative.
Experts earlier said that older adults with preexisting health conditions were more vulnerable to the coronavirus, particularly those aged over 60-years-old.
The Philippines has so far recorded 10 confirmed cases of coronavirus, including the first death outside of China. Of the remaining 9, two have since recovered and left the country, while the others were being treated.
One patient, a 62-year-old man, was in ""very critical condition"" as of early Saturday morning, March 7, the DOH said. Having no recent history of travel, he is considered the first case of local transmission in the Philippines. 
Meanwhile, the health department said it has probed a total of 700 patients for possible infection, 48 of whom remain admitted in health facilities across the country while 646 have already been discharged.

MANILA, Philippines – The government of Cook Islands is prohibiting travelers from the Philippines and 13 other countries from entering its borders due to the outbreak of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. 
“We also have information that the Cook Islands has also restricted travel from certain COVID-affected countries,” said Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) Assistant Secretary Eduardo Meñez, in a press conference in Malacañang on Monday, March 9.
As he was speaking, the DFA official flashed a presentation listing Cook Islands among the foreign countries that have imposed travel restrictions on the Philippines. The others are Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Qatar.  
Apart from the Philippines, Cook Islands is also imposing a travel ban on passengers who have been to the following countries within the last 14 days:

China and its administrative regions Hong Kong and Macau
Taiwan
 Japan
Singapore
South Korea
Malaysia
Thailand
Indonesia
Vietnam
Cambodia

Cook Islands, an associate state of New Zealand, is a self-governed island country located in the South Pacific Ocean. 
In the same press conference, Meñez announced that two Filipinos tested positive for 2019-nCoV in Lebanon, increasing the total number of Filipinos who caught the virus outside the Philippines to 91.  
Locally, the Philippines has reported 10 positive cases so far, including 5 Filipinos, 3 Chinese, one Taiwanese, and one American. One of the 3 Chinese patients died, but the other two have already recovered from COVID-19.

ECONOMIC IMPACT. A shopper wears a mask at the Greenhills Shopping Center in San Juan City. Photo by Inoue Jaena/Rappler  
MANILA, Philippines – The novel coronavirus is seen to spoil the Philippines' economic growth rate in 2020, said Socioeconomic Planning Undersecretary Rosemarie Edillon, which would make the country miss its target.
Speaking at the Senate inquiry on the economic impact of the virus, Edillon said on Monday, March 9, that it may bring down the gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate to the range of 5.5% to 6.5% this year.
""Kung ang target natin (If our target) is 6.5% to 7.5%, then we're looking at 5.5% to 6.5% for the year,"" Edillon said.
Senator Imee Marcos, chairperson of the Senate committee on economic affairs, said the upper-range estimate of the government's economic team may not be feasible anymore.
""Wala na 'yung 6.5%, 5.9% sabihin na lang natin. 'Wag na tayo magtawaran sa numero, masakit sa bulsa 'yan,"" Marcos said.
(6.5% is unrealistic, let's just say 5.9%. Let's not bargain on the numbers, it will hurt our coffers.)
The economic team previously projected that growth would be slashed by 0.2% if the virus would not be contained within a quarter, and up to 0.4% if it drags on until the 1st half of the year.
If China continues to be crippled by the outbreak until June, the Philippine economic team estimates that around 30,000 to 50,000 jobs in manufacturing and tourism would be lost.
The Philippine economic team also expects around 1.42 million tourist arrivals lost, which would amount to foregone gross value added (GVA) of around P93 billion to P187 billion. GVA is the value of goods and services produced in a sector or municipality that contributes to the economy.
Besides that, Edillon said the country may face a wider fiscal deficit of 3.3% to 3.4% of GDP, or equivalent to around P680 billion, higher than the current cap of 3.2%. (READ: [ANALYSIS] How the budget deficit exploded under Duterte's watch)
The deficit ceiling was initially raised to 3% from the Aquino administration's 2%, when the Duterte administration pushed for infrastructure growth. The cap was later revised to 3.2% in 2019.
The Philippines has had 10 confirmed cases of the virus. Of the total, 7 are confined, 2 have recovered, while a Chinese tourist died.

MANILA, Phlippines (UPDATED) – President Rodrigo Duterte declared a state of public health emergency on Monday, March 9, after health officials recorded additional cases of the 2019 novel coronavirus, including the first case of local transmission in the Philippines.
In Proclamation No. 922 signed on Sunday, March 8, and released to media on Monday, Duterte ordered all government agencies and local government units to cooperate and mobilize necessary resources to combat the coronavirus.
Duterte's declaration was based on the recommendation of Health Secretary Francisco Duque III, who earlier raised the Philippines' coronavirus alert system to Code Red-Sublevel 1, due to the first case of local transmission.
Duque earlier said that a state of public health emergency ""will facilitate the mobilization of resources, ease processes including procurement of critical logistics and supplies, and intensify reporting and quarantine measures.""
The Philippines has so far recorded 10 confirmed cases of coronavirus, including the first death outside of China. Of the remaining 9, two have since recovered and left the country, while the others were being treated. One patient, a 62-year-old man, was in ""very critical condition"" as of early Saturday morning, March 7.
The 62-year-old patient, who was reported to frequent a Muslim prayer hall in Barangay Greenhills, is the considered the first case of local transmission in the Philippines.
What to expect: Under a state of public health emergency, Health Assistant Secretary Maria Rosario Vergeire earlier said patients suspected to have the novel coronavirus could face sanctions if they refuse to undergo quarantine.
""Itong (This) state of public health emergency would give the government more authority with regards to this procedure,"" she said.
In the proclamation, Duterte said Duque ""may tap the Philippine National Police and other law enforcement agencies to assist in responding to the outbreak.”
Duterte also urged all citizens, residents, tourists, and business owners to “act within the bounds of the law” and comply with advisories issued by the government to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. 
Duque earlier said that the government was conducting intensified contact tracing, while health officials were preparing for ""possible sustained community transmission.""
""Once there is sustained community transmission or increasing number of local cases whose links cannot be established, the strategy will be shifted from intensive contact tracing, to the implementation of community level quarantine or lockdown and possible suspension of work or school,"" Duque said.
As of Monday, the DOH has probed a total of 700 patients for possible infection, 48 of whom remain admitted in health facilities across the country while 646 have already been discharged.
Meanwhile, at least 89 Filipinos outside the Philippines have contracted the virus since the outbreak began. This included 4 cases in Hong Kong, 80 from a cruise ship docked in Japan, 3 in Singapore, and 2 in the United Arab Emirates. 
As of Sunday, March 8, 40 Filipinos from the cruise ship,1 in Singapore, and 2 in Hong Kong have since recovered.

MANILA, Philippines – Department of Health (DOH) Secretary Francisco Duque III confirmed that the 4 new patients who tested positive for the novel coronavirus are all admitted in private hospitals across Metro Manila.
In an interview with CNN Philippines on Monday, March 9, Duque said that the 4 positive cases are currently admitted in the following cities:

38-year-old Taiwanese male (7th case): Makati Medical Center in Makati City
32-year-old Filipino male (8th case): St Luke’s Medical Center in Taguig City
86-year-old American male (9th case): Medical City-Ortigas in Pasig City
57-year-old Filipino male (10th case) St Luke’s Medical Center in Quezon City

Only patients deemed by doctors as “severe” cases of 2019-nCoV would  be referred to the government’s official referral hospitals like the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) in Muntinlupa City, the Lung Center of the Philippines in Quezon City, and the San Lazaro Hospital in Manila, said DOH Assistant Secretary Maria Rosario Vergeire in a press conference on Monday.
Quezon City Mayor Joy Belmonte said in a speech at city hall on Monday morning that a coronavirus-positive patient is hospitalized in the city’s 1st District.
Vergeire clarified that the patient Belmonte mentioned was among the 10 cases already announced by the Health Department. 
Marikina City Mayor Marcelino Teodoro also confirmed in a statement that the 86-year-old American male is a resident of the city.
Vergeire reminded the public that only persons exhibiting flu-like symptoms after traveling to countries with 2019-nCoV cases or being exposed to confirmed cases should be tested for possible infection.
She explained that the coronavirus symptoms like cough and colds are similar to the symptoms of the common flu. Vergeire said that people who have not been exposed to a positive patient are “at very low risk” of getting COVID-19, the disease caused by 2019-nCoV. 
“But for those people who exhibit signs and symptoms like fever, sore throat, cough and colds without any history of travel at all to those affected areas or without history of known exposure to those positive cases, they don’t need to worry. They [should] just monitor themselves and if symptoms progress, they can consult their doctor. But they are the ones at [ a ] very low risk of contracting this disease,” Vergeire said.
The Philippines now has 10 confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV , including 5 Filipinos, a Taiwanese, an American. The country’s first 3 cases were all Chinese, one of whom died while the other two have already recovered from COVID-19.
The country has also recorded its first local transmission of COVID-19 after a 62-year-old Filipino man with no travel history outside the Phililppines infected his 59-year-old wife. The couple is the country’s 5th and 6th positive cases.
President Rodrigo Duterte is set to issue on Monday an Executive Order formally declaring a state of public health emergency, under which patients suspected to have 2019-nCoV will be required to undergo the 14-day quarantine period. 
The DOH has probed a total of 700 patients for possible infection, 48 of whom remain admitted in health facilities across the country while 646 have already been discharged.
Worldwide, the novel coronavirus has infected more than 109,800 people and killed 3,803, with most deaths still being recorded in Hubei, China, the epicenter of the outbreak. Still, over 60,700 have already recovered from COVID-19. – Rappler.com

MANILA, Philippines – Following the confirmation of the first local transmission of the novel coronavirus in the country, Vice President Leni Robredo called on the government to be ""very transparent"" in its response.
In her radio show on Sunday, March 8, Robredo stressed the importance of transparency to dispel speculations such as alleged ""underreporting"" of the number of COVID-19 cases. (READ: DOH confirms 6th coronavirus case in PH)
The Vice President noted how other countries have responded to the outbreak.
""So marami nang best practices na nakikita, na sana iyon iyong sinusundan natin. Iyong transparency, nakakataas ng tiwala ng tao sa pamahalaan, so sana...sana maging very transparent. Sana walang pagduda iyong taumbayan na mayroong mga information na hindi 'sinisiwalat,"" said Robredo.
(So there are many best practices observed, and I hope these are the ones we're following. With transparency, the public would better trust the government, so I hope [the government] would be very transparent. I hope there would be no doubts from the public anymore that some information are being hidden.)
The Vice President also said the government should have promptly released guidelines as soon as the first local transmission was confirmed.
After the Department of Health (DOH) confirmed the first case of local transmission on Saturday, March 7, Duterte agreed to the DOH's recommendation to declare a state of public health emergency. This declaration has yet to be issued as of Sunday.
Robredo also noted that as early as February 21, the DOH had already recommended the declaration of a state of public health emergency once local transmission is confirmed.
""Noong ni-request sana ito noong February 21, sana hinanda na, para the moment na nagkaroon ng local transmission, nilabas na kaagad,"" the Vice President said.
(When [the declaration] was requested on February 21, they should have prepared [the guidelines] so that the moment a local transmission is confirmed, it would have been released immediately.)
She explained that the guidelines would entail ""a whole-of-government approach.""
""So hopefully first thing tomorrow (Monday, March 9), lumabas na (it gets issued),"" added Robredo. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines (3rd UPDATE) – President Rodrigo Duterte has approved the recommendation of Health Secretary Francisco Duque III to declare a state of public health emergency after the Department of Health (DOH) confirmed the local transmission of COVID-19.
Senator Bong Go was the first to announce this to media on Saturday, March 7. Hours before Go made the announcement, Duque said he had recommended the issuance of the declaration to the Chief Executive in anticipation of the possible sustained community spread of the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.
""Pursuant to the recommendation of the DOH and my suggestion as Chair of the Senate Committee on Health, President Rodrigo Duterte has agreed to issue a declaration of a State of Public Health Emergency due to the confirmation of a local transmission of COVID-19 in our country,"" said Go.
Malacañang issued a similar announcement over an hour later.
""The Office of the President also notes the recommendation of the DOH to declare a State of Public Health Emergency. The said proposal has been raised to the attention of the President who has agreed to issue such declaration after considering all critical factors with the aim of safeguarding the health of the Filipino public,"" said Presidential Spokesman Salvador Panelo.
Duque announced at a news briefing that the DOH raised the conoravirus alert system to Code Red-Sublevel 1 after it ascertained that the country's 5th case of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, got infected locally as he had no history of travel abroad.
""With this Code Red, the DOH has recommended to the Office of the President for the declaration of a state of public health emergency which will facilitate the mobilization of resources, ease processes including procurement of critical logistics and supplies, and intensifying reporting and quarantine measures,"" Duque said.
The DOH raised the COVID-19 alert system as it confirmed the Philippines' 6th case of COVID-19 – the wife of the 5th case, a 62-year-old Filipino man known to frequent a prayer hall at the Greenhills shopping mall in San Juan.
Duque assuaged fears about the raising of the alert level, saying it was just ""a preemptive measure"" that served as a ""signal to all concerned agencies, local governments, health care providers to be ready to [implement] planned response measures.""
At this stage, Duque said, the government will be conducting intensified contact tracing, as well as activation of other laboratories that can diagnose COVID-19. 
""Activation of other labs outside of Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) to increase capacity to diagnose are now being implemented,"" Duque said.
But Duque said that the DOH was also preparing for ""possible sustained community transmission.""
""However, once there is sustained community transmission or increasing number of local cases whose links cannot be established, the strategy will be shifted from intensive contact tracing, to the implementation of community level quarantine or lockdown and possible suspension of work or school,"" Duque said.
""This will be implemented in municipal, city or provincial scale as maybe warranted,"" he added.
He said that if this should happen, health staff and uniformed personnel from unaffected would be tapped. – Rappler.com  "

MANILA, Philippines (3rd UPDATE) – Multinational professional services network Deloitte Philippines confirmed on Saturday, March 7, that one of its employees tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.
Deloitte Philippines, which made the statement in a  Facebook post on Saturday, said the employee was being treated at a hospital.
""The colleague is currently in hospital receiving treatment and further tests, and Deloitte is supporting the colleague and family in every way we can,"" it said.

The company said that ""the health and safety of our people, our clients, and out community is our highest priority, and our immediate response has been to take all necessary actions to manage the situation.""
""Deloitte Philippines continues to comply with the instruction and directions from the Department of Health. All necessary actions were promptly taken to inform those who might have come into contact with the colleague for the appropriate checks and provide any possible form of support,"" it added.
Close coordination
The company did not say in its statement whether the employee was one of the two new COVID-19 patients in the country but Taguig Mayor Lino Cayetano confirmed this in a Facebook post on Saturday.
Cayetano said that the patient, whose office is located in Bonifacio Global City, was put under surveillance of the City Epidemiology and Disease Surveillance Unit (CEDSU) and was admitted to RITM the following day.
“He is currently receiving treatment there and his condition is stable. We continue to monitor his medical status while our CEDSU and city officials have been in close coordination with the concerned property managers. Contact tracing and proper management are ongoing,” he said.
The patient visited Japan and returned to Manila on February 25.
The Taguig mayor also said that local government unit has been in constant communication with the DOH and has been aggressive in reinforcing a two-pronged approach of fighting the virus – through prevention and protection, and monitoring and reporting. 
“The City Government encourages everyone to source their information only from reliable channels and stay calm,” Cayetano said. (LIST: Where to get official, reliable info on novel coronavirus)
DOH reminder
The Deloitte Philippines announcement was apparently made without the knowledge of the Department of Health (DOH).
Following the announcement, the DOH reminded the public that any official announcement regarding COVID-19 cases in the country should only be made by the government, and that anyone with such information should immediately relay it to the DOH for proper handling.
""Only the Secretary of Health has the authority to release such details,"" Health Assistant Secretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said in an interview on DZMM, citing protocols observed by the government in announcing new cases.
She said the DOH is “very careful with the personal information of our patients” as provided under the Data Privacy Act.
Health Secretary Francisco Duque III reiterated this in a press briefing on Saturday, saying that any official announcements on COVID-19 cases in the country should come from the DOH, and urged those with such information to coordinate with the department.
“Our objectives for sharing information are two-pronged: ensure the public's health and safety by facilitating contact tracing and ensure that the individual’s right to privacy is not impinged. Hence, we appeal to all to coordinate closely with the Department of Health when disseminating information to the public and within their respective institutions,"" he said.
""Let us make sure the information sharing process will yield the utmost benefit, and avoid unnecessary stress and stigma to individuals and institutions. The DOH commits to be more circumspect in reporting confirmed cases, to balance interests of public health and privacy. To this end only pertinent information necessary to facilitate contact tracing will be provided to the public, i.e. activity, location and time, if available,"" he added.

MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – The first batch of Filipinos who were repatriated from Macau arrived in Manila late Saturday afternoon, March 7.
A total of 163 ""stranded and distressed"" Filipinos arrived at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport Terminal 1 via a chartered Air Macau flight that landed  at around 4:30 pm on Saturday.
The Department of Foreign Affairs earlier announced that 167 Filipinos were due to arrive, but the total number was 163, composed of 130 adults, 5 children, and, 28 Overseas Workers Welfare Administration members.
Upon arrival at the airport, the repatriates were given a health briefing to guide them on their 14-day self-quarantine. Some of the pointers include wearing a mask when talking to others, disposing of the used mask properly after 8 hours of use, and alerting barangay health workers if they experience any flu symptoms such as cold, cough, and fever.
They also received financial assistance from the government.
The Macau repatriates were among the first batch repatriated from the area amid the continued global spread of the 2019 novel coronavirus. The Philippine government had been coordinating with the Macau government for their return after travel restrictions resulted in lack of direct flights back to Manila.
Health Assistant Secretary Maria Rosario Vergeire earlier said repatriated Filipinos will not be brought to the New Clark City (NCC) in Capas, Tarlac, for quarantine upon landing since they will be subject to home-based quarantine and considered persons-under-monitoring. The DFA gave assurances that all Filipinos coming from Macau were asymptomatic.
Despite this, the DFA said that if some displayed symptoms of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new virus, ""they will be immediately brought to a medical facility for further investigation and treatment if necessary.""
Filipinos repatriated from Macau will comprise the 3rd batch of Filipinos returning to the country as COVID-19 cases of continued to increase worldwide.
The DFA, along with officials from the Department of Health, repatriated on Februrary 9, 30 Filipinos from from China’s Hubei province, the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak. On February 25, a total of 445 Filipinos also returned home from the coronavirus-hit  M/V Diamond Princess cruise ship from Japan.
The Philippines has recorded 5 confirmed cases of coronavirus, including the first death outside of China. Of the remaining 4, two have since recovered and left the country, while the other were being treated. One was in ""very critical condition"" as of early Saturday morning.

MANILA, Philippines – The Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) on Saturday, March 7, urged all Filipinos to postpone upcoming trips to the Holy Land “until further notice” as the 2019 novel coronavirus continues to spread worldwide. The DFA issued the travel advisory as it announced that the Palestinian Authority was implementing a temporary ban prohibiting the entry of tourists to the West Bank, Bethlehem, and Jericho. The sites are among those frequented by tourists and hold significance for participants of prayer pilgrimages. The DFA advised also the public to take note that the Israeli government is implementing measures to restrict all travels to Bethlehem from Israel. “Prospective travelers are therefore advised to coordinate with their tour operators to avoid any inconvenience,” DFA said in an advisory.Israel and the Palestinian Authority are the latest to impose sweeping travel restrictions on holy sites to stem the spread of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus. The sites see thousands of tourists and pilgrims each year, as it holds significance for Jews, Christians, and Muslims. The restrictions can be likened to those recently imposed by Saudi Arabia on “umrah” pilgrims who were set to visit Islam's holiest sites. Worldwide, the COVID-19 death toll stood at over 3,400 as of Saturday, while over 101,000 people had been infected across 84 countries.

MANILA, Philippines – An elderly Filipino man who tested positive for the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is “in a very critical condition,” Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said on Saturday, March 7
Asked about the condition of the patient amid concerns that the senior citizen, who had preexisting illnesses, was more vulnerable to the new virus, Duque said in a text message to Rappler early Saturday morning, ""As of 1 am, March 7, [he] is still alive but in a very critical condition.""
The 62-year-old man was among the two Filipinos who tested positive for the virus in the country.
Duque was citing the latest update he received from Director Celia Carlos of the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM), where the two COVID-19 patients are currently admitted. 
Even before catching COVID-19, the disease caused by 2019-nCoV, the 62-year-old male was already known to have hypertension and diabetes mellitus. 
He started experiencing cough with phlegm on February 25 and was confined at the Cardinal Santos Medical Center for severe pneumonia on March 1. His specimen was collected for testing on March 4 and he tested positive for the new virus the next day. He was then transferred to the RITM.
The senior Filipino patient had often visited a Muslim prayer room in Barangay Greenhills, San Juan City, prompting Mayor Francis Zamora to temporarily shut down the area to disinfect it.  
Though the patient had no known travel history outside the Philippines, Duque had arlier said previously said it was “premature” to describe him as the country's first local transmission of 2019-nCoV, as the government was still tracing all individuals with whom he had made contact in the past days. 
As of Saturday morning, the Philippines has reported 5 positive cases of COVID-19 – 3 foreigners from China and two Filipinos.  Of the Chinese patients, one died and the other two had recovered.

CEBU CITY, Philippines – Room occupancies in the Philippines have taken a hit due to the novel coronavirus travel bans, according to the Department of Tourism Central VIsayas.   There was about a 20% reduction in hotel occupancies across Cebu compared to the same period in 2019, the DOT-7 reported.
Shalimar Tamano, DOT-7 regional director, said on Friday, March 6, that this data does not include Air BNB properties.   Hotels in Bohol were hit even harder with a 35% reduction in hotel occupancies compared to the same period in 2019.   Some of the top visitors to the region include countries with known novel coronavirus with 37% of visitors coming from South Korea, 17.63% from China, and 12.85% from Japan. Central Visayas, home to the 2nd largest international airport in the country, received a total of 4.2 million visitors from other countries in 2019.Tourism is a sizeable contributor to the economy of Central Visayas. In 2019, tourism generated about P97 billion in revenues.   Tamano said that he expected the travel bans due to the novel coronavirus would hinder the DOT from hitting its 2020 targets.   “Best case scenario is that we can make up for the loss in the 3rd or 4th quarters,” Tamano said during Friday's press conference.   The first confirmed COVID-19 case traveled through Central Visayas, including Cebu and Dumaguete, before going to Manila.   The 26 South Koreans from virus-hit Daegu City, South Korea, were also quarantined here in Cebu.  According to national data from the Department of Tourism, the Philippines stands to lose P42 billion in revenues due to the coronavirus.
Tamano said they are continuing dialogue with the tourism sector to find short-term solutions for businesses suffering revenue losses.
Some solutions, he said, include tax breaks for hotels, special rates for regional tourists who patronize local hotels, and financial aid from the government.   “Financial aid would be the most challenging because we’re dealing with the BIR (Bureau of Internal Revenue), DBM (Department of Budget and Management), and other agencies,” Tamano said.   While the average occupancy drop was at 20% in Cebu, several higher end hotels which did not want to be named told Rappler they reported up to 40% to 60% reduction in occupancy compared to the same period in 2019.   “But the upside to this is sales and discounts for the local tourists,” the DOT-7 director said.
The Department of Health (DOH) also confirmed on Friday that two Filipinos tested positive locally for the 2019-nCoV. 
Prior to the Filipino cases, the Philippines had 3 confirmed cases who were Chinese tourists. Two of them have already recovered and the other died. As of Friday, the DOH has probed a total of 678 patients for possible infection. Of this number, only 41 remain admitted in hospitals nationwide while 634 have already been discharged. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – Afraid of losing their jobs in China, more than 600 stranded overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) appealed to the Philippine government to lift the travel ban on “safe areas” there so they could go back to work.
The government imposed the travel ban on February 2 as the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak worsened worldwide.
The virus was discovered in the city of Wuhan in China, capital of Hubei province, prompting the lockdown of several provinces, and several countries' travel ban covering the mainland and its special administrative regions.
""We wish the government to review the travel ban and start thinking about our situation. China is a big country and most of the areas have a very few new cases,"" the petitioners said in a statement. 
Reggie Medestomas, 45, who works as a brand director in a consultant firm in Shenzhen, China, started the petition. According to him, some offices in China – which have few recorded cases – have already resumed normal operations.
“Ang office namin nag start na ulit normal operations last February 24. ‘Yung position ko kasi ay kailangan na nandoon ako. Kapag hindi ako makabalik agad, baka mawalan na ako ng trabaho,” he added. 
(Our office has resumed normal operations last February 24. My position in the compnay requires me to be physically there. If I won’t be able to return to China immediately, I might lose my job.)
‘No work, no pay’
As the total ban in mainland China remains in place, OFWs with contracts there worry about making both ends meet, especially since most of them are in a “no work, no pay” arrangement with their employers.

“Ang amortization ko sa bahay buwan-buwan at tution ng mga bata ang magiging problema ko sa mga susunod na buwan (My monthly house amortization and my children’s tuition fees would be a problem in the next months),” said Medestomas. 

The Overseas Workers Welfare Administration (OWWA) has provided P10,000 to each OFW who was supposed to travel back to mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau, but was instead stranded in Manila airports after the announcement of the travel ban. 
The amount, according to the petitioners, is not enough. “Dumadami ang expenses pero wala naman kami income. Wala naman provision ang gobyerno na tutulungan kami sa mga pangangailangan namin habang andito kami (Our expenses are piling up, but we have no source of income. The government has no provision in helping us for our needs while we're here in the Philippines.),” Medestomas said. 
Asked for his message to the government, Medestomas said: “Hayaan lang kami na bumalik kasi may assurance naman na ang employer namin na kami ay iingatan kami kasi part kami ng organization nila.”
(Allow us to go back to China because our employers assured us that they would take care of us since we are part of their organization.) 
On February 18, the Philippine government’s Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID) allowed OFWs to return to their jobs in Hong Kong and Macau. This was after some 25,000 stranded OFWs and Hong Kong residents organized themselves and urged the government to exempt them from the ban. 
Medestomas told Rappler that Migrante International will be organizing a press conference on Monday, March 9, to urge the government to allow OFWs to return to “safe areas” in mainland China. 
Over 80,500 have been infected by 2019-nCoV in mainland China as of Friday, March 6. A total of 3,042 have died from COVID-19 – the disease caused by the virus – nationwide.
The Department of Health (DOH) also confirmed on Friday that two Filipinos tested positive for the 2019-nCoV locally. 
Prior to the Filipino cases, the Philippines had 3 confirmed cases who were Chinese tourists. Two of them have already recovered and the other died. 
As of Friday, the DOH has probed a total of 678 patients for possible infection. Of this number, only 41 remain admitted in health facilities nationwide while 634 have already been discharged. – Rappler.com "

Since the outbreak began, at least 88 Filipinos outside the Philippines have contracted the virus. These include 80 from a cruise ship docked in Japan, 3 in Singapore, 3 in Hong Kong, and 2 in the United Arab Emirates.
But 40 from the cruise ship, one in Singapore, and two in Hong Kong have since recovered, leaving 45 still infected as of Friday.
The World Health Organization raised its global risk assessment of the virus to the maximum level. It earlier declared the outbreak an international emergency.
The global death toll has reached 3,385, with 3,042 of the fatalities in China. The number of cases worldwide has risen to 98,123, with 80,552 of the infections in China. The virus has spread to more than 87 countries. – with reports from Agence France-Presse/Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – San Juan City Mayor Francis Zamora has temporarily shut down  the Muslim prayer hall in Barangay Greenhills that was frequently visited by a Filipino man who tested positive for the novel coronavirus (2019-nCov).
The prayer hall will be disinfected and sanitized, said Zamora in a statement around two hours after the Department of Health (DOH) confirmed two Filipinos caught the virus locally, bringing the number of confirmed cases in the Philippines to 5. 
One of the two positive cases is a 62-year-old male who often visited the Muslim prayer hall while the other is a 48-year-old Filipino who traveled to Japan.
“I have already instructed the San Juan City Health Office, with the support of the Department of Health, to immediately disinfect, sanitize, and close to the public temporarily the prayer room in Barangay Greenhills, which was frequented by a patient who lives in a municipality near Metro Manila whom the DOH has confirmed positive with coronavirus,” Zamora said.
The mayor said San Juan is working closely with the DOH to trace all the people with whom the COVID-19 patient had contact with in the past days. 
He then advised the public to exercise all safety precautions against COVID-19, the disease caused by 2019-nCoV. 
“I encourage the public to stay calm, practice proper hand washing using soap and water or alcohol, and executive proper cough etiquette. Finally, avoid going to crowded places, keeping at least a one-meter distance from other people,” said Zamora. 
The 62-year-old coronavirus patient has no known travel history outside of the country, but the DOH said it was not yet recognizing him as a positive case of local transmission in the Philippines.
In a separate statement, the Cardinal Santos Medical Center (CSMC) located in San Juan also confirmed that it had nursed the 62-year-old man before he was transferred to the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine in Muntinlupa.
""Cardinal Santos Medical Center took care of a male patient who had no history of travels or contact with those who traveled to the countries enumerated to have experienced positive COVID-19,"" the hospital management said.
The patient, who continued showing symptoms, was transferred to RITM so he could have the ""best care.""
The CSMC management then assured the public that they have taken ""all the precautionary measures"" necessary for all personnel who had been exposed to the coronavirus-positive case. None of them have shown flu-like symptoms so far.
Prior to the two Filipino cases, the Philippines previously reported that 3 Chinese nationals tested positive for COVID-19. One died, while the other two already recovered.
Three foreigners from Taiwan, Japan, and Australia also caught the virus after traveling to the Philippines. 
As of Friday, the DOH has probed a total of 678 patients for possible infection. Of that number, only 41 remain admitted in health facilities nationwide while 634 have already been discharged. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines (3rd UPDATE) – The Department of Health (DOH) confirmed that two Filipinos tested positive for the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) for the first time in the Philippines, bringing the total confirmed cases in the country to 5.
In a press conference on Friday, March 6, DOH Secretary Francisco Duque III said the 4th positive case in the Philippines is a 48-year-old male Filipino who visited Japan and returned to Manila on February 25.  
He started experiencing symptoms such as chills and fever on March 3, but is currently in a ""stable"" condition.The second new confirmed case is a 62-year-old Filipino male with known pre-existing conditions of hypertension and diabetes mellitus who started experiencing cough with phlegm on February 25. 
He sought medical consultation at a hospital in Metro Manila on March 1 and was admitted with severe pneumonia. The man frequented a Muslim prayer hall in San Juan City. 
Both cases are admitted at the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM).
This 5th case has no known travel history, but Duque said it cannot be treated as a confirmed local transmission of COVID-19 – the disease caused by 2019-nCoV – for now.“There is no transmission to speak of as of [now]. There’s only one. That’s why we’re doing contact tracing…But now it’s premature to say that there’s local transmission,” Duque said. 
Contact tracing
The DOH and concerned local government units are now tracing all the individuals the two additional confirmed cases came in contact with.
“These recent developments are significant, but we are prepared to respond to its potential consequences. Our priority is to protect our health workers and the most vulnerable populations,” Duque said. 
“We can still contain the spread of the virus in the country, which is why we are encouraging the public to practice proper handwashing, social distancing, and cough etiquette. We call on the public to be vigilant and continue doing their part in containing the disease,” he added.
Prior to the two Filipino cases, the Philippines previously reported that 3 Chinese nationals tested positive for COVID-19. One died, while the other two already recovered. 
The Philippine government has long been criticized for not testing a larger part of the population for possible infection. 
The RITM is the country’s sole laboratory accredited by the World Health Organization (WHO) to test 2019-nCoV samples. It uses a testing method that yields results within 24 to 48 hours, much slower compared to the speed of the rapid diagnostic testing (RDT) kits that countries like South Korea is using. The DOH is now eyeing 4 more hospitals across the country to be accredited by the WHO as official testing centers for 2019-nCoV.
Duque, however, still does not want to use the RDTs to expand the Philippines' testing samples, arguing these have not been accredited by the WHO yet. 
‘Wake up call’
Senator Risa Hontiveros said the latest COVID-19 cases in the country, as well as confirmed cases abroad involving people who traveled to the Philippines, should be a “wake up call” to Philippine health officials.
“This is a cause for concern and a wake-up call for our health officials. We should not give the public a false sense of security because the danger of local transmission is real,” Hontiveros said in a statement on Friday.
She urged the Doh to review its screening and testing protocols, following the latest cases.
“Parang hindi sapat (It seems that it is inadequate). DOH should intensify its monitoring and surveillance to include all travelers, not just those who come from countries with high prevalence of COVID-19,” the senator said.
“A weak health system poses a risk to public health. We need the DOH to be hawk-eyed and transparent with the public every step of the way,” she added.
Worldwide, a total of 90 Filipinos caught the novel coronavirus in the past weeks, including the two new cases recorded in the Philippines on Friday.Of this number, 80 were infected with 2019-nCoV while aboard the cruise ship Diamond Princess that was docked for days at the port of Yokohama in Japan. Another two Filipinos tested positive in the United Arab Emirates, while Singapore reported 3 cases. Another 3 Filipinos got 2019-nCoV in Hong Kong.Still, 40 of the Filipinos from Diamond Princess and one case from Singapore already recovered from the coronavirus.– Rappler.com "

DANCE CHALLENGE. A screenshot of the Department of Health's first TikTok video giving tips on how to prevent COVID-19. Photo courtesy of DOH's Facebook page 
MANILA, Philippines – The Philippine Department of Health (DOH) just opened an account on Chinese-owned video-sharing platform TikTok as part of its campaign to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which also originated from China. 
On Thursday, March 5, the DOH’s official Facebook account shared a video of 3 of its personnel dancing to the song “The Weekend” while tips on how to prevent COVID-19 – the disease caused by 2019-nCoV – flashed on the screen. 
The health department’s 6-minute TikTok video advised its viewers to wash their hands, maintain a one-meter distance from their neighbors, avoid touching their face, and follow proper cough etiquette.

The video was an instant hit among Facebook users, garnering 68,000 views and 2,300 shares as of 8:20 pm on Thursday. (READ: PH coronavirus watch: Suspected cases per region, as of March 5, 2020)
The DOH post then asked the public to “join the #covidance challenge” and follow their official TikTok account.
“DOH is officially on Tiktok! Learn protective measures against COVID-19 in this TikTok video! Join the #covidance challenge!” the post read.
The DOH is not alone in tapping the video-sharing app widely popular among teens worldwide to help stop the spread of COVID-19. The Department of Tourism has also started encouraging Filipino millennials addicted to TikTok to help address the economic impact of the novel coronavirus.  
But United States lawmakers and intelligence officials already expressed concern over TikTok’s connections with Beijing, arguing the video-sharing app could become another tool exploited by China for espionage activities. 
As of 8:30 pm Thursday, the Philippines has recorded only 3 positive cases of COVID-19, all of whom were Chinese nationals who traveled from Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak that has so far killed 2,902 people in that province alone. 
Of the 3 positive cases in the Philippines, one died while the other two already recovered. There are also 669 patients under investigation by the DOH for possible infection. Only 37 of them remain admitted to hospitals, while 629 have already been discharged.  
Worldwide, the death toll due to the coronavirus stood at over 3,200, while over 95,000 people were infected across at least 84 countries. – Rappler.com  "

MANILA, Philippines – Saudi Arabia is imposing a travel ban on tourists from countries, including the Philippines, judged to pose ""a particularly high risk"" of spreading the 2019 novel coronavirus, the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) announced late Wednesday night, March 4.
Aside from tourist visa holders, the Saudi government is also banning the entry of ""umrah"" pilgrimage visa holders to quell the spread of the virus.
The advisory follows days of confusion over the exact scope of the Saudi government's travel restrictions first implemented last February 27.
Saudi Arabia earlier announced the unprecedented decision to ban ""umrah"" pilgrims from visiting Islam's holiest sites to try to contain the spread of the coronavirus. The kingdom added it was also suspending visas for tourists visiting from countries where the new virus is a ""danger.""
But despite restrictions limited to pilgrims and tourist visas, the Philippine government sought to clarify the full scope of the Saudi government's travel ban, following reports that some Filipinos traveling to Saudi Arabia were unable to enter the country for other purposes.
Following this, the DFA said among Filipinos exempted from the Saudi government's ban are those who hold visas for the following purposes:

Employment
Work visit
Business visit
Family visit

Filipinos holding these types of visas will still be allowed entry into Saudi Arabia, the DFA said.
Aside from this, the Saudi government announced it is suspending the issuance of entry visas for the ""umrah"" pilgirms, visits to the Prophet's mosque in Medina, as well as tourist visas ""indefinitely"" due to the coronavirus crisis.
The DFA gave assurances the Philippine Embassy in Riyadh and the Philippine Consulate General in Jeddah are closely monitoring the situation and are coordinating with the concerned agencies of the Saudi government.
Filipinos on their way to Saudi Arabia who experience problems related to these travel restrictions can call the embassy at (+966-11) 482-0507, or the consulate at (+966-12) 667-0925 and (+966-12) 669-6303.
As of Wednesday night, Saudi Arabia recorded one confirmed case of the novel coronavirus.
Worldwide, the death toll due to the coronavirus stood at over 3,200 as of Wednesday, while over 93,000 people were infected across 81 countries.
The Philippines, meanwhile, earlier recorded 3 confirmed cases of coronavirus – all Chinese tourists – including the first death due outside China. The other two cases have since recovered and left the country. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said the Philippine government is working to have 4 more laboratories across the country accredited by the World Health Organization (WHO) as official testing centers for the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). 
""We are now expanding our testing capacity. We have 5 sub-national laboratories that are up for accreditation by RITM (Research Institute for Tropical Medicine). These are one in Visayas, one in Mindanao, one in Northern Luzon, and another one in Metro Manila. So we will have 5,"" Duque said in a press conference on Wednesday, March 4. 
He said specialists from the WHO are currently in the country to help set up the capacities of the following hospitals so they will soon be ready to test 2019-nCoV samples: 

Vicente Sotto Memorial Medical Center in Cebu City
Southern Philippines Medical Center in Davao City
Baguio General Hospital in Baguio City
Lung Center of the Philippines in Quezon City

The RITM – the health department's research arm – is the Philippines' sole laboratory accredited by the WHO that can test 2019-nCoV samples. But if all goes well, Duque hopes the 4 other laboratories would also get accredited within a month or two. 
""Mayroong timeline 'yan. In fact sabi sa akin parang 8 weeks. Pero sabi ko baka puwedeng 4 weeks lang. Kasi 'yung 8 weeks parang ang tagal kako, so 4 weeks. So susubukan,"" the DOH chief said. 
(We have a timeline for that. In fact I was told the process will take about 8 weeks. But I said perhaps we can do it in just 4 weeks because 8 weeks just seem too long. So we'll try.)
Currently, the RITM is running tests with primers from a referral laboratory in Japan, of which it has a limited supply. 
Duque explained the machine used in this testing method tends to yield results between 24 to 48 hours – a longer process compared to the rapid diagnostic testing (RDT) kits used by countries like South Korea to identify 2019-nCoV cases.
He then addressed criticisms hurled at the Department of Health for not testing a larger part of the population for possible infection. 
In comparison, South Korea – where a total of 5,621 people have caught the 2019-nCoV – has been testing its residents by the thousands every day, a feat the Philippines just isn't capable of doing for now.  
Duque, however, is unfazed, arguing the DOH would rather stick to a WHO-accredited process that will not yield ""false negative"" results. 
The DOH chief said he had even talked to the ambassadors of South Korea and Japan to ask if their RDTs have already been vetted by the WHO. (READ: Test kits for novel coronavirus need WHO validation before use – DOH)
""Because the last thing I want to have is a rapid diagnostic test where it might produce false negatives. Nakakatakot 'yon! I'll say negative ka (That's scary! I'll say you tested negative), then I'll let you go out, then you're really positive…. I'm not into just using RDT that has not been vetted by a third party, a credible third party,"" Duque said.  
As of Wednesday, the Philippines has recorded no local transmission of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. A total of 39 persons under investigation are still admitted to hospitals, while the other 620 have already been discharged.  
Only 3 confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV have been recorded in the Philippines, all of whom were Chinese nationals who traveled from Hubei province, the epicenter of the outbreak. One died, but the other two recovered from the disease.

MANILA, Philippines – Labor Secretary Silvestre Bello III on Wednesday, March 4, denied the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak had a severe impact on overseas Filipino workers' employment, as he asserted cases of domestic workers displaced in Hong Kong were only ""isolated"" incidents.
Bello issued the remarks in a press conference with reporters at the Department of Labor and Employment's headquarters in Manila, saying there was ""no alarming rate of unemployment to our overseas workers.""
""That’s not true, we’re not losing workers overseas except for some few requests for repatriation. Wala naman ganung (There is no) loss of work if you’re talking of Hong Kong, Japan, and even Taiwan,"" Bello said.
""There are no incidents of unemployment. There are isolated cases, but by and large, there is no alarming rate of unemployment to our overseas workers,"" he added.
At least 40 Filipino domestic workers in Hong Kong were displaced from work as of Tuesday, March 3, according to figures from the Philippine Consulate in Hong Kong, Philippine Overseas Labor Office, and Overseas Workers Welfare Administration (OWWA).
According to OWWA Administrator Hans Cacdac, 35 of the 40 were let go by their employers, who had plans to relocate from the city. Others, he added, were fired in relation to issues regarding days off.
This came after the Hong Kong City’s labor department earlier urged domestic workers not to leave their employers’ homes for their days off, saying it could reduce the risk of transmission. Some employers misunderstood the advisory as mandatory, leaving many workers unable to take days off or punished if they did.
Meanwhile, Bello downplayed challenges that may be faced by affected overseas Filipino workers when looking for new employers. He expressed confidence that many would find work as Filipino workers have become ""very indispensable.""
""We're not alarmed of any employment loss,"" he said.
Despite this, Bello assured workers the Philippine government was ready to repatriate them and provide aid in case they returned to the Philippines.
Cacdac earlier said the Philippine government was helping affected Filipino workers in filing complaints related to their right to take days off. Efforts were also being carried out to assist displaced workers in claiming settlements against their employers. – Rappler.com "

FLEXIBLE WORK. Metro Manila commuters wear face mask as protection from the coronavirus on February 3, 2020. Photo by Jire Carreon/Rappler 
MANILA, Philippines – The Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) on Wednesday, March 4, issued guidelines that employers should follow when implementing flexible working hours in response to the ongoing 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak. “The objective (of flexible working hours) is to help both employer and employees to get over the hump (caused by the coronavirus),” DOLE Undersecretary Ana Dione told reporters in a press conference on Wednesday. DOLE said implementing flexible working hours was among the measures taken by the department to avoid “outright termination of employees” or “total closure” of establishments. (READ: A mess': Coronavirus economic impact on Philippines worse than projected)According to Dione, implementing flexible working arrangements will not be mandatory for employers, who will have full say on whether or not to take such measures. “The effectivity and implementation of any of the flexible work arrangements shall be temporary in nature, subject to the prevailing conditions of the company,” DOLE said.
Why this matters. Labor group Trade Union Congress of the Philippines (TUCP) earlier estimated some 7,000 layoffs and retrenchments could take place in the next 6 months amid the growing coronavirus outbreak crisis. 
TUCP made the forecast after Philippine Airlines terminated 300 employees, citing losses incurred because of canceled flights due to coronavirus travel bans, which have severely impacted businesses. The group said other industries may follow suit and lay off non-essential workers.
Aside from flexible working arrangements, Labor Secretary Silvestre Bello said the department will also require regional and overseas labor offices to submit daily reports on workers displaced by the coronavirus outbreak. He likewise gave assurances affected workers will be provided livelihood and financial assistance.

What employers need to know. DOLE Department Advisory No. 1 series of 2020, issued on Wednesday, listed the following arrangements employers may consider:

Reduction of work hours and/or work days: Normal work hours or work days per week are reduced
Reduction of workers: Employees are rotated or alternately provided work within the week 
Forced leave: Employees are required to go on leave for several days or weeks using leave credits

Meanwhile, DOLE urged employers and employees to discuss other possible alternative work arrangements to ease the effects of loss of income on employees. Employers and employees will be responsible for administering and supervising flexible work arrangements should they opt to implement it, DOLE added. If employers and employees disagree on the interpretation of the arrangements, DOLE said differences can be tackled under the company’s grievance system.In cases where no system for dealing with grievances is in place, regional labor offices where workplaces are registered will have jurisdiction over conciliatory talks. DOLE said employers who will implement flexible working arrangements must ensure documents are kept on record as proof the measure was adopted. Employers will also need to inform regional or provincial labor offices if flexible work arrangements are adopted. – Rappler.com "

The effort is reminiscent of the Department of Tourism's (DOT) award-winning ""It's more fun in the Philippines"" campaign, where the promotions also banked on crowdsourced content to amplify its messaging.
Will President Rodrigo Duterte be featured on the campaign? Tourism officials are keeping other details of the campaign under wraps, but they said that this is a possibility.
Duterte is set to visit Boracay in March to encourage Filipinos to travel.
The Philippines stands to lose at least P42.9 billion in tourism revenues due to the threat of the novel coronavirus.
Tourist arrivals in popular destinations like Boracay, Cebu, and Bohol declined significantly in February.
The DOT will be spending P6 billion to support local tourism. 
Hotels and airlines have slashed prices just to encourage travel.
The DOT said that travelling around the country is safe, as the Philippines has not recorded domestic transmission. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines –  Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said the Department of Health (DOH) can use P530 million of its 2020 budget to help contain the spread of the novel coronavirus while waiting for Congress approval of its proposed P2-billion supplemental budget.
Duque gave the assurance in a press conference, when asked if the DOH had enough funds to sustain government efforts to stem the spread of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new virus, without a supplemental budget.
“Yes! We have enough budget. I just received a guidance from the DBM (Department of Budget and Management) during our Cabinet meeting last Monday and he (DBM Secretary Wendel Avisado) has pointed out to us that we have about close to P530 million available budget of the DOH that we can use in the meantime that we are waiting the P2-plus billion,” Duque said. 
He stressed the importance of the the DOH's requested supplemental budget, which would be used  to purchase surgical masks and personal protective equipment of some 5,000 health workers in the frontlines of the fight against the new coronavirus.
Two bills were filed at the House of Representatives seeking to give an additional P2 billion to the DOH for its campaign against COVID-19.
The House committee on appropriations has yet to approve the measures due to the ongoing power struggle in the House. Davao City 3rd District Representative Isidro Ungab was sacked as House appropriations panel chairman on Tuesday, March 3, and was replaced by ACT-CIS Representative Eric Yap. 
Under the 1987 Constitution, all bills on the national budget must first be passed by the House before they can be voted upon by the Senate.
When asked, Duque declined to comment on whether he thought the alleged coup against Speaker Alan Peter Cayetano was delaying the approval of DOH’s additional funds. 
“Wala akong inside information [tungkol sa] nagpalitan ng mga chairmanships so I don’t know how that one is affecting [our budget proposal]. But we have been writing follow-up letters,” Duque said. 
(I have no inside information about the changing of chairmanships so I don’t know how that one is affecting our budget proposal. But we have been writing follow-up letters.) 
The DOH chief planned to write a new follow-up letter addressed to Yap to expedite the approval of the  supplemental fund. 
Of the total of 662 patients probed by the DOH for possible infection, only 39 remain admitted in hospitals nationwide as of Wednesday afternoon. The other 620 patients under investigation have been discharged.

MANILA, Philippines – The Department of Tourism (DOT) will be spending some P6 billion to boost the tourism industry, which is heavily hit by the global spread of the novel coronavirus.
On Wednesday, March 4, Tourism Secretary Bernadette Romulo Puyat said the DOT's tourism resiliency program will focus on promoting domestic destinations and on assuring the public that it is safe to travel in the Philippines.
The money for the program will come from a pooled fund from various agencies.
Of the amount, P2.2 billion will be allocated for infrastructure development and expansion, which will be determined together with local government units of top tourist destinations.
P1.6 billion will be used to improve secondary airports.
Some P500 million is allocated for a sewerage treatment plant in Coron, Palawan, while P300 million will go to various projects in Puerto Galera, Oriental Mindoro.
P725 million will be used to mount tactical programs, international events, and market initiatives.
P421 million will be spent on developing new campaigns, while P467 million will be used to create ""engaging content"" tailored for countries that are not affected by the novel coronavirus.
P85 million is earmarked for orientation and emergency response protocols training.
The Philippines stands to lose at least P42.9 billion in tourism revenues due to the threat of the novel coronavirus.
Tourist arrivals in Boracay declined significantly in February, amid travel restrictions imposed to prevent the spread of the virus. From the 172,695 visitors in January, the number dwindled by 40% to 103,834.
Hotel occupancy rates have also declined by 27% in Cebu and 40% in Bohol, according to Puyat.
Aside from additional funding, Puyat said President Rodrigo Duterte is set to visit Boracay in March to encourage tourists to visit the rehabilitated island. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines  – Fifteen of the 16 Filipino repatriates from the Diamond Princess cruise ship who showed flu-like symptoms while quarantined at New Clark City (NCC) have tested negative for the coronavirus.
The Department of Health (DOH) on Wednesday, March 4, said that the 15 repatriates have already recovered from their symptoms and were asked to return to New Clark City to finish their 14-day quarantine.
 “Labing-lima po sa kanila ay nakabalik na sa New Clark City dahil ang kanilang mga test ay negative na (Fifteen of them have already returned to New Clark City because they tested negative for the disease),"" said DOH Assistant Secretary Maria Rosario Vergeire.
Vergeire said the one remaining case at NCC is experiencing diarrhea. 
The 16 repatriates are among the 538 Filipinos who had been quarantined aboard the Diamond Princess docked at the port of Yokohama, Japan, since the outbreak of the novel coronavirus, which infected a total of 763 people aboard the ship.
As of Wednesday, the DOH said it has probed into 662 cases for possible infection. Of this number, 620 have been discharged and 39 remain in hospitals. There had been 3 confirmed cases who were Chinese tourists. Two of them have already recovered and the other died. There is still no recorded local transmission in the country.
No definite time yet
Meanwhile, the DOH said that there is no definite time yet this week for the repatriation of Filipinos in Macau. The repatriates from Macau will be categorized as persons under monitoring (PUM).
PUMs are individuals who have not shown any symptoms of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), but have traveled in the past 14 days to areas with issued travel restrictions, or have been in contact with a confirmed or probable case of COVID-19.
The Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) on Tuesday, March 3, announced it will repatriate 148 Filipinos from Macau amid the continued global spread of the novel coronavirus.
The Overseas Workers Welfare Administration (OWWA) said it will repatriate 48 of its active members from the area. The repatriated Filipinos will return to the Philippines via a chartered flight, while OWWA members will arrive via one commercial flight.
The DOH said that the DFA and the OWWA will have separate repatriation intiatives. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – Half of the 80 Filipinos who caught the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) while aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship docked in Yokohama, Japan, have already recovered.
Department of Health (DOH) Assistant Secretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said that as of Wednesday, March 4, 40 out of the 80 Filipinos no longer have COVID-19, the disease caused by 2019-nCoV, and will now be allowed to go back to the Philippines.
The rest remain admitted in hospitals in Tokyo, Japan.
""'Yung sa Japan, we had a total of 80 positive cases. So sa ngayon po, 40 na lang po 'yung naka-admit sa mga different facilities or ospital sa Tokyo tapos naka-recover na 'yung 40,"" Vergeire said. 
(For those in Japan, we had a total of 80 positive cases. So now, only 40 of them remain admitted in different facilities or hospitals in Tokyo while the other 40 already recovered.) 
Of the 40 Filipinos who recovered, 21 have already been repatriated to the Philippines and are being treated as ""persons under monitoring"" by the government.
This means they are required to undergo another 14 days of quarantine at their respective homes. The DOH and the local government units where their residences are located will then regularly monitor their health during the self-quarantine period.
Another 19 Filipinos who recovered from COVID-19 are still in Japan, but their repatriation is already being processed by the Philippine government.
The Diamond Princess cruise ship carried about 3,700 people – among them 531 Filipino crew members and 7 Filipino passengers – when it reached the port of Yokohama in January.
The Japanese government then quarantined the cruise ship after an 80-year-old passenger who disembarked on January 25 in Hong Kong tested positive for the deadly virus. (READ: All crew members have left virus-hit ship in Japan – minister)
Since then, 705 cruise ship passengers and crew members of different nationalities have been found to have COVID-19, including the 80 Filipinos.
The Philippine government already repatriated another 458 Filipinos from Diamond Princess who did not catch the virus while inside the cruise ship.
They are currently finishing their 14-day mandatory quarantine period – set to end on March 11 – at the New Clark City in Capas, Tarlac, the country's designated national quarantine facility for COVID-19.
Aside from those who were aboard the cruise ship, 7 other Filipinos abroad tested positive for the virus: 2 each in the United Arab Emirates and Hong Kong, and 3 in Singapore. One of the Filipinos in Singapore has since recovered. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – As the 2019 novel coronavirus continues to spread worldwide, an increasing number of Filipino domestic workers in Hong Kong have lost their jobs after employers fired them over mounting concerns spurred by the global health crisis.
The Philippine Consulate in Hong Kong, Philippine Overseas Labor Office, and Overseas Workers Welfare Administration (OWWA) received reports some 40 Filipino domestic workers from the city were displaced as of Tuesday, March 3.
Of the 40, 35 were let go by their employers, OWWA Administrator Hans Cacdac announced on Twitter.
Why are workers losing their jobs? The reasons for firing domestic workers range form employers' supposed relocation amid slowing business operations to issues regarding days off taken by workers.
According to Cacdac, 16 out of 35 Filipinos reported being fired after employers claimed they were leaving the city, where 100 confirmed coronavirus cases have been found as of Tuesday afternoon. Among those infected were two Filipino domestic workers. 
Meanwhile, 12 of the 35 employer-initiated terminations were due to issues regarding rest days.
Hong Kong City’s labor department earlier urged domestic workers not to leave their employers’ homes for their days off, saying it could reduce the risk of transmission. But a report by the South China Morning Post, based on accounts from migrant groups, said employers have taken the suggestion too far as they misinterpreted the government’s advisory as a mandatory measure.
The situation has left many domestic workers prohibited from leaving their homes on days off, but still made to carry out work errands such as going to the market and buying supplies outside.
How did the Philippines respond? Upon hearing of reports of fired workers, Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr said he was ""deeply disgusted"" with the city, which ""begged"" the Philippines to allow domestic workers to return.
""When the West turned on China for COVID-19 I stood up for her before the vicious West at the ASEAN-COVID 19 MEETING. I said that I begged my President to let Filipino domestic workers return to their jobs in HK showing my trust in the Chinese city. This I guess is thank you,"" Locsin said.

We'll prepare for their repatriation pronto. Deeply disgusted with HK wch begged us to let domestic workers return to work. I extracted promise from Chinese ambassador that they'd be given same protection from COVID-19 as HK residents. I shoulda specified ""from Hongkongers."" https://t.co/3Ly1CHCfCm— Teddy Locsin Jr. (@teddyboylocsin) March 3, 2020

Locsin was referring to the Philippines' earlier decision to allow stranded OFWs to return to work in Hong Kong and Macau, provided they sign a declaration stating they know and understand the risks involved.
Cacdac said the Philippine government is now helping concerned overseas Filipino workers in filing complaints related to workers' rights to take days off. Efforts are also underway, he added, to assist displaced workers in claiming settlements against their employers.
Aside from this, OWWA will also provide aid to displaced OFWs who decide to permanently return to the Philippines.
Cacdac said majority of domestic workers displaced due to their employers' relocation have returned to the Philippines to await their new job visas. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – The Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) on Tuesday, March 3, announced it will repatriate 148 Filipinos from Macau amid the continued global spread of the 2019 novel coronavirus.
The Overseas Workers Welfare Administration said it will repatriate 48 of its active members from the area. The repatriated Filipinos will return to the Philippines via a chartered flight, while OWWA members will arrive via one commercial flight.
No date had been set for the arrival of the Filpinos from Macau.
In a statement on Tuesday, the Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF) on Emerging Infectious Diseases said it approved the DFA and OWWA's repatriation plans during a meeting held on Tuesday afternoon. The IATF assured the public that returning Filipinos would undergo the required screening and quarantine measures being implemented by the Philippine government.
As of Tuesday, Macau has recorded 10 confirmed cases of coronavirus. 
Filipinos repatriated from Macau will comprise the 3rd batch of Filipinos returning to the country as cases of coronavirus continues to increase worldwide.
The DFA, along with officials from the Department of Health, earlier repatriated on Feburary 9, 30 Filipinos from from China’s Hubei province, the epicenter of deadly novel coronavirus' outbreak. On February 25, a total of 445 Filipinos also returned home from the coronavirus-hit Japanese cruise ship M/V Diamond Princess.
All repatriates were placed under quarantine in the New Clark City Center in Capas, Tarlac – the Philippines' national quarantine facility for the novel coronavirus outbreak.
The Philippines earlier recorded 3 confirmed cases of the coronavirus, all Chinese tourists, including the first death outside China. The other two already recovered and have returned to China.
As of 12:10 am on Tuesday, the worldwide death toll due to the coronavirus stood at 3,048, while over 89,000 cases were recorded across 68 countries. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – The Philippine government eased restrictions on Filipino tourists traveling to South Korea, limiting the ban it imposed only to areas where the novel coronavirus outbreak is concentrated, instead of the whole country.
Presidential Spokesperson Salvador Panelo told reporters on Tuesday, March 3, that only North Gyeongsang Province, including Daegu City and Cheongdo County, are included in the travel ban.
Before leaving the Philippines, Filipinos visiting other areas in South Korea will be made to sign a declaration stating they know and understand the risks involved in traveling to the country. A health advisory pamphlet will also be given to them upon departure.
""The IATF (Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases) has resolved to partially lift travel restrictions to South Korea as their government has implemented stringent infection control measures to contain the spread of COVID-19,"" Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said.
""South Korea has also reported a low case fatality rate of only 0.5%, and the successful containment of local transmission to only certain areas.""
Last Wednesday, February 26, the Philippines banned Filipino tourists from traveling to South Korea, but allowed permanent residents, overseas Filipino workers, and students based in that country to leave.
Non-Filipinos coming from North Gyeongsang were also barred from entering the Philippines. Exemptions were only granted to Filipinos and their foreign spouses and children, as well as holders of permanent resident cards and diplomatic visas.
Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles earlier said the Philippines decided to impose only a partial travel ban on those arriving from North Gyeongsang since the South Korean government gave assurances it will be able to isolate coronavirus cases.
As of 2:46 pm on Tuesday, South Korea has registered the highest number of coronavirus cases outside China, with 4,812. The death toll there stands at 28.
The vast majority of cases were seen in Daegu, South Korea's 4th largest city and the epicenter of the outbreak, and the rest of North Gyeongsang, Agence France-Presse reported.
No new bans, for now
As for other areas, Panelo said no new travel restrictions have been imposed on countries where a high number of coronavirus cases have been found.
The IATF, he added, has also agreed to maintain existing travel bans on China, Macau, and Hong Kong.
""The IATF assures [the public] that the review concerning travel restrictions and protocols to and from the Philippines shall be regularly conducted,"" Panelo said.
But travel exemptions are now granted, ""allowing dependents of permanent residents of South Korea, Hong Kong, and Macau to travel to these areas as long as they also sign a risk-acknowledgement declaration,"" said Duque on Tuesday.

MANILA, Philippines – The government's economic managers are set to issue a more dire assessment of the novel coronavirus' impact on the Philippine economy, as the deadly virus further spreads around the globe.
""The whole world is in a mess [due to the virus],"" said Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas Governor Benjamin Diokno in The Manila Times business forum on Tuesday, March 3.
The economic team previously projected that growth would be slashed by 0.2% if the virus would not be contained within a quarter, and up to 0.4% if it drags on until the 1st half of the year.
However, Diokno noted that they were basing the figures on the ""wrong assumption.""
The calculations were based on how the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) affected the global economy over 16 years ago.
""This is not SARS, this is different.... Slightly worse than recent computation,"" Diokno said. (READ: How does COVID-19 compare to SARS and MERS?)
In February, the novel coronavirus overtook SARS in terms of the number of deaths.
During the 2002-2003 SARS outbreak, 774 died, while the novel coronavirus has killed more than 3,100 people and infected over 90,000, with figures still rising.
The Philippines' revised economic estimates are likely to be out by late March or early April.
As the public continues to avoid crowded spaces like malls, Diokno is banking on government spending to shore up the economy.
Less collections
The Bureau of Customs (BOC) is expected to post lower collections due to less imports from China amid the outbreak.
Finance Undersecretary Antonette Tionko said in the same forum that imports from China plummeted by 44% in February, while overall imports are down by 22%.
""We have to work to find ways to recover,"" Tionko said.
However, she noted that the amount of collections ""didn't go down much"" because of higher taxes from oil imports.
The BOC fell short of its collection target for January by at least P2 billion, collecting some P56 billion for the month. 
The tourism sector is among those hardest hit by the virus. The Department of Tourism estimated that the country is set to lose some 1.2 million Chinese tourists due to the novel coronavirus.
In February alone, tourists arrivals in world-famous Boracay declined by 40%, resulting in the closure of some 20 establishments on the island and in the airport. From an average of 4,100 Chinese tourists, only 1,400 came to visit the island.
The Philippines has had 3 confirmed cases of the virus, so far, all of them Chinese tourists. One died, while the other two recovered. There is still no recorded case of local transmission in the country.

SINGAPORE (UPDATED) – A Filipina maid, a coworker of another patient from the Philippines, contracted the novel coronavirus disease called COVID-19 in Singapore, said the city-state’s Ministry of Health (MOH) on Monday, March 2.
The 34-year-old domestic worker is the 3rd Filipino coronavirus patient in Singapore. She is the city-state’s 108th case of the novel coronavirus.
“Case 108 is a 34-year-old female Filipino national who is a Singapore Work Pass holder, and has no recent travel history to China, Daegu, and Cheongdo. She is a foreign domestic worker employed by Case 101, and works in the same household as Case 102,” said the MOH.
“She was confirmed to have COVID-19 infection on 2 March morning and is currently warded in an isolation room at Ng Teng Fong General Hospital,” the ministry added.
The Filipina is among two new COVID-19 cases reported by the MOH on Monday, as 4 other patients have been discharged. Of Singapore’s 108 cases of the novel coronavirus, 78 have completely recovered and have been discharged from the hospital as of Monday, said the MOH.
Like her Filipino coworker and their employer, the 3rd Filipino novel coronavirus patient in Singapore is linked to a cluster of cases involving the Singapore e-learning company Wizlearn Technologies. (READ: Filipina linked to coronavirus cases in Singapore firm)
The second Filipino coronavirus patient is a 41-year-old domestic worker with no recent travel history to China, Daegu, and Cheongdo. She tested positive for COVID-19 on Saturday, February 29.
Their employer is an anonymous 61-year-old Singaporean who, also on Saturday, was confirmed to have contracted COVID-19.
The Singaporean employer is linked to Case 93, who had earlier been linked to the COVID-19 cases involving Wizlearn Technologies. The MOH said 12 of Singapore’s 108 novel coronavirus patients are linked to this e-learning company.
Earlier, the first Filipino coronavirus case in Singapore was discharged from the hospital.

MANILA, Philippines – One of the 26 South Koreans in Cebu who flew in from Daegu, South Korea is still being tracked by the Department of Health (DOH), Assistant Secretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said on Monday, March 2.
Daegu, South Korea's fourth-largest city, is the center of the country's coronavirus outbreak. The 26 flew to Cebu on a direct flight from Daegu on February 25, a day before the government imposed a travel ban on South Korea after it saw a sudden spike in coronavirus cases. (READ: South Korea wages 'all-out responses' to virus with 586 new cases)
The following is the status of the 26 South Korean tourists, according to Vergeire:

15 went home to South Korea on Sunday, March 1
2 are going home on Monday, March 2
1 has gone to Angeles City, and is endorsed to the DOH Central Luzon office
7 are still quarantined in Cebu in their respective hotels
1 is ""for verification""

By ""verification,"" Vergeire said that this meant health authorities are still trying to trace him. The man told port officials that he was staying at a particular hotel in Cebu but when the DOH went to look for him, he was not there.
In the regional press conference in Cebu also held on Monday, DOH Region 7 Director Jaime Bernadas said ""everyone is accounted for"" despite the unverified location of one of the 26 Korean tourists.
Bernadas said that there were ""a lot of ways"" the person can be traced. He said that this included the help of local governments, the provincial health office, the different branches of the Philippine National Police, the Bureaus of Investigation and Quarantine, and the private sector including hotel operators.
Bernadas said that 6 of the South Koreans still in Cebu are tourists and have expressed intention to stay longer after the 14-day quarantine period lapses.
Contact tracing
Vergeire explained that contact tracing refers to tracking down the people who came in contact with confirmed coronavirus cases.
The Health official said that since the 26 South Koreans were not showing signs and symptoms of COVID-19, the disease caused by the 2019-nCoV, contact tracing was not required. However, since they came from a coronavirus-hit area, they still have to be monitored by the DOH as a precaution.
As of Monday, there have been 638 cases monitored in the country, although only 43 remain admitted and 592 others have already been discharged. Even with the significant decrease, the DOH said it ""won't let their guard down."" – with reports from Ryan Macasero/Rappler.com

There are at least 86 Filipinos confirmed to have the virus, but all are based outside the Philippines, including two in the United Arab Emirates, two in Hong Kong, two in Singapore, and 80 who were aboard a cruise ship quarantined in Japan.
The World Health Organization raised its global risk assessment of the virus to the maximum level. It earlier declared the outbreak an international emergency.
The global death toll has reached 3,044, with 2,912 of the fatalities in China. The number of cases worldwide has risen to 89,006, with 80,026 of the infections in China. The virus has spread to more than 60 countries. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – The government's economic managers are set to issue a more dire assessment of the novel coronavirus' impact on the Philippine economy, as the deadly virus further spreads around the globe.
""The whole world is in a mess [due to the virus],"" said Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas Governor Benjamin Diokno in The Manila Times business forum on Tuesday, March 3.
The economic team previously projected that growth would be slashed by 0.2% if the virus would not be contained within a quarter, and up to 0.4% if it drags on until the 1st half of the year.
However, Diokno noted that they were basing the figures on the ""wrong assumption.""
The calculations were based on how the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) affected the global economy over 16 years ago.
""This is not SARS, this is different.... Slightly worse than recent computation,"" Diokno said. (READ: How does COVID-19 compare to SARS and MERS?)
In February, the novel coronavirus overtook SARS in terms of the number of deaths.
During the 2002-2003 SARS outbreak, 774 died, while the novel coronavirus has killed more than 3,100 people and infected over 90,000, with figures still rising.
The Philippines' revised economic estimates are likely to be out by late March or early April.
As the public continues to avoid crowded spaces like malls, Diokno is banking on government spending to shore up the economy.
Less collections
The Bureau of Customs (BOC) is expected to post lower collections due to less imports from China amid the outbreak.
Finance Undersecretary Antonette Tionko said in the same forum that imports from China plummeted by 44% in February, while overall imports are down by 22%.
""We have to work to find ways to recover,"" Tionko said.
However, she noted that the amount of collections ""didn't go down much"" because of higher taxes from oil imports.
The BOC fell short of its collection target for January by at least P2 billion, collecting some P56 billion for the month. 
The tourism sector is among those hardest hit by the virus. The Department of Tourism estimated that the country is set to lose some 1.2 million Chinese tourists due to the novel coronavirus.
In February alone, tourists arrivals in world-famous Boracay declined by 40%, resulting in the closure of some 20 establishments on the island and in the airport. From an average of 4,100 Chinese tourists, only 1,400 came to visit the island.
The Philippines has had 3 confirmed cases of the virus, so far, all of them Chinese tourists. One died, while the other two recovered. There is still no recorded case of local transmission in the country.
At least 87 Filipinos were found to have the virus, but all are based outside the Philippines, including 80 from a cruise ship docked in Japan, 3 in Singapore, and 2 each in the United Arab Emirates and Hong Kong. – Rappler.com "

Photo courtesy of Cebu City Public Information Office CEBU CITY, Philippines – The Cebu Chinese Chamber of Commerce donated 5,000 face masks to help prepare for a possible outbreak of COVID-19 in the Philippines.   The masks were delivered by local businessman Francisco Benedicto.  The donation comes after it was reported that at least 26 Koreans from coronavirus-hit Daegu City traveled to Cebu. All except one have been accounted for, but none exhibited symptoms of the virus. 
Cities around the world have been dealing with mask shortages due to panic buying.  Shortly after news of infections spreading in China began, pharmacies in Cebu started implementing a ""one box per person"" policy in the purchase of face masks to prevent hoarding. (READ: Amid coronavirus scare, masks fly off shelves in Cebu drugstores)   During a meeting on Friday, January 31, Cebu City Mayor Edgardo Labella requested the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) to monitor prices of face masks and to also sanction those who are hoarding them. Hoarding masks can cause problems for hospitals or quarantine centers who need them to take in persons who may have the virus. (READ: WHO reminder: Reserve face masks for coronavirus high-risk people, health workers)
The World Health Organization (WHO) does not recommend wearing masks unless one is sick. Instead, they encourage the public to frequently wash hands and maintain good hygiene practices to avoid infection.   
Preparations  Cebu is home to the second busiest international airport.   Cebu City’s chief executive Mayor Edgar Labella said they have been working to prepare the city for a possible outbreak.  “We’re meeting the challenge of [the coronavirus] by following the protocols of the Department of Health,” Labella said. “Protocol is that if they are persons under monitoring, they will be under home confinement for 14 days. This means they are not symptomatic, but came from areas with known outbreaks.   If there are young children, elderly, or other vulnerable persons in their homes, they will be placed under quarantine in a newly-built facility in Barangay Taptap.""
Those who show symptoms will be placed in hospitals prepped to treat COVID-19 patients.

SINGAPORE (UPDATED) – A Filipina maid, a coworker of another patient from the Philippines, contracted the novel coronavirus disease called COVID-19 in Singapore, said the city-state’s Ministry of Health (MOH) on Monday, March 2.
The 34-year-old domestic worker is the 3rd Filipino coronavirus patient in Singapore. She is the city-state’s 108th case of the novel coronavirus.
“Case 108 is a 34-year-old female Filipino national who is a Singapore Work Pass holder, and has no recent travel history to China, Daegu, and Cheongdo. She is a foreign domestic worker employed by Case 101, and works in the same household as Case 102,” said the MOH.
“She was confirmed to have COVID-19 infection on 2 March morning and is currently warded in an isolation room at Ng Teng Fong General Hospital,” the ministry added.
The Filipina is among two new COVID-19 cases reported by the MOH on Monday, as 4 other patients have been discharged. Of Singapore’s 108 cases of the novel coronavirus, 78 have completely recovered and have been discharged from the hospital as of Monday, said the MOH.
Like her Filipino coworker and their employer, the 3rd Filipino novel coronavirus patient in Singapore is linked to a cluster of cases involving the Singapore e-learning company Wizlearn Technologies. (READ: Filipina linked to coronavirus cases in Singapore firm)
The second Filipino coronavirus patient is a 41-year-old domestic worker with no recent travel history to China, Daegu, and Cheongdo. She tested positive for COVID-19 on Saturday, February 29.
Their employer is an anonymous 61-year-old Singaporean who, also on Saturday, was confirmed to have contracted COVID-19.
The Singaporean employer is linked to Case 93, who had earlier been linked to the COVID-19 cases involving Wizlearn Technologies. The MOH said 12 of Singapore’s 108 novel coronavirus patients are linked to this e-learning company.
Earlier, the first Filipino coronavirus case in Singapore was discharged from the hospital. Identified only as Case 89, he was a 41-year-old Singapore permanent resident who was allowed to leave the hospital on Friday, February 28,nearly a week after he tested positive for COVID-19.

The Philippine embassy in Singapore on Monday reminded Filipinos ""not to lower their guard"" against COVID-19.

MANILA, Philippines – One of the 26 South Koreans in Cebu who flew in from Daegu, South Korea is still being tracked by the Department of Health (DOH), Assistant Secretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said on Monday, March 2.
Daegu, South Korea's fourth-largest city, is the center of the country's coronavirus outbreak. The 26 flew to Cebu on a direct flight from Daegu on February 25, a day before the government imposed a travel ban on South Korea after it saw a sudden spike in coronavirus cases. (READ: South Korea wages 'all-out responses' to virus with 586 new cases)
The following is the status of the 26 South Korean tourists, according to Vergeire:

15 went home to South Korea on Sunday, March 1
2 are going home on Monday, March 2
1 has gone to Angeles City, and is endorsed to the DOH Central Luzon office
7 are still quarantined in Cebu in their respective hotels
1 is ""for verification""

By ""verification,"" Vergeire said that this meant health authorities are still trying to trace him. The man told port officials that he was staying at a particular hotel in Cebu but when the DOH went to look for him, he was not there.
In the regional press conference in Cebu also held on Monday, DOH Region 7 Director Jaime Bernadas said ""everyone is accounted for"" despite the unverified location of one of the 26 Korean tourists.
Bernadas said that there were ""a lot of ways"" the person can be traced. He said that this included the help of local governments, the provincial health office, the different branches of the Philippine National Police, the Bureaus of Investigation and Quarantine, and the private sector including hotel operators.
Bernadas said that 6 of the South Koreans still in Cebu are tourists and have expressed intention to stay longer after the 14-day quarantine period lapses.
Contact tracing
Vergeire explained that contact tracing refers to tracking down the people who came in contact with confirmed coronavirus cases.
The Health official said that since the 26 South Koreans were not showing signs and symptoms of COVID-19, the disease caused by the 2019-nCoV, contact tracing was not required. However, since they came from a coronavirus-hit area, they still have to be monitored by the DOH as a precaution.
As of Monday, there have been 638 cases monitored in the country, although only 43 remain admitted and 592 others have already been discharged. Even with the significant decrease, the DOH said it ""won't let their guard down."" – with reports from Ryan Macasero/Rappler.com

MANILA, Philippines – Ten Filipinos from the coronavirus-hit Diamond Princess cruise ship who showed flu-like symptoms at the New Clark City (NCC) quarantine facility tested negative for the virus, the Department of Health (DOH) said Monday, March 2.
They are among the 14 patients under investigation (PUIs) in NCC. Ten of them manifested sore throat, 3 had a cough, and one had a fever.
The four others are still waiting for the results of their novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) test. 
""We are more than ready to cater to the needs of our kababayans (countrymen) should they test positive for COVID-19. We are also geared up for the possibility of local transmission,"" said Health Secretary Francisco Duque III. 
COVID-19 is the disease caused by the 2019-nCoV, which originated in Wuhan, China. So far, the virus has killed more than 3,000 people worldwide, with 2,912 fatalities in China alone. The virus has spread to more than 60 countries. (READ: Global coronavirus death toll passes 3,000 with new China count)
As of Monday, 12 noon, Health Assistant Secretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said that there have been 638 cases monitored in the Philippines, but only 43 remain admitted while the 592 others have already been discharged.
There are 458 individuals currently quarantined in the Clark facility, nearly all of whom were from the virus-hit Diamond Princess and were repatriated by the government to the Philippines last week.
The cruise ship was placed under quarantine since February 5 in Yokohama, Japan after passengers tested positive for the new virus, six of whom had died from the disease.
As of Sunday, March 1, all crew members of the Diamond Princess have disembarked, Japan's health minister said. (READ: All crew members have left virus-hit ship in Japan- minister)

MANILA, Philippines – The Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) said it was seeking clarification on the full scope of the Saudi government's travel ban, following reports that some Filipinos traveling to Saudi Arabia were denied entry over restrictions put in place due to the 2019 novel coronavirus.
""We're quite concerned about reports of the Saudi government's actions with regard to this particular COVID-19 issue.... We are clarifying the scope and existing policy and if there are those negatively affected we will bring (such) cases to the attention of Saudi government,"" DFA Assistant Secretary Eduardo Meñez told reporters in a press briefing in Malacañang on Monday, March 2.
In an unprecedented move, Saudi Arabia earlier announced it was banning ""umrah"" pilgrims from visiting Islam's holiest sites to try to contain the spread of the coronavirus as the number of cases and deaths soared in neighboring Iran.
The kingdom – which hosts millions of pilgrims every year – added it was also suspending visas for tourists visiting from countries where the new virus is a ""danger."" (READ: World 'simply not ready' for virus spread – WHO China mission chief)
But despite restrictions limited to pilgirms and tourist visas, Meñez said the Philippine embassy was monitoring reports of some Filipinos who were supposedly unable to enter the country for other purposes.  
Among those affected by the Saudi government's travel restrictions was House Minority Leader Bienvenido Abante Jr who was supposed to visit and meet with overseas Filipino workers. Abante was in transit in Dubai when his airline informed him he would not be allowed to enter Saudi Arabia due to restrictions barring Filipino tourists from entering due to the coronavirus.
At the time, Meñez said the Philippine government was confirming the “exact details” of the Saudi government's travel ban.
Following the outbreak of the coronavirus, several countries have imposed sweeping travel restrictions in an effort to quell the spread of the virus. The Philippines is so far imposing travel bans with varying degrees of restrictions on China, its administrative regions Macau and Hong Kong, and South Korea. 
As of Monday morning, the virus has killed more than 3,000 people, with 2,912 of them in China. More than 88,000 people have been infected by the virus, which has spread to over 60 countries. – with reports from Agence France-Presse/Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – The Overseas Workers Welfare Administration (OWWA) said the government has distributed some P84 million in aid to overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) who were stranded in the Philippines due to travel restrictions imposed over the novel coronavirus outbreak.
OWWA Administrator Hans Cacdac gave the figure during a press conference at Malacañang on Monday, March 2.
He said the assistance was given to 8,448 OFWs who were stationed mostly in China, Hong Kong, and Macau.
The Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) earlier announced that each affected worker would receive P10,000. Repatriated OFWs coming from China will also get at least P20,000 from DOLE.
Last February 2, the Philippine government had banned travel to and from China and its administrative regions Hong Kong and Macau. All Filipinos were not allowed to go to the 3 areas, while only Filipinos and permanent resident card holders could enter the Philippines.
The situation left thousands of OFWs stranded in the Philippines, including those who were set to return to work after Chinese New Year and those who were newly deployed. They feared losing their source of income.
The Philippine government later lifted the ban on OFWs, permanent residents, and Filipinos leaving abroad for study in China, Hong Kong, and Macau on February 18.
'No negative signals'
Aside from this, Cacdac said OWWA is ready to assist Filipino workers from the Diamond Princess cruise ship quarantined in Japan, should they wish to permanently stay and work in the Philippines.
But he added that the workers' manning agent assured the government that all workers will be rehired when they are cleared to return to work.
Cacdac also said there have been ""no negative signals"" on possible effects of the coronavirus on the overseas hiring of Filipinos.
""No negative signals in the sense na magbabawas sila o ayaw na nila ng Filipino (that they will lay off workers or will no longer hire Filipinos),"" he said.
Cacdac likewise assured the public that the government has enough funds to continue helping OFWs affected by the coronavirus outbreak.

""This may be attributed to our strengthened surveillance, early travel restrictions, and enhanced laboratory process. But this is not enough reason to let our guard down,"" Vergeire said in a press briefing in Malacañang on Monday.
Vergeire said the DOH is continuously assessing the situation and working to improve health surveillance protocols based on evidence and latest developments related to the coronavirus.
She added that the DOH has geared up for the possibility of local transmission.
Aside from this, Vergeire said the DOH is adopting contingency plans as the World Health Organization raised its risk assessment for the virus to its maximum level of ""very high"" worldwide.
Meanwhile, of the 458 individuals quarantined at New Clark City in Tarlac, 14 have been admitted to health facilities. Of this number, 10 have tested negative for the coronavirus, while health officials are waiting for the results of 4 individuals.
The Philippines earlier recorded 3 confirmed cases of the coronavirus, all Chinese tourists, including the first death outside of China. The other two already recovered and have returned to China.
As for Filipinos abroad, the DOH has recorded 86 Filipinos confirmed to have the coronavirus. This includes 80 from the Diamond Princess cruise ship docked in Japan, 2 in Hong Kong, 2 in Singapore, and 2 in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).
Of the 80 Filipinos in Japan, 48 remain admitted in hospitals while 32 have been discharged. A Filipino remains admitted in both Hong Kong and Singapore. In the UAE, both Filipinos are still in the hospital.

AKLAN, Philippines – The 11 tourists from South Korea were allowed to return home to Incheon via Kalibo International Airport on February 28 and 29 after they were monitored in Boracay Island without flu-like symptoms.
Madel Joy Tayco, deputy information manager of Malay inter-agency task force against COVID-19, said no people have been diagnosed with the 2019 novel coronavirus (Covid-19) in Malay, Aklan and Boracay Island.
Tayco said that the Koreans were classified as persons under monitoring (PUMs) after the Philippine government banned the entry of visitors on Wednesday, February 26 from South Korea’s North Gyeongsang province.
The Koreans - 6 males and 5 females - were not under mandatory quarantine since they arrived in Boracay Island for vacation on Tuesday, February 25. But Tayco said that the tourists had been medically cleared and took the direct flight out of Aklan to South Korea.
“Zero na tayo sa PUMs na South Koreans, nag check out na sila sa Boracay at bumalik sa South Korea. No PUMs na ibang nationalities, so far (We have zero PUM South Koreans because they have checked out of Boracay and returned to South Korea. We have no PUMs of other nationalities, so far),” Tayco said.
North Gyeongsang province and Daegu, South Korea’s epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak, have tallied over 2,300 confirmed cases of coronavirus, with 13 casualties. (READ: South Korea reports 376 more coronavirus cases, total 3,526)
Ahead of the summer season, Boracay Island is expected to experience a drop in the daily influx of arrivals from China and South Korea, the two biggest inbound tourist markets of Aklan.
Health authorities in Aklan have also instituted measures in Caticlan port in Malay, Aklan to reduce the risk of the coronavirus spreading.
The Covid-19 threat forced the Provincial Health Office (PHO-Aklan) and Caticlan port medical staff  to conduct health screenings to monitor the body temperature of drivers and passengers using thermometer guns.
Last January 30, travelers from Macau, Hong Kong, and mainland China - the epicenter of deadly virus - were also banned by health authorities from entering the Philippines. – Rappler.com

MANILA, Philippines –  Thousands of workers may lose their jobs in the next 6 months as businesses take a hit from the novel coronavirus disease COVID-19 outbreak, a labor group said on Saturday, February 29.
""TUCP sees 7,000 more layoffs and retrenchments in 6 months amid the growing corona virus outbreak crisis,"" the Trade Union Congress of the Philippines  said in a statement on Saturday.
It made the forecast after Philippine Airlines (PAL)  terminated 300 employees, citing losses incurred because of canceled flights due to the COVID-19 travel bans.
""In TUCP discussions with unions leaders in other industries, they said the PAL retrenchment is just the beginning of the bigger adverse economic effect of the escalating outbreak of COVID-19 phenomenon,"" the labor group said.
TUCP Representative Raymond Mendoza said that based on their assessment, other industries would follow suit and lay off non-essential workers.
""The PAL retrenchment program and the travel bans will trigger more layoffs in several of its supply chains that includes hotels, restaurants, land transport service, logistics, catering and other suppliers of the airlines,"" Mendoza said.
""It is now inevitable that other airlines, to cope with the crisis, will also make similar retrenchments of non-essential jobs which will also affect workers down their supply chains,"" he added.
Mendoza said they would call to reconvene the National Tripartite Industrial Peace Council composed of labor, business and the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE), the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), and the Department of Finance to come up with mitigating measures for the labor impact of COVID-19. 
The TUCP also expected layoffs of Filipino workers in cruise ships, especially cruise lines  hard-hit by the virus.
The labor group said that it is in discussions with shipowners and manning agencies to honor unions' collective bargaining agreements (CBA). In the worst-case scenario, the TUCP said it reminded agencies to ""make a reasonable retrenchment and separation package with those crew who do not have contracts and collective bargaining agreement with them."" – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – The Quezon City government is training its health workers and volunteers on handling biosecurity risks in communities amid the COVID-19 scare.
Following the directive of Mayor Joy Belmonte,  the Quezon City Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Office (QCDRRMC) and the City Health Department taught barangay-based health workers and first responders to prepare the city in the event of an outbreak of the disease caused by the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)
During the training sessions of the  Quezon City Epidemiology and Disease Surveillance Section, members of the city’s Barangay Health Emergency Response Teams (BHERT) would be given instructions on how to properly wear personal protective equipment (PPEs) before directly handling patients under investigation.
“Wearing PPEs involves a tedious process to make sure that the responder is fully protected from possible contamination,” said city epidemiologist Dr Rolando Cruz.
The PPE kits contain anti-fog goggles, disposable latex gloves, disposable plastic shoe cover, disposable coverall, disposable surgical gown, N95 face mask, disposable surgical mask, and disposable head cap.
The QCDRRMC said that so far, more than a hundred BHERT members from 20 out of the city’s 142 barangays have been training. The first training session was held at Barangay Batasan Hills with over 30 participants, and was followed by another session at the newly-opened Regional Evacuation Center in Barangay Fairview.
“Nakakamangha na sa barangay level pa lang may traning na ganito. Handa na tayo sakaling magkaroon ng case na ganito (It’s amazing that we already have these measures starting at the barangay level. We are ready if ever a case hits our area),” Barangay Batasan Hills captain Jojo Abad said after participating in a session.

DIPOLOG CITY, Philippines – As parents threatened to pull out their children from schools after learning of teachers coming home from vacation in Seoul, South Korea, the Dipolog City Schools Division immediately ordered the teachers to go on 14-day self-quarantine. 
“In all, 8 school teachers, a supervisor, and 6 other companions are now on mandatory self-quarantine,” provincial health officer Esmeralda A. Nadela told Rappler on Saturday, February 29.
“We are now coordinating with the Dipolog City Schools Division as we sent surveillance personnel to visit and investigate our persons under monitoring (PUM),” Nadela added.
On February 26, the Philippine government imposed travel restrictions on North Gyeongsang Province in South Korea after detecting a rise of COVID-19 infections. Exempted by the travel restriction are permanent residents in South Korea, those leaving for study, and overseas Filipino workers.
Nadela said she only knew of the teachers from Korea after parents had raised apprehension of sending their children to school.
“Some of the teachers arrived in Cebu on February 26, took a ship and arrived in Dipolog the following day. Some also took the Manila-Dipolog route air travel also on February 26,” Nadela said.
A parent commented: “Dangag kayo aning taga-Dipolog ga-travel anang lugar nga positive sa COVID-19, wala gyud sila gahuna-huna sa atong safety… pwede ra man unta i-postpone bisag nakapalit na silag promo tickets (These teachers from Dipolog are careless, they travel to a place that is positive of COVID-19, they did not think of our safety… They could have postponed their travel even if they already have bought promo tickets).”
Virgilio P. Batan Jr., Dipolog Schools Division assistant superintendent and officer-in-charge of the division, issued Division Order to the teachers and officials concerned to go on mandatory self-quarantine for 14-days.
“As of now, these teachers are not showing symptoms. In case they will – God forbid – they will be immediately transferred to our isolation facility,” Nadela said.
Dipolog City Mayor Darel Dexter Uy also issued a statement on February 29 assuring the people that the city is safe from COVID-19, and that “measures are in place following established protocols issued by the Department of Health, other government agencies, and concerned authorities."" – Rappler.com

AKLAN, Philippines – The inter-agency task force in Malay, Aklan said 11 tourists from South Korea were being closely monitored in case they were infected with the novel coronavirus (COVID-19).
The 11 Koreans – 10 adults and a child – arrived in Boracay Island on February 25 via Kalibo International Airport before the national government imposed a ban against travellers to and from North Gyeongsang province in South Korea.
The tourists came from Daegu, a city in North Gyeongsang province and the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak in South Korea.
The ban also took effect on February 26 for visitors coming from Gyeongbuk, including Cheongdu County. Aside from the South Korean travel ban, the country has an existing travel ban on China and special administrative regions Macau and Hong Kong. 
“Mga persons under monitoring sila (They are persons under monitoring) based on guidelines of Department of Health, but not necessarily quarantine,” said Madel Joy Tayco, deputy information manager of Malay inter-agency task force against COVID-19.
Tayco said the Koreans – comprised of 6 males and 5 females – are the only persons under monitoring (PUMs) in Boracay Island and were being closely monitored by the task force and the Municipal Health Office in their hotels for any signs of the deadly virus.
Majority of South Koreans classified as PUMs left Boracay Island for Incheon, South Korea via Kalibo International Airport on February 28, after undergoing health screenings with the local Bureau of Quarantine.
“Safe na tayo sa mga persons with history of travel in China kasi more than 14 days na from the lockdown. Unless kung galing ang mga turista sa mga bansang affected ng coronavirus case at may fever, cough or cold. So far, walang reports na may signs or symptoms,” Tayco added.

""We are calling on the PNP to assist in locating these 7. We have their identities, the airport authorities have the telephone numbers, and the DOH (Department of Health) is also coordinating with the vice consul of Korea in order to locate the 7,"" Cebu Governor Gwendolyn Garcia said.
 Central Visayas' Department of Health (DOH) Regional Director Jaime Bernadas said they would also need to track where the persons from Daegu have been in the country so far.  
The task force said the patients were not in the hotels where they said they would be as listed in their health cards.   Because of this, the task force proposed penalties of P5,000 for not putting the correct information in their health cards. 
""This should be a warning. With the help of the GMR (Cebu airport management), we shall be revising the health declaration forms for all international arrivals as well as domestic arrivals,"" Garcia said.
She said that in addition to the fine, she wants prison time as well for health card misrepresentation.
 The 19 Koreans already tracked by the local government are currently under quarantine in their hotel rooms. 
According to the task force, they are being monitored by the Philippine National Police, barangay tanods, hotel management, and DOH personnel.   The persons being monitored were also given the option to return to Daegu instead of completing the quarantine period.
  So far, the 19 are asymptomatic. Once they start showing symptoms, they will immediately be sent to a hospital.   
Garcia also signed a new executive order implementing a 14-day quarantine for Philippine citizens and visa holders who have been to Daegu or North Gyeongsang province in South Korea.   This is in addition to the existing mandatory quarantine on passengers from mainland China and its special administrative regions.

Photo by Anthony Wallace / AFP 
MANILA, Philippines – The Philippine government is eyeing the repatriation of Filipinos in Macau, Health Assistant Secretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said on Friday, February 28.
Vergeire said in a news briefing that the Inter-agency Task Force (IATF) met to discuss the plan and were reaching out to the Macau government for the repatriation process.
The IATF is also discussing logistical matters, such as what kind of carrier the repatriates would be brought in, if they would travel by air or sea.
Vergeire said that the final decision may be reached after the IATF meeting this weekend.
Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles, an ex-officio member of the IATF, said in a news brieing earlier this week that at least 200 Filipinos in Macau have signified their desire to be repatriated.
Unlike the repatriates from Wuhan, China; and the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan, the DOH said that repatriates from Macau and other countries would not be brought to the New Clark City (NCC) in Capas, Tarlac, for quarantine.
Vergeire said that the Diamond Princess repatriates had a ""special situation,"" because the transmission dynamics are unique on the ship. Since it is a contained place, it is difficult to determine the circumstances of the people on board, so the Philippine government quarantined them in New Clark City where they could be closely monitored.
Since the possible repatriates from Macau were not subject to the same situation, the DOH would only consider them as persons-under-monitoring, subject to home-based quarantine. Vergeire noted that they would be strictly monitored.
The first batch of 49 Filipino repatriates from Hubei province were quarantined in NCC and discharged on February 21.
Four days later, 445 repatriates from the Diamond Princess were brought to NCC. The DOH reported that a total of 5 exhibited symptoms, although two had already tested negative for COVID-19. Three were still awaiting results. – Rappler.com "
