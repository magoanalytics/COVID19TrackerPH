MANILA (4th UPDATE) - Philippine health authorities on Saturday raised Code Red as it confirmed local transmission and another case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the country, bringing the total number of patients to 6. 
Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said the latest patient is a 59-year-old woman who got infected from her 62-year-old husband, the country's fifth case of COVID-19. 
The man was, meanwhile, the first confirmed local transmission of the disease. 
The couple, who lives east of Manila, are now confined at the state-run Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) in Alabang, Muntinlupa City. Both have no recent travel history, records from the Bureau of Immigration (BI) showed.
""The DOH is currently exhausting all its efforts to identify others who may have come in contact with the confirmed cases to ensure that this localized transmission does not progress to community spread,"" Duque said.

What is Code Red?

To stem the spread of the disease, which has infected nearly 100,000 people and killed more than 3,300 worldwide, health authorities raised its alert system to ""Code Red, Sub-level 1.""
The alert is ""a preemptive call to ensure that national and local governments and public and private health care providers can prepare for possible increase in suspected and confirmed cases,"" Duque said.
A ""code red"" alert also means all hospital personnel are required to report for duty in their respective facilities to provide medical services. 
Announcing ""code red"" also prompted health authorities to recommend to President Rodrigo Duterte for the declaration of a state of public health emergency.

Duterte OKs declaration of state of public health emergency amid coronavirus spread- Go

In response to the DOH recommendation, the chief executive has agreed to declare a national public health emergency, according to Sen. Christopher ""Bong"" Go.
""Pursuant to the recommendation of the DOH and my suggestion as Chair of the Senate Committee on Health, President Rodrigo Duterte has agreed to issue a declaration of a State of Public Health Emergency due to the confirmation of a local transmission of COVID-19 in our country,"" he said.
In the event of a sustained community transmission or an increasing number of local cases whose links cannot be established, Duque said the strategy will be shifted from an intensive contact tracing to the implementation of community-level quarantine or lockdown and/or possibly, suspension of work or school.
SIXTH CASE
RITM director Dr. Celia Carlos revealed that the latest patient, who was admitted on March 5, was experiencing mild respiratory symptoms.
Her husband, the 5th coronavirus case who is suffering from severe pneumonia, is in critical condition, she added. 
""He still has severe pneumonia and other medical problems like diabetes and hypertension,"" Carlos said.
The man had coughs last Feb. 25 and was admitted at the Cardinal Santos Medical Center in San Juan City on March 1 with severe pneumonia. He tested positive on March 5. 
The man also frequented a Muslim prayer hall in San Juan, which has seen been disinfected. The worshipers in this prayer hall experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 have been asked to call the Department of Health hotline (02) 8651 7800 local 1149 o 1150 for referral to a health facility. 
According to Duque, the recovery of patients in critical condition is slow.
""Based on the experience, the clinical condition on severe cases as reported in China, it takes a very long time for them to recover from 3 to 6 weeks when critical. If mild, it's about 2 to 3 weeks,"" he said.
The first 3 COVID-19 cases in the Philippines involved Chinese nationals with history of travel to Wuhan, China, epicenter of the outbreak. One of them died of severe pneumonia on Feb. 1 while 2 recovered and have returned home. 
The fourth case, a 48-year-old Filipino man, had traveled to Japan, which has recorded 349 confirmed cases and 6 deaths from the illness. 
Health assistant secretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said the Philippines had 5 sub-national laboratories capable of diagnosing the virus.
These are the San Lazaro Hospital and Lung Center of the Philippines in Manila, Baguio General Hospital and Medical Center in Northern Luzon, Vicente Sotto Memorial Medical Center in the Visayas, and Southern Philippines Medical Center in Mindanao.
The country also has testing kits capable of completing about 2,500 procedures, Carlos added.
Duque also appealed to stakeholders to exercise utmost prudence in sharing sensitive information about suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19.
“Our objectives for sharing information are 2-pronged: ensure the public's health and safety by facilitating contact tracing and ensure that the individual’s right to privacy is not impinged. Hence, we appeal to all to coordinate closely with the Department of Health when disseminating information to the public and within their respective institutions. Let us make sure the information sharing process will yield the utmost benefit, and avoid unnecessary stress and stigma to individuals and institutions,"" the health chief said.

MANILA - The US Agency for International Development (USAID) has pledged millions of dollars of financial assistance to several countries, including the Philippines, to fight the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic.

Jean-Claude Coutausse, Pool/Reuters


PARIS - French officials have closed down about 120 schools in areas that have reported the largest numbers of coronavirus infections, and more could be shuttered in the coming days, Education Minister Jean-Michel Blanquer said Tuesday.
Both primary and secondary schools have been shut in the Oise department north of Paris, where the main cluster of French cases has emerged, and where 2 people who have died of the virus lived. 
Officials have reported 191 coronavirus cases in France so far, and 3 deaths.
The Oise closures are affecting about 35,000 pupils, Blanquer told LCI television, while an additional 9,000 have been told to stay home in the Morbihan department of Brittany on the Atlantic coast.
One class of some 20 students has been suspended in Montreuil, a suburb just east of Paris, after a pupil tested positive for the virus, Blanquer said.
The Oise schools will remain closed until further notice, while Morbihan authorities have ordered doors shut until at least March 14.
""These figures are evolving quickly,"" Blanquer said, adding: ""There could be similar measures taken in the coming days"" at other schools.
Authorities have already halted all class trips outside the country, and prohibited any gatherings of more than 5,000 people in enclosed spaces.
Schools are increasing stocks of soap for washing hands, but Blanquer said there were no plans to order a nationwide school shutdown, for now.
""It wouldn't make sense to confine everyone, to paralyze the country, it would be counter-productive,"" he said.
President Emmanuel Macron, who is scheduled to visit the health ministry's crisis management center on Tuesday, has called off several events this week as France scrambles to contain the outbreak.
Contagion fears have led to shortages of sanitizing hand gels and face masks, with suppliers racing to replenish stocks even though much of the production is in China, where authorities have closed thousands of factories after the coronavirus emerged there in December.
Demand for thermometers has also soared, with one French producer, STIL, relaunching production at its factory south of Paris for the first time in 15 years after having moved manufacturing to Chinese partners.
""We can't do without China completely, but with this coronavirus the balance could shift for French companies to not be completely reliant"" on Chinese producers, STIL's president Gerard Lux told AFP.

MANILA - All Filipinos living in Italy are free from the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) amid the rise of cases there, the Philippine foreign ministry said Tuesday.
""Based on reports from our posts in Rome and Milan as of today, no Filipinos have been reported as affected by COVID - PUM [person under monitoring], PUI [patient under investigation] or COVID positive,"" said Assistant Secretary Eduardo Meñez of the Department of Foreign Affairs' Office of Strategic Communication and Research.
The death toll from coronavirus in Italy jumped to 52 on Tuesday (Manila time) from 34 the day before.
The increase in deaths was the largest since the outbreak surfaced 10 days ago in the wealthy northern regions of Lombardy and Veneto.
Lombardy, around Italy's financial capital Milan, is by far the hardest hit, with 38 casualties.
The virus has since spread south but the vast majority of cases remain centered on the original hotspots, with the addition of Emilia Romagna, another affluent region which borders on both Lombardy and Veneto and now has more cases than Veneto.
In total, 2,036 people have tested positive in Italy, up from 1,694 on Sunday. Of these, 149 have recovered, the civil protection agency said. - With reports from Willard Cheng, ABS-CBN News and Gavin Jones and Angelo Amante, Reuters

MANILA - China's flag carrier Air China on Thursday will mount special flights from Beijing to Manila and vice versa to evacuate stranded passengers due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak.
The aircraft will depart Beijing at 10:55 a.m. and is set to arrive in Manila at 4:05 p.m., the Chinese Embassy in Manila said in a tweet.
It will return to Beijing at 5:40 p.m. and is expected to arrive at 10:35 p.m.
Asked about the flights, the embassy said ""there are still many people from both countries stranded in the other country and they need to return to their homes.""
The Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA), in an advisory published on Feb. 19, said some commercial flights in some parts of China were available for Filipinos who wished to return home.
These areas are Beijing, Chengdu, Chongqing, Guangzhou, Guiyang in Guizhou Province, Hong Kong, Kunming in Yunnan Province, Macau, Shanghai and Xiamen.
""Returning Filipinos are reminded of the mandatory 14-day quarantine upon arrival regulation implemented by the Bureau of Quarantine per guidelines of the Department of Health (DOH),"" the DFA said.
To stem the spread of the fast-spreading disease, the Philippine government in February imposed travel restrictions to China and its special administrative regions of Macau and Hong Kong. The ban on the two Chinese territories was eventually relaxed in favor of migrant workers and some specific visa holders.

ROME - The governor of Veneto, one of the regions worst hit by an outbreak in Italy of coronavirus, apologized on Saturday for criticizing China over the contagion and saying Chinese people ""eat live mice.""
Luca Zaia has pinned the blame on China for the flare-up in Italy, which has led to at least 21 deaths, saying that unlike Italians, the Chinese did not have good standards of hygiene.
""The hygiene that our people, the Venetians and the Italian citizens have, the cultural training we have, is that of taking a shower, of washing, of washing one's hands often,"" Zaia said in a Antenna 3-Nord Est TV television interview on Friday.
""It is a cultural fact that China has paid a big price for this epidemic because we have seen them all eat mice live or things like that.""
His words stung the Chinese embassy in Rome. ""At a crucial time like this, when China and Italy stand side-by-side to deal with the epidemic, an Italian politician has spared no slander about the Chinese people. This is a gratuitous attack that leaves us stunned,"" it wrote on Facebook.
Political opponents of Zaia also denounced his comments, saying they would damage ties between the 2 countries. The Veneto governor, who is a member of the rightist League party, said he had not meant to cause offense.
""My words came out badly, I agree. If anyone was offended, I am sorry,"" he told Corriere della Sera newspaper on Saturday. ""I wanted to say that when it comes to food health and safety, controls change from country to country.""
The new coronavirus emerged at the end of 2019 in the Chinese city of Wuhan where scientists believe it might have passed to humans from animals at a local market where bats, snakes and other wildlife were sold. 
China temporarily shut down all such markets in January, warning that eating wild animals posed a threat to public health and safety.
The total accumulated number of confirmed cases in Italy has risen to almost 900, latest data shows, making it the worst affected country in Europe.
In China, the virus has caused nearly 80,000 infections and 2,835 deaths, according to official figures.

MEXICO CITY - Mexico's health ministry said the country has confirmed 3 cases of the coronavirus, becoming the second Latin American nation reached by the global outbreak.
The 3 men -- 2 in Mexico City and 1 in the northern state of Sinaloa -- are all believed to have visited northern Italy, the epicenter of the virus in Europe.
""Probably all 3 were infected from the same source. All 3 are imported cases,"" Jose Luis Alomia, general director of epidemiology at the Ministry of Health, said at a press conference Friday.
Senior health ministry official Hugo Lopez-Gatell told a separate news conference that 1 of the men, a 35-year-old in the capital, ""has a mild, mild illness"" with symptoms ""similar to that of a cold.""
""He is a young individual and so he is at very low risk,"" he said.
The patient and 5 members of his family have been isolated at the National Institute of Respiratory Diseases, Lopez-Gatell added.
The second case, a 41-year-old man who returned from Bergamo in Italy, is in isolation at a hotel in Sinaloa after being tested by regional authorities, officials said.
A 59-year-old man in Mexico City who also visited northern Italy is the third case but authorities did not say whether he had been hospitalized.
Italy has recorded 650 cases of the coronavirus and 17 deaths across cities in the north.
In Mexico, 2 more suspected cases are under analysis in the central state of Guanajuato and 1 in northwestern Durango.

SEOUL - South Korea urged citizens on Saturday to stay indoors as it warned of a ""critical moment"" in its battle on the coronavirus after recording the biggest daily jump in infections, as 813 new cases took the tally to 3,150.
South Korea is grappling with the largest outbreak of the virus outside China, as a new death took the toll to 17, amid a record daily increase in infections since the country confirmed its first patient on Jan. 20.
""We have asked you to refrain from taking part in public events, including a religious gathering or protest, this weekend,"" Vice health minister Kim Kang-lip told a briefing.
It was a ""critical moment"" in reining in the spread of the virus, he said, adding, ""Please stay at home and refrain from going outside and minimize contact with other people.""
As many as 657 of the new cases were from southeastern Daegu city, the site of a church at the center of the outbreak, and 79 from the nearby province of North Gyeongsang, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) said.
In the nearby city of Gumi, LG Display has shut a display module plant for disinfection work until Tuesday, after an employee of a bank in the building tested positive for the virus.
Health authorities have run tests on more than 210,000 members and 65,000 trainees of the church linked to a majority of cases after a 61-year-old woman known as ""Patient 31"" attended religious services there before testing positive.
More than 88 percent have been checked, and about 3,300 have shown symptoms such as fever, Kim added.
Some provincial officials want to press criminal charges against the church, saying it refused to release a complete list of members, although the church denied the accusation, and urged an end to ""slander and oppression"" of its followers.
Kim said the government was working with the municipal authorities to check if the church provided an incomplete list.
A court rejected a plan by conservative groups critical of President Moon Jae-in for a massive weekend rally in downtown Seoul, citing health concerns.

""Kaya 'pag winter sa ibang bansa, talagang nagkakasakit. Higit sa malamig, madilim, walang araw. All of these, it weakens the immune system,"" ani Mercado, na ngayo'y deputy secretary-general ng Centers for Health in Humanitarian Action ng Philippine Red Cross.
""Hindi tayo maka-relate do'n eh. Palaging mainit at laging lalabas 'yong araw [dito]. Actually, pasalamat tayo maraming araw,"" dadgag niya.
Sa kabila ng pagkalat ng COVID-19 na nakapagdudulot ng respiratory infection, naobserbahan ni Mercado na mabilis kumalat ang sakit sa mga lugar na may malamig na klima, gaya ng China, Japan, Italy at South Korea.
""In the 2 months we've seen this virus, hindi natin siya nakikita na kumakalat ng sukdulan sa lugar na mainit, na marami, na libo-libo,"" aniya.
Base sa datos ng World Health Organization (WHO) nitong Biyernes, Pebrero 28, nakapagtala na ng higit 78,000 na kaso ng impeksiyon sa China, kung saan nagmula ang sakit. 
Karamihan dito ay nasa Hubei province na sentro ng outbreak at may daily average temperature na 7 degrees Celsius noong Enero at 10 degrees Celsius nitong Pebrero.
Sa hiwalay na panayam ng DZMM, sinabi ni Health Secretary Francisco Duque III na hindi sigurado kung may kinalaman ang klima sa bilis ng pagkalat ng virus.
""Ang Singapore, ang Malaysia maiinit din 'yan pero mayroon sila. In fact, ang Singapore nga mayroon silang local transmission. Siguro hindi gano'n ka agresibo 'yong virus sa maiinit na lugar pero hindi naman nangangahulugan na hindi siya tatama,"" aniya.
May 96 na kaso ng COVID-19 ang Singapore habang 24 naman sa Malaysia.
Nakapagtala naman ng 3 kaso ng coronavirus ang Pilipinas, kung saan isa ang namatay habang nag-negatibo na sa sakit ang 2 iba pa. Pareho silang mga Chinese na galing sa Wuhan City, Hubei province.
Sa kasalukayan, may binabantayan ang mga awtoridad na 30 pasyente na posibleng may novel coronavirus.

LOS ANGELES (UPDATE) - US health officials reported Friday a fourth case of novel coronavirus of unknown origin, indicating the disease was spreading in the country.
The latest case is a boy under 18 in Washington State who tested ""presumptive positive,"" local authorities said without releasing further details about the patient.
He is currently in home isolation in Snohomish County. The high school he attends will be shut until March 3 while it is deep cleaned, the Washington State Department of Health said.
In neighboring Oregon, authorities said Friday an adult who had had contact with people at an elementary school had been hospitalized and was also considered ""presumptive positive.""
A positive test is treated as ""presumptive"" until the results have been confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
""We've been expecting this and we're prepared for it,"" Oregon's Health Authority director Patrick Allen told reporters.
The school will be closed until March 4 as it undergoes a deep clean, officials said, adding they would talk to employees and parents.
Earlier Friday, Californian health authorities said an older woman was confirmed infected with unknown origin -- the second such case in the northern part of the state.
""This new case indicates that there is evidence of community transmission but the extent is still not clear,"" said Sara Cody, director of public health for Santa Clara County.
""What we know now is that the virus is here, present at some level, but we still don't know to what degree,"" she added.
The 2 cases in California are close to Silicon Valley, where tech giants like Apple, Google and Tesla are based.
The latest infections have heightened fears of an outbreak across the country.
President Donald Trump, however, downplayed the risk in the US at a campaign rally in South Carolina, accusing Democrats and the press of stirring up hysteria.
""We are preparing for the worst,"" he said. ""My administration has taken the most aggressive action in modern history to prevent the spread of this illness in the United States.""
He called the coronavirus the Democrats' ""new hoax.""
""The Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus. They're politicizing it,"" he said. ""They don't have any clue. They can't even count their votes in Iowa.""
According to the Centers for Disease Control more than 60 people are infected with the disease in the United States, the majority of them in California.
The state's governor Gavin Newsom said Thursday 33 people had tested positive for the virus, and 5 of them had left California.
Worldwide more than 85,000 people have been infected and over 2,900 have died.
The escalating number of cases has sent stock markets tumbling and heightened fears the disease could wreak havoc on the world economy.

Kazuhiro NOGI, AFP


TOKYO - Major cherry blossom festivals in Japan have been canceled due to the deadly new coronavirus, the latest in a growing list of events quashed as the epidemic spreads globally. 
The traditional spring celebrations in Tokyo and Osaka, which attract millions of people wanting to seeing the white and pink flowers, will not go ahead as planned in April.
""We are sincerely sorry for those who were looking forward to the viewing... but please give us your understanding,"" the Japan Mint in Osaka said Friday. 
Other cherry blossom events -- feverishly anticipated by locals and tourists -- are likely to follow suit, according to local media. 
Organizers of Tokyo's Nakameguro Cherry Blossom Festival said people could still enjoy the blooming trees that grow along public roads. 
Trees in Tokyo will soon be in full bloom, with friends, families and colleagues typically flocking to parks for sometimes raucous, alcohol-fueled celebrations.
The cancellations come as authorities step up efforts to tackle the outbreak in Japan, which has reported more than 230 infections and 5 deaths.
Schools are closed and the government is urging people to work from home or commute during off-peak hours and avoid large gatherings. 
The operator of Tokyo's 2 Disney resorts -- Disneyland and DisneySea -- said Friday the parks would be closed for around 2 weeks due to the virus.
Universal Studios Japan in Osaka has also shuttered for a fortnight.

Courtesy of the Quezon City Government


MANILA - The Quezon City government has started training village health workers as local first responders in handling contagious illnesses like the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Members of the Barangay Health Emergency Response Teams (BHERT) from 20 villages were taught how to properly wear personal protective equipment (PPEs) to prevent the risk of infection.
""Wearing PPEs involves a tedious process to make sure that the responder is fully protected from possible contamination,” said city epidemiologist Dr. Rolando Cruz.
Amid the global outbreak of the novel coronavirus, city mayor Joy Belmonte ordered the distribution of PPE kits to barangays.
Each PPE kit contains anti-fog goggles, disposable latex gloves, a disposable plastic shoe cover, a disposable coverall, a disposable surgical gown, an N95 face mask, a disposable surgical mask and a disposable cap.
The trainings were conducted after Interior Secretary Eduardo Año issued a memorandum ordering local chief executives to activate BHERTs to address the COVID-19 outbreak.
The DILG circular tasks BHERTs to visit the homes of persons who came from countries affected by the outbreak and list down names of persons that the traveler had contact with.
BHERTs are instructed to immediately isolate a suspected coronavirus carrier in a room away from family members and contact local authorities in transporting them to the nearest healthcare facility equipped to handle such cases.
For Cruz, communities should know how to properly respond to public health emergencies.
""Sa lahat ng health workers, parehas tayo magtulungan at gawing ligtas at maayos ang mga barangay. Trust the right information para sa ating mga nasasakupan sakaling maging community ang transmission ng COVID,” he said.
(To all health workers, let's work together and make our villages safe. Trust the right information in case the COVID transmission becomes local.)
The novel coronavirus, believed to have originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan, has infected more than 83,000 people all over the world, according to data from the World Health Organization (WHO).
The fast-spreading illness also killed more than 2,800 people, majority in China.
In the Philippines, health authorities were monitoring 30 people suspected of carrying the strain of COVID-19 as of Friday. Three Chinese nationals who had traveled to the Philippines were earlier confirmed to have contracted the disease, one of whom died.

HONG KONG - All pets of people in Hong Kong infected with the coronavirus will be quarantined, with 1 dog already in isolation, the city's authorities said Friday.
The move is the first reported case anywhere in the world of a government quarantining pets over the outbreak and was prompted by a positive test in the pet of an infected patient.
The canine has been placed in quarantine for 14 days as a precaution but has no ""relevant symptoms,"" Hong Kong officials said Friday.
""Nasal and oral cavity samples tested weak positive for COVID-19,"" a government spokesman said without explaining why they tested the animal in the first place.
He said it was unclear whether the dog had actually contracted the virus or tested positive for low levels due to environmental contamination of the dog's mouth and nose.
The animal was collected from the owner's home on Wednesday after the 60-year-old woman was diagnosed with the contagion and placed in a hospital isolation ward.
It would be closely monitored, undergo further tests and held in quarantine until it returned a negative result, authorities said.
There is no evidence domestic animals such as dogs and cats can catch the virus or transmit it to humans but the department said all pets of infected people should be quarantined and tested for the virus for 14 days.
The financial hub has confirmed 94 cases of the new coronavirus in humans, with 2 deaths earlier this month. 
The epidemic, which emerged in central China in December, has infected more than 83,000 people globally.

TOKYO (UPDATE) - Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe called Thursday on schools to close nationwide from March 2 for several weeks to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus.
""The government considers the health and safety of children above anything else,"" Abe said.
""We request all primary, junior high and high schools... across the nation to close temporarily from March 2 next week until their spring break.""
The spring break for public schools usually starts in late March in Japan and lasts several weeks.
""Efforts to prevent the spread of infections among children are being made in various areas,"" Abe added. 
Many public elementary schools and junior high schools in northern Hokkaido were already closed on Thursday after the governor requested public schools to close for about a week.
The city of Osaka also said it will close its kindergartens, elementary and junior high schools from Saturday for 2 weeks.
Abe's call comes after the government urged organizers of major events to consider cancelling them, and called on businesses to allow employees to work from home or commute off-peak.
Authorities have said the coming 2 to 3 weeks will be critical in determining whether they can stem the outbreak of the virus, which has infected nearly 200 people in the country and been linked to the deaths of 3.
Japan has also struggled to deal with the fallout from a cruise ship that it quarantined off its coast, where more than 700 people tested positive for the virus. Four people who became sick on the boat have died.
""It's extremely important to prevent one patient cluster from creating another and we think we should take thorough measures,"" Abe said at a cabinet-level meeting on the virus.
He also urged ministers to work on legislation for minimizing the negative impact on the economy and daily lives of Japanese.

MADRID - With governments scrambling to contain a slew of new coronavirus cases popping up across Europe, here is an overview of the countries affected, where people have died and the precautions being taken. 
ITALY
With 12 deaths and 400 infections, Italy is the European country worst affected by the COVID-19 outbreak. It has also been a point of contagion with many cases in other countries involving people who returned home after travelling in infection-hit areas of northern Italy.
FRANCE
France has so far registered 18 infections and 2 deaths, and has urged its nationals to delay any plans to visit virus hot spots in northern Italy. Students returning from China, Singapore, South Korea and the Italian regions of Lombardy and Venice are being asked to remain at home for 2 weeks after their return. 
GERMANY
In Germany, 18 people have been infected including 2 diagnosed on Tuesday. One is a 25-year-old man believed to have been infected in the Italian city of Milan. 
BRITAIN
Britain has so far recorded 13 cases since the start of the epidemic. The government has requested travelers returning from affected areas in northern Italy, China, South Korea and Iran to isolate themselves and inform authorities.
SPAIN
The same has happened in Spain, which has registered 12 cases, 10 of which have been detected since Monday. Nine involved Italians or people who had recently visited Italy. 
Among that number are 4 Italians who were visiting Tenerife in the Canary Islands. The hotel where they were staying has been quarantined. 
To curb the spread, Madrid has advised against travel in northern Italy and sought to identify other potential cases that may have slipped under the radar by testing those already in hospital with respiratory problems or returning from high-risk areas with flu-like symptoms. 
CROATIA
Three people have tested positive for the virus, including a young man who recently stayed in Italy and his brother. A third case was detected Wednesday in a man who works in the Italian city of Parma.
AUSTRIA
A young Italian couple have tested positive. The Innsbruck hotel where the woman worked as a receptionist was initially placed in quarantine but the measure was lifted on Wednesday following tests. Austria has also urged its nationals to avoid visiting affected areas of neighboring Italy. 
FINLAND
Two virus infections were confirmed Wednesday -- a Chinese tourist in Lapland and a second case involving a Finnish national who had recently visited northern Italy.
SWEDEN
Two cases have been detected so far. One was registered at the end of January in a woman who had visited Wuhan, the Chinese city where the virus emerged in December. On Wednesday a second infection was discovered.
BELGIUM
One case was detected in a Belgian national who was repatriated from Wuhan in early February. He has completed his quarantine period.
GEORGIA
Georgia on Wednesday announced the first confirmed case of the novel coronavirus in the South Caucasus region.
GREECE
Athens announced its first infection on Wednesday, a woman aged 38 who had recently returned from northern Italy. 
The Greek government said Tuesday that in the event of a mass outbreak, it would activate temporary restrictions on travel to and from countries with a large number of infections as well as temporarily close schools, places of worship, cinemas, theaters, sports halls and businesses.
NORTH MACEDONIA
One case has been detected -- a woman who recently returned from Italy. 
SWITZERLAND
A first case was detected on Tuesday in a man in his 70s who was infected near Milan.
ROMANIA
Romania reported its first case on Wednesday -- a man who was in contact with an Italian who visited the country last week.
NORWAY
Norwegian health authorities announced Wednesday the first case of the new coronavirus in the Nordic nation in someone who returned from China last week. They said the patient was not ""in danger.""

TOKYO - A woman working as a tour-bus guide in Japan tested positive for the coronavirus for a second time, Osaka's prefectural government said Wednesday, the first person in the country to do so amid growing concerns about the spread of the infection.
The second positive test comes as the number of confirmed cases in Japan rose to 186 by Thursday from around 170 the day before. Tokyo has urged big gatherings and sports events be scrapped or curtailed for 2 weeks to contain the virus while pledging the 2020 Olympic Games will still go ahead in the city.
The 186 cases reported by Japan's health ministry are separate from 704 reported from an outbreak on a cruise liner that was quarantined off Tokyo earlier this month. A total of 7 people have died, including 4 from the ship.
The woman, a resident of Osaka in western Japan, tested positive on Wednesday after developing a sore throat and chest pains, the prefectural government said in a statement, describing her as being in her 40s. She first tested positive in late January and was discharged from the hospital after recovering on Feb. 1, according to the statement.
The health ministry confirmed the case was the first in Japan where a patient tested positive for coronavirus for a second time after being discharged from hospital, the Nikkei newspaper said.
Though a first in Japan, cases of second positive tests have been reported in China, where the disease originated late last year. The outbreak has spread rapidly and widely, infecting about 80,000 people globally and killing nearly 2,800, the vast majority in mainland China.
""Once you have the infection, it could remain dormant and with minimal symptoms, and then you can get an exacerbation if it finds its way into the lungs,"" said Philip Tierno Jr., Professor of Microbiology and Pathology at NYU School of Medicine.
He said much remains unknown about the virus. ""I'm not certain that this is not bi-phasic, like anthrax,"" he said, meaning the disease appears to go away before recurring.
Asked to comment on prospects for the Olympic Games going ahead in Tokyo this summer, Prof. Tierno said, ""The Olympics should be postponed if this continues... There are many people who don't understand how easy it is to spread this infection from one person to another.""
Japan has changed its strategy in combating the contagion, seeking to slow its spread and minimize the number of deaths.
As part of the attempt to contain the outbreak, Tokyo Olympics officials are considering scaling down the torch relay, Tokyo 2020 CEO Toshiro Muto said Wednesday.
The government is also considering scaling back this year's March 11 memorial ceremony for victims of 2011's massive earthquake and tsunami, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told reporters on Thursday.
Meanwhile, a major Japanese bank reported an employee had tested positive for coronavirus. MUFG Bank, part of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc, the country's largest lender by assets, said a member of staff at a branch in central Aichi prefecture, had been confirmed to have the virus on Wednesday.

When does an epidemic become a pandemic? As the novel coronavirus continues its spread across the globe, what does the designation mean to world healthcare systems as they try to rein in the deadly disease? 
The World Health Organization has yet to declare the current outbreak, which originated in central China last month, a pandemic. 
It has indicated however that we should prepare ourselves for one.
The WHO defines a pandemic as a situation in which ""the whole world's population would likely be exposed to this infection and potentially a proportion of them fall sick,"" said its emergencies director Michael Ryan.
WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that countries should be doing everything they could ""to prepare for a potential pandemic"".
""For the moment we are not witnessing the uncontained global spread of this virus and we are not witnessing large-scale deaths,"" he said on Monday.
While the number of fresh cases in mainland China has slowed slightly in recent weeks, several other countries have seen infections mushroom. 
These include South Korea, which has seen more than 1,100 people infected, and Italy, with more than 300 confirmed cases.
On Tuesday Iran reported four more deaths, taking the total number of fatalities to 19 and confirmed infections to 139.
""What we see are epidemics in different parts of the world, affecting countries in different ways and requiring a tailored response,"" said Tedros.
The WHO has not updated its designation of the outbreak since January 30, when it classed it as ""a public health emergency of international concern"".
Under its old warning system, which had six stages of alert, the WHO could simply start referring to coronavirus as a pandemic, which comes from the Ancient Greek for ""pan demos"": all people.
""Definitions and terminology aside, our advice remains the same,"" said WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic.
For Bharat Pankhania, of the University of Exeter Medical School in England, coronavirus is already a pandemic ""in all but name"".
""It's only a matter of time before the World Health Organisation starts to use the term in its communications,"" he said.
David Heymann, professor of Infectious Disease Epidemiology at London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine said the terminology risked being a distraction. 
""What is necessary is to understand the current situation in each country,"" he said.
Tedros did hint that designating the outbreak a pandemic prematurely might do more harm than good.
""Using the word pandemic now does not fit the facts, but it may certainly cause fear. This is not the time to focus on what word we use,"" he said.
He added that even if a pandemic is declared, the world alone ""will not prevent a single infection today or save a single life today.""

The world is ""simply not ready"" to rein in the new coronavirus outbreak, the head of a joint WHO-China mission of experts said Tuesday, urging countries to learn from China's expertise.
""You have to be ready to manage this at a larger scale... and it has to be done fast,"" Bruce Aylward told reporters in Geneva, insisting countries everywhere have to ""be ready as if this hits us tomorrow"".
His comments came after the World Health Organization announced that the epidemic had peaked at its epicenter in China, where it has killed more than 2,600 people and infected over 77,000 others.

But the situation has worsened elsewhere with nearly 2,700 other cases and more than 40 deaths globally. That has prompted restrictions on travelers from infected nations, the cancellation of football matches and national efforts to isolate suspected patients.
Aylward, who led an international mission of experts to China that wrapped up on Monday, hailed the dramatic and concerted measures taken in that country to rein in the outbreak.
But he voiced concern that other countries were not preparing quickly enough to react if they were hit hard by the outbreak.
""How many countries are planning hospital bed, planning ventilators... and the lab capacity to be able to manage this?"" he asked
""There has to be a shift in mindset,"" he insisted. ""You have to plan.""

Austria, Croatia report first cases of coronavirus infection

But so far, he warned, countries ""are simply not ready"".
He also cautioned that China's quick response and quality treatment of COVID-19 cases may have given other countries ""a false sense of security"".
""China knows how to keep people alive from COVID... That is not going to be the case everywhere in the world,"" he said. ""It is a serious disease.""
He voiced particular concern that poorer countries with weak health care systems were the most at risk.
Aylward also said his team's findings in China appeared to belie theories circulating that the number of cases being detected is only the tip of the iceberg and that a lot of undetected transmission is going on.
""There is not a lot of evidence of that,"" he said.

SEOUL - South Korean health authorities said on Tuesday they aim to test more than 200,000 members of a church at the center of a surge of new coronavirus cases that has taken the country's tally to 893.
South Korea's fast-spreading outbreak has fueled fears that the coronavirus, which is believed to have begun in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in December, is developing into a global pandemic.
About 60 percent of South Korea's cases have been linked to the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, where the first case was reported in a 61-year-old woman, but it is not known how she became infected.
Of 60 new cases reported on Tuesday, 16 were in the southeastern city of Daegu, where the church is located, and 33 from nearby North Gyeongsang Province, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.
South Korea also reported its ninth death from the virus, a patient from a hospital in North Gyeongsang Province.
The leader of the Shincheonji Church said it had agreed to provide authorities with the names of all its members in South Korea, estimated by media at about 215,000 people.
The government would conduct coronavirus tests on all members ""as soon as possible"" once it got the information, the prime minister's office said in a statement.
""It is essential to test all of the church members in order to contain the spread of the virus and relieve public anxiety,"" the office said.
Vice Health Minister Kim Kang-lip said the priority was to test some 1,300 of the 9,200 members of the Daegu church who are showing symptoms, which he said would be completed by Wednesday.
""We will make utmost efforts with the goal of stabilizing the situation in Daegu within 4 weeks,"" he told a briefing, adding that the government would trace all other Daegu citizens having symptoms for isolation and checks.
US WARNING
The church, which has faced public criticism of its handling of the outbreak, asked the government to ensure the personal details of its members did not become public.
The church founder and self-proclaimed messiah, Lee Man-hee, said the church was cooperating with the government to stop the outbreak and beside its members, it would also check people in church training programs.
""All of these will be implemented on the premise that the government takes steps to protect their personal information,"" Lee said in a letter posted online.
North Gyeongsang Province has also seen surges in cases in recent weeks, most from a hospital in Cheongdo, which was designated a ""special care zone"" along with Daegu last week.
On Tuesday, 21 of the 33 cases from the province were confirmed to have come from a residential home for the disabled people in Chilgok County, also near Daegu, traced to a worker there whose mother is a member of the Shincheonji church in Daegu, Governor Lee Cheol-woo said.
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, meanwhile, raised its warning level for South Korea and recommended Americans avoid all nonessential travel to the country, citing the ""widespread, ongoing outbreak"" of the coronavirus.
The US and South Korean militaries said they were considering scaling back joint training due, in one of the first concrete signs of the virus' fallout on global US military activities.
South Korean Defense Minister Jeong Kyeong-doo told a news conference in Washington 13 cases had been confirmed in the South Korean armed forces.
More than 400 South Korean citizens were set to return from Israel, which imposed an entry ban and arranged 2 charter flights after more than 2 dozen South Korean Catholics who had gone on a pilgrimage there tested positive for the virus.

NEXU Science Communication via Reuters


GENEVA - The new coronavirus has peaked in China but could still grow into a pandemic, the World Health Organization has warned, as infections mushroom in other countries.
Financial markets have gone into a tailspin after grim news of deaths and outbreaks in the Middle East, Europe and Asia, even as the Chinese epicenter appeared to be calming, with the death toll at its lowest for 3 weeks.
But the situation is worsening in other countries, with more than 2,000 cases and 30 deaths reported abroad, prompting a raft of restrictions on travelers from infected nations.
South Korea, Italy and Iran have logged particularly sharp increases in infections and deaths, while several countries in the Middle East reported their first cases of the novel coronavirus.
But WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyes insisted the virus could still be contained, praising China's drastic quarantine measures in several cities for helping to prevent an even bigger spread.
""For the moment we are not witnessing the uncontained global spread of this virus and we are not witnessing large-scale deaths,"" Tedros told reporters in Geneva.
He added, however, that countries should be ""doing everything we can to prepare for a potential pandemic.""
The term ""pandemic"" is used to describe an illness that spreads across numerous communities.
SOUTH KOREA HOTSPOT
South Korea, which has the largest number of cases outside China, reported 60 more infections and 1 more fatality on Tuesday, raising its death toll to 8 and total patients to nearly 900.
South Korea's outbreak has centered around a religious sect in Daegu, the country's fourth largest city.
The country is on its highest ""red"" alert. As part of the containment efforts, school holidays were extended nationally while the 2.5 million people of Daegu were told to remain indoors.

South Korea reports 60 new coronavirus cases, total 893

The US Centers for Disease Control raised its caution level to warn Americans against ""all non-essential travel to South Korea.""
Italy, which has reported 7 deaths and over 200 cases, has locked down 11 towns, while upcoming football matches in its Serie A and the Europa League will be played behind closed doors. 
With police manning checkpoints to enforce a blockade, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte has said that residents could face weeks of lockdown.
IRAN FEARS
The disease -- officially known as COVID-19 -- spread to new countries including Afghanistan, Bahrain, Iraq, Kuwait and Oman.
At least 12 people have died in Iran, the highest toll outside China.
But there were concerns the situation might be worse than officially acknowledged. The semi-official ILNA news agency quoted 1 local lawmaker in hard-hit Qom -- a religious center -- who said 50 people had died there.
The Iranian government denied the report, and pledged transparency.

Iran says 43 infected with coronavirus, 8 dead - official

Even so, authorities have only reported 64 infections in Iran, an unusually small number that would mean an extremely high mortality rate.
Michael Ryan, head of WHO's health emergencies program, said a team from the UN agency would be arriving in Iran on Tuesday.
But he cautioned against drawing any conclusions about the mortality rate. Iran ""may only be detecting severe cases"" because the epidemic was still at an early stage, he said.
Several countries have taken measures to prevent arrivals from Iran.
CHINA PEAK
In China, 508 new cases were reported, with all but 9 at the epicenter in central Hubei province. Although that was up from 409 on Monday it was much lower than new infections being reported just a week ago.
China's death toll reached 2,663 on Tuesday, after 71 more people died.
WHO's Tedros said the epidemic peaked in China between Jan. 23 and Feb. 2.
China has placed some 56 million in Hubei and its capital under quarantine since late last month, while other regions have enacted some forms of travel curbs and measures to keep millions more people indoors.
Bruce Aylward, leader of a WHO mission of international experts, said late Monday it was time for China to start lifting some of the restrictions.
""Obviously they want to get society back to a more normal semblance of what probably is the new normal, because this virus may be around... for months,"" Aylward said.
Reflecting the disquiet, global markets plunged on Monday, with Wall Street off 3.6 percent. 
Bargain buying helped some Asian markets into the green on Tuesday, but disquiet remained, with Tokyo dropping 3 percent by lunchtime.

TOKYO (UPDATE) - A fourth person has died after being taken to hospital from a quarantined coronavirus-stricken cruise ship off Japan, local media reported on Tuesday.
Public broadcaster NHK and other local outlets said the fatality was a man in his 80s, with the Yomiuri Shimbun saying the man had tested positive for the new coronavirus and died of pneumonia.
The health minister did not immediately respond to a request to confirm the reports.
Three others, all Japanese, have so far died after becoming sick on the ship. Two were confirmed to have the new coronavirus, while the health ministry declined to comment on whether the third person tested positive for the virus.
At least 691 people who were on board the Diamond Princess have so far tested positive for COVID-19, according to the health ministry.
Around a 1,000 people were allowed to leave the ship after it completed a 14-day quarantine if they tested negative and displayed no symptoms.
But several people who left the boat after getting the all-clear have since tested positive, and the health ministry has admitted some people were allowed to disembark despite not being tested during the quarantine.
Separately, Japan has confirmed at least 156 cases of infection with the virus, and 1 death.

CASALPUSTERLENGO - Italy reported Monday its fifth death from the new coronavirus, as the number of people contracting the disease continued to mount and officials called for calm.
The death of an 88-year-old man was the fourth in the northern Lombardy region, where villages have been put under lockdown and security measures enforced in a bid to stem the spread of the disease.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte has said that residents could face weeks in lockdown in an effort to sit out the virus.
Angelo Borrelli, head of the country's civil protection agency, said 219 people had now tested positive in Italy, which has the most confirmed cases in Europe.
Five people have died of the virus in the past 4 days, including 1 in the Veneto region.
An Alitalia flight from Rome was being held in Mauritius Monday, after 40 people from Lombady and Veneto were told they could not disembark unless they consented to being placed in quarantine.
Alitalia said it was arranging for their immediate repatriation instead, despite none of the passengers showing any symptoms.
Eleven towns -- 10 in Lombardy and 1 in neighboring Veneto -- are under lockdown, with some 50,000 residents prohibited from leaving.
Regional authorities have ordered gathering spots, such as bars, restaurants, cinemas and discos to close.
The spread of the virus has disrupted high profile events including Milan Fashion Week and the Venice Carnival, while Serie A football matches have been postponed. Operas have also had to be cancelled at Milan's famed La Scala.
Masses in churches across the affected regions have been cancelled and funerals limited to immediate relatives only.
The stock market in Milan was down nearly 5 percent on Monday in a broad-based sell-off over virus fears.
'OUTBREAK IN HOSPITAL'
Most of the cases in Italy are in Lombardy, a prosperous region in the country's north where Milan is located.
They can be traced back to a 38-year-old man in the town of Codogno whom authorities have called ""patient one.""
Investigators are reconstructing minute by minute the man's movements over the past few weeks -- where he slept, ate, walked -- in a bid to trace everyone he could have come into contact with.
""We had the most unfortunate situation possible; the outbreak of an epidemic in a hospital,"" infectious disease expert Massimo Galli told the Corriere della Sera daily.
""Unfortunately, in these cases, a hospital can turn into a frightening amplifier of contagion,"" he said.
The 38-year old patient had not traveled to China and doctors failed to treat him with the necessary precautions.
The man initially believed to have given him the virus after returning from Shanghai later tested negative.
""We still do not know who brought the coronavirus to Codogno,"" Galli said.
'EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO TRACK'
Simon Clarke, Cellular Microbiology associate professor at Reading University in England, said: ""It seems that the virus can pass from person to person without symptoms, making it extremely difficult to track, regardless of what health authorities do.""
""While it remains the case that most people who become infected will have light symptoms or none at all, such uncontrollable spread would present a serious risk to vulnerable individuals.""
Fontana urged residents to stay calm and stop panic buying.
""Rushing to stock up on food doesn't make any sense. There are enough supplies.""
Milan mayor Beppe Sala echoed his plea, saying: ""Rather than dashing to the supermarkets to grab food, perhaps we should spend time looking after the most vulnerable, such as old people, who are particularly at risk.""
Schools have been closed as a precaution in Lombardy, Veneto, Piedmont, Emilia Romagna and Friuli Venezia Giulia.
Piedmont shares a border with France, while the other regions neighbor Switzerland, Austria and Slovenia.
France has said there is no need to close borders in response to the spread of virus in Italy.
Hungarian authorities issued a warning to citizens travelling to northern Italy, asking them to postpone their trip if possible, while incoming passengers will be screened at Budapest and Debrecen airports for fever symptoms.
Croatia meanwhile suspended all school strips to Italy for a month and advised against travel to Lombardy and Veneto, Italian media reported.

Thousands of Russian-linked social media accounts have launched a coordinated effort to spread alarm about the new coronavirus, disrupting global efforts to fight the epidemic, US officials say.
The disinformation campaign promotes unfounded conspiracy theories that the United States is behind the COVID-19 outbreak, in an apparent bid to damage the US image around the world by seizing on health concerns.
State Department officials tasked with combating Russian disinformation told AFP that false personas are being used on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to advance Russian talking points in multiple languages.
""Russia's intent is to sow discord and undermine US institutions and alliances from within, including through covert and coercive malign influence campaigns,"" said Philip Reeker, the acting Assistant Secretary of State for Europe and Eurasia. 
""By spreading disinformation about coronavirus, Russian malign actors are once again choosing to threaten public safety by distracting from the global health response,"" he said.
The claims that have been circulating in recent weeks include allegations that the virus is a US effort to ""wage economic war on China,"" that it is a biological weapon manufactured by the CIA or part of a Western-led effort ""to push anti-China messages.""
US individuals including Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, a philanthropist who has spent billions on global health programs, have also been falsely accused of involvement in the virus.
The disinformation campaign was identified by US monitors in mid-January after Chinese officials announced a third death from the new coronavirus in Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak.
More than 2,340 people have since died, mostly in China, and the number of cases exceeds 76,000, most are in China.
- Close coordination observed -
Several thousand online accounts -- previously identified for airing Russian-backed messages on major events such as the war in Syria, the Yellow Vest protests in France and Chile's mass demonstrations -- are posting ""almost near identical"" messages about the novel coronavirus, according to a report prepared for the State Department's Global Engagement Center and seen by AFP.
The accounts -- run by humans, not bots -- post at similar times in English, Spanish, Italian, German and French and can be linked back to Russian proxies, or carry similar messages to Russian-backed outlets such as RT and Sputnik, it said. 
Russian state-funded media started pushing anti-Western messages about the cause of the epidemic on January 20, with operators of the social media accounts beginning to post globally the following day, US officials say.
""In this case, we were able to see their full disinformation ecosystem in effect, including state TV, proxy web sites and thousands of false social media personas all pushing the same themes,"" said Special Envoy Lea Gabrielle, the head of the State Department's Global Engagement Center, which is tasked with tracking and exposing propaganda and disinformation.
During many past news events, the accounts would post actively for up to 72 hours. But messages about the new coronavirus have been uploaded every day over the past month -- a sign, US officials said, of Russia's investment in a story unlikely to disappear soon from the headlines.
""In the Russian doctrine of information confrontation, this is classic,"" said another official from the Global Engagement Center. 
""The number of coronavirus cases globally hasn't reached its apex, so the Russian strategy is to very cheaply but very effectively take advantage of the information environment to sow discord between us and China, or for economic purposes.""
Experts saw parallels with previous conspiracy theories traced to Moscow, including a KGB disinformation campaign in the 1980s that convinced many around the world that US scientists created the HIV virus that causes AIDS.
US intelligence has also said that Russia interfered through social media manipulation in the 2016 election and seeks to do so again in 2020. The Kremlin has denied the charges and President Donald Trump has scoffed at suggestions of Russian help.
- Risks seen in response -
Scientists believe the COVID-19 illness originated in late December in Wuhan at a market selling exotic animals for human consumption.
Bats are known carriers of this strain of the coronavirus, whose official name is SARS-CoV-2, but scientists think it spread to humans via another mammal species, possibly pangolins.
The US believes the latest Russian disinformation campaign is making it harder to respond to the epidemic, particularly in Africa and Asia, with some of the public becoming suspicious of the Western response.
The World Health Organization warned Friday that the window to stem the outbreak was narrowing, voicing alarm at a surge of cases with no clear link to China.
A State Department official said that Russian operatives appeared to have been given ""carte blanche"" to attack the US reputation.
""Whether or not a particular theme is being directed at the highest levels doesn't matter. It's the fact that they have freelance ability to operate in this space to do whatever damage they can, which could have seismic implications.""

TEHRAN - Iran on Saturday reported 1 more death among 10 new cases of coronavirus, bringing the total number of deaths in the Islamic republic to 5 and infections to 28.
""We have 10 new confirmed cases of COVID-19,"" health ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour said on state television.
""One of the new cases has unfortunately passed away,"" he added, noting that 8 of them had been hospitalized in Qom and 2 in Tehran, without specifying where the death occurred.
The COVID-19 outbreak first emerged in Iran on Wednesday, when officials said it killed 2 elderly people in Qom, a Shiite holy city south of the capital.
They were the first confirmed deaths from the disease in the Middle East.
Since then, Iran has carried out tests on 785 suspected cases, Jahanpour said.
""Most of the cases are either Qom residents or have a history of coming and going from Qom to other cities,"" the health ministry spokesman said.
Qom is a center for Islamic studies and pilgrims, attracting scholars from Iran and beyond. An official said the first 2 victims, who were Qom residents, had not left Iran.
Following the announcement of the deaths, neighboring Iraq on Thursday clamped down on travel to and from the Islamic republic, with its health ministry announcing people in Iran were barred from entering the country ""until further notice.""
Kuwait's national carrier Kuwait Airways also announced it would suspend all flights to Iran.

SHANGHAI - A 70-year-old man in China's Hubei province was infected with coronavirus but did not show symptoms until 27 days later, the local government said on Saturday, meaning the virus' incubation period could be much longer than the presumed 14 days.
A longer incubation period could complicate efforts to contain spread of the epidemic that has so far killed more than 2,000 people and spread outside China.

Drop in new China virus cases as toll reaches 2,345: government

The man, only identified by his family name, Jiang, on Jan. 24 drove his car back to Shennongjia, in northwestern Hubei, from eastern Ezhou, where he had close contact with his sister, who had been infected, according to the government website of Hubei, the virus epicenter.
He had a fever on Feb. 20 and tested positive for coronavirus a day later, according to the government statement.
