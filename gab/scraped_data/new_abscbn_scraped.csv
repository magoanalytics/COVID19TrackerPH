MANILA (4th UPDATE) - Philippine health authorities on Saturday raised Code Red as it confirmed local transmission and another case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the country, bringing the total number of patients to 6. 
Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said the latest patient is a 59-year-old woman who got infected from her 62-year-old husband, the country's fifth case of COVID-19. 
The man was, meanwhile, the first confirmed local transmission of the disease. 
The couple, who lives east of Manila, are now confined at the state-run Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) in Alabang, Muntinlupa City. Both have no recent travel history, records from the Bureau of Immigration (BI) showed.
""The DOH is currently exhausting all its efforts to identify others who may have come in contact with the confirmed cases to ensure that this localized transmission does not progress to community spread,"" Duque said.

What is Code Red?

To stem the spread of the disease, which has infected nearly 100,000 people and killed more than 3,300 worldwide, health authorities raised its alert system to ""Code Red, Sub-level 1.""
The alert is ""a preemptive call to ensure that national and local governments and public and private health care providers can prepare for possible increase in suspected and confirmed cases,"" Duque said.
A ""code red"" alert also means all hospital personnel are required to report for duty in their respective facilities to provide medical services. 
Announcing ""code red"" also prompted health authorities to recommend to President Rodrigo Duterte for the declaration of a state of public health emergency.

Duterte OKs declaration of state of public health emergency amid coronavirus spread- Go

In response to the DOH recommendation, the chief executive has agreed to declare a national public health emergency, according to Sen. Christopher ""Bong"" Go.
""Pursuant to the recommendation of the DOH and my suggestion as Chair of the Senate Committee on Health, President Rodrigo Duterte has agreed to issue a declaration of a State of Public Health Emergency due to the confirmation of a local transmission of COVID-19 in our country,"" he said.
In the event of a sustained community transmission or an increasing number of local cases whose links cannot be established, Duque said the strategy will be shifted from an intensive contact tracing to the implementation of community-level quarantine or lockdown and/or possibly, suspension of work or school.
SIXTH CASE
RITM director Dr. Celia Carlos revealed that the latest patient, who was admitted on March 5, was experiencing mild respiratory symptoms.
Her husband, the 5th coronavirus case who is suffering from severe pneumonia, is in critical condition, she added. 
""He still has severe pneumonia and other medical problems like diabetes and hypertension,"" Carlos said.
The man had coughs last Feb. 25 and was admitted at the Cardinal Santos Medical Center in San Juan City on March 1 with severe pneumonia. He tested positive on March 5. 
The man also frequented a Muslim prayer hall in San Juan, which has seen been disinfected. The worshipers in this prayer hall experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 have been asked to call the Department of Health hotline (02) 8651 7800 local 1149 o 1150 for referral to a health facility. 
According to Duque, the recovery of patients in critical condition is slow.
""Based on the experience, the clinical condition on severe cases as reported in China, it takes a very long time for them to recover from 3 to 6 weeks when critical. If mild, it's about 2 to 3 weeks,"" he said.
The first 3 COVID-19 cases in the Philippines involved Chinese nationals with history of travel to Wuhan, China, epicenter of the outbreak. One of them died of severe pneumonia on Feb. 1 while 2 recovered and have returned home. 
The fourth case, a 48-year-old Filipino man, had traveled to Japan, which has recorded 349 confirmed cases and 6 deaths from the illness. 
Health assistant secretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said the Philippines had 5 sub-national laboratories capable of diagnosing the virus.
These are the San Lazaro Hospital and Lung Center of the Philippines in Manila, Baguio General Hospital and Medical Center in Northern Luzon, Vicente Sotto Memorial Medical Center in the Visayas, and Southern Philippines Medical Center in Mindanao.
The country also has testing kits capable of completing about 2,500 procedures, Carlos added.
Duque also appealed to stakeholders to exercise utmost prudence in sharing sensitive information about suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19.
“Our objectives for sharing information are 2-pronged: ensure the public's health and safety by facilitating contact tracing and ensure that the individual’s right to privacy is not impinged. Hence, we appeal to all to coordinate closely with the Department of Health when disseminating information to the public and within their respective institutions. Let us make sure the information sharing process will yield the utmost benefit, and avoid unnecessary stress and stigma to individuals and institutions,"" the health chief said.

MANILA - The US Agency for International Development (USAID) has pledged millions of dollars of financial assistance to several countries, including the Philippines, to fight the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic.

Jean-Claude Coutausse, Pool/Reuters


PARIS - French officials have closed down about 120 schools in areas that have reported the largest numbers of coronavirus infections, and more could be shuttered in the coming days, Education Minister Jean-Michel Blanquer said Tuesday.
Both primary and secondary schools have been shut in the Oise department north of Paris, where the main cluster of French cases has emerged, and where 2 people who have died of the virus lived. 
Officials have reported 191 coronavirus cases in France so far, and 3 deaths.
The Oise closures are affecting about 35,000 pupils, Blanquer told LCI television, while an additional 9,000 have been told to stay home in the Morbihan department of Brittany on the Atlantic coast.
One class of some 20 students has been suspended in Montreuil, a suburb just east of Paris, after a pupil tested positive for the virus, Blanquer said.
The Oise schools will remain closed until further notice, while Morbihan authorities have ordered doors shut until at least March 14.
""These figures are evolving quickly,"" Blanquer said, adding: ""There could be similar measures taken in the coming days"" at other schools.
Authorities have already halted all class trips outside the country, and prohibited any gatherings of more than 5,000 people in enclosed spaces.
Schools are increasing stocks of soap for washing hands, but Blanquer said there were no plans to order a nationwide school shutdown, for now.
""It wouldn't make sense to confine everyone, to paralyze the country, it would be counter-productive,"" he said.
President Emmanuel Macron, who is scheduled to visit the health ministry's crisis management center on Tuesday, has called off several events this week as France scrambles to contain the outbreak.
Contagion fears have led to shortages of sanitizing hand gels and face masks, with suppliers racing to replenish stocks even though much of the production is in China, where authorities have closed thousands of factories after the coronavirus emerged there in December.
Demand for thermometers has also soared, with one French producer, STIL, relaunching production at its factory south of Paris for the first time in 15 years after having moved manufacturing to Chinese partners.
""We can't do without China completely, but with this coronavirus the balance could shift for French companies to not be completely reliant"" on Chinese producers, STIL's president Gerard Lux told AFP.

MANILA - All Filipinos living in Italy are free from the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) amid the rise of cases there, the Philippine foreign ministry said Tuesday.
""Based on reports from our posts in Rome and Milan as of today, no Filipinos have been reported as affected by COVID - PUM [person under monitoring], PUI [patient under investigation] or COVID positive,"" said Assistant Secretary Eduardo Meñez of the Department of Foreign Affairs' Office of Strategic Communication and Research.
The death toll from coronavirus in Italy jumped to 52 on Tuesday (Manila time) from 34 the day before.
The increase in deaths was the largest since the outbreak surfaced 10 days ago in the wealthy northern regions of Lombardy and Veneto.
Lombardy, around Italy's financial capital Milan, is by far the hardest hit, with 38 casualties.
The virus has since spread south but the vast majority of cases remain centered on the original hotspots, with the addition of Emilia Romagna, another affluent region which borders on both Lombardy and Veneto and now has more cases than Veneto.
In total, 2,036 people have tested positive in Italy, up from 1,694 on Sunday. Of these, 149 have recovered, the civil protection agency said. - With reports from Willard Cheng, ABS-CBN News and Gavin Jones and Angelo Amante, Reuters

MANILA - China's flag carrier Air China on Thursday will mount special flights from Beijing to Manila and vice versa to evacuate stranded passengers due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak.
The aircraft will depart Beijing at 10:55 a.m. and is set to arrive in Manila at 4:05 p.m., the Chinese Embassy in Manila said in a tweet.
It will return to Beijing at 5:40 p.m. and is expected to arrive at 10:35 p.m.
Asked about the flights, the embassy said ""there are still many people from both countries stranded in the other country and they need to return to their homes.""
The Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA), in an advisory published on Feb. 19, said some commercial flights in some parts of China were available for Filipinos who wished to return home.
These areas are Beijing, Chengdu, Chongqing, Guangzhou, Guiyang in Guizhou Province, Hong Kong, Kunming in Yunnan Province, Macau, Shanghai and Xiamen.
""Returning Filipinos are reminded of the mandatory 14-day quarantine upon arrival regulation implemented by the Bureau of Quarantine per guidelines of the Department of Health (DOH),"" the DFA said.
To stem the spread of the fast-spreading disease, the Philippine government in February imposed travel restrictions to China and its special administrative regions of Macau and Hong Kong. The ban on the two Chinese territories was eventually relaxed in favor of migrant workers and some specific visa holders.

ROME - The governor of Veneto, one of the regions worst hit by an outbreak in Italy of coronavirus, apologized on Saturday for criticizing China over the contagion and saying Chinese people ""eat live mice.""
Luca Zaia has pinned the blame on China for the flare-up in Italy, which has led to at least 21 deaths, saying that unlike Italians, the Chinese did not have good standards of hygiene.
""The hygiene that our people, the Venetians and the Italian citizens have, the cultural training we have, is that of taking a shower, of washing, of washing one's hands often,"" Zaia said in a Antenna 3-Nord Est TV television interview on Friday.
""It is a cultural fact that China has paid a big price for this epidemic because we have seen them all eat mice live or things like that.""
His words stung the Chinese embassy in Rome. ""At a crucial time like this, when China and Italy stand side-by-side to deal with the epidemic, an Italian politician has spared no slander about the Chinese people. This is a gratuitous attack that leaves us stunned,"" it wrote on Facebook.
Political opponents of Zaia also denounced his comments, saying they would damage ties between the 2 countries. The Veneto governor, who is a member of the rightist League party, said he had not meant to cause offense.
""My words came out badly, I agree. If anyone was offended, I am sorry,"" he told Corriere della Sera newspaper on Saturday. ""I wanted to say that when it comes to food health and safety, controls change from country to country.""
The new coronavirus emerged at the end of 2019 in the Chinese city of Wuhan where scientists believe it might have passed to humans from animals at a local market where bats, snakes and other wildlife were sold. 
China temporarily shut down all such markets in January, warning that eating wild animals posed a threat to public health and safety.
The total accumulated number of confirmed cases in Italy has risen to almost 900, latest data shows, making it the worst affected country in Europe.
In China, the virus has caused nearly 80,000 infections and 2,835 deaths, according to official figures.

MEXICO CITY - Mexico's health ministry said the country has confirmed 3 cases of the coronavirus, becoming the second Latin American nation reached by the global outbreak.
The 3 men -- 2 in Mexico City and 1 in the northern state of Sinaloa -- are all believed to have visited northern Italy, the epicenter of the virus in Europe.
""Probably all 3 were infected from the same source. All 3 are imported cases,"" Jose Luis Alomia, general director of epidemiology at the Ministry of Health, said at a press conference Friday.
Senior health ministry official Hugo Lopez-Gatell told a separate news conference that 1 of the men, a 35-year-old in the capital, ""has a mild, mild illness"" with symptoms ""similar to that of a cold.""
""He is a young individual and so he is at very low risk,"" he said.
The patient and 5 members of his family have been isolated at the National Institute of Respiratory Diseases, Lopez-Gatell added.
The second case, a 41-year-old man who returned from Bergamo in Italy, is in isolation at a hotel in Sinaloa after being tested by regional authorities, officials said.
A 59-year-old man in Mexico City who also visited northern Italy is the third case but authorities did not say whether he had been hospitalized.
Italy has recorded 650 cases of the coronavirus and 17 deaths across cities in the north.
In Mexico, 2 more suspected cases are under analysis in the central state of Guanajuato and 1 in northwestern Durango.

SEOUL - South Korea urged citizens on Saturday to stay indoors as it warned of a ""critical moment"" in its battle on the coronavirus after recording the biggest daily jump in infections, as 813 new cases took the tally to 3,150.
South Korea is grappling with the largest outbreak of the virus outside China, as a new death took the toll to 17, amid a record daily increase in infections since the country confirmed its first patient on Jan. 20.
""We have asked you to refrain from taking part in public events, including a religious gathering or protest, this weekend,"" Vice health minister Kim Kang-lip told a briefing.
It was a ""critical moment"" in reining in the spread of the virus, he said, adding, ""Please stay at home and refrain from going outside and minimize contact with other people.""
As many as 657 of the new cases were from southeastern Daegu city, the site of a church at the center of the outbreak, and 79 from the nearby province of North Gyeongsang, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) said.
In the nearby city of Gumi, LG Display has shut a display module plant for disinfection work until Tuesday, after an employee of a bank in the building tested positive for the virus.
Health authorities have run tests on more than 210,000 members and 65,000 trainees of the church linked to a majority of cases after a 61-year-old woman known as ""Patient 31"" attended religious services there before testing positive.
More than 88 percent have been checked, and about 3,300 have shown symptoms such as fever, Kim added.
Some provincial officials want to press criminal charges against the church, saying it refused to release a complete list of members, although the church denied the accusation, and urged an end to ""slander and oppression"" of its followers.
Kim said the government was working with the municipal authorities to check if the church provided an incomplete list.
A court rejected a plan by conservative groups critical of President Moon Jae-in for a massive weekend rally in downtown Seoul, citing health concerns.

""Kaya 'pag winter sa ibang bansa, talagang nagkakasakit. Higit sa malamig, madilim, walang araw. All of these, it weakens the immune system,"" ani Mercado, na ngayo'y deputy secretary-general ng Centers for Health in Humanitarian Action ng Philippine Red Cross.
""Hindi tayo maka-relate do'n eh. Palaging mainit at laging lalabas 'yong araw [dito]. Actually, pasalamat tayo maraming araw,"" dadgag niya.
Sa kabila ng pagkalat ng COVID-19 na nakapagdudulot ng respiratory infection, naobserbahan ni Mercado na mabilis kumalat ang sakit sa mga lugar na may malamig na klima, gaya ng China, Japan, Italy at South Korea.
""In the 2 months we've seen this virus, hindi natin siya nakikita na kumakalat ng sukdulan sa lugar na mainit, na marami, na libo-libo,"" aniya.
Base sa datos ng World Health Organization (WHO) nitong Biyernes, Pebrero 28, nakapagtala na ng higit 78,000 na kaso ng impeksiyon sa China, kung saan nagmula ang sakit. 
Karamihan dito ay nasa Hubei province na sentro ng outbreak at may daily average temperature na 7 degrees Celsius noong Enero at 10 degrees Celsius nitong Pebrero.
Sa hiwalay na panayam ng DZMM, sinabi ni Health Secretary Francisco Duque III na hindi sigurado kung may kinalaman ang klima sa bilis ng pagkalat ng virus.
""Ang Singapore, ang Malaysia maiinit din 'yan pero mayroon sila. In fact, ang Singapore nga mayroon silang local transmission. Siguro hindi gano'n ka agresibo 'yong virus sa maiinit na lugar pero hindi naman nangangahulugan na hindi siya tatama,"" aniya.
May 96 na kaso ng COVID-19 ang Singapore habang 24 naman sa Malaysia.
Nakapagtala naman ng 3 kaso ng coronavirus ang Pilipinas, kung saan isa ang namatay habang nag-negatibo na sa sakit ang 2 iba pa. Pareho silang mga Chinese na galing sa Wuhan City, Hubei province.
Sa kasalukayan, may binabantayan ang mga awtoridad na 30 pasyente na posibleng may novel coronavirus.

LOS ANGELES (UPDATE) - US health officials reported Friday a fourth case of novel coronavirus of unknown origin, indicating the disease was spreading in the country.
The latest case is a boy under 18 in Washington State who tested ""presumptive positive,"" local authorities said without releasing further details about the patient.
He is currently in home isolation in Snohomish County. The high school he attends will be shut until March 3 while it is deep cleaned, the Washington State Department of Health said.
In neighboring Oregon, authorities said Friday an adult who had had contact with people at an elementary school had been hospitalized and was also considered ""presumptive positive.""
A positive test is treated as ""presumptive"" until the results have been confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
""We've been expecting this and we're prepared for it,"" Oregon's Health Authority director Patrick Allen told reporters.
The school will be closed until March 4 as it undergoes a deep clean, officials said, adding they would talk to employees and parents.
Earlier Friday, Californian health authorities said an older woman was confirmed infected with unknown origin -- the second such case in the northern part of the state.
""This new case indicates that there is evidence of community transmission but the extent is still not clear,"" said Sara Cody, director of public health for Santa Clara County.
""What we know now is that the virus is here, present at some level, but we still don't know to what degree,"" she added.
The 2 cases in California are close to Silicon Valley, where tech giants like Apple, Google and Tesla are based.
The latest infections have heightened fears of an outbreak across the country.
President Donald Trump, however, downplayed the risk in the US at a campaign rally in South Carolina, accusing Democrats and the press of stirring up hysteria.
""We are preparing for the worst,"" he said. ""My administration has taken the most aggressive action in modern history to prevent the spread of this illness in the United States.""
He called the coronavirus the Democrats' ""new hoax.""
""The Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus. They're politicizing it,"" he said. ""They don't have any clue. They can't even count their votes in Iowa.""
According to the Centers for Disease Control more than 60 people are infected with the disease in the United States, the majority of them in California.
The state's governor Gavin Newsom said Thursday 33 people had tested positive for the virus, and 5 of them had left California.
Worldwide more than 85,000 people have been infected and over 2,900 have died.
The escalating number of cases has sent stock markets tumbling and heightened fears the disease could wreak havoc on the world economy.

Kazuhiro NOGI, AFP


TOKYO - Major cherry blossom festivals in Japan have been canceled due to the deadly new coronavirus, the latest in a growing list of events quashed as the epidemic spreads globally. 
The traditional spring celebrations in Tokyo and Osaka, which attract millions of people wanting to seeing the white and pink flowers, will not go ahead as planned in April.
""We are sincerely sorry for those who were looking forward to the viewing... but please give us your understanding,"" the Japan Mint in Osaka said Friday. 
Other cherry blossom events -- feverishly anticipated by locals and tourists -- are likely to follow suit, according to local media. 
Organizers of Tokyo's Nakameguro Cherry Blossom Festival said people could still enjoy the blooming trees that grow along public roads. 
Trees in Tokyo will soon be in full bloom, with friends, families and colleagues typically flocking to parks for sometimes raucous, alcohol-fueled celebrations.
The cancellations come as authorities step up efforts to tackle the outbreak in Japan, which has reported more than 230 infections and 5 deaths.
Schools are closed and the government is urging people to work from home or commute during off-peak hours and avoid large gatherings. 
The operator of Tokyo's 2 Disney resorts -- Disneyland and DisneySea -- said Friday the parks would be closed for around 2 weeks due to the virus.
Universal Studios Japan in Osaka has also shuttered for a fortnight.

Courtesy of the Quezon City Government


MANILA - The Quezon City government has started training village health workers as local first responders in handling contagious illnesses like the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Members of the Barangay Health Emergency Response Teams (BHERT) from 20 villages were taught how to properly wear personal protective equipment (PPEs) to prevent the risk of infection.
""Wearing PPEs involves a tedious process to make sure that the responder is fully protected from possible contamination,” said city epidemiologist Dr. Rolando Cruz.
Amid the global outbreak of the novel coronavirus, city mayor Joy Belmonte ordered the distribution of PPE kits to barangays.
Each PPE kit contains anti-fog goggles, disposable latex gloves, a disposable plastic shoe cover, a disposable coverall, a disposable surgical gown, an N95 face mask, a disposable surgical mask and a disposable cap.
The trainings were conducted after Interior Secretary Eduardo Año issued a memorandum ordering local chief executives to activate BHERTs to address the COVID-19 outbreak.
The DILG circular tasks BHERTs to visit the homes of persons who came from countries affected by the outbreak and list down names of persons that the traveler had contact with.
BHERTs are instructed to immediately isolate a suspected coronavirus carrier in a room away from family members and contact local authorities in transporting them to the nearest healthcare facility equipped to handle such cases.
For Cruz, communities should know how to properly respond to public health emergencies.
""Sa lahat ng health workers, parehas tayo magtulungan at gawing ligtas at maayos ang mga barangay. Trust the right information para sa ating mga nasasakupan sakaling maging community ang transmission ng COVID,” he said.
(To all health workers, let's work together and make our villages safe. Trust the right information in case the COVID transmission becomes local.)
The novel coronavirus, believed to have originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan, has infected more than 83,000 people all over the world, according to data from the World Health Organization (WHO).
The fast-spreading illness also killed more than 2,800 people, majority in China.
In the Philippines, health authorities were monitoring 30 people suspected of carrying the strain of COVID-19 as of Friday. Three Chinese nationals who had traveled to the Philippines were earlier confirmed to have contracted the disease, one of whom died.

HONG KONG - All pets of people in Hong Kong infected with the coronavirus will be quarantined, with 1 dog already in isolation, the city's authorities said Friday.
The move is the first reported case anywhere in the world of a government quarantining pets over the outbreak and was prompted by a positive test in the pet of an infected patient.
The canine has been placed in quarantine for 14 days as a precaution but has no ""relevant symptoms,"" Hong Kong officials said Friday.
""Nasal and oral cavity samples tested weak positive for COVID-19,"" a government spokesman said without explaining why they tested the animal in the first place.
He said it was unclear whether the dog had actually contracted the virus or tested positive for low levels due to environmental contamination of the dog's mouth and nose.
The animal was collected from the owner's home on Wednesday after the 60-year-old woman was diagnosed with the contagion and placed in a hospital isolation ward.
It would be closely monitored, undergo further tests and held in quarantine until it returned a negative result, authorities said.
There is no evidence domestic animals such as dogs and cats can catch the virus or transmit it to humans but the department said all pets of infected people should be quarantined and tested for the virus for 14 days.
The financial hub has confirmed 94 cases of the new coronavirus in humans, with 2 deaths earlier this month. 
The epidemic, which emerged in central China in December, has infected more than 83,000 people globally.

TOKYO (UPDATE) - Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe called Thursday on schools to close nationwide from March 2 for several weeks to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus.
""The government considers the health and safety of children above anything else,"" Abe said.
""We request all primary, junior high and high schools... across the nation to close temporarily from March 2 next week until their spring break.""
The spring break for public schools usually starts in late March in Japan and lasts several weeks.
""Efforts to prevent the spread of infections among children are being made in various areas,"" Abe added. 
Many public elementary schools and junior high schools in northern Hokkaido were already closed on Thursday after the governor requested public schools to close for about a week.
The city of Osaka also said it will close its kindergartens, elementary and junior high schools from Saturday for 2 weeks.
Abe's call comes after the government urged organizers of major events to consider cancelling them, and called on businesses to allow employees to work from home or commute off-peak.
Authorities have said the coming 2 to 3 weeks will be critical in determining whether they can stem the outbreak of the virus, which has infected nearly 200 people in the country and been linked to the deaths of 3.
Japan has also struggled to deal with the fallout from a cruise ship that it quarantined off its coast, where more than 700 people tested positive for the virus. Four people who became sick on the boat have died.
""It's extremely important to prevent one patient cluster from creating another and we think we should take thorough measures,"" Abe said at a cabinet-level meeting on the virus.
He also urged ministers to work on legislation for minimizing the negative impact on the economy and daily lives of Japanese.

MADRID - With governments scrambling to contain a slew of new coronavirus cases popping up across Europe, here is an overview of the countries affected, where people have died and the precautions being taken. 
ITALY
With 12 deaths and 400 infections, Italy is the European country worst affected by the COVID-19 outbreak. It has also been a point of contagion with many cases in other countries involving people who returned home after travelling in infection-hit areas of northern Italy.
FRANCE
France has so far registered 18 infections and 2 deaths, and has urged its nationals to delay any plans to visit virus hot spots in northern Italy. Students returning from China, Singapore, South Korea and the Italian regions of Lombardy and Venice are being asked to remain at home for 2 weeks after their return. 
GERMANY
In Germany, 18 people have been infected including 2 diagnosed on Tuesday. One is a 25-year-old man believed to have been infected in the Italian city of Milan. 
BRITAIN
Britain has so far recorded 13 cases since the start of the epidemic. The government has requested travelers returning from affected areas in northern Italy, China, South Korea and Iran to isolate themselves and inform authorities.
SPAIN
The same has happened in Spain, which has registered 12 cases, 10 of which have been detected since Monday. Nine involved Italians or people who had recently visited Italy. 
Among that number are 4 Italians who were visiting Tenerife in the Canary Islands. The hotel where they were staying has been quarantined. 
To curb the spread, Madrid has advised against travel in northern Italy and sought to identify other potential cases that may have slipped under the radar by testing those already in hospital with respiratory problems or returning from high-risk areas with flu-like symptoms. 
CROATIA
Three people have tested positive for the virus, including a young man who recently stayed in Italy and his brother. A third case was detected Wednesday in a man who works in the Italian city of Parma.
AUSTRIA
A young Italian couple have tested positive. The Innsbruck hotel where the woman worked as a receptionist was initially placed in quarantine but the measure was lifted on Wednesday following tests. Austria has also urged its nationals to avoid visiting affected areas of neighboring Italy. 
FINLAND
Two virus infections were confirmed Wednesday -- a Chinese tourist in Lapland and a second case involving a Finnish national who had recently visited northern Italy.
SWEDEN
Two cases have been detected so far. One was registered at the end of January in a woman who had visited Wuhan, the Chinese city where the virus emerged in December. On Wednesday a second infection was discovered.
BELGIUM
One case was detected in a Belgian national who was repatriated from Wuhan in early February. He has completed his quarantine period.
GEORGIA
Georgia on Wednesday announced the first confirmed case of the novel coronavirus in the South Caucasus region.
GREECE
Athens announced its first infection on Wednesday, a woman aged 38 who had recently returned from northern Italy. 
The Greek government said Tuesday that in the event of a mass outbreak, it would activate temporary restrictions on travel to and from countries with a large number of infections as well as temporarily close schools, places of worship, cinemas, theaters, sports halls and businesses.
NORTH MACEDONIA
One case has been detected -- a woman who recently returned from Italy. 
SWITZERLAND
A first case was detected on Tuesday in a man in his 70s who was infected near Milan.
ROMANIA
Romania reported its first case on Wednesday -- a man who was in contact with an Italian who visited the country last week.
NORWAY
Norwegian health authorities announced Wednesday the first case of the new coronavirus in the Nordic nation in someone who returned from China last week. They said the patient was not ""in danger.""

TOKYO - A woman working as a tour-bus guide in Japan tested positive for the coronavirus for a second time, Osaka's prefectural government said Wednesday, the first person in the country to do so amid growing concerns about the spread of the infection.
The second positive test comes as the number of confirmed cases in Japan rose to 186 by Thursday from around 170 the day before. Tokyo has urged big gatherings and sports events be scrapped or curtailed for 2 weeks to contain the virus while pledging the 2020 Olympic Games will still go ahead in the city.
The 186 cases reported by Japan's health ministry are separate from 704 reported from an outbreak on a cruise liner that was quarantined off Tokyo earlier this month. A total of 7 people have died, including 4 from the ship.
The woman, a resident of Osaka in western Japan, tested positive on Wednesday after developing a sore throat and chest pains, the prefectural government said in a statement, describing her as being in her 40s. She first tested positive in late January and was discharged from the hospital after recovering on Feb. 1, according to the statement.
The health ministry confirmed the case was the first in Japan where a patient tested positive for coronavirus for a second time after being discharged from hospital, the Nikkei newspaper said.
Though a first in Japan, cases of second positive tests have been reported in China, where the disease originated late last year. The outbreak has spread rapidly and widely, infecting about 80,000 people globally and killing nearly 2,800, the vast majority in mainland China.
""Once you have the infection, it could remain dormant and with minimal symptoms, and then you can get an exacerbation if it finds its way into the lungs,"" said Philip Tierno Jr., Professor of Microbiology and Pathology at NYU School of Medicine.
He said much remains unknown about the virus. ""I'm not certain that this is not bi-phasic, like anthrax,"" he said, meaning the disease appears to go away before recurring.
Asked to comment on prospects for the Olympic Games going ahead in Tokyo this summer, Prof. Tierno said, ""The Olympics should be postponed if this continues... There are many people who don't understand how easy it is to spread this infection from one person to another.""
Japan has changed its strategy in combating the contagion, seeking to slow its spread and minimize the number of deaths.
As part of the attempt to contain the outbreak, Tokyo Olympics officials are considering scaling down the torch relay, Tokyo 2020 CEO Toshiro Muto said Wednesday.
The government is also considering scaling back this year's March 11 memorial ceremony for victims of 2011's massive earthquake and tsunami, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told reporters on Thursday.
Meanwhile, a major Japanese bank reported an employee had tested positive for coronavirus. MUFG Bank, part of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc, the country's largest lender by assets, said a member of staff at a branch in central Aichi prefecture, had been confirmed to have the virus on Wednesday.

When does an epidemic become a pandemic? As the novel coronavirus continues its spread across the globe, what does the designation mean to world healthcare systems as they try to rein in the deadly disease? 
The World Health Organization has yet to declare the current outbreak, which originated in central China last month, a pandemic. 
It has indicated however that we should prepare ourselves for one.
The WHO defines a pandemic as a situation in which ""the whole world's population would likely be exposed to this infection and potentially a proportion of them fall sick,"" said its emergencies director Michael Ryan.
WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that countries should be doing everything they could ""to prepare for a potential pandemic"".
""For the moment we are not witnessing the uncontained global spread of this virus and we are not witnessing large-scale deaths,"" he said on Monday.
While the number of fresh cases in mainland China has slowed slightly in recent weeks, several other countries have seen infections mushroom. 
These include South Korea, which has seen more than 1,100 people infected, and Italy, with more than 300 confirmed cases.
On Tuesday Iran reported four more deaths, taking the total number of fatalities to 19 and confirmed infections to 139.
""What we see are epidemics in different parts of the world, affecting countries in different ways and requiring a tailored response,"" said Tedros.
The WHO has not updated its designation of the outbreak since January 30, when it classed it as ""a public health emergency of international concern"".
Under its old warning system, which had six stages of alert, the WHO could simply start referring to coronavirus as a pandemic, which comes from the Ancient Greek for ""pan demos"": all people.
""Definitions and terminology aside, our advice remains the same,"" said WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic.
For Bharat Pankhania, of the University of Exeter Medical School in England, coronavirus is already a pandemic ""in all but name"".
""It's only a matter of time before the World Health Organisation starts to use the term in its communications,"" he said.
David Heymann, professor of Infectious Disease Epidemiology at London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine said the terminology risked being a distraction. 
""What is necessary is to understand the current situation in each country,"" he said.
Tedros did hint that designating the outbreak a pandemic prematurely might do more harm than good.
""Using the word pandemic now does not fit the facts, but it may certainly cause fear. This is not the time to focus on what word we use,"" he said.
He added that even if a pandemic is declared, the world alone ""will not prevent a single infection today or save a single life today.""

The world is ""simply not ready"" to rein in the new coronavirus outbreak, the head of a joint WHO-China mission of experts said Tuesday, urging countries to learn from China's expertise.
""You have to be ready to manage this at a larger scale... and it has to be done fast,"" Bruce Aylward told reporters in Geneva, insisting countries everywhere have to ""be ready as if this hits us tomorrow"".
His comments came after the World Health Organization announced that the epidemic had peaked at its epicenter in China, where it has killed more than 2,600 people and infected over 77,000 others.

But the situation has worsened elsewhere with nearly 2,700 other cases and more than 40 deaths globally. That has prompted restrictions on travelers from infected nations, the cancellation of football matches and national efforts to isolate suspected patients.
Aylward, who led an international mission of experts to China that wrapped up on Monday, hailed the dramatic and concerted measures taken in that country to rein in the outbreak.
But he voiced concern that other countries were not preparing quickly enough to react if they were hit hard by the outbreak.
""How many countries are planning hospital bed, planning ventilators... and the lab capacity to be able to manage this?"" he asked
""There has to be a shift in mindset,"" he insisted. ""You have to plan.""

Austria, Croatia report first cases of coronavirus infection

But so far, he warned, countries ""are simply not ready"".
He also cautioned that China's quick response and quality treatment of COVID-19 cases may have given other countries ""a false sense of security"".
""China knows how to keep people alive from COVID... That is not going to be the case everywhere in the world,"" he said. ""It is a serious disease.""
He voiced particular concern that poorer countries with weak health care systems were the most at risk.
Aylward also said his team's findings in China appeared to belie theories circulating that the number of cases being detected is only the tip of the iceberg and that a lot of undetected transmission is going on.
""There is not a lot of evidence of that,"" he said.

SEOUL - South Korean health authorities said on Tuesday they aim to test more than 200,000 members of a church at the center of a surge of new coronavirus cases that has taken the country's tally to 893.
South Korea's fast-spreading outbreak has fueled fears that the coronavirus, which is believed to have begun in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in December, is developing into a global pandemic.
About 60 percent of South Korea's cases have been linked to the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, where the first case was reported in a 61-year-old woman, but it is not known how she became infected.
Of 60 new cases reported on Tuesday, 16 were in the southeastern city of Daegu, where the church is located, and 33 from nearby North Gyeongsang Province, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.
South Korea also reported its ninth death from the virus, a patient from a hospital in North Gyeongsang Province.
The leader of the Shincheonji Church said it had agreed to provide authorities with the names of all its members in South Korea, estimated by media at about 215,000 people.
The government would conduct coronavirus tests on all members ""as soon as possible"" once it got the information, the prime minister's office said in a statement.
""It is essential to test all of the church members in order to contain the spread of the virus and relieve public anxiety,"" the office said.
Vice Health Minister Kim Kang-lip said the priority was to test some 1,300 of the 9,200 members of the Daegu church who are showing symptoms, which he said would be completed by Wednesday.
""We will make utmost efforts with the goal of stabilizing the situation in Daegu within 4 weeks,"" he told a briefing, adding that the government would trace all other Daegu citizens having symptoms for isolation and checks.
US WARNING
The church, which has faced public criticism of its handling of the outbreak, asked the government to ensure the personal details of its members did not become public.
The church founder and self-proclaimed messiah, Lee Man-hee, said the church was cooperating with the government to stop the outbreak and beside its members, it would also check people in church training programs.
""All of these will be implemented on the premise that the government takes steps to protect their personal information,"" Lee said in a letter posted online.
North Gyeongsang Province has also seen surges in cases in recent weeks, most from a hospital in Cheongdo, which was designated a ""special care zone"" along with Daegu last week.
On Tuesday, 21 of the 33 cases from the province were confirmed to have come from a residential home for the disabled people in Chilgok County, also near Daegu, traced to a worker there whose mother is a member of the Shincheonji church in Daegu, Governor Lee Cheol-woo said.
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, meanwhile, raised its warning level for South Korea and recommended Americans avoid all nonessential travel to the country, citing the ""widespread, ongoing outbreak"" of the coronavirus.
The US and South Korean militaries said they were considering scaling back joint training due, in one of the first concrete signs of the virus' fallout on global US military activities.
South Korean Defense Minister Jeong Kyeong-doo told a news conference in Washington 13 cases had been confirmed in the South Korean armed forces.
More than 400 South Korean citizens were set to return from Israel, which imposed an entry ban and arranged 2 charter flights after more than 2 dozen South Korean Catholics who had gone on a pilgrimage there tested positive for the virus.

NEXU Science Communication via Reuters


GENEVA - The new coronavirus has peaked in China but could still grow into a pandemic, the World Health Organization has warned, as infections mushroom in other countries.
Financial markets have gone into a tailspin after grim news of deaths and outbreaks in the Middle East, Europe and Asia, even as the Chinese epicenter appeared to be calming, with the death toll at its lowest for 3 weeks.
But the situation is worsening in other countries, with more than 2,000 cases and 30 deaths reported abroad, prompting a raft of restrictions on travelers from infected nations.
South Korea, Italy and Iran have logged particularly sharp increases in infections and deaths, while several countries in the Middle East reported their first cases of the novel coronavirus.
But WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyes insisted the virus could still be contained, praising China's drastic quarantine measures in several cities for helping to prevent an even bigger spread.
""For the moment we are not witnessing the uncontained global spread of this virus and we are not witnessing large-scale deaths,"" Tedros told reporters in Geneva.
He added, however, that countries should be ""doing everything we can to prepare for a potential pandemic.""
The term ""pandemic"" is used to describe an illness that spreads across numerous communities.
SOUTH KOREA HOTSPOT
South Korea, which has the largest number of cases outside China, reported 60 more infections and 1 more fatality on Tuesday, raising its death toll to 8 and total patients to nearly 900.
South Korea's outbreak has centered around a religious sect in Daegu, the country's fourth largest city.
The country is on its highest ""red"" alert. As part of the containment efforts, school holidays were extended nationally while the 2.5 million people of Daegu were told to remain indoors.

South Korea reports 60 new coronavirus cases, total 893

The US Centers for Disease Control raised its caution level to warn Americans against ""all non-essential travel to South Korea.""
Italy, which has reported 7 deaths and over 200 cases, has locked down 11 towns, while upcoming football matches in its Serie A and the Europa League will be played behind closed doors. 
With police manning checkpoints to enforce a blockade, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte has said that residents could face weeks of lockdown.
IRAN FEARS
The disease -- officially known as COVID-19 -- spread to new countries including Afghanistan, Bahrain, Iraq, Kuwait and Oman.
At least 12 people have died in Iran, the highest toll outside China.
But there were concerns the situation might be worse than officially acknowledged. The semi-official ILNA news agency quoted 1 local lawmaker in hard-hit Qom -- a religious center -- who said 50 people had died there.
The Iranian government denied the report, and pledged transparency.

Iran says 43 infected with coronavirus, 8 dead - official

Even so, authorities have only reported 64 infections in Iran, an unusually small number that would mean an extremely high mortality rate.
Michael Ryan, head of WHO's health emergencies program, said a team from the UN agency would be arriving in Iran on Tuesday.
But he cautioned against drawing any conclusions about the mortality rate. Iran ""may only be detecting severe cases"" because the epidemic was still at an early stage, he said.
Several countries have taken measures to prevent arrivals from Iran.
CHINA PEAK
In China, 508 new cases were reported, with all but 9 at the epicenter in central Hubei province. Although that was up from 409 on Monday it was much lower than new infections being reported just a week ago.
China's death toll reached 2,663 on Tuesday, after 71 more people died.
WHO's Tedros said the epidemic peaked in China between Jan. 23 and Feb. 2.
China has placed some 56 million in Hubei and its capital under quarantine since late last month, while other regions have enacted some forms of travel curbs and measures to keep millions more people indoors.
Bruce Aylward, leader of a WHO mission of international experts, said late Monday it was time for China to start lifting some of the restrictions.

TOKYO (UPDATE) - A fourth person has died after being taken to hospital from a quarantined coronavirus-stricken cruise ship off Japan, local media reported on Tuesday.
Public broadcaster NHK and other local outlets said the fatality was a man in his 80s, with the Yomiuri Shimbun saying the man had tested positive for the new coronavirus and died of pneumonia.
The health minister did not immediately respond to a request to confirm the reports.
Three others, all Japanese, have so far died after becoming sick on the ship. Two were confirmed to have the new coronavirus, while the health ministry declined to comment on whether the third person tested positive for the virus.
At least 691 people who were on board the Diamond Princess have so far tested positive for COVID-19, according to the health ministry.
Around a 1,000 people were allowed to leave the ship after it completed a 14-day quarantine if they tested negative and displayed no symptoms.
But several people who left the boat after getting the all-clear have since tested positive, and the health ministry has admitted some people were allowed to disembark despite not being tested during the quarantine.
Separately, Japan has confirmed at least 156 cases of infection with the virus, and 1 death.

CASALPUSTERLENGO - Italy reported Monday its fifth death from the new coronavirus, as the number of people contracting the disease continued to mount and officials called for calm.
The death of an 88-year-old man was the fourth in the northern Lombardy region, where villages have been put under lockdown and security measures enforced in a bid to stem the spread of the disease.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte has said that residents could face weeks in lockdown in an effort to sit out the virus.
Angelo Borrelli, head of the country's civil protection agency, said 219 people had now tested positive in Italy, which has the most confirmed cases in Europe.
Five people have died of the virus in the past 4 days, including 1 in the Veneto region.
An Alitalia flight from Rome was being held in Mauritius Monday, after 40 people from Lombady and Veneto were told they could not disembark unless they consented to being placed in quarantine.
Alitalia said it was arranging for their immediate repatriation instead, despite none of the passengers showing any symptoms.
Eleven towns -- 10 in Lombardy and 1 in neighboring Veneto -- are under lockdown, with some 50,000 residents prohibited from leaving.
Regional authorities have ordered gathering spots, such as bars, restaurants, cinemas and discos to close.
The spread of the virus has disrupted high profile events including Milan Fashion Week and the Venice Carnival, while Serie A football matches have been postponed. Operas have also had to be cancelled at Milan's famed La Scala.
Masses in churches across the affected regions have been cancelled and funerals limited to immediate relatives only.
The stock market in Milan was down nearly 5 percent on Monday in a broad-based sell-off over virus fears.
'OUTBREAK IN HOSPITAL'
Most of the cases in Italy are in Lombardy, a prosperous region in the country's north where Milan is located.
They can be traced back to a 38-year-old man in the town of Codogno whom authorities have called ""patient one.""
Investigators are reconstructing minute by minute the man's movements over the past few weeks -- where he slept, ate, walked -- in a bid to trace everyone he could have come into contact with.
""We had the most unfortunate situation possible; the outbreak of an epidemic in a hospital,"" infectious disease expert Massimo Galli told the Corriere della Sera daily.
""Unfortunately, in these cases, a hospital can turn into a frightening amplifier of contagion,"" he said.
The 38-year old patient had not traveled to China and doctors failed to treat him with the necessary precautions.
The man initially believed to have given him the virus after returning from Shanghai later tested negative.
""We still do not know who brought the coronavirus to Codogno,"" Galli said.
'EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO TRACK'
Simon Clarke, Cellular Microbiology associate professor at Reading University in England, said: ""It seems that the virus can pass from person to person without symptoms, making it extremely difficult to track, regardless of what health authorities do.""
""While it remains the case that most people who become infected will have light symptoms or none at all, such uncontrollable spread would present a serious risk to vulnerable individuals.""
Fontana urged residents to stay calm and stop panic buying.
""Rushing to stock up on food doesn't make any sense. There are enough supplies.""
Milan mayor Beppe Sala echoed his plea, saying: ""Rather than dashing to the supermarkets to grab food, perhaps we should spend time looking after the most vulnerable, such as old people, who are particularly at risk.""
Schools have been closed as a precaution in Lombardy, Veneto, Piedmont, Emilia Romagna and Friuli Venezia Giulia.
Piedmont shares a border with France, while the other regions neighbor Switzerland, Austria and Slovenia.
France has said there is no need to close borders in response to the spread of virus in Italy.
Hungarian authorities issued a warning to citizens travelling to northern Italy, asking them to postpone their trip if possible, while incoming passengers will be screened at Budapest and Debrecen airports for fever symptoms.
Croatia meanwhile suspended all school strips to Italy for a month and advised against travel to Lombardy and Veneto, Italian media reported.

Thousands of Russian-linked social media accounts have launched a coordinated effort to spread alarm about the new coronavirus, disrupting global efforts to fight the epidemic, US officials say.
The disinformation campaign promotes unfounded conspiracy theories that the United States is behind the COVID-19 outbreak, in an apparent bid to damage the US image around the world by seizing on health concerns.
State Department officials tasked with combating Russian disinformation told AFP that false personas are being used on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to advance Russian talking points in multiple languages.
""Russia's intent is to sow discord and undermine US institutions and alliances from within, including through covert and coercive malign influence campaigns,"" said Philip Reeker, the acting Assistant Secretary of State for Europe and Eurasia. 
""By spreading disinformation about coronavirus, Russian malign actors are once again choosing to threaten public safety by distracting from the global health response,"" he said.
The claims that have been circulating in recent weeks include allegations that the virus is a US effort to ""wage economic war on China,"" that it is a biological weapon manufactured by the CIA or part of a Western-led effort ""to push anti-China messages.""
US individuals including Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, a philanthropist who has spent billions on global health programs, have also been falsely accused of involvement in the virus.
The disinformation campaign was identified by US monitors in mid-January after Chinese officials announced a third death from the new coronavirus in Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak.
More than 2,340 people have since died, mostly in China, and the number of cases exceeds 76,000, most are in China.
- Close coordination observed -
Several thousand online accounts -- previously identified for airing Russian-backed messages on major events such as the war in Syria, the Yellow Vest protests in France and Chile's mass demonstrations -- are posting ""almost near identical"" messages about the novel coronavirus, according to a report prepared for the State Department's Global Engagement Center and seen by AFP.
The accounts -- run by humans, not bots -- post at similar times in English, Spanish, Italian, German and French and can be linked back to Russian proxies, or carry similar messages to Russian-backed outlets such as RT and Sputnik, it said. 
Russian state-funded media started pushing anti-Western messages about the cause of the epidemic on January 20, with operators of the social media accounts beginning to post globally the following day, US officials say.
""In this case, we were able to see their full disinformation ecosystem in effect, including state TV, proxy web sites and thousands of false social media personas all pushing the same themes,"" said Special Envoy Lea Gabrielle, the head of the State Department's Global Engagement Center, which is tasked with tracking and exposing propaganda and disinformation.
During many past news events, the accounts would post actively for up to 72 hours. But messages about the new coronavirus have been uploaded every day over the past month -- a sign, US officials said, of Russia's investment in a story unlikely to disappear soon from the headlines.
""In the Russian doctrine of information confrontation, this is classic,"" said another official from the Global Engagement Center. 
""The number of coronavirus cases globally hasn't reached its apex, so the Russian strategy is to very cheaply but very effectively take advantage of the information environment to sow discord between us and China, or for economic purposes.""
Experts saw parallels with previous conspiracy theories traced to Moscow, including a KGB disinformation campaign in the 1980s that convinced many around the world that US scientists created the HIV virus that causes AIDS.
US intelligence has also said that Russia interfered through social media manipulation in the 2016 election and seeks to do so again in 2020. The Kremlin has denied the charges and President Donald Trump has scoffed at suggestions of Russian help.

Bats are known carriers of this strain of the coronavirus, whose official name is SARS-CoV-2, but scientists think it spread to humans via another mammal species, possibly pangolins.
The US believes the latest Russian disinformation campaign is making it harder to respond to the epidemic, particularly in Africa and Asia, with some of the public becoming suspicious of the Western response.
The World Health Organization warned Friday that the window to stem the outbreak was narrowing, voicing alarm at a surge of cases with no clear link to China.
A State Department official said that Russian operatives appeared to have been given ""carte blanche"" to attack the US reputation.
""Whether or not a particular theme is being directed at the highest levels doesn't matter. It's the fact that they have freelance ability to operate in this space to do whatever damage they can, which could have seismic implications.""

TEHRAN - Iran on Saturday reported 1 more death among 10 new cases of coronavirus, bringing the total number of deaths in the Islamic republic to 5 and infections to 28.
""We have 10 new confirmed cases of COVID-19,"" health ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour said on state television.
""One of the new cases has unfortunately passed away,"" he added, noting that 8 of them had been hospitalized in Qom and 2 in Tehran, without specifying where the death occurred.
The COVID-19 outbreak first emerged in Iran on Wednesday, when officials said it killed 2 elderly people in Qom, a Shiite holy city south of the capital.
They were the first confirmed deaths from the disease in the Middle East.
Since then, Iran has carried out tests on 785 suspected cases, Jahanpour said.
""Most of the cases are either Qom residents or have a history of coming and going from Qom to other cities,"" the health ministry spokesman said.
Qom is a center for Islamic studies and pilgrims, attracting scholars from Iran and beyond. An official said the first 2 victims, who were Qom residents, had not left Iran.
Following the announcement of the deaths, neighboring Iraq on Thursday clamped down on travel to and from the Islamic republic, with its health ministry announcing people in Iran were barred from entering the country ""until further notice.""

A longer incubation period could complicate efforts to contain spread of the epidemic that has so far killed more than 2,000 people and spread outside China.

BEIJING - China is bringing in 7 cruise ships to house medical workers in Wuhan, state media said on Saturday, at a time when such ships are under scrutiny after hundreds of passengers on the Diamond Princess liner in Japan contracted the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
The first of these ships, the Blue Whale, arrived in Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, on Friday from Yichang, a nearby city down the Yangtze River.
The 7 ships will provide 1,469 beds in total.
Tens of thousands of medical workers have been brought into central Hubei province and its capital, Wuhan, from across China to help contain the coronavirus outbreak.
A senior Chinese health official said last week as of Feb. 11, 1,716 health workers had been infected by the coronavirus, including several who died.
The ships are normally used for river cruises in the Three Gorges scenic area, Xinhua added.
The ships are expected to provide safe dining and living conditions for medics to keep them refreshed as they fight the epidemic, state media said.
The Diamond Princess, held under quarantine in Yokohoma, Japan, since Feb. 3, has reported more than 630 cases, accounting for the biggest infection cluster outside China.
Several countries have already evacuated scores of passengers from the ship, which carried about 3,700 people. A second group of Chinese citizens from Hong Kong were among those flown home from Japan, Xinhua reported.

MELBOURNE - The Australian government said Saturday it would allow the return of some Chinese high school students who have been blocked from entering the country due to coronavirus restrictions, reopening its doors to a market that is key for the economy.
Thousands of Chinese students were prevented from heading to Australia after the long summer break for the start of school and university terms this month when the government imposed a travel ban for most people travelling from China.
Australian officials said the targeted easing of the ban would allow about 760 Chinese high school students - none from Hubei province, which is the epicenter of the outbreak - to apply to return.
The students would be considered on a case-by-case basis and those who were successful would be subjected to a 14-day self-imposed quarantine on arrival in Australia, officials said.
""It is incredibly important that we bring some normality back to the international student market,"" Education Minister Dan Tehan told reporters. ""It is a small step we are taking, it is a precautionary step.""
Tehan said the government would next week consider whether to allow the return of tertiary education students.
Chinese students made up almost 40 percent of the international higher education population in Australia in 2018, according to the most recent official data.
That broader population has grown by more than 10 percent over each of the past 3 years, contributing more than A$30 billion ($21 billion) to the domestic economy.
Australia introduced its travel restrictions on all foreign nationals who had been in China within 2 weeks of planned travel to Australia from entering the country.
Australian nationals and permanent residents were exempt from the ban, which has been extended twice and remains in place until Feb. 29.

SEOUL (UPDATE) - South Korea reported 142 more coronavirus cases Saturday, the sharpest spike in infections yet, with many new cases involving patients being treated in hospital for mental health issues.
The national toll of 346 is now the second-highest outside of China, with the jump in cases at the hospital in the southern city of Cheongdo following a similar spike among members of a religious sect in the nearby city of Daegu.
Among the new cases, 92 were ""related"" to patients or staff at Cheongdo Daenam Hospital, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) said.
""Most of the hospital's patients who have been diagnosed are those who had been staying as inpatients for mental illnesses,"" Seoul's vice health minister Kim Gang-lip told reporters.
Some cases show ""no confirmed epidemiological connections,"" meaning they are not sure where or how they contracted the virus, he added.
Authorities reported another death on Saturday, taking the toll to 2. Both victims had been inpatients at the hospital.
Almost 170 members of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus have now been infected, starting with a 61-year-old woman who attended at least 4 services at the church's Daegu branch before being diagnosed.
""Those who are related to Shincheonji's Daegu branch account for 48 percent of all confirmed cases,"" KCDC director Jung Eun-kyeong told reporters.
KCDC said some 9,300 Shincheonji members in Daegu have either been quarantined at facilities or have been asked to stay at home. Among them, 1,261 said they had symptoms, health officials added.
The mayor of Daegu -- South Korea's fourth-biggest city, with a population of over 2.5 million -- has advised locals to stay indoors, while access to a major US military base in the area has been restricted.
CHURCH 'DEEPLY SORRY'
One of the Shincheonji members in Daegu visited China -- where the deadly virus was first detected -- in January, while some 3 others are believed to have traveled to other countries, KCDC director Jung said.
Cheongdo, some 27 kilometers south of Daegu, is the birthplace of Shincheonji's founder Lee Man-hee.
County officials said on Friday that a 3-day funeral was held for one of the church members 3 weeks ago at a hall owned by the Cheongdo hospital.
Shincheonji is often accused of being a cult and claims its founder Lee has donned the mantle of Jesus Christ and will take 144,000 people with him to heaven on the day of judgement.
But with more church members than available places in heaven, they are said to have to compete for slots and pursue converts persistently and secretively.
President Moon Jae-in on Friday called for a ""thorough investigation"" of everyone who attended the funeral and Shincheonji services.
The central government on Friday had declared Daegu and Cheongdo ""special management zones,"" with Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun saying the region would be supported with medical personnel, beds and equipment.
Authorities in Seoul banned public rallies at 3 main locations on health and safety grounds.
The US army garrison in Daegu -- where around 10,000 soldiers, civilians and family members live or work -- has restricted access and instructed any American troops who recently attended Shincheonji services to self-quarantine.
Shincheonji offered an apology, suspending its worship services and gatherings nationwide.
""We are deeply sorry that because of 1 of our members, who thought of her condition as a cold because she had not traveled abroad, led to many in our church being infected and thereby caused concern to the local community,"" it said in a statement.
But its leader Lee told his followers the outbreak had been ""caused by the Devil"" and compared it to the biblical testing of Job, Yonhap news agency reported.

BEIJING (UPDATE) - The death toll in China from the new coronavirus outbreak rose by 109, the National Health Commission said Saturday, bringing the total number of fatalities to 2,345.
Another 397 new cases were reported nationwide, down from nearly 900 officially reported Friday, bringing the total number of cases to over 76,000.
The drop in new cases of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) came as officials in Hubei province -- whose capital city Wuhan is the epicenter the outbreak -- were ordered to revise figures to clear ""doubt"" around the data.
The number of new cases nationwide for Feb. 19 was revised up to 820 up from 394 previously reported, the National Health Commission said Saturday.
It also adjusted upwards the total confirmed cases for Feb. 20 by over 400 cases to 75,891.
The decision to amend Hubei's past data, which was announced on Friday by local authorities, is the latest in a string of changes made to Hubei's counting method -- further complicating efforts to track the spread of the illness.
Last week, Chinese health officials added patients from Hubei who had been diagnosed via clinical methods including lung imaging on top of those confirmed by lab tests.
But on Thursday, Hubei officials backtracked the decision and deducted 279 cases -- which they were ordered to re-add to the count on Friday.
The virus has spread to several parts of the world, triggering travel restrictions to and from China in some countries.

TOKYO - Newly released data from a Japanese research institute appears to back the government's case that its quarantine strategy for the Diamond Princess cruise ship was successful in stemming contagion of the coronavirus among passengers.
Japan has been criticized for its handling of the quarantine, as more than 620 people on board have been infected with the virus and 2 elderly passengers have died.
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has said the quarantine may not have been sufficient.
But a report released on Wednesday by the National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID) showed that the onset of symptoms from confirmed cases of COVID-19 peaked on Feb. 7 before tailing off to zero by Feb. 15.
Cases among crew were observed to steadily increase, peaking on Feb. 13.
""The decline in the number of confirmed cases, based on reported onset dates, implies that the quarantine intervention was effective in reducing transmission among passengers,"" according to the report. Later transmission ""appears to have occurred mostly among crew or within passenger cabins.""
The NIID is Japan's top research institute of infectious diseases.
More than 620 passengers have been infected on the ship, which has been quarantined since Feb. 3, initially with about 3,700 people on board. The health ministry announced on Thursday that 2 passengers in their 80s had died, the first fatalities from the ship.
The NIID report was ""very reassuring,"" said Kentaro Iwata, an infectious disease specialist from Kobe University Hospital who had been one of the harshest critics of the quarantine. After visiting the ship, Iwata had posted YouTube videos decrying the infection controls he saw.
The videos got over a million views before Iwata took them down, saying at a press briefing on Thursday that the new data and reports of improved controls on the ship convinced him that the government had responded to his criticism.
The United States, Canada and other nations evacuated their citizens ahead of the Feb. 19 end of the quarantine. Remaining passengers have been released in batches and advised by health authorities to stay at home and monitor their condition.
The health ministry will provide assistance to those returning passengers, as there is still a risk they could develop symptoms, said Koji Wada, a professor at the International University of Health and Welfare in Tokyo.
""We can say the quarantine has been done as we planned,"" said Wada, who has worked as an advisor on site at the Diamond Princess. ""I'm not sure if I can say it's a success.""

ROME - Taiwan on Wednesday imposed a ban on live pigs and pork product imports from Italy following Rome's suspension of flights between the 2 countries in response to the coronavirus outbreak.
Italy stopped all flights between the country and Taiwan, China as well as Hong Kong and Macau on Jan. 31 to stop the spread of the virus.
""Deletion of recognition of Italy as a country free of African swine fever,"" a statement published by the Taiwan's Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine said.
Rome's flight ban did not play well in Taipei, which summoned Italy's representative Davide Giglio to urge a speedy resumption of flights.
Beijing was also not happy with the ban and has lobbied to have it lifted but so far with no success.
Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio said earlier this month that the block on flights was an emergency measure.
""We will keep it in place as long as health authorities and... the scientific community tell us we should.""
Taiwan's imports of commercial goods from Italy amounted to $2.6 billion in 2019 with machinery, chemical products, leather, vehicles and textiles leading the list, according to the Taipei's representative office in Rome.
The website of Taiwan's state-owned Central News Agency reported the Taiwan government as saying: ""After conducting a rolling assessment of the international outbreak of African swine fever, the bureau has concluded that the epidemic on the Italian island of Sardinia is escalating.""

MANILA - A Filipino sailor who had contracted the novel coronavirus aboard a cruise ship moored off Japan's coast has been cleared of the disease, the Philippine Embassy in Japan said Wednesday.
The Filipino crew member of Diamond Princess has been given a clean bill of health and is scheduled to be discharged from hospital, the embassy added.
The sailor was then the first known case of a Filipino infected with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

As of Wednesday, 40 other Filipino crew members of the Carnival Corp-operated cruise liner are recuperating in medical facilities around Tokyo after catching the flu-like disease, which health authorities said can be transmitted between humans through close contact or droplets.
""The embassy is in touch with those who have been admitted to hospitals in order to ensure their well-being and to provide them any assistance they need,"" the embassy said.

DFA orders repatriation of Filipinos aboard virus-hit cruise ship in Japan

As the quarantine came to an end on Wednesday, the embassy, in coordination with the Japanese Government and the management of Princess Cruises, is threshing out details on the repatriation of the Filipino crew and passengers on board the Diamond Princess.
Filipino passengers cleared for disembarkation from the vessel will be repatriated at the soonest possible time, the embassy said.
Filipino crew members undergoing treatment have to be cleared of the disease first before they could return to the Philippines, it added.
At least 542 people on board the ship, which carries more than 3,700 guests and crew members, had tested positive for COVID-19.
The ship was kept in quarantine starting Feb. 3 after a passenger, who disembarked in Hong Kong, was found to be infected with the virus.
Hundreds are expected to disembark the ship in the coming days after testing negative for COVID-19 and completing the 14-day mandatory quarantine.

MANILA - Foreign Affairs Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr. has ordered the Philippine Embassy in Tokyo ""to immediately repatriate"" Filipinos aboard Diamond Princess off Japan's coast after the coronavirus-stricken cruise ship completed a 2-week quarantine.
""It’s our duty to take care [of] our Overseas Filipinos wherever they are. I want them home now!"" he wrote in a tweet on Wednesday.
Some 41 out of 500 Filipinos aboard the ship contracted the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the Department of Health (DOH) said.

DOH wants cruise ship passengers repatriated, quarantined; 41 positive for COVID-19

All of those who tested positive are crew members of the Carnival Corp-operated cruise liner. They were confined in hospitals in Japan and were responding well to the treatment, the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) had said.
The repatriates will have to undergo another 14-day quarantine in the Philippines, said Health Assistant Secretary for Public Health Services Maria Rosario Vergeire.
The ship was kept in quarantine since Feb. 3 after a passenger, who disembarked in Hong Kong, was found to be infected with the virus.
When the quarantine came to an end on Wednesday, more than 500 people were confirmed to have been infected by COVID-19, a new strain of coronavirus that originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan.
Earlier this month, the Philippine government repatriated 30 Filipinos from Wuhan. 
They are currently staying at the New Clark City in Capas, Tarlac for a 2-week quarantine, the incubation period of the virus.
The fast-spreading disease has killed more than 2,000 people and infected more than 74,000 others in China as of Wednesday.

,Feb 19 2020,nCov,Foreign pilots at Chinese airlines return home on unpaid leave as demand plummets,"Stella Qiu and Jamie Freed, Reuters","

BEIJING/SYDNEY - Foreign pilots at some Chinese airlines have returned to their home countries and are considering other jobs after being placed on unpaid leave as demand falls because of the coronavirus, affected flight crew told Reuters.
Meanwhile, Chinese pilots with greater job security said their income has been sharply reduced because most of their pay is based on flying hours.
Data firm OAG estimates about 80 percent of scheduled airline capacity to, from and within China has been cut this week because of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that has killed more than 2,000 people. Chinese airlines have been the hardest hit.
Major employers of foreign pilots, including China Southern Airlines Co Ltd and HNA Group's Hainan Airlines Holding Co Ltd, have acted swiftly to cut their losses, according to pilots and industry experts.
China Southern did not respond immediately to a request for comment, and HNA declined to comment.
""All the foreign pilots are on leave until the virus situation gets better,"" said an expatriate captain at China Southern who, like all of those who spoke to Reuters, requested anonymity because he was not authorized to speak with media. ""For the moment we are all in our home countries.""
Expats are typically paid more than local staff and work on contracts, which means they are more expendable in a downturn, industry experts said.
""We have seen pilots heading back to Australia in January and February due to the stand down and seeking new roles,"" said Kirsty Ferguson, the head of Sydney-based airline interview coaching firm Pinstripe Solutions.
As China's airline sector ballooned, it imported foreign experience: the number of foreign pilots flying with Chinese airlines more than doubled to over 1,500 between 2010 and 2019, according the Civil Aviation Administration of China.
China will need another 124,000 pilots in the next 20 years, according to Boeing, as an expanding middle class drives demand for air travel. But foreign pilots said being put on leave without pay makes it less likely they'll return when demand recovers.
A foreign captain at Fuzhou Airlines, part of HNA Group, said he was placed on unpaid leave when the virus hit and was concerned it would be permanent.
""They hope people will find other jobs as none can go without pay forever,"" he said. ""This way they 'save their face,' and secondly they don't feel obliged to dismiss you properly according to the contract.""
The pilot said that he was looking for jobs closer to home, but that so far those options paid less than in China. Foreign pilots can make more than $300,000 a year there, making it one of the best-paying markets in the world.
A pilot at Tianjin Airlines, also part of HNA Group, said he was told it would be at least three to four months before the carrier starts recalling expatriate captains. He has found work with another foreign airline, he said.
HNA declined to comment.
A local pilot at China Southern said he was barely flying and as a result was receiving only his base salary, roughly 1/6 to 1/8 of his normal pay.
""What we can do now is keep a good mentality and enjoy the company of our family at home,"" he said. ""Eat well, sleep well and exercise well and keep learning. Build up the energy so that we'll be well prepared for whatever comes later.""

GENEVA/SEOUL - There are no indications that there are cases of the new coronavirus in North Korea, a World Health Organization (WHO) official said, despite South Korean media reports suggesting the outbreak had spread to the isolated country.
""At the moment there are no signals, there are no indications we are dealing with any COVID-19 there,"" Dr. Mike Ryan, head of WHO's emergencies program, told a news conference in Geneva on Tuesday.
COVID-19 is the name of the disease caused by the new coronavirus.
WHO officials had ""no reason to believe that there are any specific issues"" going on in North Korea, and would be providing authorities in the North with more laboratory supplies to conduct diagnostic tests, Ryan said.
Some South Korean media outlets have reported multiple cases and possible deaths from the virus in North Korea, but there has been no independent verification.
On Tuesday, Rodong Sinmun, the official newspaper of North Korea's ruling party, quoted a public health official reiterating the country had ""no confirmed case of the new coronavirus so far.""
An outbreak of the disease - which has killed more than 2,000 people in neighboring China - could be devastating for the under-resourced health system in North Korea, experts said.

WHO urges calm as China virus death toll reaches 2,000 

Last week, the US State Department said it was ""deeply concerned"" about the possible impact of a coronavirus outbreak in North Korea and was prepared to facilitate efforts by US and international organizations to contain the spread of the virus there.
Aid organizations have called for exemptions from sanctions that restrict most trade and business with North Korea.
Already one of the most closed-off countries in the world, North Korea has stopped flights and train services with its neighbors, established month-long mandatory quarantines, suspended international tourism, and imposed a near-complete lockdown on cross-border travel.
The WHO has prioritized aid for North Korea, and a shipment of protective equipment and supplies was due to be shipped there this week, Ryan said.
""The government is very anxious as you can imagine, as all governments are, to make preparations and are seeking our technical and operational assistance to help them get ready,"" he said.

Vietnam's inaugural Formula One Grand Prix will take place in Hanoi in April as planned, organizers told AFP on Tuesday, avoiding the fate of the Chinese Grand Prix which was postponed over the deadly coronavirus outbreak.
The virus, which has killed more than 1,800 people in China, has trashed Asia's sporting calendar, forcing the postponement of top events including the Hong Kong Sevens rugby.
But Vietnamese authorities said the country's inaugural F1 race would go ahead as ""scheduled"" on April 5, Le Ngoc Chi, CEO of Vietnam Grand Prix told AFP.
That flies in the face of mounting fears over the spread of the virus from neighboring China and the risk of transmission among the crowds expected to make the journey to the Vietnamese capital.
""The time for the... F1 race will not be postponed or delayed,"" Tran Trung Hieu, deputy director of Hanoi's tourism department was quoted as saying by state media Tuesday.
""Although this is a sports event, it has a very huge impact on Vietnam and Hanoi's tourism,"" he said, adding all measures will be taken to ensure safety.
AFP reporters saw workers building stands at the racetrack as construction continued this week.
- Football friendly cancelled -
The go-ahead comes the same day Vietnam's football federation announced that an international friendly scheduled a week before the F1 race will be cancelled.
Vietnam and Iraq's national teams were supposed to play on March 26 as preparation for World Cup qualifiers
But the match has been cancelled because of the outbreak and at ""the request of the Iraq Football Federation"", said a statement from Vietnam's Football Federation.
Last week, Vietnam became the only country outside of China to enforce a mass quarantine of a community to contain a cluster of virus cases.
Checkpoints have been set up around the six villages that make up Son Loi, about 40 kilometers outside Hanoi after six people were detected with the virus there.
Vietnam, which shares a porous border with China, has 16 confirmed cases of the coronavirus, including those in Son Loi.
It banned all flights to and from mainland China in a bid to stop the virus from spreading.
It also suspended new tourist visas for Chinese nationals or foreigners who had been in China over the past two weeks.
The communist country will get its first taste of the glitz and glamour of Formula One with the Hanoi race, as the sport attempts to reach new markets in Southeast Asia.
Hanoi has bet big on the event's popularity, signing a 10-year, multi-million-dollar deal with Formula One last year which state media said would cost Vietnam $60 million per year.
The fee has been picked up in full by the country's largest private conglomerate, VinGroup, which is hoping to dazzle with a night race on a street track.
The commitment to hold the race will likely be welcomed by Formula One chiefs who are scrambling to fit the postponed Shanghai race into this season's schedule.
The Chinese GP, scheduled for April 19, last week joined the World Athletics Indoor Championships and European Tour and LPGA golf tournaments in being shelved because of the deadly outbreak.

MANILA - Southeast Asia's holiday hot spots, hit by billions in lost business from Chinese tourists, are turning to markets closer to home to soften the blow from travel restrictions caused by the coronavirus epidemic.
To make up for foregone revenues, firms in the region are dangling discounted airfares, hotel accommodation and tour add-ons in a bid to boost domestic travelers.
Home to rich culture, white sand beaches, diverse marine life, lively nightlife and affordable tours, Southeast Asia is the favorite for Chinese tourists, the region's top foreign visitors. But travel restrictions on China, the origin of the new coronavirus, since late January have led to losses in the region's hospitality sector.
In the Philippines, the government and tourism players last week launched a travel campaign led by President Rodrigo Duterte.
""Come with me and be my travel companion. I'll be travelling around the Philippines,"" Duterte said in video address, offering assurances that the virus posed no risks to local tourists in their own country.

Member firms of the Tourism Congress of the Philippines are offering discounts of up to 50 percent on hotels, free upgrades and complimentary items like breakfasts.
Other firms are offering individual customers corporate or government rates for tours and hotel accommodation, which are 15 percent to 30 percent cheaper, Arwin Paul Lingat, president of a tourism officers group, told Reuters.
Manila's Golden Phoenix Hotel has slashed its rates by two-thirds, its marketing director Christine Ann Ibarreta said.
LOCAL SWEETENERS
China's health authorities are reporting thousands of new cases daily of the coronavirus infection, which has killed 1,868 people, mostly in China. The flu-like virus' spread has also prompted countries to shut doors to Chinese travelers, who are a major source of growth for many Southeast Asian economies.

China virus death toll passes 1,800: gov't 

Southeast Asia welcomed more than 29 million mainland travelers in 2018, up 15 percent from a year earlier, data from the ASEAN Statistical Yearbook 2019 showed. That was nearly double the entire European market and almost 5 times the number of North American tourists.
Southeast Asian airlines are making fares attractive for cost-sensitive locals. Indonesia's biggest budget carrier, Lion Air, is reducing fares by up to 60 percent on select flights.
Philippines' largest carrier, Cebu Pacific, which has refunded 1.5 billion pesos ($29 million) to passengers, is offering seats on flights for as little as $2 before taxes while Philippine Airlines launched promotional discounts of 20 percent to 40 percent.
Thailand, Southeast Asia's biggest market for Chinese tourists, is now offering special packages for local elderly, which allows their expenses to be used for their children's tax deductions.
The Thai government is also providing tax breaks and soft loans to help slow job losses.
Vietnam, the region's second-largest market for Chinese tourists, said it would waive entrance fees to some tourist attractions when the outbreak is over. It has also simplified visa procedures for some non-Chinese arrivals. The coronavirus epidemic could wipe $5.9 billion to $7.7 billion from Vietnam's tourism earnings in the next 3 months.
Indonesia, Southeast Asia's largest economy, has also pledged to boost spending and incentives to soften the virus's business impact.
Bali, Indonesia's main tourist magnet because of its aquamarine water, white sand beaches and majestic cliffs, has seen 20,000 cancellations, said Hariyadi Sukamdani, head of the country's hotels and restaurants association.
In Kuala Lumpur, a 3,600-member industry group has planned for April its first ever ""Cuti Cuti Malaysia"" (Holiday in Malaysia) travel fair, exclusively focused on domestic tourism.
""Individual hotels, airlines, travel companies, theme parks, dive resorts, have reduced their normal rates, some by 20 percent and 30 percent,"" Tan Kok Liang, the industry group's president, told Reuters.
Despite the big push, industry experts do not expect local business to do much more than cushion the hit to the region's tourism sector.

""The domestic, to be honest, will not make up for what the international market brings here,"" Tourism Congress President Jose Clemente told a congressional hearing. ""Our objective right now is just to survive the storm... What we're trying to do is to have some cash flow.""

MANILA - Philippine government agencies on Tuesday announced it is safe to attend concerts and other big gatherings despite the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China.
A statement posted by the Department of Tourism (DOT) on its Twitter account said that it is “safe to organize and attend public gatherings, meetings and festivals as long as all precautionary measures identified by the DOH (Department of Health) are observed.”
The joint announcement by the DOH, DOT and the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) was meant to clarify an earlier advisory released by the DOH recommending people to avoid big crowds and cancel such events.

DOH recommends halting concerts as new coronavirus continues to spread

The three agencies reminded the public to practice good hygiene by washing hands regularly. It also urged those experiencing such symptoms as cough, colds, sore throat and fever to seek medical attention.
“All preventive and precautionary measures have been put in place by the national government to contain the spread of the COVID-19,” the agencies said.
They said guidelines are already in place in hotels and resorts across the country even before a temporary travel ban against travelers from China was imposed. It emphasized that facilities have infrared thermometers and hand sanitizers.
“The safety of the public, especially our tourists and employees in the tourism sector, remains the priority of the Philippine government,” it said.
As of Tuesday, there are more than 70,000 people infected with COVID-19, a new disease caused by a new strain of coronavirus that is believed to have originated from Wuhan city in China. 
There are already more than 1,800 deaths worldwide, mostly in China.
In the Philippines, there were 3 confirmed cases of COVID-19. While one of the Chinese travelers died due to the disease, the other two have already recovered.

BEIJING (UPDATE) - The head of a leading hospital in China's central city of Wuhan, the epicenter of a coronavirus outbreak, died of the disease on Tuesday, state television said, becoming the second prominent Chinese doctor to have succumbed to the pathogen.
Liu Zhiming, the director of Wuhan Wuchang Hospital, died at 10:30 a.m., it said.
Earlier this month, millions in China mourned the death of Li Wenliang, a doctor who was previously reprimanded for issuing an early warning about the coronavirus.

Death of Chinese doctor fuels anger, demands for change on China's handling of virus crisis

Tens of thousands of medical workers have been fighting to contain the spread of the coronavirus, believed to have first surfaced in a seafood market in Wuhan, the capital of the central province of Hubei.
As in the case of Li's death, there was confusion on the Chinese internet about Liu's condition on Monday night.
On Monday night, the Communist Party propaganda department of the Hubei Health Commission wrote in a social media post that Liu had died.
But it said in a subsequent post that Liu was alive.
""According to Liu's relative, the hospital is still trying its best to rescue him,"" the commission said in the second post, adding that the previous misinformation was from a good friend of Liu who was not aware of the latest situation.
It has not posted any message since state television announced Liu's death on Tuesday morning.
Beijing was accused of covering up the full extent of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003. In the current coronavirus outbreak, Beijing has called for transparency.
A senior Chinese health official said on Friday that 1,716 health workers have been infected by the coronavirus and 6 of them have died.

BEIJING - On a Friday night in one of Beijing's central shopping districts, the popular Megabox cinema is shuttered and empty.
Like entertainment venues across the capital, the 8-screen movie theater has been closed for nearly a month in response to the coronavirus outbreak that has swept China, infecting more than 70,000 people.
Glossy posters for this year's blockbusters hang inside the closed entrance, while a sign outside says it was closed to ""avoid spreading infections.""
No reopening date was given.
The government told hundreds of millions of people to stay home through the Lunar New Year holiday -- a crucial period in China's movie industry.
Normally, blockbuster films are released and consumers pack cinemas -- but this year, all was quiet.
The closures could have a devastating impact on China's film industry -- and its target to overtake the US this year as the biggest box office in the world.
With sales decimated in the first 2 months of the year, this now looks unlikely.
""Based on 2019, the contribution from Chinese New Year was about 20 to 30 percent of the total box office,"" said Wilson Chow, head of PwC's global technology, media and entertainment and telecommunications practice.
""It is really a big portion.""
'NOT OPTIMISTIC'
The takings at the box office on the first day of the new year in 2019 was $240 million, according to Chow.
This year, the same day managed just $300,000.
""I'm not very optimistic (of overtaking US sales this year),"" he said, describing the virus as ""a big blow to the industry.""
Film groups in China are only beginning to count the cost.
State-owned China Film Co. said during the New Year holiday last year it earned 144.03 million yuan ($20 million) at the box office -- nearly 8 percent of annual earnings.
This year, cinemas have closed and films the group has produced are postponed.
""The coronavirus outbreak has ground China's film industry to a halt,"" said Deloitte China's Polly Lee.
She says only 117,000 people went to the cinema during the first few days of the holiday -- compared with 130 million last year.
Shares in Shenzhen-listed Wanda Film have tumbled by more 25 percent since mid-January, with Hong Kong-listed iMax China down over 16 percent.
Chow warned older or less successful cinemas might be forced to close permanently.
'DESTROYING THE INDUSTRY'
The outbreak could also hit the pipeline.
Hengdian Studios -- China's largest film and TV production site -- said some production work began again last week, but only with crew members who have undergone a 14-day quarantine.
Beijing's Film Bureau promised to give financial support to production companies hit by the outbreak.
The loss of lucrative Chinese audiences will have a global impact.
According to state agency Xinhua, more than 40 non-domestic made films last year had box office sales over 100 million yuan ($14 million).
The virus has also caused waves in China's film circles.
One anticipated blockbuster, ""Lost In Russia,"" was set to be released during the new year holiday -- but the film studio, Huanxi Media, decided to release the film online instead of waiting for cinemas to reopen.
The studio signed a partnership to screen it for free with internet firm Bytedance, which paid Huanxi a 1-time fee of $90 million to release it on its Douyin and Toutiao platforms.
The move was popular with those trapped at home, but prompted a huge backlash from cinemas.
A joint letter signed by the country's biggest theater chains threatened to boycott future releases from Huanxi. 
It claimed the agreement was ""intentionally destroying the movie industry.""
GLOBAL IMPACT
The streaming giants have had an unexpected hit from the locked-down holiday, with shares surging for the likes of Baidu's Nasdaq-listed iQiyi and Bilibili.
iQiyi said it has brought forward the release of new programs and released VIP films for free viewing during the holiday.
Meanwhile others remain in limbo. Disney was hoping its new film Mulan -- based on the tale of a legendary Chinese warrior -- would be a huge hit with Chinese audiences.
Now the US entertainment giant, which will also face losses from closing its Disneyland parks in China and Hong Kong, can't even be sure when the film will open.
Even the Oscar awards felt the coronavirus impact.
The first film from Barack and Michelle Obama's production house, ""American Factory,"" won best documentary, about a Rust Belt factory reopened by a Chinese billionaire.
But the film's co-producer and the factory's chairman were unable to leave China for the ceremony -- due to US travel restrictions over the coronavirus.

HONG KONG - Pressures to scrap a Philippine travel ban on Hong Kong amid the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak continue to generate support with more than 100 Filipino organizations in one of China's special administrative regions petitioning President Rodrigo Duterte for it on Monday.
The appeal was received by Philippine Consul General Raly Tejada, who immediately assured the group he would relay their concerns to Manila. The government's Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Infectious Disease will meet Tuesday and tackle the travel ban issue.
""They will review the travel ban tomorrow and take into account all facts and reports necessary to make an informed decision,"" Tejada told ABS-CBN News.
Representatives of migrants' rights advocates, those from religious groups, and Filipinos permanently residing in Hong Kong handed the petition to the Philippine Consulate General office.
The Society of Hong Kong Accredited Recruiters of the Philippines (SHARP) said an estimated 25,000 Filipino workers have been affected by the ban that was imposed on Feb.2. Some Hong Kong residents who were vacationing for the Lunar New Year break were also caught flat-footed.
""We all feel that the travel ban, which was imposed without a warning or consultation, is unjustified and oppressive. It was decided upon without a comprehensive understanding of how it would affect us,"" the petition letter reads.
It said the ban was ""not even in line with health protocols set by the World Health Organization.""
The group said the Philippine government's response to the travel ban crisis ""leaves much to be desired"" as the P10,000 compensation from the Overseas Workers' Welfare Administration could not cover expenses incurred after being stranded at the airport.
""Moreover, non-OFWs were given 'no help at all' when many of them don't even have houses in the Philippines,"" the petition said.
""They are also in danger of suffering even more if they lose their jobs, as they pay high rents and other expenses such as school fees for their children in Hong Kong.""
Members of Migrante-Hong Kong echoed calls for the review of the travel ban, urging the government to grant exemption to returning migrant workers, students and residents.
The appeal was also conveyed in Manila when a separate Facebook-generated group, ""#StrandedPH"", consisting of mostly Filipino residents who are stranded in the Philippines, met with OWWA Administrator Hans Cacdac and Deputy Administrator Esther Margaux Uson on Monday.
Joms Ortega, one of the administrators of StrandedPh, said that the meeting 'went really well'.
""We're hopeful for good news soon. So pray na lang po tayo. Pero no promises pa rin talaga (So, let's just pray. But still, no promises),"" said Ortega in a public post on #StrandedPH.
The group said it hoped the Philippine government would ""understand the consequences of the ban to the OFWs,"" and that they were willing to sign a waiver of obligations for the Philippine government ""if anything undesirable happens to us"" in their return to work in Hong Kong.

MANILA - Locating hundreds of people who may have come in contact with a Chinese woman positive for the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) in the Philippines has reached a dead end, the Philippines' top health official said Monday.
""Wala na talaga. Mahirap ang contact-tracing natin,"" Health Secretary Francisco Duque III told radio DZMM.
(It's already a dead end. Contact-tracing has become difficult for us.)

Philippines confirms 3rd new coronavirus case

Instead of contact tracing, the country's health system will be focused instead on ""case management"" or the early detection and appropriate treatment of infected patients.
""Ang labanan dito ay case management na tayo, sa hospital talaga... 'Yong early detection, early testing, dapat maaga para maiwasan ang komplikasyon,"" Duque said.
(Fighting the disease is now through case management in the hospital. It involves early detection, prompt testing to avoid complications.)
As of Monday, Feb. 17, only 255 out of 740 people who may have come in contact with the country's third confirmed case of COVID-19 had been traced, the health department said in its latest advisory.
Of the number, 172 were interviewed wherein 155 completed their home quarantine. Fifteen patients who earlier exhibited flu-like symptoms were discharged while 2 left the country.
This includes the Chinese woman's co-passengers of her flights from Hong Kong to Cebu and staff of hotels and hospitals during her last stop in Bohol.

Meanwhile, authorities were able to locate 280 people who came in contact with the first 2 confirmed cases of COVID-19—a Chinese couple from Wuhan—in the country. The male Chinese tourist died.
Of the number, 221 had completed home quarantine while 14 were still ordered to self-isolate.
Of the 45 people who were considered patients under investigation (PUIs) after showing symptoms of the disease, 31 have already been discharged from the hospital, 6 are under strict monitoring, and another 6 have left the country after being discharged.



The Philippines is currently monitoring 171 patients suspected of contracting the new coronavirus strain while 350 have been discharged.
In China, the virus has killed more than 1,700 people and infected more than 70,000 others as Monday.

,Feb 17 2020,nCov,Japan issues coronavirus medical guidance as infections rise,Kyodo News,"
Another 99 on cruise ship in Yokohama test positive for coronavirus
TOKYO - Japan's health ministry issued guidance Monday for when people with symptoms consistent with the new coronavirus should consult medical institutions, as the country steps up efforts to contain the outbreak.
The ministry is now encouraging people who have had a temperature of 37.5 C or higher for four days, are feeling lethargic or are experiencing shortness of breath to contact local authorities in charge of responding to the outbreak by telephone.
The government's guidance is intended to give those worried about contracting the virus an idea of when to seek an advice from a doctor. Elderly people and those with underlying conditions such as diabetes and high blood pressure are viewed as more vulnerable to the respiratory disease, now officially named COVID-19.
The new coronavirus, which originated in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, has infected more than 510 people in Japan, including 454 people quarantined on a cruise ship, and a government panel of medical experts has said the country is at an early stage of infection.
The United States flew two chartered flights from Tokyo's Haneda airport on Monday morning to evacuate hundreds of its citizens from the cruise ship hit by the new coronavirus that has been quarantined in Yokohama. Japan also evacuated more of its nationals as well as their family members from Wuhan and surrounding areas.
With infections climbing, Japan is scrambling to strengthen its virus testing capabilities and prepare medical facilities to treat infected people.
Speaking at a press conference, health minister Katsunobu Kato noted that people with colds or influenza tend to see their health recover after three to four days on average while those infected with the new coronavirus do not.
Kato also asked individuals who have developed cold-like symptoms to keep track of their temperature and refrain from going to work or school.
Hundreds of U.S. citizens from the Diamond Princess left Yokohama port near Tokyo around 1:40 a.m. Monday on 10 Japanese Self-Defense Forces coaches with drivers in protective suits.
Among the evacuees, 44 tested positive for the virus, The Washington Post said, quoting Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.
Fauci told CBS news that those who tested positive are ""going to be in hospitals in Japan,"" adding, ""the degree of transmissibility on that cruise ship is essentially akin to being in a hot spot.""
The 328 evacuees who were allowed to board the U.S.-chartered flights will be quarantined for 14 days and housed at Travis Air Force Base in California or Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland in Texas.
Japan had been in contact with the United States about the possibility of evacuating the U.S. citizens since the early stages of the quarantine that began on Feb. 3, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said.
""We understand that the United States has made its own decision after comprehensively taking into account such factors as reducing the burden on our country,"" Abe told a parliamentary session.
Australia, Canada, Hong Kong and Israel have also said they are preparing to send chartered flights to Japan to evacuate their citizens from the vessel. Around 3,000 passengers and crew remain on the ship.
Medical and other staff who may have had close contact with those aboard the ship have also contracted the virus, with a Japanese health ministry official in his 50s who worked as a liaison on the vessel hospitalized after testing positive for the virus.
In a separate case in Kanagawa Prefecture near Tokyo, a nurse who had taken care of a woman in her 80s who later became the first domestic fatality of the viral outbreak last week was also confirmed as infected with the virus.
The nurse in her 40s developed a fever and vomited on Friday. She took a virus test the following day due to her close contact with the elderly woman who died Thursday, according to the local government.
Abe told parliament that the government plans to start airing TV commercials to raise awareness about the new coronavirus later Monday, while it will also strive to provide more information in English.
Japan's fifth chartered flight to evacuate its nationals from Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, arrived at Haneda airport Monday morning. On the Boeing 767 were 36 Japanese citizens and 29 family members who are Chinese.
All Japanese citizens and their family members of other nationalities in Hubei Province who had wished to return to Japan have done so. The government believes its evacuation operation using chartered flights is complete, according to the Foreign Ministry.
Of the 65 passengers, 13 were aged 12 or younger and six were aged 60 or above. Twenty-eight of the evacuees were residents of Wuhan, while 37 were from other cities in the province.
They will undergo screening and those without symptoms will stay at a state facility in Saitama Prefecture, north of Tokyo, the government said.
The government will continue to provide support to ensure the safety of those who remain in the Chinese province as well as travelers, the ministry said.
A total of 828 people returned to Japan on the five chartered flights.

TOKYO - Japan evacuated more citizens from the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak on Monday, while the disease's spread prompted a hospital to stop accepting new patients and raised the possibility of restricting participants at next month's Tokyo Marathon.
A fifth government-chartered flight carrying 65 Japanese arrived in Tokyo from Wuhan, China, early on Monday, bringing the total number repatriated from the city to 763, broadcaster NHK reported.
With more than 400 people infected, most of whom are passengers on a cruise ship docked in Yokohama, Japan is the country most affected by the epidemic behind China, where the outbreak was first detected in December and which has now killed more than 1,700 people.
A hospital in Sagamihara, 50 kilometers (31 miles) west of Tokyo, said it would suspend admissions of new patients as one of its nurses tested positive for the virus after treating a patient who later died of the disease.
The widening fallout is damaging output and tourism in Japan, undermining growth and potentially pushing the country into recession, analysts say.

More Pinoys on Japan cruise ship positive for COVID-19 infection

The risk that cases in Japan may increase is threatening to limit one of the world's biggest marathons, scheduled for March 1.
Organizers of the Tokyo Marathon are considering restricting the number of general participants in this year's race as a precaution against the further spread of infection, the Asahi newspaper reported, citing unnamed sources.
Marathon organizers were not immediately available for comment.
Trimming down the size of the marathon, which has more than 300,000 entrants this year, would be the latest effect on an international sporting event in Japan due to the virus.
The FIBA Asia Cup 2021 has postponed a qualifying basketball match between Japan and China, which was initially scheduled to be held in Chiba, near Tokyo, later this week.
As hundreds of passengers prepare to be evacuated from the quarantined cruise ship, one member of the testing team from Japan's health ministry has tested positive for the disease, the ministry said.
Companies are stepping up measures to prevent the spread of the virus, SARS-CoV-2 as the number of infections in the country ticks up daily. A growing number of cases have been reported in people who have neither visited China nor have had direct contact with people arriving from the country.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp, one of Japan's biggest companies, said it was urging its roughly 200,000 group-wide employees to work from home or stagger their commutes.
On Friday, NTT Data Corp said an external employee who works at one of its buildings was confirmed with the coronavirus. The company had ordered 14 workers who had come into close contact with this person to work at home, it said.

TOKYO—The United States said it would send an aircraft to Japan to bring back U.S. passengers on the quarantined cruise ship Diamond Princess, where the most coronavirus infections outside China have occurred.
The U.S. Embassy in Tokyo said in a letter on Saturday to passengers that a chartered plane would arrive in Japan on Sunday evening and that it recommended ""out of an abundance of caution"" that U.S. citizens disembark and return home for further monitoring.
The passengers would be required to undergo further quarantine of 14 days upon arriving in the United States and if they choose not to return on the flight, they would not be able to return home ""for a period of time"", the letter said.
""We understand this is frustrating and an adjustment, but these measures are consistent with the careful policies we have instituted to limit the potential spread of the disease,"" it said.
It also said passengers would be screened before the flight and the U.S. government was working with Japan so that any people with symptoms would receive proper care if they could not board the plane.
Japan confirmed it was coordinating with the U.S. government for Americans to leave the ship and return home, saying that would ease its burden in resolving the situation.
Other countries might follow suit and ask to bring back their own citizens from the ship before the quarantine period ends next week, a Japanese government official told reporters.
The cruise ship, owned by Carnival Corp, has been quarantined since arriving in Yokohama on Feb. 3, after a man who disembarked in Hong Kong before it traveled to Japan was diagnosed with the virus.
It had some 3,700 passengers and crew on board. Another 67 people have tested positive for the virus, Japanese Health Minister Katsunobu Kato said on Saturday, bringing the total to 285 cases. Those testing positive are transferred to Japanese hospitals.
Japanese public broadcaster NHK has reported that there were more than 400 U.S. citizens on board.
The cruise liner's quarantine is set to end on Wednesday and while some passengers were disheartened at the prospect of more time in quarantine, others were more understanding.
""They are very concerned about spreading the virus, and there’s no good way to transport people from Japan without possible transfer of virus, so it is the logical thing to do,"" Sawyer Smith, 25, told Reuters.
The plane will land at Travis Air Force Base in California and some passengers will then continue onward to Lackland Air Force Base in Texas.
The letter did not specify how long U.S. citizens who choose not to board the chartered flight might have to wait before they could return home, saying only that the final decision would be up to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

SHANGHAI/BEIJING—China must make every effort to maintain economic and social control as it battles the coronavirus epidemic, and avoid causing panic that could lead to secondary ""disasters,"" President Xi Jinping told senior officials earlier this month.
Reuters reported this week that Xi had warned officials on Feb. 3 that efforts to contain the new coronavirus had gone too far, threatening the economy. Those comments came days before Beijing rolled out measures to soften the blow.
The epidemic has become a major test for Xi in how to balance stamping out the epidemic with protecting an economy already growing at its slowest in nearly three decades.
His Feb. 3 speech to the Politburo's Standing Committee was published in full by the leading Communist Party theoretical journal Qiushi on Saturday. It showed how Xi had urged officials to roll out policies to support the economy even as they worked to control the spread of the coronavirus.
In the speech, he said that the epidemic, which has killed more than 1,500 people and infected over 66,000 so far, was impacting the economy, especially service industries. Actions needed to be taken to maintain China's industrial chain and encourage enterprises to resume production, he said.
China ""still has to adhere to this year's economic and social development goals"", Xi said in the speech.
He also said it was necessary to increase financial support, such as preferential policies for loan interest rates and terms, and get migrant workers in major industries back to work.
Big projects, especially those in manufacturing, should start construction on time, he said, adding that boosting consumption was an important hedge against the epidemic's impact. Work should be done to promote the wider adoption of 5G technology, as well as the purchase of products associated with healthy living and cars, Xi added.
The epidemic had revealed ""shortcomings and deficiencies"" in national governance, he said, such as how the wildlife animal industry had remained huge despite clear risks in their consumption, and how the country's reserves of health and anti-epidemic materials were seriously inadequate.
A tendency to insist on formalities and bureaucracy have also emerged, creating problems in fighting the epidemic, he said, adding that party members who did not adequately engage in the work must be held accountable and removed from their posts.
He also said he gave instructions on preventing and containing the coronavirus on Jan. 7, when he chaired another Politburo Standing Committee meeting. China first confirmed that the virus had passed from person-to-person and infected some medical staff on Jan. 20. (Reporting by Brenda Goh and Huizhong Wu; Editing by Andrew Cawthorne)

An 80-year-old Chinese tourist has died from the new coronavirus in France, the first death confirmed outside of Asia, French Health Minister Agnes Buzyn said on Saturday.
Buzyn said she had been told about the death of the patient -- in hospital in Paris since late January -- late on Friday, adding that his condition ""had deteriorated rapidly"" after several critical days.
The virus originated late last year in China, where it has since infected more than 66,000 people and killed more than 1,500.
Three deaths from the virus have so far been recorded outside mainland China -- in the Philippines, Hong Kong and Japan.
The scale of the epidemic ballooned this week after officials in the Chinese province of Hubei -- the epicenter of the outbreak -- changed their criteria for counting cases, adding thousands of new patients to the tally.
Some 56 million people in Hubei and its capital Wuhan are now living under quarantine, virtually sealed off from the rest of the country in an effort to contain the virus.
Away from China, almost 600 cases have been confirmed -- roughly 35 of which have been reported in the European Union.
Six people with the virus remain in hospital in France, Buzyn said, adding that none were seriously ill.

MANILA - All public Masses in Singapore have been suspended indefinitely starting Saturday, Feb. 15, to curb the spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Singapore said Friday.
""As Catholics, we need to be responsible in playing our part to contain the spread of this virus by avoiding large gatherings of people,"" Archbishop of Singapore William Goh said in a statement.
Also suspended are large gatherings, such as sessions, retreats and seminars.
Weddings and funerals, which are considered private services where only invited guests can attend, are allowed, but arrangements will have to be made with the parish priest.
""Thank you for your patience and understanding. Let us continue to pray for each other, especially those who have succumbed to this illness... Pray also for those in the front-lines -- the doctors and the nurses -- who are putting their own well-being in the service of the sick,"" Goh added.
The Philippine Embassy in Singapore also advised Filipinos to observe the precautionary measures against the disease.
In Singapore, there are 58 confirmed cases of COVID-19 as of Friday, data from the World Health Organization (WHO) show. Of this number, 36 are attributed to possible local transmission.
To fulfill the obligation of keeping the Day of the Lord holy, the Catholic faithful in Singapore are advised to follow the broadcast of the Mass on the CatholicSG Youtube channel; gather as a family for the Liturgy of the Word by spending time together in prayer, reading the Word of God of the Sunday Liturgy, and interceding for the world; or spend at least half an hour in quiet time to pray and read the Word of God.
The Catholic Church in Hong Kong earlier implemented a similar measure amid the threat of the COVID-19 outbreak.
All public Masses were suspended for 2 weeks in Hong Kong, which has recorded 53 confirmed cases of coronavirus infection and 1 death.

BEIJING - China is disinfecting and isolating used banknotes as part of efforts to stop the spread of the new coronavirus that has killed more than 1,500 people, officials said Saturday.
Banks use ultraviolet light or high temperatures to disinfect yuan bills, then seal and store the cash for 7 to 14 days -- depending on the severity of the outbreak in a particular region -- before recirculating them, China's central bank said at a press conference.
The virus, which has infected more than 66,000 people in China and spread to more than 2 dozen other countries, has sparked a rush to disinfect public places and minimize contact between people.

Death toll in China epidemic surges past 1,500

Pharmacies across the country sold out of disinfectants and surgical masks in just days after a lockdown was announced in late January on Wuhan city, where the COVID-19 illness is believed to have emerged.
Office buildings have installed packets of tissue in elevators that tenants are encouraged to use when pressing buttons, while ride-hailing company Didi exhorts drivers to disinfect their cars daily.
'EMERGENCY ISSUANCE'
Fan Yifei, deputy governor of China's central bank, said Saturday that banks have been urged to provide new banknotes to customers whenever possible.
The central bank made an ""emergency issuance"" of 4 billion yuan in new notes to Hubei province, the epicenter of the outbreak, prior to the recent Lunar New Year holiday, Fan added.
The measures are intended to ""secure the public's safety and health when using cash,"" Fan said.
But it is unclear how wide an impact the central bank's disinfection work will have, with increasing numbers of Chinese people preferring mobile payments over cash in recent years.
In 2017, nearly three-quarters of Chinese respondents told an Ipsos survey they could survive a whole month without using more than 100 yuan in cash.
According to the World Health Organization, COVID-19 can be spread through contaminated objects in addition to droplets and direct contact with infected patients.

LOS ANGELES - Hawaii health authorities began a search on Friday for anyone who may have had close contact with a Japanese tourist who fell ill on the island of Oahu and tested positive for a new coronavirus soon after returning to his home country.
The case came to public attention at a Honolulu news conference by Gov. David Ige and senior state health officials, who said the man in question is believed to have become infected in Japan before embarking on his trip, or while en route to Hawaii.
That assumption is based on the 14-day incubation period of the virus, and the fact that the man became symptomatic after less than a week in Hawaii, the state health officials said.
The patient and his wife visited the island of Maui from Jan. 28 to Feb. 3, then traveled to Oahu, where they stayed until flying on Feb. 7 back to their home in the Aichi Prefecture of central Japan, the officials said.
The man had exhibited no sign of illness until reaching Oahu, where he first developed cold-like respiratory symptoms but no fever, the state's health direct, Dr. Bruce Anderson, told reporters.
Once back in Japan, he became more seriously ill and was tested for the coronavirus after going to a hospital, Anderson said.
Hawaii officials were notified through the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Friday, and state authorities in turn alerted local health providers to be on the lookout for coronavirus-like illnesses.
""We do believe that this is a serious concern, and I want to assure you that this scenario is exactly what we've been preparing for and are prepared for,"" the governor said.
The greatest immediate focus is to identify and track down individuals who had ""prolonged, face-to-face contacts"" with the Japanese man after he began showing symptoms on Oahu, said Dr. Sarah Park, the state's chief epidemiologist.
Based on what is known about transmission of the disease, the patient was unlikely to have been contagious while on Maui because he was asymptomatic then, and anyone who had fleeting, incidental contact with him after he became ill, such as passing him in a hallway, would be considered at low risk, Park said.
The man's apparent lack of fever while in Hawaii also bodes well because infected individuals are believed to be most contagious when feverish, she said.
The man's precise travel itinerary remained unclear, except that he stayed at a Hilton Grand Vacations time-share condo in the Waikiki section of Honolulu, Anderson said, adding that he only sought medical care upon returning to Japan.
State health officials said they were consulting Japanese authorities to get more details of his Hawaii visit.
Hawaii, the US Pacific island state closest to the origin of the coronavirus outbreak, has seen no infections documented on its soil, while the number of US cases confirmed nationwide stands at 15, none fatal. Eight cases are in California.
The worldwide total now exceeds 66,000 cases, with more than 1,500 deaths, most of them in China's Hubei province, the epicenter of the outbreak.
Beyond China, nearly 450 cases have been tallied in some 24 countries and territories, and 3 deaths. Japan is among the nations hardest hit, with 251 confirmed cases, most of them on a cruise liner quarantined in a port.
Japan confirmed its first coronavirus death on Thursday.

MANILA - The Bureau of Immigration (BI) said Saturday it had implemented the lifting of travel restriction the Philippines imposed on Taiwan due to the outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
BI Commissioner Jaime Morente said he had instructed all immigration personnel to allow foreigners and Filipinos to travel to and from the self-governing territory.
""We have received an order from the Office of the President yesterday [Friday] afternoon lifting the travel restrictions,"" Morente said.
""This follows the resolution of the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Infectious Disease (IATF), which we are bound to implement immediately. Hence, travel may now be made by any foreign national to Taiwan from the Philippines and vice versa,"" he added.
Also allowed to enter the Philippines are members of the diplomatic corps traveling from Taiwan, regardless of nationality.

Philippines lifts travel ban to Taiwan

The decision to lift the ban, announced Friday, came as Taiwan threatened sanctions against the Philippines, including scrapping visa-free privilege for Filipinos.
Presidential spokesperson Salvador Panelo had said the task force reached the decision given strict measures and protocol Taiwan had been undertaking against the spread of the virus.
Taiwan said it had only 18 cases of the virus compared to more than 66,000 in China.
Nearly 160,000 Filipinos live and work in Taiwan, mainly in factories and as household helpers.
Philippine immigration authorities currently do not allow foreign travelers from China and and its special administrative regions Hong Kong and Macau to enter Manila.

Death toll in China epidemic surges past 1,500

The COVID-19, which has killed more than 1,500 people and infected more than 66,000 others, originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan.
Only Filipinos and permanent resident visa holders are allowed to enter the Philippines. Filipinos are also temporarily barred from traveling to China.
The task force, Morente said, is ready to enforce the possible lifting of the travel ban in other territories. This as Palace officials said Friday the ban would undergo periodic review.
""We are on standby, ready to implement any policy change as deemed appropriate by the IATF,"" he said.

MELBOURNE - The Chinese gymnastics team entered into next week's World Cup in Melbourne has pulled out due to Australian government travel restrictions put in place to limit the coronavirus outbreak, organizers said Saturday.
The restrictions on foreign nationals traveling from China were introduced in early February and extended for another week on Thursday.
The extension effectively rules out China's participation at the Feb. 20 to 23 World Cup, which offers qualifying points for this year's Tokyo Olympics.
""It has been a very challenging few weeks for us all, but none more so than for the Chinese gymnasts and officials who have been training and preparing to come to Melbourne,"" Gymnastics Australia CEO Kitty Chiller said in a statement.
""I have been in regular contact with the Chinese Gymnastics Association and its President, who informs me all of their delegation are well and have shown no sign of infection.""
""Despite this, we all have to respect the Australian Government's travel restrictions.""
Among the 12 Chinese entries listed on the World Cup's website are 4-time world champion Zhang Chenglong, who claimed the men's team gold at the 2012 London Olympics and bronze at the Rio Games.
Zhang's Rio teammates You Hao and Liu Yang will also miss out, along with Xiao Ruoteng, a former men's all-around world champion.
Chinese athletes in other sports have also suffered disruptions to Olympic preparations.
The entire Chinese women's soccer team and staff were confined to a Brisbane hotel for nearly 2 weeks due to quarantine restrictions after arriving in Australia in late-January for an Olympic qualifying tournament.
The coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak has killed more than 1,500 people, mostly in China's central Hubei province. Confirmed infections have risen above 66,000.

Another repatriate, a 25-year-old woman, will also be brought to the Bataan General Hospital and Medical Center “for further evaluation and management after exhibiting anxiety-related symptoms.”
Asked if the patient’s anxiety-related symptoms could be because of her isolation or repatriation, Vergeire said, “We can’t say for now.”
Experts at the hospital will be able to determine the patient's condition. 
“Ang pinakita niyang sintomas, hindi makatulog at balisa po siya,"" she said.
(The symptoms she's showing is inability to sleep and feeling restless.)
Vergeire assured the public the symptoms of the repatriates will be managed. She also said both are not related to COVID-19, which has infected over 60,000 people and has killed more than 1,300 in China as of Friday.
The 30 Filipino repatriates and government personnel who assisted them were kept in isolation rooms at the New Clark City upon their arrival last Sunday. They were repatriated amid travel restrictions on China and its territories.

On Tuesday, a 34-year-old female repatriate and an infant were admitted to the regional hospital because of diarrhea. Both tested negative for COVID-19 as well.

They also returned to New Clark City to finish the 14-day quarantine.
While local government officials have expressed concerns that the repatriates might be infected with the dreaded disease, none have tested positive for COVID-19. 
There are no announcements yet if another batch of overseas Filipino workers will be repatriated from Wuhan, the epicenter of the disease, or other areas in China.

,Feb 14 2020,nCov,Virus could mean $5 billion in airline losses: UN agency,Agence France-Presse,"



MONTREAL, Canada - The new coronavirus outbreak could mean a reduction of $4 to 5 billion in worldwide airline revenue, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) said Thursday. 
The UN agency reported that 70 airlines have canceled all international flights in and out of China and 50 others have reduced their operations. 
Preliminary estimates show this has meant a reduction of nearly 20 million passengers compared to expectations for the first quarter of 2020. 
That figure equates to potential lost revenue of up to $5 billion, the agency said.
The virus has killed 1,483 people in China and infected more than 64,600 there. Overseas, nearly 600 cases have emerged in around 30 locations
""Prior to the outbreak, airlines had planned to increase capacity by 9 percent on international routes to/from China for the first quarter of 2020 compared to 2019,"" ICAO said in a statement.
The reality has been a reduction in foreign airline traveler capacity of 80 percent. 
Japan looks to be hardest-hit from a reduction in Chinese air travelers in the first quarter, ICAO said. The country could lose $1.29 billion in tourism revenue, with Thailand not far behind at a $1.15 billion loss potential. 
ICAO said the effects of the COVID-19 virus outbreak on the airline industry are expected to be larger than the 2002-2003 SARS epidemic because flight cancellations are more widespread this time. 
In addition, China's international air traffic has doubled and its domestic air traffic increased 5-fold in the last 17 years. 
Chinese authorities have locked down Hubei province, the virus epicenter, and have restricted movements in several cities as part of an unprecedented effort to contain the virus.
Britain, Germany, the US, Japan and others have advised against travel to China.

MANILA - President Rodrigo Duterte has urged Filipinos to travel around the Philippines in light of fears on international travel due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak.
Duterte, in a taped message, called on the public to boost local tourism as tour operators reported at least P10 billion in losses due to a travel ban to and from China, the country's second largest tourism market and epicenter of the deadly virus.
“To my fellow Filipinos, I encourage you to travel with me around the Philippines. I assure you that everything is safe in our country, be it an issue of health, be it an issue of law and order and be it an issue of accessibility,” the President said.
“Come with me and be my travel companion. I’ll be traveling around the Philippine. Pasyal tayo dito sa atin. Unahin natin 'yung atin. Mabuhay ang Pilipino. Mabuhay ang turismo ng Pilipinas,” he added.
(Let’s tour around and prioritize our country. Cheers to the Filipino people and Philippine tourism.)
Duterte, who met with airline companies earlier this week, said carriers and hotels had agreed to lower rates “so that we can be a viable market.”
“Maraming magagandang mapuntahan sa Pilipinas, wala kayong dapat alalahanin,” he said.
(There are many beautiful places in the Philippines. You don’t have to worry about a thing.)

 
The Philippines has imposed travel restrictions on China and its territories in a bid to control the spread of the COVID-19.
China is the Philippines second largest source of foreign tourist arrivals, next only to South Korea, and accounts for nearly a fifth of the total, tourism department data showed.
Earlier this month, Tourism Secretary Bernadette Romulo-Puyat said the government was eyeing to boost promotions in South Korea and the United States, the Philippines' top and 3rd largest tourist markets, respectively.

BEIJING - China's death toll from the new coronavirus epidemic was revised downwards to 1,380 on Friday after officials said some fatalities had been counted more than once.
The National Health Commission removed 108 deaths after discovering ""duplicate statistics"" in hard-hit central Hubei province, according to its daily update, without providing more details.
The commission also subtracted 1,043 from the total number of confirmed infections in Hubei after a ""verification.""
The death toll now stands at 1,380 even after accounting for 116 new deaths in Hubei and 5 others reported elsewhere in China on Friday, according to the commission.
The total number of cases has now risen to 63,851.
The extent of the epidemic seemed to deepen on Thursday after authorities in Hubei started counting patients who were diagnosed through lung imaging, in addition to those who undergo lab tests.
The revision added nearly 15,000 patients to Hubei's count in a single day, with officials explaining that past cases were included. The first cases emerged in December in Wuhan, Hubei's capital.
Hubei reported more than 4,800 new cases on Friday.

TOKYO - Japan on Friday vowed to step up testing and containment efforts for the coronavirus after suffering its first death and the confirmation of new cases, including a doctor and taxi driver.
Japan's health ministry said Thursday that a woman in her 80s living in Kanagawa prefecture, just to the west of Tokyo, had died. She was transferred between hospitals as her condition worsened and was only confirmed to have the coronavirus after her death.
A Tokyo taxi driver, who Japanese media said was the woman's son-in-law, as well as a man in his 20s just east of Tokyo and a doctor in Wakayama, western Japan, were also confirmed to have the virus.
""We will stay in touch with local governments and expand our testing procedures and treatment of patients in order to prevent the spread of the illness,"" Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told reporters, a day after a task force on the disease drew up new measures to deal with it, including spending 10.3 billion yen from budget reserves.
Planners will also keep in close contact with Japan's military, chief cabinet secretary Yoshihide Suga told a news conference, without giving further details.
He said the number of people confirmed to have the virus in Japan had risen to 33, with another 218 on a cruise ship quarantined at a port in Yokohama.
Japanese media reported after Suga's remarks that a man in Wakayama, at the same hospital as the doctor, had also tested positive.
Both Suga and health minister Katsunobu Kato said there was no evidence the coronavirus, dubbed SARS-CoV-2, was spreading widely in Japan, although Kato said that it might and that the government needed to prepare for that situation.
Separately, some passengers on the cruise ship Diamond Princess, which has been moored Yokohama, just south of Tokyo, were set to start disembarking on Friday instead of waiting for the originally targeted date of Feb. 19.
Elderly passengers who have medical conditions or are in windowless rooms can complete their quarantine onshore, Kato said.
The ship was quarantined on arrival in Yokohama, near Tokyo, on Feb. 3 after a man who disembarked in Hong Kong before it traveled to Japan was diagnosed with the virus, which has now killed more than 1,350 people in mainland China.
About 80 percent of the ship's passengers are 60 or older, with 215 in their 80s and 11 in their 90s, according to Japanese media. The ship, managed by Princess Cruise Lines and owned by Miami-based Carnival Corp, typically has a crew of 1,100 and a passenger capacity of 2,670.

TOKYO - A taxi driver in Tokyo has tested positive for the coronavirus, NHK public TV reported, marking a further spread of the disease in Japan even as authorities said some passengers aboard a ship quarantined off its coast would finally be allowed to disembark.
The broadcaster, quoting sources, said the health ministry was trying to trace the route of the contagion, adding that the driver said he had carried passengers who appeared to be Chinese.
No further details were immediately available, including word on the condition of the man, who NHK said was in his 70s. The case is likely to raise further concerns about the spread of the flu-like virus given how many people a city taxi driver has likely been in contact with.
The news came after Japan said it would allow some elderly passengers on the quarantined cruise liner who test negative for the new coronavirus to disembark ahead of schedule and another 44 new cases were confirmed aboard the Diamond Princess.
Health Minister Katsunobu Kato said elderly passengers who have preexisting conditions or are in windowless rooms would be allowed to leave starting from Friday, rather than the originally targeted date of Feb. 19, and complete their quarantine ashore.

Japan cruise ship virus cases jump to 218

With the number of those infected on the cruise ship now up to 218 plus 1 quarantine officer, concerns have been raised about conditions on the ship, where about 3,500 people remain on board.
The liner was quarantined on arrival in Yokohama, near Tokyo, on Feb. 3 after a man who disembarked from the liner in Hong Kong before it traveled to Japan was diagnosed with the virus that has now killed more than 1,350 in mainland China.
About 80 percent of the ship passengers were aged 60 or over, with 215 in their 80s and 11 in their 90s, according to Japanese media. The ship typically has a crew of 1,100 and a passenger capacity of 2,670.
Separately, NHK also reported on Thursday what a doctor in central Japan had tested positive for the virus. It was not immediately clear whether he had any connection to China.
Hundreds of infections have been reported in more than 2 dozen countries and territories besides China, but only 2 people have died from the virus outside mainland China - 1 in Hong Kong and another in the Philippines.

Japanese nationals who have been staying in hotels or other facilities since returning on 4 charter flights from China's Wuhan, the epicenter of the epidemic, have begun going home.
All 197 people from a Jan. 29 flight who tested negative were either home or en route and another 200 or so from a second flight could head home later on Thursday, NHK said.

TOKYO - Japan will take emergency steps against the spread of the new coronavirus worth 15.3 billion yen (P7 billion), Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said Thursday.
The amount includes 10.3 billion yen from reserve funds in the state budget, Abe said, adding that the Cabinet will approve its use on Friday.
As face masks are in short supply across the country, Abe said the government aims to secure over 600 million units a month by encouraging companies to boost output.

MANILA - The number of Filipinos confirmed to have contracted the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) while on board a quarantined cruise ship moored off Japan has climbed to 11, the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) said Thursday.
All of the Filipinos who got the virus are crew members of Diamond Princess, Foreign Affairs Assistant Secretary Eduardo Meñez said in a text message to ABS-CBN News.
""All of them are now confined in various hospitals in and around the Tokyo area,"" the agency said in a statement, adding they are responding well to treatment.
The Philippine Embassy in Tokyo has sent supplies to the patients and also those still quarantined inside the ship.
""An embassy team also visited the hospitals this afternoon to speak with the doctors and social workers assigned to the Filipino patients in order to ensure their well-being,"" the agency added.
The ship has been kept in quarantine since Feb. 3 after a passenger, who disembarked in Hong Kong, was found to be infected with the virus.
Passengers are expected to stay until Feb. 19, 14 days after the isolation period began.

BEIJING - Prosecutors in China have brought criminal charges against a 59-year-old man who strapped on firecrackers and doused himself with gasoline to defy a ban on public gatherings during a coronavirus epidemic, the Xinhua news agency said.
The resident of the southwestern city of Chongqing planned a birthday banquet for more than 10 tables of guests on Jan. 28, the state-run agency said on Wednesday, but local officials battling the outbreak asked him to cancel the plan.
But on Jan. 26, after the man failed to convince them to let the party go ahead, he wrapped firecrackers around his waist, poured gasoline on his chest and held up a lighter, trying to threaten them into agreeing.
""The actions prevented town and village cadres from carrying out epidemic prevention and control work,"" Xinhua said, adding that 10 patients visiting a clinic on a lower level of the same building had also been affected.
It was not immediately clear what kind of penalties the man would face if convicted.
Authorities have banned large gatherings, such as banquets and parties, as they try to rein in the virus epidemic, which has killed more than 1,100 and infected more than 40,000 in China.

HONG KONG - Hotpot has become the latest casualty of the coronavirus outbreak after 10 members of a family in Hong Kong became infected after sharing the dish, a much loved favorite during winter.
Comprised of a vat of soup at the center of a table, hotpot is a deeply communal dish.
Those enjoying it dip a variety of meats, seafood and vegetables into the bubbling broth, which becomes more intense as the meal progresses.
But health experts have sounded warnings after a cluster of coronavirus cases were discovered in one Hong Kong family who all shared a hotpot with a carrier from mainland China over the Lunar New Year holiday.
As the tenth positive case was confirmed within the family on Monday, stocks for large hotpot companies with restaurants in Hong Kong and mainland China plunged.
Xiabuxiabu closed down 7.1 percent, Haidilao ended 4.8 lower while Yihai International, which makes seasonings and sauces for hot pot, dropped 2.7 percent.
In Hong Kong, major restaurant chains including Fairwood, Cafe de Coral, Yoshinoya and Maxim's announced they were temporarily pulling hotpot from their menus.
Maxim's also confirmed that 2 of the infected family members from the hotpot cluster worked in 2 of their branches, which would be closed for disinfecting.
Haidilao, China's largest hotpot chain, has already closed all its branches on the mainland, where the virus outbreak has killed more than 1,000 people.

It said it would not close its Hong Kong branches but would start checking the temperatures of patrons.
Sam Wong, who owns 66 Hotpot, a family-run restaurant in the bustling district of Mongkok, said some 20 customers have canceled bookings since the news of the family cluster emerged.
""I don't think the focus should be placed specifically on hotpot considering the habit among Chinese people of communally sharing food,"" Wong, 39, told AFP.
""But given hotpot is part of this cluster infection case, our business can't help but be affected,"" he added.
Wong said he was conducting thermometer checks on all customers, had placed disinfectant soaked floor mats at his restaurant entrance and was replacing reusable chopsticks with disposable ones.
Emily Mok, a flight attendant, came to Wong's restaurant before it opened on Monday evening and ordered a hotpot for take-away.
""My boyfriend and I will have hotpot at home because we don't want to consume it in a restaurant, where we don't know who is sitting next to us,"" she said.
Even before this year's health crisis, Hong Kong's catering industry had been battered by months of political unrest as Hong Kongers push for greater democratic freedoms and police accountability.
In the last quarter of 2019, when the protests were at their most violent, the catering industry suffered a 14 percent drop compared to the same period last year, according to government figures.
Retail, tourism and entertainment industries have been similarly hit.
Wong's restaurant had weathered the unrest because he was a well-known pro-democracy supporter.
With protesters keen to support the businesses, Wong said he almost always had queues outside.
""Now you can simply walk in,"" he lamented.

GENEVA - China's coronavirus outbreak poses a ""very grave threat for the rest of the world,"" the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) said Tuesday in an appeal for sharing virus samples and speeding up research into drugs and vaccines.
WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus was addressing the start of a 2-day meeting aimed at accelerating development of drugs, diagnostics and vaccines against the flu-like virus amid growing concerns about its ability to spread.
To date China has reported 42,708 confirmed cases, including 1,017 deaths, Tedros said.

""With 99 percent of cases in China, this remains very much an emergency for that country, but one that holds a very grave threat for the rest of the world,"" he told more than 400 researchers and national authorities, including some taking part by video conference from mainland China and Taiwan.
Tedros, speaking to reporters on Monday, referred to ""some concerning instances of onward transmission from people with no travel history to China,"" citing cases this week in France and Britain.
Five British nationals were diagnosed with the coronavirus in France, after staying in the same ski chalet with a person who had been in Singapore.
""The detection of this small number of cases could be the spark that becomes a bigger fire. But for now it's only a spark. Our objective remains containment,"" he said.
Hong Kong residents evacuated from a residential building where a man and woman confirmed with coronavirus live tested negative for the virus, health authorities said Tuesday, easing concerns of a cluster of the outbreak in the Chinese-ruled city.
Many questions remain about the origin of the virus, which emerged at a wildlife market in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in December, and is spread by people in droplets from coughing or sneezing.

""We hope that one of the outcomes of this meeting will be an agreed roadmap for research around which researchers and donors will align,"" Tedros told the closed-door meeting, according to remarks made available by the UN agency.
""The bottom line is solidarity, solidarity, solidarity. That is especially true in relation to sharing of samples and sequences,"" Tedros said. ""To defeat this outbreak, we need open and equitable sharing, according to the principles of fairness and equity.""
Dr. Mike Ryan, WHO's top emergencies experts, told reporters on Monday: ""This is an amazing initiative to centralize our knowledge.""
The aim was to identify gaps and generate scientific information for urgently needed medical interventions, he said.
""This is not just simply scientific discourse, there are big issues to do with how that whole process is governed,"" Ryan said, citing the need to ""ensure equitable access"" to any products derived from research and approved by regulators.
""Bringing everybody together I think will give us a leap-frog moment in terms of coherence, priority-setting,"" he said.

TOKYO - Two Japanese citizens evacuated from the epicenter of a novel coronavirus outbreak have been diagnosed with the infection after initially testing negative, the health ministry said Tuesday.
One of the 2, a man in his 50s who returned from the Chinese city of Wuhan on the first Japanese evacuation flight on Jan. 29, previously twice tested negative for the virus. 
However, a third test 12 days later found the man -- who has been isolated in his hotel room since his return -- was infected.
According to the World Health Organization, the coronavirus incubation period ""could be up to 14 days.""
The second evacuee, a Japanese man in his 40s, returned from Wuhan on Jan. 30 and initially tested negative for the virus, but was diagnosed after a second test on Monday.
The new cases bring the number of infections inside Japan to 28, excluding dozens diagnosed aboard a cruise ship moored off the coast.
So far, 135 people on board the Diamond Princess have tested positive for the virus since it arrived off Japan on Monday.
Authorities on Tuesday were removing from the ship the most recently diagnosed 65 crew and passengers.
The ship was carrying 3,711 people when it arrived off Japan on the evening of Feb. 3, and was officially placed into quarantine 2 days later. 
Only those diagnosed with the virus or suffering other serious health conditions have been allowed off the boat, which is expected to remain in quarantine until at least Feb. 19.
People on board the ship on Tuesday tweeted that medicines were being delivered to passengers, and that the ship's captain had announced the vessel would head out to sea overnight to produce fresh water and other operations.
Japan has evacuated hundreds of its citizens from Wuhan since the outbreak began. They have been asked to self-quarantine, with most staying in government-appointed hotels for a period of 14 days. 
Evacuees from the first flight, which landed Jan. 29, are expected to be released from self-quarantine this week after undergoing an additional test for the virus, officials said.
Japan is planning to send a fifth evacuation flight to Wuhan later this week.

MANADO, Indonesia - Bat meat is still popular in some parts of Indonesia, despite research suggesting the coronavirus spreading from China might have originated in bats before being passed on to humans.
Bats are traditionally eaten by the Minahasan people from North Sulawesi in the form of a curry-like dish called Paniki. Whole bats are used in Paniki, including the head and wings.
""It (the coronavirus) has not affected sales,"" said bat seller Stenly Timbuleng at his stall in Tomohon, a city in North Sulawesi, south of the provincial capital of Manado.
""In fact... sales continue. It is always sold out.""

On an average day, Timbuleng sells 50 to 60 bats and during festive periods, he can sell up to 600.
""Bats are the favorite indigenous protein, particularly in North Sulawesi,"" Indonesian culinary expert and author of half a dozen of cookbooks, William W. Wongso, told Reuters.
""My favorite part is the wings,"" Wongso added.
Glands from the armpits and the neck of the bat are first removed to get rid of the bad smell.
It is then grilled or torched to get rid of the bat's hairs before being chopped and cooked in a stew of herbs, spices and coconut milk.

How do bats live with so many viruses?

The coronavirus is believed to have originated in a food market in the Chinese city of Wuhan that was illegally selling wildlife. Health experts think it may have originated in bats and then passed to humans, possibly via another species.
In China, the virus has killed more than 1,000 and infected more than 42,700.
There are 319 coronavirus cases in 24 countries and territories outside of China, according to the World Health Organization (WHO) and Chinese health officials.
None has been reported in Indonesia, but the outbreak has prompted many Manadonese restaurants in the capital, Jakarta, to take bats off the menu.

Several companies and institutes in Australia, China, France, Germany and the United States are racing to develop a vaccine -- a process that normally takes years.
Asked whether scientists from Taiwan would be allowed to take part in this week's Geneva conference, WHO officials said that they would do so but only online -- along with colleagues from other parts of China.
While the WHO does not deal with Taiwan directly and only recognizes Beijing, Taiwan was often allowed to attend annual assemblies and sideline meetings as an observer.
But in recent years it has been frozen out as Beijing takes an increasingly combative stance towards democratic Taiwan, which it considers its own territory.

BEIJING - The 2 most senior health officials at the epicenter of China's deadly virus outbreak have been sacked, state media said Tuesday, as pressure mounts over the way local authorities have handled the epidemic.
Zhang Jin, the Communist Party boss of the provincial health commission in Hubei, and its director Liu Yingzi have been removed from their positions, reported state broadcaster CCTV, after a decision by the province's party committee Monday.
The area has found itself at the center of a coronavirus outbreak that has killed more than 1,000 people and infected over 42,000 across China since December.

China virus toll passes 1,000 as Xi visits frontline hospital

Local officials have faced mounting pressure for perceived incompetence -- particularly after the death of a Chinese doctor in the provincial capital Wuhan who was punished for raising the alarm about the new virus.
Deputy director of China's National Health Commission Wang Hesheng will take over the 2 roles, said CCTV.
In another sign of personnel changes at ground zero of the outbreak, senior Beijing official Chen Yixin has been sent to Wuhan to guide epidemic control work.
IMAGE OF STABILITY
Chen -- a former deputy party chief of Hubei -- has been appointed deputy head of a central government group dispatched to the province, according to a report from the health commission on its WeChat account.
Analysts have said local authorities played down the extent of the outbreak in early January because they were holding political meetings at the time and wanted to project an image of stability.
Hubei remains on virtual lockdown to curb the spread of the virus.

Local Communist Party secretary Ma Guoqiang acknowledged last week that officials had worsened the spread by failing to restrict travel earlier. 
Wuhan authorities also faced criticism in January for going ahead with an annual public banquet for 40,000 families just days before the city was placed on lockdown.
Other manpower changes have been taking place in the province, including the removal of a top Red Cross official in Wuhan for dereliction of duty.

TAIPEI (3rd UPDATE) - Taiwan urged the Philippines on Tuesday to lift a travel ban on its citizens after Philippine airlines canceled flights to Taiwan due to a government ban on all foreigners traveling from the island to help contain the spread of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV).
Ministry spokeswoman Joanne Ou made the comments at a regular news briefing in Taipei, adding that some Taiwanese were stranded at airports in the Philippines after the ban was announced earlier this week.
The Philippines' 2 largest airlines -- Philippine Airlines and Cebu Pacific -- canceled flights to Taiwan after the government expanded its travel ban to include all foreigners coming from the island to help contain the spread of the coronavirus.
The Philippines' Bureau of Immigration said Monday the travel ban would take effect immediately and would follow the same procedures as in the previously announced restriction that covered China and its Special Administrative Regions Hong Kong and Macau.
Filipinos and foreigners with permanent resident visas may be allowed entry but will be turned over to the Bureau of Quarantine for assessment, Immigration Commissioner Jaime Morente said in a statement.
More than 115,000 Filipinos live and work in Taiwan, mainly in factories and as household helpers.

54 foreign passport holders, some of them natural-born Filipinos, are stuck at the NAIA after the PH govt announcement of travel ban in Taiwan at 9:50PM, Feb 10. They flew from from Taiwan at 10PM and arrived in PH around midnight.

PASSENGERS STRANDED
Some 50 passengers were stuck at the capital's airport after the Philippine government imposed a travel restriction for Taiwan.
The passengers told ABS-CBN News they came from the US and transited through Taiwan. They only learned about the travel ban after arriving at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) Terminal 1.
Most of them were natural-born Filipinos but are US passport holders.
They were not sent for quarantine inspection but were told to fly back to Taiwan.
PALACE: UP TO HEALTH ADVISORIES
Malacañang said lifting the travel ban on Taiwan would depend on the recommendation of the World Health Organization and its national health department.
Taiwan was included in the ban because it is a “part of China,” Palace spokesman Salvador Panelo said Tuesday.
“Since there is a ban on China, necessarily, Taiwan, being part of China, is included. And we always follow the recommendations of the World Health Organization,” Panelo told reporters.
The Taipei Economic and Cultural Office (TECO) in the Philippines meanwhile lamented the ""wrong"" inclusion of Taiwan in the travel ban.
""The Republic of China (Taiwan) is a sovereign and independent state. Taiwan issues its own passport and visas and has exclusive jurisdiction over its people and territory. In fact, Taiwan is not, nor has it ever been, part of the PRC,"" the office said in a statement.
Taiwan is an independently governed territory but the Philippines considers it part of China under the one-China policy.
TECO added that Manila should not be ""misled by WHO’s wrong information on Taiwan"" as part of mainland China.
""It is a factual error for the World Health Organization (WHO) to regard Taiwan as a part of PRC.""
For now, Panelo said the travel ban on Taiwan stays “until the WHO makes any announcement and until the DOH (Department of Health) recommends to the President [its lifting].”
Cases of the virus have been confirmed there.
“If the WHO says there is a need for the lifting of the ban in any part of those already announced with a travel ban then we will, I suppose, do so,” he said.

BANGKOK - Thailand has barred passengers from Holland America's cruise ship MS Westerdam from disembarking, its health minister said Tuesday, the latest country to turn it away amid fears of the coronavirus despite no confirmed infections aboard.
The company, owned by Miami-based Carnival Corp, had said on Monday that passengers would disembark in Bangkok on Feb. 13 and that there was no reason to believe anybody aboard had the virus.
""I have issued orders. Permission to dock refused,"" Public Health Minister Anutin Charnvirakul said in a Facebook post.
The Westerdam has already been turned away from several countries, including Japan, the Philippines and Thailand, amid fears of the coronavirus, which has killed more than 1,000 people and infected more than 40,000 since it was first reported in the Chinese city of Wuhan less than 2 months ago
Holland America says no one on board has the virus. Media reports say it carries 1,455 passengers and 802 crew; its original destination was Yokohama, Japan, which refused it permission to dock.
""The ship is not in quarantine and we have no reason to believe there are any cases of coronavirus on board despite media reports,"" the company said.
It had earlier said the Westerdam was sailing toward Bangkok, and it is not immediately clear whether the ship would change course.
Another cruise ship, the Diamond Princess, with 3,700 passengers and crew on board, is quarantined in the Japanese port of Yokohama, with 135 cases of coronavirus detected on the Carnival Corp-owned vessel.
Most of the coronavirus cases have been inside China, but there have been 319 cases in 24 other countries, including 1 death, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Monday.

(UPDATE) The 13th case of coronavirus in the United States was detected in California in a person under federal quarantine after returning from Wuhan, China, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said Monday.
The adult patient was among US nationals evacuated from Wuhan, the epicenter of the disease, who were under mandatory quarantine for 14 days at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar, near San Diego, the CDC said in a statement.
The individual was taken to the University of California San Diego Medical Center for observation and isolation and is ""doing well,"" the hospital said in a statement.
""CDC is conducting a thorough contact investigation of the person who has tested positive to determine contacts and to assess if those contacts had high risk exposures,"" the CDC said.
Some 800 US nationals have been evacuated from Wuhan and flown to air bases in the United States where they are subject to the CDC’s first public health quarantine in 50 years.
The US has imposed mandatory quarantines and travel restrictions with China to slow the spread of coronavirus within the United States. US officials fear a global pandemic if the virus is allowed to gain a foothold outside China, where the death toll has climbed to more than 1,000.

The latest individual diagnosed with coronavirus was the first confirmed case among some 800 US nationals evacuated to military bases in the United States on flights from Wuhan, the epicenter of the disease.
The person was among 4 evacuees taken to the UC San Diego Medical Center for further evaluation last week after arriving at the Miramar air base.
On Sunday, the CDC said all 4 patients initially tested negative for the virus and were discharged and returned to quarantine at the base. Further testing showed 1 of the 4 was positive and the patient was returned to the hospital.
Another patient from MCAS Miramar was taken to the hospital on Monday for evaluation, the medical center said.
""Both patients are doing well and have minimal symptoms,"" the hospital said.
None of the coronavirus cases confirmed in the United States has proved fatal and several patients have been released from hospital.
With most US-China flights suspended, only a handful of US nationals arriving on commercial flights have been quarantined under rules imposed on Feb. 2 to curb the virus' spread, according to a Reuters survey.
Of 8 states with airports screening travelers for the virus, 6 said they had no one under quarantine, New York reported 4 people and Illinois a ""tiny"" number, the survey found.

MADRID - Major tech companies are skipping the Mobile World Congress this year because of fears over the coronavirus, though Chinese groups and other big names still plan to attend the top industry event.
Amazon and Sony said Monday they would stay away from the world's biggest mobile tech fair in Barcelona, joining Swedish telecoms equipment maker Ericsson and South Korean giant LG.
NTT DoCoMo, the biggest Japanese telecommunications operator and one of the biggest in Asia, said it too would be absent for reasons of ""security"" stemming from the virus.
The annual gathering is scheduled for Feb. 24 to 27 this year.
""Due to the outbreak and continued concerns about novel coronavirus, Amazon will withdraw from exhibiting and participating in Mobile World Congress 2020,"" a Spanish-language statement said.
A Sony statement said: ""As we place the utmost importance on the safety and well-being of our customers, partners, media and employees, we have taken the difficult decision to withdraw from exhibiting and participating at MWC 2020 in Barcelona.""
LG, which normally has one of the biggest stands, said last week that its decision ""removes the risk of exposing hundreds of LG employees to international travel which has already become more restrictive as the virus continues to spread across borders.""
Like Sony, LG plans separate events to unveil its new mobile products.
Other trade shows have also been hit by the virus, with the biennial Singapore Airshow reporting the loss of more than 70 participants, including US group Lockheed Martin and Bombardier of Canada.
The MWC is a major date on tech company calendars and normally draws more than 100,000 people from all over the world to see the latest innovations and gadgets.
The mobile trade association GSMA that organizes the congress said Sunday it was taking drastic precautions this year to ease fears that it could become a hub for the virus to spread.
To date, more than 40,000 people have been infected and more than 900 have died in the outbreak that began in China's Wuhan city. Most deaths have been in China.
The Barcelona congress will be off limits to anyone from the Chinese province of Hubei, where the virus first broke out, and visitors from other parts of China will have to show they have been outside the country for two weeks before arriving in Spain.
Shenzhen-based ZTE, which makes smartphones and wireless networking equipment, and Huawei have said they still plan to attend, along with compatriots Oppo, Vivo and Xiaomi.
Finnish phone maker Nokia and the South Korean giant Samsung are also still expected.
""We remain more than 2,800 exhibitors strong,"" a GSMA statement said.
Daily disinfection
ZTE's exhibition stand and equipment will be disinfected daily and its booth exhibition staff will come from countries outside China, mainly from Europe, it said.
Senior executives taking part in ""high-level meetings"" at the gathering ""will self-isolate themselves in Europe for at least two weeks prior to the MWC,"" a ZTE statement said.
The company plans to showcase new 5G devices this year.
Huawei staff, including executives, have also arrived two weeks early and shut themselves up in their hotels, a company spokesman told AFP.
GSMA said: ""We are grateful for the preventative measures our Chinese exhibitors have put in place, notably ZTE and Huawei.""
Meanwhile, personnel will be on hand to take visitors' temperatures and exhibitors will be advised on how best to disinfect their stands.
Spain has not declared a health emergency and only two cases of coronavirus have been detected in the country so far, one in the Canary Islands and another on the Mediterranean island of Majorca.
""Everything will be done to ensure the participant's peace of mind,"" Barcelona Mayor Jaume Collboni told Antena 3 television.
But an association of Barcelona hotel operators acknowledged they had recorded cancellations for the period, which represents one of the Catalan city's most important events.

MANILA- Residents of Capas town in Tarlac need not worry about a possible spread of the 2019 novel coronavirus since authorities placed enough safeguards in the quarantine zone for repatriated Filipinos from the epicenter of the virus, a government official said Monday.
Police are guarding the perimeter of the quarantine site in New Clark City, an 18-minute drive from Capas while health authorities guard the repatriated Filipinos under observation, the Department of the Interior and Local Government said.
""There is really nothing for the people of Capas to be worried about since none of these repatriates showed symptoms of the disease,"" DILG Undersecretary Jonathan Malaya told reporters in Malacañang.
Thirty Filipinos from the Chinese city of Wuhan arrived in the Philippines on Sunday, marking the country's first evacuation of its nationals from the epicenter of the new coronavirus which has killed at least 900 people.

30 Filipinos from nCoV-stricken Wuhan arrive in Philippines

Prior to the arrival of repatriated Filipinos, Capas town Mayor Reynaldo Catacutan urged the national government to reconsider New Clark City as a quarantine site, saying the local government was not consulted in the ""last-minute"" decision.
Malaya on Monday however clarified that the national government need not seek the permission of the local government of Capas for the quarantine site since New Clark City is a property of the national government managed by the Bases Conversion and Development Authority.
He, however, assured residents of Capas that ""all precautionary measures are in place to ensure their safety and protection to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.""
The Philippines has so far monitored 267 patients suspected of carrying the new strain of virus, of whom 230 were admitted to hospitals and 19 were discharged. Three, all Chinese nationals, were confirmed to have acquired the virus.
The country recorded the first fatality outside of China with the death of a 44-year-old patient on Feb. 1.

The Filipinos and their spouses are scheduled to depart China on Saturday night and are expected to arrive at the Clark International Airport on Sunday morning.
They will be brought to the Athletes' Village in New Clark City in Tarlac for a 14-day quarantine period.
Dulay also allayed fears of those living near the quarantine area.

(First of all, the Athletes' Village is far from downtown Capas. Secondly, the task force secured the living quarters and flight of the repatriates. We are following quarantine protocols.)

Capas, Tarlac mayor Reynaldo Catacutan earlier expressed concerns over the plan to use the Athletes’ Village as a quarantine site.
""We acknowledge that the Bases Conversion and Development Authority has full jurisdiction over NCC, but I, as the Mayor of Capas, appeal in behalf of all Capaseños to our dear President Rodrigo Duterte and DOH Secretary Francisco Duque to consider another place or facility as isolation area,"" he said.
The Bureau of Immigration (BI), on its part, said the repatriates and their spouses will undergo stringent screening.
""We're going to process all the necessary immigration arrival formalities. 'Yong passport, dadalhin sa'min in a sanitized bag, and then, of course, we have all the protection as well.

SINGAPORE - Anxious Singapore shoppers formed long lines at grocery stores Saturday and cleared the shelves of essential items, after the city-state raised its alert level over China's coronavirus outbreak.

Singapore, which has reported 33 cases, raised its alert level Friday to ""orange"" -- the same as during the deadly 2003 SARS outbreak, indicating the virus is severe and passes easily between people.
The announcement triggered panic in the city-state of 5.7 million starting late Friday, with shoppers -- many wearing masks -- rushing to stock up on items including rice, noodles and toilet paper.
Pictures circulating on social media showed empty shelves in some stores, carts filled with goods and long lines at counters, which continued into Saturday.

As coronavirus infections continue to rise, the BI will now require both foreign and Filipino passengers abroad to completely fill out and submit their arrival cards.
Morente said he instructed immigration duty supervisors to strictly enforce the new policy so the bureau could help in tracing passengers who have traveled to China.
Previously, only foreign passengers arriving at the airports are required to fill out the arrival cards while Filipinos are obliged to fill out embarkation cards when they leave the country.
The bureau has also implemented strict screening of applications for the extended stay of foreign tourists to check if they traveled to China, Hong Kong and Macau within 14 days from their arrival, Morente said.
Applicants covered by the restriction shall be turned over to the Bureau of Quarantine for medical assessment, he added.

TOKYO - Three more people on a cruise ship off Japan have tested positive for the new coronavirus, bringing the number of infected aboard to 64, the government said Saturday, with passengers facing a 2-week quarantine.
The latest confirmation came a day after an additional 41 passengers were found to have contracted the virus, which has killed hundreds of people, most of them in China, where it has infected more than 30,000 on the mainland.

Japanese authorities have so far tested about 280 people on board the Diamond Princess, which was quarantined after a former passenger, who disembarked in Hong Kong last month, was diagnosed with the virus.
Test results from 6 more people were released on Saturday, with 3 of them confirmed infected, the health ministry said without giving further details such as their nationalities.
The 3 people have already been sent to hospital, the ministry said in a statement.
There were more than 3,700 passengers and crew on the ship when it arrived off Japan's coast on Monday evening. It docked in Yokohama on Thursday to resupply for a quarantine that could last until Feb. 19.
One of those found infected is in serious condition. Many on board are elderly and at greater risk of developing complications from the virus.
Testing was initially carried out on those who displayed symptoms or had come into close contact with the former passenger diagnosed.
'VERY, VERY SCARY'
Japan has already reported at least 25 cases of coronavirus aside from the infections on board the ship, and evacuated hundreds of citizens from Wuhan, the Chinese city where the pathogen emerged, including on a fourth flight Friday.
Passengers on the ship have been asked to stay inside their cabins to prevent new infections and have expressed confusion and frustration.
The World Health Organization (WHO) called on Tokyo to provide sufficient support, including mental care, for the passengers and patients.
""There's a lot to do to support those patients. Not just from the point of view of their physical health but from a mental health perspective,"" Michael Ryan, head of the WHO's Health Emergencies Programme, told reporters in Geneva on Friday.

The primary path is believed to be virus-laden droplets from an infected person's cough, though researchers in early cases have said they focused heavily on patients with respiratory symptoms and may have overlooked those linked to the digestive tract.
A total of 14 out of 138 patients (10 percent) in a Wuhan hospital who were studied in the new paper by Chinese authors in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) initially presented with diarrhea and nausea one or two days prior to development of fever and labored breathing.
The first US patient diagnosed with 2019-nCoV also experienced loose bowel movements for two days and the virus was subsequently detected in his stool. There have been other such cases in China documented in the Lancet, albeit infrequently.
""Importantly, 2019-nCoV has been reported elsewhere in the feces of patients with atypical abdominal symptoms, similar to SARS which was also shed in urine, suggesting a fecal transmission route which is highly transmissible,"" William Keevil, a professor of environmental healthcare at the University of Southampton said in a comment to the UK's Science Media Centre.
The possibility is not totally surprising to scientists, given that the new virus belongs to the same family as SARS.
Fecal transmission of SARS was implicated in sickening hundreds in Hong Kong's Amoy Gardens housing estate in 2003. A rising plume of warm air originating in bathrooms contaminated several apartments and was transported by wind to adjacent buildings in the complex.
Based on the literature, ""the 2019-nCoV virus found in stool may be transmitted through fecal spread,"" added Jiayu Liao, a bioengineer at the University of California, Riverside.
But, he added: ""We still do not know how long this virus can survive outside the body -- HIV can only survive roughly 30 minutes outside the body -- and what temperature range the 2019-nCoV is sensitive to.""
Fecal spread could present new challenges to the virus's containment, but is more likely to be a problem inside hospitals, which can become ""amplifiers"" of epidemics, said David Fisman, an epidemiologist at the University of Toronto.
Benjamin Neuman, a virology expert at Texas A&M University-Texarkana, cautioned that while fecal transmission was ""certainly worth considering,"" ""droplets and touching contaminated surfaces then rubbing eyes, nose or mouth"" were likely the main way the virus was transmitted based on current data.

MAYNILA - ""The Brave 5"" kung ituring ni Health Undersecretary Gerardo Bayugo ang medical team na pinalilipad papuntang Hubei - na episentro ng 2019 Novel Coronavirus.
Ang grupo, na kinabibilangan ng dalawang nurse na sina Rowell Divinagracia at Jay Juan; medical technician na si Elmer Collong; doktor na si Oliver Macalinao at isa pang doktor mula sa Bureau of Quarantine ang inatasang bantayan ang kalagayan ng mga Pinoy na ire-repatriate o ililikas mula sa Hubei.
May halo mang kaba, mas nanaig sa kanila ang matulungan ang mga kababayang makauwi.
""Mas nananalaytay yung pagiging Filipino ko, that I have to help. Kaya ba nating iwanan 'yong mga kababayan natin gustong umuwi. Papabayaan ba natin sila? For me hindi ko kaya 'yon,"" ani Divinagracia.
""The fact that these people want to go home and they’re our countrymen, talagang hindi puwedeng iwanan 'yon,"" ani Collong.
Matagal nang nurse sa DOH si Juan at karangalan para sa kaniya na makapaglingkod sa isa sa pinakamalaking health emergency na tumama sa mundo nitong nakalipas na linggo.
""'Pag meron ka nang passion to serve, yun na yun eh. susunod na yung pagiging prepared mo,"" ani Juan.
Pag-uwi,sa harap uupo ang mga medical personnel at sa gitnang bahagi ng eroplano pauupuin ang 45 Pinoy na pauuwiin.
Mananatili namang bakante ang huling limang hilera ng eroplano sakaling makaramdam ng sintomas ang mga pasahero, ayon kay Macalinao.
Pagdating sa paliparan, isasailalim sa screening ng Bureau of Quarantine ang mga Pinoy.
Pagkatapos, isasailalim sila sa mga protocol at quarantine, na itinayo ngayon sa New Clark City at ituturing na pasyente.

Samantala, umalma naman ang lokal na pamahalaan ng Capas sa planong gawing quarantine area ang New Clark City, batay sa resolusyong inilabas nila ngayong Biyernes.
Ayon kay Capas acting mayor Roseller Rodriguez, hindi sila naabisuhan tungkol dito.
""There was no coordination we were not informed by the DOH the BCDA that they will use the athletes village as quarantine station,"" aniya.
Pero paliwanag ng kinatawan ng Health regional office na hindi naman daw basta-bastang mahahawa sa bagong coronavirus maliban na lang kung magkakaroon ng interaksyon sa isang nahawa rito.
Giit pa nila, pinili ang New Clark City dahil mas kumpleto ito sa gamit at magiging mas komportable umano ang mga titira rito.
Ayon sa Bases Conversion and Development Authority, sisiguruhin nilang ligtas ang mga residente at poproteksyunan nila ang mga ika-quarantine sa NCC.
Plano namang makipag-ugnayan ng DOH sa alkalde ng Capas para masigurong hindi mahawa ang mga residente.
Sa ngayon, naka-lockdown na ang New Clark City.

HONG KONG- Hong Kong on Friday said it would deploy an army of volunteers to bolster plans to forcibly quarantine all arrivals from mainland China, warning that anyone caught breaching the new rules faces up to 6 months in prison.
In a major escalation of its battle against the new coronavirus, the international finance hub has said anyone arriving from the mainland from Saturday will have to undergo 14 days compulsory quarantine.
Officials hope the new measures will virtually halt all cross-border traffic while allowing the city to remain stocked with food and goods from the mainland where the virus has killed more than 600 people.
Cabinet ministers unveiled the quarantine plans just 6 hours before the new policy was due to come on.
Hong Kong residents arriving from mainland China will be allowed to self-quarantine at home. Chinese and international visitors will be able to self-quarantine at hotels or any other accommodation they have arranged.
""If they cannot arrange accommodation, they will be taken to the temporary facilities prepared by the government,"" Health Secretary Sophia Chan said.
Anyone who has been to mainland China in the past 14 days and then flies into Hong Kong from another destination will also be quarantined. 
Officials -- backed by volunteers from the civil service and some students -- will conduct spot checks or make daily phone calls to ensure people were staying at home.
Those caught breaking their quarantine face up to six months in jail and a HK$25,000 ($3,200) fine.
""We will be stopping a lot of people with the new measures,"" Security Minister John Lee said.
PANIC-BUYING 
The new regulations have been enacted under a sweeping emergency law that allows city leaders to bypass the legislature during a disease outbreak.
Exemptions would be made for a variety of key jobs, including flight and shipping crews as well as cross border truck drivers to ensure goods and food keep coming into the city.
Hong Kong has been hit by a wave of panic-buying in recent days with supermarket shelves frequently emptied of crucial goods such as toilet paper, hand sanitizer, rice and pasta.
The government has blamed false online rumors of shortages, saying supplies are stable.
""The problem of supply shortage doesn't exist,"" said Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung.
""Citizens do not need to worry or make excessive purchases out of panic. I urge the public not to believe in rumors.""
The new coronavirus that emerged in Wuhan at the end of last year has killed more than 630 people and spread around the world.
The latest figures from China show there are more than 30,000 people infected there.
Outside mainland China, there have been more than 320 infections reported in two dozen countries.
Hong Kong has 25 confirmed cases, with one patient who died earlier this week. Many of the newer infections have no history of travel to mainland China, prompting fears that the city now has a local self-sustaining outbreak.
There have been growing calls for the border with China to be sealed entirely. 
Hong Kong's pro-Beijing leadership, which currently has record-low approval ratings after months of pro-democracy protests, had been reluctant to make such a move.
Thousands of medical workers, including some doctors and nurses, have been on strike this week in a bid to force the government to entirely seal the border.
On Friday, hundreds of union members occupied the offices of the Hospital Authority. Late Friday the union called off its strike.

GAPYEONG, South Korea- Thousands of couples -- some in facemasks -- tied the knot in a mass Unification Church wedding Friday, despite concerns in South Korea over the spread of the coronavirus outbreak.
The church founded by Sun Myung Moon -- revered as a messiah by his followers -- distributed face coverings to the 30,000 crowd, but only some donned them.
""I am overwhelmed that I am getting married today,"" said Choi Ji-young, who met her husband -- matched by the church -- only two months ago.
""It would be a lie if I said I was not concerned at all about the infection,"" said the 21-year-old university student. ""But I feel like I will be protected from the virus today.""
South Korea has recorded 24 cases of the novel coronavirus outbreak that emerged in neighboring China, where more than 30,000 cases have been confirmed, and Seoul has barred entry to foreigners who have recently been in Wuhan, the epidemic's center.
Festivals, graduation ceremonies, and K-pop concerts have been canceled over fears large events could facilitate virus transmission, and authorities have asked religious groups to co-operate in preventing it spreading.
The church went ahead with the event because it had been ""four years in the making"" as part of the celebrations of the 100th anniversary of Moon's birth, said official Jang Young-chul.
But followers from China were asked not to come, he added.
Nearly 6,000 identical-dressed couples from 64 countries -- many of whom met for the first time in recent weeks -- married in Gapyeong, a festive mood filling the venue as newlyweds took group photos and were congratulated by friends and relatives.
'GOD'S CONTROL'
Mass weddings, often held in giant sports stadiums with tens of thousands of couples, have long been a signature feature of the church, whose followers have been dubbed ""Moonies"" after its founder, who died in 2012.
They began in the early 1960s, involving just a few dozen couples at first but with numbers mushrooming over the years. In 1997, 30,000 couples took part in a joint wedding in Washington, and two years later around 21,000 filled the Olympic Stadium in Seoul.
Those who choose to be matched by the church must confirm under oath that they are virgins, and after their wedding, the couple must refrain from sexual relations for a minimum of 40 days.
Kim Chang-seong, 27, who was marrying a woman whom he met 20 days ago, said he was not concerned about infection because the mass wedding had ""special meaning"" for him.
""By marrying a fellow church believer, I am taking a path paved by our church leaders.""
The teachings of the Unification Church are based on the Bible but with new interpretations, and Moon saw his role as completing the unfulfilled mission of Jesus to restore humanity to a state of ""sinless"" purity.
While it claims a worldwide following of three million, experts suggest the core membership is far smaller.
Evelyne Chimfwembe, who flew in from Botswana to attend the ceremony with her husband of 28 years, said she was not worried about the virus as she believed the event would be ""under God's control.""

MANILA- The Department of Health on Friday said that the body of the first novel coronavirus fatality has been finally laid to rest, but was short on details whether the patient was cremated.
Health Undersecretary Eric Domingo confirmed that the man's body and that of another patient who tested negative for novel coronavirus but died because of pneumonia “have been disposed properly already.”
“They are no longer in San Lazaro (Hospital),” Domingo said, assuring the public that safety procedures were followed.
Domingo declined to say if the 44-year-old's corpse was buried in a public cemetery, as earlier suggested by Health Secretary Francisco Duque.
“I cannot divulge for privacy reasons and for the dignity of the buried,” he said, however refusing to deny or confirm that a burial took place.
Earlier, the DOH said funeral parlors were refusing to cremate the body of the first n-CoV related death outside China.

Domingo said the cadaver does not pose health hazards, ""as long as it is handled and buried properly.""
The 44-year-old Chinese man came to the Philippines from Wuhan city, the epicenter of the 2019 novel coronavirus acute respiratory disease (2019-nCoV ARD), on January 21 with his partner. While his 38-year-old partner has recovered, the man died on February 1.
Health Secretary Francisco Duque III earlier lamented that the health agency was unable to have the body cremated due to fears that the cadaver still had the virus, which has already infected 30,000 people and killed more than 600 mostly in China.

MANILA – The suggested retail price (SRP) for surgical face masks may increase to P10 to P12 per piece from P8 due to rising costs of raw materials, Trade Secretary Ramon Lopez said Friday. 
Prices of raw materials for face masks have increased, and costs of surgical face masks abroad have also spiked by P10, Lopez told reporters. Local suppliers were still keeping prices at P8 as of Feb. 7. 
A surge in demand for surgical and N95 masks was observed following the Taal Volcano eruption and the global outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus. 
“Yes, the suggested retail price may increase. I won't say double for now as we are still getting various costings,” Lopez told ABS-CBN News. 
Any changes in the prices, however, will be consulted with the Department of Health.

SINGAPORE - Singapore on Friday reported 3 more coronavirus cases that have not been linked to previous infections or travel to China, prompting it to raise its alert to orange, the same level it reached during the SARS outbreak in 2003.
Singapore now has 33 confirmed coronavirus cases.
The orange alert means the virus is severe and passes easily from person to person and was last raised during an outbreak of H1N1 influenza from 2009 to 2010.
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) killed more than 30 people in Singapore and hundreds worldwide.
""As there are now a few local cases without any links to previous cases or travel history to China, we have stepped up our risk assessment,"" the health ministry said in a statement, adding that firms should be prepared for ""widespread community transmission.""
The highest alert is red, which indicates the virus is spreading widely.
Singapore advised businesses to cancel or defer non-essential large-scale events but said the Singapore Airshow will go ahead next week although organizers may limit public visitors.
Of the new cases reported on Friday, 1 was a teacher and authorities said all students and staff who had come into contact with her would have to spend 2 weeks at home.
A British man has also contracted the coronavirus after traveling to a business meeting in Singapore, which has also been linked to cases in the city-state, Malaysia and South Korea, health ministry official Kenneth Mak said.
Mak said authorities had not yet identified the source of infection at the meeting of more than 100 employees from an as-yet-unnamed firm at the Grand Hyatt Hotel in mid-January.

MANILA - The Department of Health on Friday appealed to the local government units to allow repatriated Filipinos from Hubei, China to stay in assigned quarantine sites, as it allayed fears that the virus will easily spread.
“Mga kababayan naman natin itong uuwi. Hahanapan naman natin sila ng lugar na safe, na malayo sa komunidad,” said Health Undersecretary Eric Domingo during a press conference.
“We will appeal naman sa puso’t damdamin nila (LGUs) na i-welcome itong mga kababayan natin dahil sisiguraduhin ng lahat ng ahensya ng gobyerno na hindi malalagay sa panganib yung kanilang mga mamamayan,” he added.
(Those who will go home are our fellowmen. We’ll find a safe place for them that will be far from the community. We’ll appeal to the hearts and emotions of our LGUs to welcome our fellow Filipinos because our government agencies will ensure that the rest of the population won’t be in danger.)
Earlier in the day, Capas, Tarlac Mayor Reynaldo Catacutan appealed to the health department to find another place to house some 40 repatriated Filipino workers.
Capas, Tarlac houses The Athletes' Village, where the repatriates will be quarantined for 14 days.

Domingo said the Inter-agency Task Force led by the DOH will work together to talk to the LGU. “Hindi naman pwedeng lahat ng LGU aayaw,” he said.
(We can’t have all LGUs refusing.)
The health official also explained that only those without symptoms will be allowed to board the plane going to the Philippines. Those who are sick will have to be left behind in China to be admitted to a hospital.
“We’ll have DOH personnel on the flight to monitor if anyone will develop symptoms. And this flight will only take a few hours,” he said.
“As soon as they arrive, we’ll have the Bureau of Quarantine escort them,” he added. “Those who are sick or are not feeling well will be brought to the hospital.”
“Ang ilalagay lang natin sa quarantine facility yung malulusog at walang pinapakitang sintomas,” he clarified.
(Those who will be brought to the quarantine facility are those who are healthy and those who do not show symptoms.)
As of Friday, more than 600 people have died from the new strain of coronavirus while more than 30,000 have been infected. Most of the patients are from China.

HONG KONG - Hong Kong Airlines said Friday it has been forced to slash hundreds of jobs and ask remaining staff to take unpaid leave as the coronavirus outbreak compounds problems at the already-struggling firm.
The announcement by the city's number two carrier comes days after Cathay Pacific said it had asked all its 27,000 workforce to take three weeks leave without salary between March and June because of collapsing demand caused by the health crisis.
The virus, which has infected 24 people, one of whom died, comes just as the city was struggling to recover from months of sometimes violent protests that battered the economy and gutted the key tourism sector.
Hong Kong Airlines said in a statement that strict entry and quarantine measures imposed by countries around the world have further impacted travel demand in the city and the firm had to take ""vigorous measures"" to mitigate the challenges.
The company said it will lay off 400 employees, with the remainder asked to take a minimum of two weeks no-pay leave per month or work three days a week from Feb. 17 until the end of June.
""There has never been a more challenging time in Hong Kong Airlines' history as of now,"" the company said in an email statement to AFP.
""As uncertainty looms with the evolving nature of this global issue, weak travel demand will likely continue into the summer season and we need to take further action to stay afloat.""
The airline is owned by struggling Chinese conglomerate HNA Group, which has been looking to lower its debt burden.
In November it announced it would delay salary payments to some staff as it struggled to find cash, triggering a warning from regulators that its licence might be at risk. While it managed to keep flying thanks to an injection of funds, it continues to struggle.
The coronavirus, which was first detected in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year, spread over the Lunar New Year holiday and has now killed more than 600 people in the country, with at least 31,000 infected.
The crisis has seen a number of governments around the world and in Asia block flights to and from Hong Kong, including popular destinations Taiwan and the Philippines.

,Feb 07 2020,nCov,Pangolin identified as potential link for new coronavirus spread,ABS-CBN News,"


 


BEIJING - The endangered pangolin may be the link that facilitated the spread of the novel coronavirus across China, Chinese scientists said Friday.
At least 31,000 people have been infected and 630 killed by the virus, which has spread to 2 dozen countries.
Researchers at the South China Agricultural University have identified the scaly mammal as a ""potential intermediate host,"" the university said in a statement, without providing further details.
The new virus, which emerged at a live animal market in central China's Wuhan city late last year, is believed to have originated in bats, but researchers have suggested there could have been an ""intermediate host"" in the transmission to humans.
After testing more than 1,000 samples from wild animals, scientists from the university found the genome sequences of viruses found on pangolins to be 99 percent identical to those on coronavirus patients, the official Xinhua news agency reported Friday.
The pangolin is considered the most trafficked animal on the planet and over 1 million have been snatched from Asian and African forests in the past decade, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).
They are destined for markets in China and Vietnam, where their scales are used in traditional medicine -- despite having no medical benefits -- and their meat is bought on the black market.
China in January ordered a temporary ban on the trade in wild animals until the epidemic is under control.
The country has long been accused by conservationists of tolerating a shadowy trade in endangered animals for food or as ingredients in traditional medicine.
The SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) virus that killed hundreds of people in China and Hong Kong in 2002 and 2003 also has been traced to wild animals, with scientists saying it likely originated in bats, later reaching humans via civets.

MANILA - Want to welcome or send off your loved ones at the airport? Avoid coming in groups for now amid the spread of the new coronavirus.
The Manila International Airport Authority (MIAA) on Friday urged the public to refrain from visiting airport terminals in groups amid growing fears over the spread of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV).
""This call is being made not to alarm the public. This is our simple way of supporting inter-agency efforts to prevent and contain the spread of the virus,” MIAA General Manager Ed Monreal said in a statement.
""Let us say our goodbyes at home and not go to the airport in groups when meeting a passenger. It is very hard to fight tradition, but in times like this, everyone should look out for their own safety,"" the airport chief added.
It has been a custom in the Philippines, a country with at least 10 million migrant workers, for families and friends to welcome or say goodbye to their loved ones at the airport in big groups.
Issuance of visitors' passes in 4 terminals of the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) will be limited, the MIAA said.
Exception will be given to those assisting medical patients, the elderly, children and pregnant women.
The MIAA will also regulate passes to VIP rooms for official guests of the government and foreign embassies.
Monreal said they would also suspend tours and filming in the facilities.
The 2019 Novel Coronavirus acute respiratory disease (2019-nCoV ARD), which health experts said spreads through close contact, has been confirmed to have infected 3 Chinese nationals in the Philippines.
They all came from Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the outbreak, which appeared from a market that sells exotic animals, such as bats and snakes, as delicacies.
As of Friday, the Philippines said it was monitoring 212 patients suspected of carrying the strain, which manifests as fever, cough, shortness of breath, and breathing difficulties.
Of the number, 184 are currently admitted in hospitals, 9 have refused admission, 17 were discharged but under strict monitoring and 2 had died of other causes, the Department of Health (DOH) said.
The Philippines has implemented a ban on travelers to and from China to contain the virus. Several airlines have also suspended flights to and from Chinese destinations.
More than 600 people have died and some 30,000 have contracted the virus, mostly in China, as of Friday.

MANILA - The Philippine tourism industry has lost at least P10 billion pesos as government continues to impose a travel ban to and from China, the country's second largest tourism market and epicenter of the deadly 2019 novel coronavirus, an official from a tour operators' group said Friday.
About 50 percent of reservations in Boracay, Bohol, Cebu, and Palawan have been canceled, Philippine Tour Operators Association President Cesar Cruz told reporters.
""Both for inbound and outbound [travel], it would really have a very big effect,"" he said.
""It hit us during the peakest of the peak, which is the Chinese New Year,"" he said.
The tourism industry may continue to feel the effects of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Acute Respiratory Disease (2019-nCoV ARD) until August, he said.
The Department of Tourism (DOT) is eyeing to boost promotions in South Korea and the United States, the Philippines' top and 3rd largest tourist markets, respectively, Tourism Secretary Bernadette Romulo-Puyat said.
The DOT is also coordinating with hotels and airline companies to give discounts to attract more visitors, she said.
Stopping the spread of the virus is the government's primary concern, she said.
The 2019-nCoV has killed at least 600 people and infected 30,000 others, mostly in China since the origin of the pathogen was traced to the Chinese city of Wuhan in late December 2019.
The Philippines has recorded 3 cases, all Chinese travelers from Wuhan, among whom 1 has died.

MANILA - The 2019 Novel Coronavirus acute respiratory disease (2019-nCoV ARD) may become less infective when the weather gets warmer, a former health secretary said Friday.
""It will probably be affected by the season. As the weather gets better, warmer, then the virus is probably going to be a little less infective,"" Dr. Esperanza Cabral told ANC's ""Early Edition.""
An international health expert, in a report on US website Vox, described coronaviruses as ""winter viruses.""
""When the weather is warm and moist, these viruses don’t spread as well as when the weather is cold and dry,"" said Dr. Tony Fauci, head of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.
Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV), according to the World Health Organization.
The 2019-nCoV ARD, which originated from a market in the Chinese city of Wuhan that sells exotic animals, is a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans. 
As coronavirus infections continue to rise, Cabral, who served as health chief during the term of then President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, said the outbreak may last for a few months.
""As a matter of fact, the number of cases reported doubles every week. So if this continues by the end of February, we will be looking at 400,000 [infection] cases and 800 deaths from coronavirus in China,"" she said.
As of Friday, the novel coronavirus has claimed at least 636 lives and infected more than 30,000 others in China as of Friday.

China virus death toll hits 636, more than 30,000 infections 

The Philippines, which experiences a ""hot dry season"" that starts from March to May, has also recorded 3 confirmed cases, including 1 death, all Chinese travelers from Wuhan. The health department is also monitoring 178 people for possible infection, including 147 who were admitted in hospitals.

Wearing face mask to ward off the illness is not required, except the sick, health workers and those exposed to crowded places, Cabral said.
Cloth masks, she added, don't work against viral illnesses.
""For viruses, the cloth masks don't work. Cloth masks are okay for dust coming from the Taal Volcano ashfall, but not for preventing viral illness,"" Cabral said.

""It's not really necessary. It's an overreaction... What's the use of going to school for 3 days and not going to school for 2 days. On the days when they go to school, they are equally exposed to whatever it is they fear they're going to be exposed [to],"" Cabral said.
Asked about the government's response to the outbreak, she admitted that the Department of Health is ""always playing catch-up"" as the agency is swamped with work.
""They are doing their best. I think we should help them by heeding their advice, by staying calm, because there's no good can come out in panicking... Right now, they need all the help they can get,"" Cabral said.

SEOUL - The most productive car factory in the world fell quiet on Friday as South Korea's Hyundai suspended operations at its giant Ulsan complex, hamstrung by a lack of parts with the coronavirus outbreak crippling China's industrial output.
The 5-plant network can make 1.4 million vehicles annually, in a coastal location facilitating importing components and exporting cars globally.
But supply lines are crucial in an ever more interconnected worldwide economy and the coronavirus outbreak in China has seen Beijing order factories closed in several areas as it seeks to contain the epidemic.
As a result, Hyundai -- which with its affiliate Kia ranks as the world's fifth-largest auto manufacturer -- has run out of the wiring harnesses that connect vehicles' complex electronics.
It is having to suspend production at its factories across South Korea, putting 25,000 workers on forced leave and partial wages, healthy victims of the disease outbreak across the Yellow Sea.
""It's a shame that I can't come to work and have to accept a pay cut,"" said an Ulsan production line staffer surnamed Park. ""It's a very uncomfortable feeling.""
The closures could be the first example of a phenomenon that rolls out around the world, analysts say.
The impact on Hyundai will be eye-watering, with analysts estimating a five-day South Korean shutdown to cost the firm at least 6 hundred billion won ($500 million).
Hyundai is not the only corporate casualty: Kia will suspend three plants for a day on Monday, the South Korean unit of French automaker Renault is considering stopping its factory in Busan next week, and Fiat Chrysler CEO Mike Manley told the FT his firm could be forced to halt one of its European factories.
Analysts warn of broader troubles if Beijing extends the Lunar New Year holiday further as the coronavirus -- which according to official figures has infected more than 31,000 people in China and killed 636 -- continues to spread.
""The biggest problem is that we don't know how the outbreak in China will unfold,"" said Cheong In-kyo, an economics professor at Korea's Inha University.
""South Korean companies rely heavily on China for parts and components. The problem is even if just one part is missing, you can't do anything.""
The disruption was only just beginning, he added, and warned it would spread beyond the auto sector.
""There is not a single category that is not manufactured in China.""
'EVERYONE IS IMPACTED'
The People's Republic is the world's biggest exporter of goods, with the US by far its largest trading partner.
Exports to the US from China and Hong Kong combined -- many goods are shipped via the financial hub -- totaled more than $450 billion last year, followed by Japan with more than $150 billion. South Korea and Vietnam also both imported goods worth more than $100 billion from the pair.
""China has become an integral part of the global manufacturing supply chain, accounting for about one-fifth of global manufacturing output,"" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics.

Toyota extends China plant closure over virus

Its neighbors will be hit by supply chain effects first, he said, naming Taiwan and Vietnam, followed by Malaysia and Korea.
The effects in the US would be delayed by the length of the supply lines, said Kristin Dziczek of the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Michigan, but there would be secondary impacts on parts from other overseas markets built with Chinese items.
Automakers and suppliers were ""evaluating and planning how to navigate the disruptions"", she said. ""But there is no capacity the size of China sitting idle waiting to fill in the gaps and it's difficult to move quickly in this environment when everyone is impacted.""
'SO DEPENDENT'
The global car industry was plunged into turmoil when a single Renesas Electronics factory in Japan -- making a vital and widely-used microcontroller -- was put out of action by the 2011 Fukushima earthquake.
Supply lines have since become much more diversified, analysts say.
""Car manufacturers have a system of multiple sourcing because the risk would be too big to have only one supplier in one place for a particular part,"" said Ferdinand Dudenhoeffer, director of Germany's Center Automotive Research.
It was standard for parts to be provided by ""at least two different suppliers"", he said, adding that as part providers tended to be in the same region as the vehicle assembly line, ""the car industry in Europe or America is much less exposed to a Chinese risk than Asian countries like Korea or India"".
But sourcing wiring harnesses from three different companies failed to protect Hyundai's South Korean plants.
""We should have more diversified suppliers,"" said production worker Park. ""It's a shame that there is nothing we can do at this point because we are so reliant on one country.""

Denis Balibouse, Reuters


MANILA — Despite the rapid rise in new coronavirus infections at the Chinese province where the outbreak began, there is no similar acceleration elsewhere, a World Health Organization (WHO) official said Thursday. 
“There has been a constant increase in cases in Hubei province but we haven’t seen that acceleration in provinces outside of Hubei,” said Dr. Michael Ryan, head of the WHO Health Emergencies Programme, during a press briefing in Geneva on Thursday.
“And equally we haven’t seen that acceleration in Hong Kong, Macau, in Taiwanese people either. I think again we are seeing a relatively stable situation outside of Hubei,” he added.
However, Ryan said there are also “cycles of transmission” and that it is possible that there will again be an increase in the coming days. 
As of Thursday morning in Geneva, there was a slight dip in the rate of rise in cases of the 2019 novel coronavirus acute respiratory disease (2019-nCoV ARD).
“The cumulative number, it looks like the daily numbers are rising but the number reported today compared to the number reported yesterday is actually down today. It doesn’t mean anything but it’s enough going in the right direction,” Ryan said.

READ: WHO: Too early to say new coronavirus peaking in China

“Nearly 3,700 cases of coronavirus confirmed on a single day is nothing to celebrate,” he said when asked if the dip meant that the transmission of the new strain of the new coronavirus was peaking. 
“I think it’s right now too early to make predictions,” he explained. “Although we are pleased that the numbers from today are the first day in which the overall numbers of confirmed cases reported from China have dropped, and so we are thankful, and I’m sure our colleagues on the frontline in China are thankful too.”
“But it is very difficult to make any prediction relating to that. We are still in the middle of an intense outbreak and we need to be very careful on making any predictions,” he added.
As of Friday morning (Manila time), the death toll in the novel coronavirus outbreak has risen to 636, with more than 30,000 people infected.

READ: China virus death toll hits 636, more than 30,000 infections

A Reuters report said that the new coronavirus took 48 days to infect the first 1,000 people. This is relatively fast compared to two other human coronaviruses: the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which took 130 days to infect 1,000 people, and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which took 2.5 years to infect 1,000 people.

READ: What we know and do not know about the new coronavirus

This even while the 2019-nCoV ARD has a lower reproduction number of two to three. A reproduction number is the average number of people that can be infected by one patient. 
This number helps health organizations determine if an outbreak will spread or if it is being eliminated. SARS had a reproduction number of two to four compared to measles, which has a reproduction number of 12 to 18.
In the Philippines, there are now three confirmed cases of the 2019-nCoV ARD. One of them died - a 44-year-old man who had come to the Philippines from Wuhan, the origin of the virus in Hubei - while two no longer show symptoms of the disease.
Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, technical lead of the WHO’s Health Emergencies Programme, said international experts have been regularly holding teleconferences to share information on the disease, which was said to have started spreading from a market selling wild animals as delicacies in Wuhan in December last year.

Van Kerkhove said the new strain has so far resulted in a “full spectrum of disease.”
“We have mild cases, which look like the common cold, which have respiratory symptoms - sore throat, common cold, runny nose, fever- all the way to pneumonia,” she said during the briefing, which was made available online. 
”And there can be varying levels of severity of pneumonia. All the way to multi-organ failure and death.”
Asked what the demographics of the patients looked like, Van Kerkhove said “underlying conditions (such as diabetes and hypertension) and advance age make an individual more at risk for developing severe disease and death.”
“Individuals who are over 60 years old have a higher risk of death,” she said. “We have seen a breakdown and it appears over (the age of) 80 is the highest risk factor. Increasing age increases the risk for death.”
The WHO has declared a global health emergency because of the epidemic, which has had spillover effects in other countries in the Asia-Pacific and North America.

MANILA- A Filipino who tried to seek medical attention in a clinic at Festival Mall in Muntinlupa City was brought to the hospital after showing flu-like symptoms as malls guard against the spread of the 2019 novel coronavirus.
The patient showed flu-like symptoms during a checkup at the Healthway Medical clinic on Thursday, Festival Mall said in a statement, and was immediately brought to the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine in Muntinlupa.
""Rest assured that Festival Mall has been taking precautionary measures to assure the safety of our shoppers, business partners, and its employees,"" the mall said.

 
Festival Mall added that it also coordinated with the Muntinlupa City Health Office over the incident.
The mall remains fully operational, it clarified.
Malls and business establishments have set up alcohol stations and purifiers, and other measures against the spread of the novel coronavirus which was first confirmed in the Philippines last week.
The novel coronavirus has killed at least 630 people and infected more than 30,000 worldwide in a matter of weeks, authorities said Friday.

MANILA - Residents of Capas will be ""kept safe and protected"" from the quarantine zone for repatriated Filipinos from the epicenter of the 2019 novel coronavirus, the agency that manages the Tarlac facility said Friday.
""Preventive and precautionary measures are being put in place"" in the New Clark City before it serves as the quarantine area for Filipinos from Wuhan, China, the Bases Conversion and Development Authority said in a statement.
""We would like to assure the municipality of Capas and its officials that the national government will address all the issues and concerns raised following the decision of the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases to use New Clark City as a quarantine site for our repatriated kababayans,"" it said.
""All preventive and precautionary measures are being put in place by the Task Force not only for our repatriated kababayans, but to also ensure that the adjacent communities of New Clark City and all Capaseños are kept safe and protected,"" it said.
The statement was released hours after Capas town Mayor Reynaldo Catacutan urged the national government to reconsider the decision, saying the local government was not consulted in the ""last-minute"" decision.
The mayor did not cite further reasons for his appeal and apprehension.
Some 50 overseas Filipino workers from Wuhan, where the pathogen originated, availed of the government's repatriation program and is expected to arrive in the country over the weekend.
The new coronavirus strand has killed at least 600 people and infected 30,000 others worldwide.
The local health department earlier said n-cOV was not a death sentence and that most of those afflicted eventually recover. Data from China showed that most of the fatalities were over 60 years old and had pre-existing medical conditions.

MANILA — Authorities have identified more than 500 people who came in close contact with the Philippines' 3 confirmed cases of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV), with some now being monitored for possible infection, the health department said Friday. 
The group that interacted with the first 2 patients -- a man and a woman from the epicenter of the disease in Wuhan, China -- included 379 passengers and crew members from flights that the pair took. 
Another 62 people were from hotels, resorts, a hospital, public vehicles and other areas they visited, said Health Undersecretary Eric Domingo. 
Some 106 people, meanwhile, were traced as those who had contact with the third patient.
Domingo said that while the DOH Epidemiology Bureau has now identified all 441 people that came into contact with the first two patients, 206 have yet to be interviewed because of “erroneous contact information.” 
“Of the contacts reached, 203 were placed on home quarantine, while the 32 contacts exhibiting symptoms were categorized as PUIs (patients under investigation),” he said. 
With 22 people already interviewed and placed on home quarantine, another four people showing symptoms were also categorized as PUIs.
Domingo said they were already working with police and local authorities to find people who interacted with the couple during their visits to Cebu, Dumaguete and Manila.
While the 38-year-old Chinese woman is already recovering from the novel coronavirus, her 44-year-old partner has died.

A third patient, a 60-year-old Chinese woman, had already recovered and left the Philippines by the time the DOH learned that she contracted the virus. Because of this, the Epidemiology Bureau were reaching out to people in Cebu and Bohol who possibly interacted with her. 
“To date, 106 contacts were traced, this includes 90 co-passengers and 16 individuals from hotels and hospitals in contact with the 3rd confirmed case,” Domingo said.
As of Friday, the Philippines has recorded 215 patients probed for possible novel coronavirus infection, including the three confirmed cases so far: the first 2 patients and another 60-year-old woman from Wuhan who tested positive for the virus, said Domingo.

MANILA- Filipino tourists bound for Jeju Island in South Korea will no longer be allowed to visit the tourist spot without a visa, the Bureau of Immigration said Friday as the East Asian country guards against the spread of the 2019 novel coronavirus.
The new travel protocol was implemented after the Korean Embassy in Manila told the Bureau of Immigration of the temporary suspension of visa-free entry of Filipino tourists to Jeju.
""We have already instructed our immigration officers not to allow the departure of any Filipino bound for Jeju unless the passenger was issued a visa by the Korean embassy,"" BI port operations division chief Grifton Medina said in a statement.
There are no direct flights from Manila to Jeju, except for chartered flights.
The suspension of visa-free entry privileges to Jeju is not limited to Filipinos but to all foreign tourists as well, Medina added.
The virus, which originated from Wuhan City in China, has prompted governments worldwide to step up precautionary measures against the pathogen which is rapidly spreading.
The Philippines confirmed its first case of the novel coronavirus, which causes flu-like symptoms last week, prompting the government to bar travel to China and its territories.

BEIJING, China – The official Chinese death toll from the coronavirus outbreak rose on Friday to 636, with the government saying total infections had climbed past 30,000.
The toll was raised by 73 new deaths from the epidemic, the National Health Commission said in its daily update.
Another 3,143 new cases of infection were confirmed, bringing total infections in the country thus far to 31,161, it said.

Immigration spokesperson Dana Sandoval said 177 Chinese, mostly tourists, left the Ninoy Aquino International Airport Terminal 1 at 9:06 p.m. Wednesday on board a chartered flight arranged by the Chinese Embassy in Manila.
“Nahihirapan sila mag-book ng ticket kasi wala outbound flights dahil nag-cancel na ang mga airlines,” she said.

“Parang mga OFWs natin na gusto nila umuwi kasi nahihirapan na din sila mag-book ng flights to go home,” she added.
(They’re like our overseas Filipino workers who want to go home but find it difficult to book flights.)
Philippine carriers Philippine Airlines (PAL), Cebu Pacific and Air Asia have cancelled flights to mainland China after the Philippine government imposed a travel ban on February 2.
The ban prohibits foreigners who travelled to China in the past 14 days from entering the Philippines and bars Filipinos from travelling to China, except in certain circumstances.
PAL has announced it would mount special flights on Feb. 10 from Manila to Xiamen and back to service stranded Filipinos.
The travel ban came amid the quick spread of the 2019-nCoV, the outbreak of which began in Wuhan, China. The Philippines has confirmed three cases of the virus here- all Chinese citizens who had come from Wuhan. One of the patients died on Saturday, becoming the first death from the virus outside China.
Sandoval said the Chinese nationals who left Wednesday make up the first group to leave the country. Many more stranded Chinese citizens are expected to follow suit but Immigration authorities are still waiting for information from the Chinese Embassy on the next scheduled flights.
Sandoval earlier said around 300 Chinese travelers were stranded at the Manila airport because of the cancellation of flights due to the travel ban.

TOKYO—Tokyo 2020 Olympics organizers said Thursday the Games would ""go ahead as planned,"" slamming misinformation over the new coronavirus for triggering panic.
Chief executive officer Toshiro Muto revealed that organizers had set up a task force to combat the fast-spreading disease that has killed over 560 people and infected at least 28,000 -- the vast majority in mainland China -- but promised that the Games would be not derailed.
""The Olympics will go ahead as planned,"" he told reporters after a Paralympic project review.
""It is important to remain objective and cool-headed. We don't want to alarm the public. The infection is still limited and there is no problem staging the Olympics based on the current situation.""
International Paralympic Committee (IPC) spokesman Craig Spence complained that scaremongering had created an ""info-demic"" that could skew public perception in the run-up to the Olympics and Paralympics.
""Fear is spreading quicker than the virus,"" he said. ""It's important we quell that fear. Only 191 of the total cases are outside mainland China, so let's put things into perspective.
""If you compare those rates with the common flu, they are still relatively small numbers,"" added Spence.
""The World Health Organization (WHO) has not declared this a pandemic. We dealt with the Zika virus in Rio and in these matters we need to rely on the experts.
""We will follow the advice of the World Health Organization. Every organizing committee looks into countermeasures, and we have measures in place from previous Olympics and Paralympics here in Tokyo. It is standard practice, it's business as usual.""
More than 20 countries have confirmed cases of the flu-like coronavirus.
GLOBAL PANIC
Japan has had no reported deaths so far, but 45 cases have been detected, including at least 20 people on a cruise ship carrying more than 3,700 passengers and crew quarantined off Yokohama.
The WHO has declared the outbreak a global health emergency.
Japan has warned citizens against non-essential travel to China and fast-tracked new rules including limits on entering the country as it tries to contain the spread of the virus.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Thursday pledged that preparations for the Olympics would proceed as normal.
""The coronavirus is beginning to have an impact on tourism,"" he said. ""But the government will continue to steadily prepare for the Games in close cooperation with the IOC (International Olympic Committee), the local organizing committee and the Tokyo Metropolitan Government.""
The Japanese government has chartered 3 flights to repatriate 565 Japanese nationals from Wuhan, the central Chinese city hardest hit by the virus.
Tokyo governor Yuriko Koike promised at the weekend to implement ""thorough measures"" to protect people from the virus.
The health scare has led to the cancellation of Olympic qualifying events in China such as boxing and badminton.
The Tokyo Olympics begin on July 24 with the Paralympics starting on Aug. 25.

MANILA - The Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth) has warned its member-hospitals to accept all patients with suspected infection of the new coronavirus.
Should accredited medical institutions refuse to provide care to patients, the state health insurance agency said they will be dealt with by the corporation accordingly.
""Refusal to provide care to said patients shall be considered a violation of the signed Performance Commitment and shall be dealt with by the Corporation accordingly,"" PhilHealth president and chief executive officer Ricardo Morales said in a statement released Wednesday.
All accredited level 2 and 3 hospitals, which have the capacity to perform quarantine and manage infectious diseases, are directed to accept suspected cases of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus acute respiratory disease (2019-nCoV ARD) for assessment and appropriate management, Morales added.
PhilHealth also reiterated that the World Health Organization (WHO) had already declared the outbreak a global health emergency.
""PhilHealth is working hand in hand with the Department of Health and other concerned agencies to ensure that all Filipinos are protected from risks brought about by this emerging disease,"" Morales said.

Duque: PhilHealth to offer coverage for suspected new coronavirus cases 

Health Secretary Francisco Duque III earlier said PhilHealth would offer a special package for its members with symptoms of the new strain of coronavirus.
The package includes a P1,000 per day for each hospital taking care of a suspected nCoV patient, he had said.

Philippines confirms 3rd new coronavirus case

As of Wednesday, the number of confirmed coronavirus infection in the country was 3, including a Chinese man who died from severe pneumonia on Feb. 1. It was the first recorded nCoV-related death outside China.

China virus death tolls rises to 560: govt 

Philippine health authorities are also monitoring 178 patients for possible infection of the virus, which has killed nearly 600 in China.

The Philippine Sports Commission on Thursday said that a number of national events has been postponed, as the country deals with the 2019 novel coronavirus. 
The PSC has also proposed moving the 10th ASEAN Paragames at a later date.
In a press conference, PSC chairman William Ramirez said the National Sports Summit 2020, the Philippine National Games, Batang Pinoy, and Children’s Games will be rescheduled, although no dates were mentioned.
Seminars and other gatherings with 40 or more participants have also been shelved indefinitely.
Ramirez said that his office also recommended the postponement of the 10th ASEAN Paragames, which is penciled for March 20 to 28.
“We have a board resolution advising the Paralympics to possibly postpone the games,” he said.
The decision comes down to the Philippine Paralympic Committee.
PPC president Mike Barredo said he will fly to Thailand on Friday to discuss the issue with the ASEAN Para Sports Federation.
Amid the global spread of the 2019 nCoV acute respiratory disease, the PSC is focused on the welfare of the athletes and coaches bound for the Tokyo Olympics later this year.
“In terms of preventive measures, we have put out information materials for our national athletes and coaches,” said Marc Velasco, the PSC chief of staff and the national training director.
“The PSC Board will not approve any foreign trips and exposures to China. Caution will be exercised on allowing athletes and coaches traveling to other countries for international competitions

SPECIAL FLIGHT PA-CHINA
Samantala, dahil sa laki ng demand ng mga banyagang pasahero sa Pilipinas na papuntang China, magsasagawa ng special flight ang Philippine Airlines (PAL) sa Lunes, Pebrero 10, ayon sa tagapagsalita ng airline.
Ito ay sa kabila ng ibinabang ban ng Pilipinas sa pagbiyahe papunta at pabalik ng Mainland China, Hong Kong at Macau bilang pag-iingat sa pagkalat ng novel coronavirus.
Lilipad nang balikan mula Ninoy Aquino International Airport at Xiamen, China ang eroplano.
Hindi bababa ng eroplano ang flight crew at piloto, pero pagbalik ng Pilipinas ay sasailalim ang mga ito sa 2 linggong quarantine, ayon kay PAL Spokesperson Cielo Villaluna.
Nasa 27,300 na ang nahawahan ng novel coronavirus, karamihan ay galing sa China, habang hindi bababa sa 560 ang namatay.
Sa Pilipinas, 3 na ang kumpirmadong kaso ng novel coronavirus, kabilang ang isang lalaking Chinese na pumanaw dito at isang babaeng pasyenteng nakabalik na ng China bago pa nakumpirmang positibo siya sa virus.
Samantala, isang Pinay household worker naman sa Dubai ang naiulat na nasawi dahil sa hindi pa natutukoy na strain ng coronavirus, ayon kay Labor Secretary Silvestre Bello III.
Hindi malinaw kung alin sa mga uri ng coronavirus ang ikinamatay ng 58 anyos na overseas worker, na galing General Santos City at 28 taon nang nagtatrabaho doon, ani Bello.

MANILA (UPDATE) - Malacañang has started requiring Palace visitors to fill up a health declaration form in light of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus outbreak.
Reporters covering President Rodrigo Duterte’s event on Thursday afternoon were asked to answer the form, which contains questions on one’s travel history for the past 14 days, as well as recent interactions with animals.
All visitors of Malacañang, including their respective security detail, are required to fill up the form as part of precautionary measures against the virus, Presidential Security Group (PSG) commander Brig. Gen. Jose Niembra told ABS-CBN News.
The forms will be distributed until the Department of Health (DOH) lifts the protocol on the virus, he added.

The PSG began implementing stricter security measures against the virus this week after the Philippines confirmed the entry of the pathogen in the country.
All persons entering the Malacañang complex undergo a temperature check and are also asked to rub their hands with alcohol.
A member of the PSG said those with a body temperature of 38 degrees Celsius or higher will be refused entry. All PSG personnel were also required to wear face masks.

Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles on Wednesday said Cabinet officials also underwent a temperature check before their meeting with the President on Tuesday night.
The President, who earlier said that the virus outbreak was “nothing really to be extra-scared of,” also rejected calls of his staff to limit his public engagements for the meantime, Nograles said.
“He (Duterte) just wants to keep on doing the things he’s doing without imposing limitations sa kaniyang (on his) movement,” the Cabinet secretary said. “He doesn’t want to change the way he conducts his business.”

YOKOHAMA - Thousands of people were stranded aboard 2 cruise ships in Asia on Thursday, quarantined by officials desperate to stem the spread of a deadly virus that has killed hundreds in China and spread panic worldwide.
At least 20 people on board 1 ocean liner off the Japanese coast have tested positive for the new coronavirus, with thousands more staring at a 2-week seaborne isolation. 
The outbreak on the vessel, whose 3,700 passengers and crew hail from over 50 countries, is the latest development in a snowballing global health emergency that has left more than 560 people dead, most of them in China.
Tens of thousands of people have been infected, including a few hundred in around 2 dozen countries.
The World Health Organization, which has declared the outbreak a global health emergency, on Wednesday appealed for $675 million to fight the virus.
In Japan, more than 3,700 people were stuck on board the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which has been held off the port city of Yokohama since Monday night.
Authorities decided to quarantine the ship and test hundreds on board after a former passenger who disembarked in Hong Kong last month tested positive for the virus.
Health Minister Katsunobu Kato told parliament on Thursday that results for 102 people had now come in, with 20 testing positive for the new strain.
In all, 273 people on board were tested, including those who had close contact with the former passenger and others displaying potential symptoms.
The first 10 people diagnosed with the new virus have already been removed from the ship, which on Thursday docked in Yokohama to resupply for a quarantine that could last until Feb. 19.
Ambulances arrived at the port, where officials could be seen dressed in white full-body protective suits, complete with face masks and helmets, to remove the additional 10 people who have tested positive.
An extendable white-tented passageway was wheeled to a door on the side of the massive cruise ship, apparently to protect the identity of people being evacuated from the boat.
'FLOATING PRISON'
""We are confined here full time,"" British passenger David Abel said in a Facebook Live video.
""The meals have completely changed. We are definitely not on a luxury cruise!... It's going to be like a floating prison.""
In Hong Kong, 3,600 passengers and crew spent the night marooned on board the cruise ship World Dream as authorities conducted health checks after 3 former passengers tested positive for the virus.
City health officials said passengers would only be allowed off after tests were completed, with crew checked first and passengers to be screened on Thursday.
Two dozen countries now have confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus that emerged from a Wuhan market selling exotic animals at the end of last year.
China is struggling with a shortage of hospital beds, equipment and materials to treat those infected, despite building 2 hospitals from scratch and converting public buildings to house patients.
'DON'T GO OUT!'
Tens of millions of people, from the eastern industrial heartlands to near the northern border with Russia, have been told to stay indoors as authorities battle to curb the outbreak.
In parts of Hangzhou, 175 kilometers (110 miles) from Shanghai, new restrictions allow only 1 person per household to go outside every 2 days.
""Please don't go out. Don't go out. Don't go out!"" blared a message on a loudspeaker urging people to wear masks, wash their hands regularly and report any people from Hubei -- reflecting a common fear that people from the province might infect others.
Several governments have imposed travel restrictions over the virus, while major airlines have suspended flights to and from China.
Italy announced that passengers on every international flight would be scanned for fever and on Thursday Taiwan banned all international cruise ships from docking.
China has reacted angrily to the travel bans, noting that the WHO does not advise imposing them.
Health experts note that the mortality rate of the new virus, at around 2 percent, is well below that of SARS, which killed 800 people in 2002-2003, around 10 percent of those infected.
Two fatalities have been reported outside the mainland, in Hong Kong and the Philippines.

BEIJING - Students blocked from returning to their universities; tourists forced to extend expensive holidays; a scientist cut off from her lab in the United States: coronavirus entry bans are wreaking havoc on the plans of thousands of Chinese travelers.
From the US to Australia and Israel, several countries have banned entry to foreigners who have recently been in China, while major airlines have suspended flights to and from the country.
AFP spoke to 4 Chinese people in limbo:
EXTENDED VACATION
After traveling to Japan from the Chinese city of Chongqing for a skiing holiday in the mountains of Hokkaido, Wang Bili was supposed to return to Washington, where he works for an international organization, on Feb. 10.
""The American decision was a total shock,"" he said.
""I had to change my tickets for a later date to comply with the incubation period.""
Now he will not be able to return to Washington until mid-February, but he said he doubted whether the US decision would be effective.
""They can't know when a Chinese person left China,"" he said, noting that China does not stamp the passports of its citizens when they leave.
But the main thing bugging the 32-year old is the cost of extending his stay in Japan.
""This will cost me another $1,000,"" he said. ""I'm annoyed but what can I do?""
SYDNEY STUDENT
Like other Chinese students who were back at home when Australia announced its restrictions, Chloe has not been able to return to her university Down Under.
""Some Chinese students didn't even find out about it until they got off the plane in Australia. Then they had to pay out of their own pockets for a flight back to China,"" she said.
She is worried about paying her rent in Sydney, and being evicted if she cannot.
""Will we be able to graduate? It's really a hassle. All of this is upsetting the plans we had for the next 2 or 3 years.""
Her plans to take a holiday in New Zealand before term started again were also ruined, when the country announced similar restrictions.
""I've lost a lot of money in canceled hotel bookings.""
RESEARCH HALTED
When Sherry Huang first heard about the US travel ban, she felt shocked.
""How could such a strict measure come out so suddenly?"" said the 36-year-old, who is staying at her parents' home in Xiamen, in the southeastern province of Fujian.
Huang, who does biomedical research in the United States, had last visited China in 2016. This year was a rare chance to gather with family over the Lunar New Year holiday.
But the Chinese researcher is now stuck on the mainland after Washington banned all foreign nationals who have traveled to China in the last 2 weeks.
That means her lab experiments -– which she cannot conduct remotely –- have been suspended until she returns.
""This is a key time period,"" Huang emphasized. ""I have made some very interesting findings and we can make some new discoveries soon.""
If research is suspended now, she said, the impact will be ""pretty large.""
""China is so big -– implementing a travel ban on an entire country is not reasonable,"" said Huang. ""Such a large-scale travel ban will impact many people's lives.""
NO INFORMATION
A second-year student at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology, Xiao Shen said he has not heard anything from his university or Australian authorities since the ban. 
""Everything I know has come from the news,"" he fumed.
""Australia hasn't told us anything, nothing on whether term has been postponed or if we'll be able to take our classes over the internet... it's really irresponsible. I'm angry."" 
As Chinese students are forced to defer studies, top Australian universities stand to lose around $2 billion in fees alone, according to preliminary estimates from analysts at Standard & Poor's.
Xiao thinks Australia should only have banned entry to tourists, or those coming from Hubei province at the epicenter of the virus. 
""I understand it's for safety reasons but it's too much. They haven't thought about how it will impact foreign students at all.""

SYDNEY - The coronavirus outbreak could deliver a painful multi-billion-dollar hit to Australian universities, as high-paying Chinese students are forced to defer their studies, economists warned Thursday.
Top universities stand to lose around US$2 billion (Aus$3 billion) in fees alone, according to preliminary estimates from analysts at Standard & Poor's.
Under open-ended travel restrictions imposed by the government in a bid to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, non-Australian citizens or permanent residents who have been in China since Feb. 1 are not allowed into Australia.
The virus's outbreak came in between Australia's academic years -- which begin in February -- and as many of the country's roughly 165,000 Chinese university students had returned home for the Lunar New Year.
""Our calculation is one of higher-education fee revenues only, and excludes the broader economic contribution from students to accommodation, tourism, and domestic consumption of goods and services,"" S&P said in a report.
Foreign students are a vital income stream for Australian universities and one that has grown exponentially in recent years.
Australia is now 1 of the top 3 destinations for foreign students worldwide.
Student representatives told AFP that many of those students have not been able to return in time to start this semester and fear missing the whole year because of the way courses are constructed.
Universities have offered to defer placements and reimburse tuition fees, but many are also trying to buy time.
The University of Sydney has extended the last date students have to be on campus to March 30 -- more than a month after classes were due to begin -- and is trying to arrange for remote teaching.
Australia's top universities are expected to be disproportionately hit, but they should be able to absorb the blow, at least temporarily.
""We believe they have some buffer in free cash, leverage, and operating margin ratios to absorb a temporary shock to revenues,"" S&P said.

HONG KONG - Panic buyers in Hong Kong have descended on supermarkets to snap up toilet rolls as the government warned that online rumors of shortages were hampering the city's fight against a deadly coronavirus outbreak.
Videos obtained by AFP showed long queues of frantic shoppers packing trolleys with multiple packets of toilet rolls, with some arguments breaking out.
Rice and pasta have also become a popular target for panic buying.
The footage -- and photos of shelves emptied of toilet rolls -- sparked a call from the government for the public to halt panic buying. 
""In response to various rumors recently that there are shortages of goods such as rice and toilet papers, leading to panic buying and even chaos, a government spokesman today expresses regret over the malicious act of spreading rumors when the city is fighting against the disease, and condemns those rumor mongers with evil intentions,"" the statement said. 
While Hong Kong has closed most of its land borders to mainland China, where the coronavirus outbreak began, freight services have not been affected, the government said.
""There are sufficient stocks of staple food including rice and pastas. There is no need for the public to worry,"" the statement said.
Harold Yip, founder of Mil Mill, a Hong Kong-based waste paper recycling company, told AFP they received over 100 inquiries from members of the public about toilet paper on Wednesday alone.
RTHK news reported that toilet paper and rice at one supermarket in the district of Wanchai -- which had been fully restocked overnight -- were cleared within 30 minutes of the store opening on Thursday morning.
The supermarket chain Wellcome said rumors of shortages were unfounded. 
The coronavirus has killed more than 550 people in China since spreading from the central city of Wuhan late last year. 
Hong Kong now has 21 confirmed infections, including 1 patient who died.
The majority of those infected came from mainland China. 
But in recent days there has been a spike in carriers with no history of travel to the mainland sparking fears local transmissions were growing.
The city's pro-Beijing leader Carrie Lam has faced growing calls to close the border with China, a step she has been reluctant to take saying it would be economically damaging and discriminatory. 
Her administration has gradually cut the number of land border crossings to just 2.
On Wednesday, she announced anyone arriving from the Chinese mainland from Saturday would face a mandatory 2-week quarantine. 
While Hong Kong maintains close economic and cultural links to the Chinese mainland, as seething distrust of the authorities in Beijing permeates the city.
The 2003 outbreak of the SARS virus, which Beijing initially covered up, killed 299 people in Hong Kong and left lasting psychological scars on the densely populated city.
Lam already boasts record-low approval ratings after using riot police to quell 7 months of huge and often violent pro-democracy protests.

SINGAPORE - At least 3 employees of a multinational company that held a meeting of more than 100 international staff in Singapore have contracted the new coronavirus, sparking a World Health Organization investigation of the case.
Malaysia and South Korea have confirmed 3 cases of the virus related to the mid-January company meeting held with 94 overseas staff at the Grand Hyatt hotel, and Singapore said late on Wednesday 4 other attendees were showing symptoms.
Authorities have not revealed the name of the company that held the meeting or said what business it is involved in.
Malaysian health authorities have said people from China including 1 from the city of Wuhan, where the virus emerged in December, attended.
""WHO is coordinating with relevant ministries of health in relation to it,"" Olivia Lawe-Davies, a spokeswoman for the WHO, said in response to questions from Reuters.
""As countries are stepping up surveillance, the detection of more cases of local transmission can be expected.""
Singapore has reported 28 cases of the coronavirus, including some involving person-to-person transmission.
The cases linked to the Singapore business meeting provide more evidence the virus is spreading through human-to-human contact outside China, which the WHO has said is deeply concerning and could signal a much larger outbreak.
China reported its biggest daily jump in fatalities from the virus on Thursday, up 73 to 563, although there have been only 2 reported deaths outside mainland China.
Malaysian health authorities first revealed the link to the Singapore business meeting when they confirmed the case of a 41-year-old Malaysian who had attended it, along with colleagues from China.
South Korea subsequently confirmed 2 cases involving South Korean who attended the conference. The Koreans and the Malaysian shared a buffet meal during the conference, South Korean media reported.
Of the 15 Singapore attendees, 4 have been referred to its National Center for Infectious Diseases, Singapore's health ministry said. All the overseas attendees have left Singapore, the ministry added.
A spokesman for the Grand Hyatt, Gerald Kheng, said the hotel had been deep cleaned after it was first informed of the incident by the health ministry on Tuesday and it was not aware of any other cases among guests or staff.
The city-state says no evidence has emerged of widespread community spread but it announced new precautionary measures on Tuesday including halting group activities such as school assemblies.
Several firms in Singapore have suspended business and media events, including a big travel fair, but the Singapore Airshow is set to go ahead next week albeit on a smaller scale.

TAIPEI - Workers making iPhones at tech giant Foxconn's plant in central China will be quarantined for up to 2 weeks, the company said Thursday, as cities on the mainland tighten their defenses against the deadly coronavirus outbreak.
Also known by its official name Hon Hai Precision Industry, Foxconn is the world's biggest contract electronics maker and assembles Apple's iPhones, as well as gadgets for other international brands.
Foxconn's vast network of factories in China, including one of its largest in Zhengzhou in central Henan province, are set to resume operations on Feb. 10 after an extended Lunar New Year holiday caused by the outbreak. 
But the company said it has advised instate and out-of-state employees at the Zhengzhou plant to be quarantined for 7 and 14 days, respectively, in accordance with local government policies.
China's industrial base has been buffeted by the outbreak of the virus, which began in the manufacturing hub of Wuhan in central China but has since spread to more than 20 countries. 
The number of confirmed infections has hit more than 28,000 in China while death toll passed 560 in an outbreak that has spiraled into a global health emergency.
The virus is also set to have an impact on international supply chains and manufacturing given China's lynchpin role in the global economy. 
Foxconn now projects a sales increase of 1 to 3 percent this year, down from a January forecast of 3 to 5 percent, chairman Young Liu told Bloomberg News.
Foxconn has tried to allay fears of production shortfalls, saying it had previous experience of viral outbreaks following the SARS epidemic in 2003. 
It is China's biggest private-sector employer with more than 30 factories and research facilities -- including 1 in Wuhan.
Taiwan has reported 11 confirmed cases so far, mostly people returning from Wuhan.
The government announced Thursday that all foreigners who resided or visited China, Hong Kong or Macau in the past 14 days will be temporarily barred from entering the island. 
Foreigners with residency permits in Taiwan returning from these areas must undergo a 14-day stay-home quarantine.

MANILA—Getting vaccinated against flu and pneumonia may help protect people against the new coronavirus, a health expert said Wednesday.
""Magpabakuna kayo because it might save your life. Kahit wala pa tayong nCoV na vaccine, meron naman tayong vaccine sa trangkaso at sa iba't ibang bagay, sa pneumonia,"" Dr. Edsel Maurice Salvana of the National Institute of Health (NIH) said during the Kapihan sa Manila Bay press forum.

""Kasi nga 'yong mga namatay sa nCoV... karamihan do'n, 70 percent, meron silang preexisting illness, or matandang-matanda or batang-bata... Mas mabubuhay ka kung healthy ka,"" added Salvana, director of the NIH's Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology.

The second confirmed case in the Philippines, a 44-year-old man from Wuhan, China, died of severe pneumonia.
""Kung nabakunahan sana siya, baka hindi siya namatay,"" Salvana said.
Meanwhile, another medical doctor urged the elderly to get vaccinated because they are more at risk in getting infections. 
""Anybody above 50 to 55 years old, basta meron underlying disease—mahina ang baga, chronic asthma, may diabetes na uncontrolled, cardiovascular conditions—[it would be] best magpabakuna na kayo against pneumonia because that would really help protect or reduce your chances of infection,"" said Dr. Beaver Tamesis, president of the Philippine Pharmaceutical & Healthcare Association of the Philippines.
(Anybody who is 50 to 55 years old, has underlying disease— weakened lungs, chronic asthma, uncontrolled diabetes, cardiovascular conditions—it is best for you to get vaccinated against pneumonia because that would really help protect or reduce your chances of infection.)
Flu vaccines, for example, must be taken annually, especially between May to August, Tamesis said.
""It can shorten your illness—from 10 days to as short as 1, 2 days or even just hours or totally protect you against the infection,"" he said.
To date, there is no medicine to prevent or treat those infected with the new coronavirus, but health authorities are racing to develop a treatment.

The Philippines on Wednesday confirmed its third case of the 2019-nCoV ARD—a 60-year-old woman from Wuhan, the epicenter of the respiratory contagion. She has since gone back to China after overcoming the disease.

An event in Manila that was supposed to be attended by K-pop boy band EXO has been cancelled amid concerns over the 2019 novel coronavirus.
The band was set to hold an event in February 22 to mark the 8th anniversary of South Korean cosmetics brand Nature Republic in the Philippines.
But fears over the 2019 novel coronavirus, which has infected over 24,000 worldwide and killed nearly 500, prompted organizers to cancel the event.

 
“We regret to inform all of you that the ‘Journey to the Nature Republic in Manila’ on Feb. 22, 2020 will be cancelled,” Nature Republic Philippines announced in a Facebook post on Wednesday.
EXO debuted in 2012 under SM Entertainment, one of the major players in the K-pop industry.

MANILA - Baguio City is not on lockdown amid the threat of the new coronavirus, its mayor clarified on Wednesday.
""Wala pong lockdown sa Baguio (There's no lockdown in Baguio.) We are still open to visitors and tourists,"" city mayor Benjamin Magalong told radio DZMM.
He made the announcement after Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana earlier said the Philippine Military Academy (PMA) homecoming may be rescheduled due to a supposed city-wide lockdown for tourists and visitors.
""Gusto ko lang pong klaruhin dahil honest mistake ko naman po 'yong nabanggit niya (I just wanted to clarify because what he mentioned was my mistake),"" Magalong said.
Due to the growing spread of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus acute respiratory disease (2019-nCoV ARD), the city had also postponed several crowd-drawing activities, such as the Cordillera Administrative Region Athletic (CARAA) Meet and International Jazz Festival.

""Everyday tinitingnan ang kanilang condition, mini-measure ang kanilang temperature (They are checking their conditions and measuring their temperatures everyday),"" he said, adding the schools have also temporarily refused accepting students.
As temperature in Baguio continues to drop, Magalong also allayed fears that flu may be common in the city because of the colder weather.
""Marami po kaming respiratory problems, cases dito dahil malamig... kaya may flu-like symptoms kami rito at tinututukan po ng Department of Health (DOH) (We have many respiratory cases here because of the cold weather... that's why some are exhibiting flu-like symptoms and the DOH is on top of it),"" he said.
On Wednesday, the city's temperature is expected to drop to 11 degree Celsius due to amihan or northeast monsoon, which brings cold air from the northern hemisphere, according to state weather bureau PAGASA.

MANILA - The number of patients being observed for possible infection of the new coronavirus has increased to 133, the Department of Health (DOH) said Wednesday.

READ: Patients checked for new coronavirus in PH rise to 105

“We have a cumulative total since the beginning of 133 PUIs [patients under investigation]. Of the 133 PUIs, 115 are admitted and isolated while 16 have been discharged under strict monitoring,” Health Undersecretary Eric Domingo said in a press conference.
PUIs are those who recently traveled to China, where the 2019 Novel Coronavirus acute respiratory disease (2019-nCoV ARD) originated, and show signs of illness such as fever, colds and cough.
Of those being checked, 63 are Filipinos, 54 are Chinese and 16 are of other nationalities. Thirty-two of them had traveled to Wuhan City in China, where the first cases of the new coronavirus were reported.
Bacolod City, meanwhile, said two men are under quarantine in a hospital for having history of travel to areas where cases of the new coronavirus have been recorded.
Dr. Grace Tan, spokesperson of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Acute Respiratory Disease Inter-Agency Task Force, said one of the patients under investigation is a 67-year-old foreigner who had a layover in Taiwan prior to his flight back to the Philippines and Negros Occidental on Jan. 21.
The other PUI is a 40-year-old Filipino who traveled to Hong Kong and returned home on Jan. 27.
Medical Center Chief II Dr. Julius Drilon said they are still waiting for results of the test conducted on two other PUIs who have been quarantined since Feb. 1 and 3.
In Tarlac, 6 PUIs tested negative for the virus, the Tarlac provincial government said in a Facebook post. Gov. Susan Yap said the capitol is undertaking all measures to prevent the spread of the virus 
As of Wednesday, the Philippines has 3 confirmed cases of the virus. The first 2 are a Chinese couple from Wuhan, China. The 44-year-old man died but the 38-year-old woman is recovering and no longer showing signs of illness but remains in hospital. 
Meanwhile, the third case is a 60-year-old woman who was belatedly diagnosed. She was already cured and cleared to return to China when test results arrived confirming that she was infected with the disease.

READ: Philippines confirms 3rd new coronavirus case

Contact tracing for the Chinese couple yielded 203 contacts so far. Of that number, 188 are quarantined at home but 15 are showing symptoms of illness. 
While the 14 are already in isolation, DOH is seeking local government and police assistance to bring the last person to the hospital. “He initially refused to be admitted,” Domingo explained.
The DOH is still calling on other passengers of Cebu Pacific flight 5J 241 from Hong Kong to Cebu on Jan. 20 and 21, 2020; Cebgo flight DG6519 from Cebu to Dumaguete on Jan. 21, 2020; and Philippine Airlines flight PR 2542 from Dumaguete to Manila on Jan. 25, 2020 to cooperate with authorities.
The DOH Epidemiology Bureau has also started contact tracing those who interacted with the 3rd confirmed case. These will be those from her Hong Kong to Cebu flight on Jan. 20 and her subsequent flight to Bohol. 
As far as the DOH is concerned, she was no longer infectious during her flight from Bohol to Cebu and then back to China.
As of Wednesday, at least 490 people have died because of the disease while 20,000 are infected, most of them from China.

HANOI - Vietnam is setting up field hospitals with thousands of beds to handle a potential influx of coronavirus cases, health officials said, as it prepares to receive its nationals from China.
Vietnam shares a long porous border with China and the communist neighbors have close trade and tourism ties. 
So far Vietnam has 10 confirmed cases of coronavirus -- including 3 people with no recent travel history to China.
The virus, declared a global health emergency by the World Health Organization, has so far killed nearly 500 people and infected more than 24,000, mostly in mainland China. 
Travel restrictions, flight bans and quarantines have been imposed as countries ramp up efforts to control the fast-spreading pathogen.
In Vietnam's southern business hub of Ho Chi Minh city -- where 3 cases of coronavirus have been confirmed -- 2 existing facilities are being converted into field hospitals with a total capacity of 500 beds. 
They will ""receive, monitor and treat"" all suspected patients of coronavirus if the epidemic spreads further, according to the director of the city's health department, Nguyen Tan Binh.
In Hanoi, 2 military facilities have been turned into quarantine centers for up to 1,500 people as the country prepares to receive 950 people from China to be isolated at the sites. 
Two provinces in northern Vietnam near the China border have also set up beds for close to 3,000 patients. Central Vietnam has centers ready for as many as 3,700. 
Vietnam has not announced plans to repatriate it citizens from China en masse, though 21 Vietnamese students in Wuhan -- the center of the epidemic -- could be brought back on a chartered flight, the government said.
Vietnam has banned all flights to and from mainland China and suspended new tourist visas for Chinese nationals or foreigners who have been there in the past 2 weeks.
All passenger trains to and from China have also been halted.

HONG KONG - Hong Kong was testing over 1,800 passengers and crew on a cruise ship for a coronavirus that originated in Wuhan, after some crew members reported having fever and other symptoms.
Authorities were not letting anyone leave the ship without permission.
The Chinese-ruled city's health department said Wednesday 90 percent of the passengers were Hong Kongers and no mainland Chinese were on board. 
Previously, 3 mainland Chinese that had been on the ship between Jan. 19 and 24 were found to have contracted the virus.
The World Dream ship, operated by Dream Cruises, was denied entry in the southern Taiwan port of Kaohsiung on Tuesday. On Monday, the ship visited Taiwan's northern Keelung port.
It was not clear how long passengers and crew would be kept on the ship.

MANILA - Justice Secretary Menardo Guevarra on Wednesday stood by his earlier directive ordering the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) to investigate peddlers of ""fake news"" about the 2019 Novel Coronavirus acute respiratory disease (2019-nCoV ARD).
In a message to reporters, Guevarra said crimes under the Revised Penal Code in relation to the Cybercrime Prevention Act may be filed against those responsible.
‪""If the intent in causing the publication of false information is to create or aggravate public disorder, or undermine government efforts during a state of public emergency, and such publication is effected by means of information technology, appropriate charges under the Revised Penal Code in relation to the Cybercrime Prevention Law may be filed against perpetrators,"" he said.
No Philippine law, however, defines or punishes ""fake news."" 
Asked for guidelines on how to determine ""fake news,"" Guevarra said he would leave it to the cybercrime experts of the DOJ and the NBI.
""The DOJ and the NBI have their own cybercrime experts. I suppose they’ll scope the field muna and see if there’s a malicious scheme or pattern somewhere,"" he said.
GUEVARRA: PROBE MY IDEA
Guevarra insisted investigating peddlers of ""fake news"" about the new coronavirus was his idea.
""I have personally observed a slew of internet/social media communications that tend to sow panic and confusion regarding this public health issue, and it was also raised during the Senate hearing yesterday. Malacañang had nothing to do with it,"" he said.
He added: ""There are limitations to this constitutional right, including the greater interest of the public.""
The Supreme Court had previously struck down the government's attempt to prevent the airing of ""Hello Garci"" tapes, which purportedly showed then-President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo instructing a Comelec official to rig the 2004 polls.
In the 2008 case of Chavez vs. Gonzales, the high court considered a form of prior restraint the statement of then-Justice Secretary Raul Gonzales and a press release from the National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) warning radio and broadcast media that the airing of “Hello Garci” tapes will result in the cancellation of their certificates of authority.
 
SC said the warning regulated the content of the speech and prior restraint could only be justified if there was a clear and present danger sought to be avoided.
Guevarra said the clear and present danger the government seeks to avoid in this case is ""causing undue panic and alarm in part, but also undermining government efforts for a unified and coordinated approach to a common threat that affects us all.""
""The nCoV threat is a very serious public concern and no distraction of government efforts to overcome it will be tolerated,"" he said.

MANILA - President Rodrigo Duterte wants to personally welcome Filipinos coming from China, the origin of the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak, a Palace official claimed Wednesday, as the Philippines prepares for the arrival of the first batch of repatriates on Saturday.
Duterte wants to see the arrival of the repatriates but there are still ongoing discussions with the Presidential Security Group (PSG) and Presidential Management Staff (PMS) over his security, Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles told reporters in Malacañang.
“The President wants to be there. He’d like to be there on Saturday pero tingnan na muna natin sa (let’s see with the) PMS and PSG,” Nograles said.
The President had ordered Health Secretary Francisco Duque III to welcome the repatriates and to ensure that protective measures are in place, Nograles added.
Malacañang on Wednesday said the repatriates would arrive at the Clark International Airport and transported to Fort Magsaysay in Nueva Ecija for a 14-day mandatory quarantine.
As of Wednesday, 42 Filipinos have expressed their desire to come home, according to Foreign Affairs Assistant Secretary Eduardo Menez.

The President, who earlier said that the virus outbreak was “nothing really to be extra-scared of,” also rejected calls of his staff to limit his public engagements for the meantime, Nograles said.
“He (Duterte) just wants to keep on doing the things he’s doing without imposing limitations sa kaniyang (on his) movement,” the Cabinet secretary said. “He doesn’t want to change the way he conducts his business.”

,Feb 05 2020,nCov,Philippines confirms 3rd new coronavirus case,"Kristine Sabillo, ABS-CBN News","
MANILA (4th UPDATE) - A third Chinese patient tested positive for the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in the Philippines but has been discharged and returned to China, the country's health ministry said Wednesday.
The announcement came three days after the Philippine government said Manila's second confirmed case led to the patient's death, marking the first novel coronavirus-related fatality outside China amid the outbreak that has spread to more than 20 countries across continents.
Philippine Health Undersecretary Eric Domingo said the patient is a 60-year old woman from Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the virus. She arrived in Cebu City in the central region, via Hong Kong, on Jan. 20, and then traveled to the neighboring resort island province of Bohol.
""She is the third confirmed 2019-nCoV Acute Respiratory Disease case in the country,"" the health department said in a statement. 
Domingo said the woman, who was traveling with other people, fell ill on her first day in Bohol on Jan. 22. She first stayed in her hotel, but was immediately admitted to a hospital the same day.
Two sets of samples were taken from the patient - one on Jan. 23 and another on Jan. 24. Since the Philippines at the time relied only on Australia's Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory for nCoV infection confirmatory tests, and it can only send limited samples, only the Jan. 24 sample was submitted there.
Results of the tests on the Jan. 24 sample, both by RITM and the VIDRL, ""came back (as) negative,"" Domingo said. They were received on Jan. 29 and 30.
""Upon recovery of the patient, she was discharged and was allowed to return to China via Cebu last Jan. 31,"" the health department said.
Meanwhile, when the RITM acquired the capability to test for 2019-nCoV infection beginning last week, it included the woman's Jan. 23 sample in its examination. This one tested positive for the new virus strain, and the RITM notified the health department on Feb. 3 about the finding.
Domingo said the Department of Health's Epidemiology Bureau has started tracking people who may have interacted or were in close proximity to the patient, especially those in her hotel. The woman’s companions did not exhibit symptoms, he said.
The health department does not consider the woman infectious by Jan. 31 when she was discharged and traveled back to China. But since the positive result came out, efforts to reach her have been made so she can be informed about it.
The passenger traveled to Shenzhen from Cebu on Jan. 31 via flight number Z2 7800, AirAsia said in a statement. 
AirAsia is willing to provide relevant documents to the DOH such as flight manifest and contact details of guests on board the affected flight “given the urgency of the situation,” it said. 
The operating flight crew have been quarantined, while the aircraft will undergo disinfection procedures based on prescribed protocol, the airline said.
“We advise passengers on-board this flight to seek medical help if they have been feeling unwell,” AirAsia said.

Earlier, two Chinese travelers, who also came from Wuhan, tested positive as well for the 2019-nCoV while in the Philippines, although both are classified as ""imported cases."" They arrived, also in Cebu via Hong Kong, last Jan. 21.
The first confirmed case involved a 38-year-old woman, while the second was her companion, a 44-year-old man. The latter, who was also found positive for pneumonia-causing bacteria, died last Saturday, Feb. 1, the first recorded nCoV-related death outside China.
The spread of the outbreak in the Philippines prompted government to ban foreign travelers from all of mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau. Domestically, the public has been scrambling for limited stocks of masks for their protection. 
On Monday, President Rodrigo Duterte called for calm, saying the public should not be scared as the disease would ""die a natural death.""
As of Wednesday, nearly 500 deaths have been recorded in China, while infections have reached over 24,000 in Chinese cities and other Asia-Pacific countries, North America, and Europe. The World Health Organization has declared the outbreak a global health emergency.
The Philippines has so far reported 133 ""patients under investigation"" (PUIs) for the new coronavirus, including the three confirmed cases and another fatality who was later found negative. Thirty-two of them have reportedly traveled to Wuhan, where the virus was known to have spread from a market that sold wild animals as delicacies.
The PUIs include 63 Filipinos, 54 Chinese, and 16 of other different nationalities.
Of the 133, there are 115 who are currently admitted and isolated.

The 43-year-old male patient will be released from the hospital Wednesday after confirmatory test results from the Research Institute of Tropical Medicine (RITM) in Muntinlupa City showed he was cleared of the strain, said CLMMRH chief Dr. Julius Drilon.
The foreigner was quarantined due to his history of travel in Taiwan, where positive cases of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus acute respiratory disease (2019-nCoV ARD) were recorded, said Dr. Jane Juanico of the Department of Health (DOH) Western Visayas.
""The patient can be discharged as soon as he is able and his specialists have issued the necessary clearance,” she added.
The CLMMRH is still monitoring 2 patient under investigation (PUIs) confined at the emerging infection disease facility while waiting for laboratory results from RITM.
""CLMMRH is assuring the public that the hospital is implementing strict infection control measures and protocols in providing treatment to these patients,"" Drilon said in a statement.



Amid growing concern of the possible spread of the virus, the DOH-Western Visayas urged the public to remain calm and vigilant.
“The strengthened surveillance against 2019-nCoV ARD should not cause paranoia. We encourage the public to remain vigilant. We do not want to discriminate. It does not mean that when someone has visited a place where a positive case of nCoV has been recorded, he is already infected,"" said Juanico, head of DOH-Western Visayas' infectious disease section.
As of Wednesday, Feb. 5, the DOH-Western Visayas has recorded 9 PUIs in the region.
Aklan has the most number of recorded PUIs at 6. Two PUIs were recorded in IloIlo and 1 in Negros Occidental.

MANILA - Washing hands frequently is a more effective way to avoid contracting the new coronavirus than using a face mask, a health official said Tuesday.
""Factually, it shows that non-symptomatic people using masks, it will give them a false sense of confidence and put them at more risk because they tend to wash hands less,"" World Health Organization (WHO) Philippines Representative Rabindra Abeyasinghe said during a Senate hearing. 
""Just because you wear a mask, you should not neglect keeping your hands clean. Because if you touch the mask and you have droplets on the outer surface of the mask that somebody else cough on, you could still get infected. What's actually more important is hand hygiene,"" he added.
Face masks, Abeyasinghe reiterated, should be used by people who are exhibiting respiratory symptoms. It should be reserved for high-risk individuals such as health workers and those who are exposed to crowds. 
""We don’t see a benefit of masks to be used by the general public... This is important now if we have to prevent secondary transmission, especially from PUIs [patients under investigation] and outpatient departments of hospitals,"" he said.

 
Evidence indicates that the 2019-Novel Coronavirus acute respiratory disease (2019-nCoV ARD) is transmitted between humans through close contact and mostly by people with symptoms. 
""The evidence today is that more than 90 percent of the transmission is attributed to symptomatic people,"" Abeyasinghe said.
To arrest the spread of the virus, he said those with respiratory symptoms must practice proper cough etiquette and hand hygiene.
""Because if you are coughing and your droplets contain this coronavirus, the virus would be present on utensils, on home items, where an infected person has cough,"" Abeyasinghe said, adding pathogens could survive on surfaces for between 8 to 10 hours.
""Make sure that you make an effort to clean surfaces that are handled by those people. This is a infection prevention measure,"" he added.
The 2019-nCoV ARD, which originated from a market that sells illegal wildlife in the Chinese city of Wuhan, has killed at least 425 people and infected nearly 20,000 others in China.

MANILA - Concerts and other entertainment shows that will gather crowds should be suspended, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said Tuesday, amid concerns over the spread of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV). 
The Department of Health (DOH) has yet to issue an official advisory on concerts, but it will ""certainly be advising"" on suspending such public events, Duque told senators in a Senate inquiry.

Concern about the spread of the virus is growing in South Korea, where 16 cases have been identified so far.

The 2 items were added to a list of designated products, it said.
From Wednesday, sellers who hoard more than one and a half times their average monthly sales volume will face a maximum sentence of 2 years in prison or a fine of up to 50 million won ($42,000).
South Korea has so far seen at least 4 cases of human-to-human transmission of the virus, while a hospitalized Chinese tour guide is believed to have caught the illness while working in Japan.

""Ang panawagan ko lang kay President Duterte na please look into it. Bigyan ng consideration ang OFW, ang HK residents. Please look into it na kailangan namin mag-work,"" said Camaya as he turned teary, adding he was starting to miss his family.
(My appeal to President Duterte is to please look into it. Give consideration for overseas Filipino workers and Hong Kong residents. Please look into because we also need to work.)

Camaya's wife and three children are based in Hong Kong. He said his employer has already told him that they ""need to find a way to get back home"". He said it's not true that just because he is a permanent resident in Hong Kong, he can easily find a job anytime.
""Ang problema yung bills [to pay] ngayong buwan na to, yung month na babayaran namin ngayon. Sinong magbibigay nun? Gobyerno ba? Gobyerno ng HK? Ang hirap e,"" said Camaya.
(The problem is the bill this month. Who will pay for that? Is it the government? Government of Hong Kong? It's so difficult.)

Jona Paredes, a domestic worker in Hong Kong, travelled all the way from La Union to Manila from 12 a.m. to 9 a.m. only to find out several hours later that her international flight to the former British colony would not push through after the ban. Paredes said she had spent 15 hours at the airport and left Manila at around 2 a.m. on February 3. 
She said she met somebody from Laoag who offered her some money so she could go home upon learning about her ordeal.
""Yung pera ko, maigi na lang may nagbigay ng pamasahe sa akin. Yung pera ko konti na lang yung deperensiya kaso kailangan ng dagdag. Maigi may nakasabay ako pinamasahian niya ako ng pandagdag pamasahe dito,"" said Paredes.
(My money...it's good that someone gave me money for my fare.) 
She said they were at the boarding gate when 10 minutes before their flight, they were told that their check-in had been put on hold. Then they were told there was a flight delay and announced it three times and would update at 5 p.m. Finally, they were reportedly told there had been some problems with the Philippine government.
They were then told to head back to the immigration area where they were told their flight had finally been cancelled. So, their record at the immigration was ""void"". 
They were told to approach the Cebu Pacific office to see whether they could rebook or refund their flights.

""Pero sa kalaunan din na naghintay na kami after 5 hours nang paghihintay, isa lang naman pala ang option. Refund din, walang rebook kasi hindi nila alam kung kailan daw mag-o-open ulit yung flight ng papunta diyan sa HK,"" said Paredes.
(But after waiting for 5 hours, there was really only one option. It was to refund. No rebooking because they don't know when the flights will be opened going back to Hong Kong.)
Paredes said she is grateful that her employers have been very understanding and would always remind her that her health and safety were most important. She said they discussed options to get her back to Hong Kong and even Singapore was on the table, but it was after she told them that she might encounter problems should she decide to go to Singapore and it may make matters worse. 
They all agreed and were willing to wait for her return without any conditions and because she was told they love her like a family. She will have to look for some ways to make ends meet while she is in the Philippines. 
""Yung wish ko sana assistance kahit magkano ...pero ang pinaka-wish ko talaga is makabalik ng HK kasi dun talaga ang aking trabaho,"" said Paredes.
(My wish is that there would be some kind of assistance, but my utmost wish is to really come back to Hong Kong because that is where my work is)
For ""Linda"", a Filipino expat based in Hong Kong for five years, the situation is already a double whammy. She said, if nothing changes in a week, she would be forced to stay in Manila and would need to spend a lot of her own money to buy equipment just to keep up with her work in Hong Kong from Manila. 
She is fortunate that she didn't end up going to the airport after receiving a cancellation email from Philippine Airlines.
""I work as a designer for the tourism industry. I've been working in Hong Kong for five years and my work has been impacted by the protests. So, I am anxious to do what I can for our ongoing projects even if business is shut down for now and everyone is working from home,"" said Linda.
The designer said they should have been allowed to travel outbound and been made to sign a waiver knowing the risks, for example, saying they understand how Filipino airplane staff are exposed to danger if flights continue, then give them the option of doing a transfer.
""Because other countries are still ok operating with the risk. We all have to make our choices for the life we ended up making,' said Linda. ""My life is not over but it's still painful and it's a terrible vulnerable feeling to be in a precarious situation where I am not given a choice. I worked really hard to be worthy of my job. I don't want to be in this situation where I am in danger of losing it,"" she added.
Mrs. Smith, a Filipino and Hong Kong resident who works for a furniture solutions company, said she and her British husband were supposed to fly out via Cathay Pacific on February 2 when they were told at the check in counter that she won't be able to fly with her husband because of the ban. 
She said she is lucky she is able to work from home, but if it takes longer than a few days, she'll be more concerned how she can get back to work.
""I find this very frustrating and extremely inconvenient. I feel this travel ban for outgoing Filipinos was careless and not thought out carefully,"" said Mrs. Smith. ""We should at least have a choice to sign a waiver that we choose to go back to where we reside despite the 'risks'.""

The situation was equally frustrating for ""Jane"", a Hong Kong-based regional marketing executive for a global company handling the Asia Pacific market. Jane was in Manila to spend her Chinese New Year holidays when she was among the hundreds who were also caught off guard by the President Duterte's announcement.
""They should have announced it and have a grace period so we wouldn't have had to go to the airport and process everything and we could have planned ahead,"" said Jane. 
""The immediate effectivity was to just cause chaos. I was in the airport for 10 hours. I'm just quite disappointed that no one is speaking on our behalf, on behalf of the OFWs and they're just basically...oh we'll give you P10,000. That won't solve it.""
What made matters worse was around 34 people, who were her co-passengers whom she had spoken with, were unable to locate their baggage after having spent 10 hours waiting at the airport. They were supposed to leave for Hong Kong at around 3pm on February 2 when they were also told their flight was cancelled.
They were told that their baggages had been sent to Hong Kong. She said Cebu Pacific personnel had asked them to leave their contact details and promised to update them as soon as their baggage arrived from Hong Kong.
In a text message to ABS-CBN News, Cebu Pacific Spokesperson Charo Logarta said that because of the confusion from the government's directives, some of the luggage were mistakenly not removed from the plane. She said that passengers would be getting back their baggage on February 4.
For another special administrative region affected, Macau-based hotel housekeeper Jayson Ocenar, an OFW there of four years, said his baby of 1 year and five months, along with his in-laws and relatives were supposed to stay with them for two months after arriving in Macau on January 12. 
But when things got worse in China, he decided to book their flight on February 2, but it got cancelled. He tried to rebook it on February 4, but got cancelled. 
He said they visited the Philippine Consulate in Macau on February 3 and met Filipinos with the same concern. He said some were tourists and visiting their families in Macau. He estimated that around 100 Filipinos were there, including children. And one Filipino had been given a visa extension for one month as the visa was supposed to expire yesterday. He said they have written a request letter for repatriation for the stranded tourists, which include his relatives.

Meanwhile, Hong Kong-based OFWs who are affected by the 2019 n-CoV travel ban with visas expiring soon or those who have been terminated, are encouraged to report to the Hong Kong immigration department about their status.
""There were instances that their flights are cancelled...ma-OS (overstay) sila. (Ang) Advice namin, they should go to immigration for extension of their visa and coordinate with their airline,"" said Assistant Labour Attache and Officer-In-Charge Antonio Villafuerte in a phone interview with ABS-CBN News on February 4.
""Ngayon, kung may problema po sa immigration, that's the time na punta sila ng Assistance to Nationals (sa Consulate) because it will become an immigration case already,"" he added.
Villafuerte said they are scheduled to meet with the Hong Kong Labor Department and the Immigration Department, together with the Philippine Consulate, on Tuesday (February 4) to discuss issues affecting Filipino workers over the current situation on affected Filipino workers in Hong Kong and those in the Philippines.
Filipinos with emergency concerns are advised to call the Consulate's hotline at +852 9155 4023. For matters concerning the Philippine Overseas Labor Office (POLO) and Overseas Workers Welfare Administration (OWWA), nationals are advised to call +852 5529 1880 and +852 6323 9324, respectively.

SEOUL - A South Korean woman has tested positive for coronavirus after visiting Thailand, South Korean officials said Tuesday, the first foreign tourist reported to have been infected after a visit to the southeast Asian nation.
The 42-year-old, identified only as Patient 16, flew back to South Korea on Jan. 19 after traveling in Thailand, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) said in a statement.
Treated since developing chills and other symptoms from Jan. 25, she did not improve until Sunday, the KCDC added, and was confirmed positive on Tuesday, following checks at Chonnam National University Hospital.
The statement did not explicitly rule out a visit to China, however.

MANILA (UPDATE) -- Roughly a fifth of 300 co-passengers of the Philippines' confirmed coronavirus cases have been contacted, Health Secretary Francisco Duque said Tuesday, as he accused airlines of failure to provide contact information. 
Only 17 percent of the passengers on board the Philippine Airlines and Cebu Pacific flights taken by the coronavirus patients in the country have been contacted, Duque told a Senate inquiry. 
Duque earlier said contact tracing was on ""full blast,"" but during the Senate hearing, he said his subordinates failed to inform him beforehand that only 17 percent of passengers have been contacted. 
""In all our meetings there has been no issue that this is a problem. This is an issue on the lack of transparency on the people on my part,"" he said. 
""'Yung mga ganung operational details, hindi nalalaman ng Secretary yan,"" he said, noting that his focus was on the ""big picture"" of the novel coronavirus outbreak. 
Duque said airlines invoked ""confidentiality"" when asked for the contact details of some of their passengers.
""Airlines are not sharing contact details of passengers. They are invoking confidentiality.""
“Ito ang kailangan nating harapin... Meron [list] pero no contact details, redacted,"" Duque said. 
In a separate statement to ABS-CBN News, Philippine Airlines spokesperson Cielo Villaluna said the flag carrier shared passengers' contact details. 
""We shared it to enable DOH to carry out the callouts and on top of that, PAL carried out callouts,"" Viillaluna said in a text message. 
In a statement, Cebu Pacific said it had already provided the DOH and the Bureau of Quarantine with a list of passengers aboard the questioned flights. 
The airline had also reached out to passengers aboard the flight taken by the coronavirus patient, Cebu Pacific director for Corporate Communications Corporate Affairs Charo Logarta Lagamon said. 
“There is no impediment whatsoever for CEB to provide any and all information that the BOQ nd DOH would need from us for their purposes,” she said. 
'SUPER SLOW'
Senator Ronald Dela Rosa described the Health department's contact tracing operations as ""super slow.""
""Once you have the list already, bigay niyo sa PNP. Tapos na yan in 3 days. Wag ninyo solohin ang problema,"" Dela Rosa said, referring to the Philippine National Police which he once headed.
Senator Francis Pangilinan said the ""dismally and incrediblly"" slow performance of the DOH showed a ""failure of leadership"" on Duque's part. 
""Seventeen percent is completely unacceptable at this day, 15 days after [the flight],"" the Pangilinan said.
""How when we stay on top of the situation when the fundamental information is not even in our fingertips?"" he said.
The government has been trying to monitor passengers who came in contact with a Chinese couple who tested positive for the novel coronavirus to curb to check if they are also carriers of the communicable virus.
The new coronavirus strain has killed 327 people and infected some 20,000 other globally since it was first reported in Wuhan, China in late December 2019.
Earlier this week, the Philippines banned travel to and from mainland China and its special administrative regions Hong Kong and Macau as health experts have yet to find a cure to the deadly virus.

MANILA - The National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) can help trace persons who may have been exposed to 2 Chinese nationals confirmed to have contracted the novel coronavirus, Justice Secretary Menardo Guevarra said Tuesday.
Guevarra's statement came a day after Monday's emergency meeting in Malacañang convened by the President with several Cabinet officials.
While the NBI was ""not being called to action yet,"" the agency will be ""on standby to support"" trace those who came in contact with coronavirus patients, the justice chief said.
""The [Department of Health] says they can still handle the contact tracing but the NBI will be on standby to support,"" he told reporters through an exchange of messages.
Guevarra clarified that there were no further instructions for the justice department except for the Bureau of Immigration (BI) ""to implement the travel ban strictly until further orders.""

First novel coronavirus death outside China recorded in PH - WHO official 

Two Chinese from Wuhan, China are the only confirmed 2019-nCoV cases in the Philippines so far. One of them, a 44-year-old, died on Saturday due to severe pneumonia -- the first recorded nCoV death outside China.
Authorities are now tracing the people who may have been exposed to the couple, who arrived in Cebu from Hong Kong on Jan. 21 and who went to Dumaguete before flying to Manila. 
Both were admitted to the San Lazaro Hospital on Jan. 25.
The female companion became the first confirmed nCoV case in the country but is now asymptomatic, according to health authorities.
No cure nor vaccine has so far been developed to combat the virus.

BEIJING - Coronavirus patients arrived Tuesday at a Chinese field hospital built from scratch in under 2 weeks at the front-line of the outbreak, state media said, following a round-the-clock construction marathon that became a national social media sensation.
The 1,000-bed facility was built to relieve hospitals swamped with patients in Wuhan, the city in Hubei province at the epicenter of the national health emergency that has killed more in China than the 2003 SARS outbreak.
Fifty patients arrived at the military-run facility, the state-backed China Daily reported, with images showing workers in protective suits pushing people in wheelchairs up a ramp and into the pre-fabricated structure.
The virus has killed more than 400 people and infected a further 20,000, nearly all of them in Hubei, and spread to 2 dozen countries since it emerged in December at a market that sold wild animals in the city.

The World Health Organization has declared the crisis a global health emergency, and the first death outside China was confirmed in the Philippines on Sunday. 

First novel coronavirus death outside China recorded in PH - WHO official

As reports surfaced of bed shortages in hospitals in Wuhan, construction began on Huoshenshan -- ""Fire God Mountain"" in Chinese -- on Friday, Jan. 24. 
Workers toiled day and night amid a forest of earthmovers and trucks carting materials around the site, southwest of the center of the city of 11 million.
On the side of 1 of the trucks, the isolated city's new rallying cry -- ""Let's go Wuhan!""
FIRE, THUNDER
All workers wore masks, as mandated by the authorities for the entire population of Wuhan, and were checked for fevers during their breaks.
By the following Friday, they had laid 400 prefabricated shipping-container-like rooms, after setting concrete foundations and routing the power supply to the complex.
The 2-floor facility was handed over to the army on Sunday and will be staffed with 1,400 military medics, including some with experience dealing with SARS and Ebola.
State media had initially reported that patients would begin arriving Monday -- inside the 10-day time frame authorities had set out when construction began.
Leishenshan (""Thunder God Mountain""), another hospital on an adjacent site, is set to start admitting patients on Thursday, with 1,600 beds.
Fire and thunder are traditionally associated in China with protection against illnesses.
Authorities said the Wuhan facilities were modeled on the Xiaotangshan hospital in Beijing, which was built from prefabricated structures in barely a week to treat patients infected by SARS in 2003. 
That pathogen killed 349 people in China and hundreds more in Hong Kong and abroad.
However, with the death toll surging in Wuhan and elsewhere in Hubei province, it was not immediately clear what overall impact the hospitals would have on the virus spreading elsewhere.
The city also plans to convert 3 existing venues, including a gymnasium and an exhibition center, into hospitals, the Wuhan government said.
The 3 buildings will be turned into healthcare facilities with a total of 3,400 beds to take in patients with mild symptoms.
 LIVESTREAMED
Footage of the mammoth construction effort was livestreamed continuously on social media and watched tens of millions of times.
It has also been feted endlessly in state media as an example of the decisive response to the public health crisis after authorities in Hubei faced a torrent of public anger for perceived incompetence, including delays in announcing the public health emergency.
Local Communist Party secretary Ma Guoqiang acknowledged Friday that officials had worsened the spread of the virus by failing to restrict travel earlier.
When a lockdown and blanket travel ban were finally introduced, they swept up more than 50 million people in Wuhan and nearby cities.

BEIJING/SHANGHAI - Police in China have detained a woman for ""deliberately concealing"" her contact with someone from an area stricken by the coronavirus and jeopardizing efforts to stop its spread, the Xinhua news agency reported on Tuesday.
China has imposed sweeping measures to try to halt the virus including virtually locking down the central province of Hubei, where the virus emerged in December, and asking anyone who has visited there to isolate themselves for 14 days.
The death toll in China from the newly identified virus has risen to 425 with more than 20,000 cases of infection, authorities reported.

The detained woman, a 36-year-old identified by her surname, Liu, had hurt virus prevention and control work through her action and public security authorities in the northern municipality of Tianjin took her into custody for ""administrative detention.""
The state news agency gave no details of what she had done or say if or when she would be released.
Authorities in some places have threatened dire punishment for anyone violating the law in connection with efforts to battle the virus.
A high court in the northeastern province of Heilongjiang said people who intentionally spread the virus could face the death penalty, according to a Jan. 31 court notice.
Police in Qinghai province in the northwest were investigating a man infected with the virus who ""severely disrupted virus containment and harmed public health,"" Xinhua reported, without elaborating.

HONG KONG (2nd UPDATE) - Hong Kong reported its first coronavirus death on Tuesday, a 39-year-old male who had been suffering from an underlying illness and had visited China's Wuhan city in January, hospital staff said, marking the second death outside mainland China.
The first death outside of China was reported on Sunday - a 44-year-old Chinese man who died in the Philippines after traveling there from Wuhan, the epicenter of the virus.

The death toll in China rose on Tuesday by a new daily record to more than 420 and total infections in China rose by 3,235 to 20,438. There were at least 151 cases in 23 other countries and regions, including the United States, Japan, Thailand, Hong Kong and Britain.

China virus death toll rises to 425: gov't

The Hong Kong death comes as hundreds of medical workers in the Asian financial hub began a second day of strikes on Tuesday to force the government to completely close the city's borders with mainland China, a day after embattled leader Carrie Lam left 3 remaining checkpoints open.
""As Carrie Lam refused to close the border, more (deaths) might come... We are not threatening the government, we just want to prevent the outbreak,"" said Cheng, a 26-year-old nurse attending the strike.
The latest coronavirus epidemic has rekindled memories of the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which killed nearly 300 people in the city.
The former British colony so far has had 15 confirmed cases of the newly discovered coronavirus, including 1 that was transmitted locally.
The Hong Kong resident who died on Tuesday had been kept in an isolation ward after the coronavirus was confirmed last week. His 72-year-old mother, who contracted the virus locally and had no travel history, was staying at home during the incubation period, authorities said.
The United States, Australia, Singapore, New Zealand and Vietnam are among countries that have denied entry to foreign nationals who have recently been in China.
Lam has rejected calls to shut the entire border, saying such a move would be ""inappropriate and impractical"" as well as ""discriminatory"".
On Monday, authorities announced the closure of 4 more border crossings with mainland China, leaving open the international airport, the bridge connecting the city to Macau and the southern Chinese city of Zhuhai as well as Shenzhen Bay Port in the north.
Around 2,700 workers from the newly formed Hospital Authority Employees Alliance (HAEA) went on strike on Monday calling for a sealing off of Hong Kong's border and for better protection for hospital staff.

Holding red and white placards reading ""Save HK now. I am a Hospital Authority staff on strike,"" masked workers on Tuesday spilled out from inside the Authority's Kowloon located headquarters, and onto the main road outside.
Around 9,000 members out of the alliance's roughly 18,000 members are expected to join the strike on Tuesday, HAEA chairwoman Winnie Yu said. 
""Our demands are not something the Hospital Authority can solve so we urge Carrie Lam to negotiate with us directly,"" Yu said.
A spokesman for the city's hospital authority said that due to the large absence of medical staff in public hospitals today, some emergency services have been ""severely"" affected.
In a notice released on Monday, one of Hong Kong's voluntary ambulance brigades - St John Ambulance - announced they would suspend all first aid and ambulance duties due to the recent spread of the coronavirus.

MANILA - The Labor department on Monday directed concerned offices to extend cash and transport assistance as well as accommodations to overseas Filipino workers affected by travel bans due to the outbreak of the novel coronavirus.
Labor Secretary Silvestre Bello III instructed Overseas Workers Welfare Administration's acting secretary Renato Ebarle to provide P10,000 cash assistance, accommodation and transport to stranded departing OFWs, OWWA said in a statement. 
The OWWA halfway house will serve as their shelter while travel arrangements back to the provinces are being made, Ebarle said. 
""The move will help ease the burden on would-be departing workers, and assist them in their transport back to their places of origin,"" Ebarle said in a memorandum.
Select countries and airports worldwide banned travel to and from parts of China to prevent the spread of the 2019 novel corona virus (nCov). 
Hundreds of OFWs bound for Hong Kong and Macau were stranded at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport on Monday, following the travel ban imposed by President Rodrigo Duterte to prevent the spread of the 2019 novel corona virus (nCov) that originated in Wuhan, China.

FRANKFURT, Germany - Cruise lines worldwide will deny boarding to passengers and crew who have recently travelled to China, a global industry body said Monday, as fears grow over the deadly new coronavirus.
In a statement, the Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA) said its members were taking extra precautions to prevent an outbreak of the virus on board cruise ships, where infections can spread rapidly.
""CLIA Members have suspended crew movements from mainland China and will deny boarding to any individual, whether guest or crew, who has travelled from or through mainland China within the previous 14 days,"" the body's Hamburg office said.
CLIA represents some of the world's largest and best-known cruise lines, including TUI, AIDA, MSC, Costa, Royal Caribbean and Carnival Cruises.
The cruise companies were also carrying out careful screening of passengers and crew before boarding, and changing itineraries where necessary, CLIA said.
The industry body added that cruise ships were well equipped to deal with health emergencies.
""The cruise industry is one of the most well-equipped and experienced when it comes to managing and monitoring health conditions of passengers and crew,"" the statement said.
All ships are fitted with medical facilities and have medical professionals ""available around the clock"", it added.
The SARS-like virus that first emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan last month has infected more than 17,000 people and killed over 360 so far.
It has spread to more than 24 countries, including Australia, Germany and Japan.
In a sign of growing anxiety, more than 6,000 tourists were temporarily confined to their cruise ship at an Italian port last week after two Chinese passengers fell ill.
They later tested negative for the coronavirus.

Pero bukod sa novel coronavirus, ayon kay Duque, nagpositibo rin ang lalaki sa Streptococcus pneumoniae at Haemophilus influenza type B.
""We would say that the severe pneumonia must have been caused by the [novel coronavirus],"" ani Duque.
Ayon kay Edmundo Lopez, medical director ng San Lazaro Hospital, may mga hinihintay silang papeles at nakikipag-ugnayan na sa Chinese embassy bago i-cremate ang labi ng lalaki.
Labis pa rin ang pag-iingat sa pangangasiwa sa bangkay ng pasyente dahil baka makahawa pa rin ito.
CONTACT TRACING
Ayon naman kay Chito Avelino, direktor ng DOH Epidemiology Bureau, 74 na tao na ang kanilang na-contact sa contact tracing ng mga posibleng nakasalamuha ng 2 Chinese na nagpositibo sa novel coronavirus.
Ang ilan daw sa mga ito ay nakitaan ng mga sintomas ng flu o trangkaso.
""They were given advice on home quarantine. This will involve isolation inside their house. They are not allowed to interact with their families,"" ani Avelino.
PULISYA TUTULONG SA LOCAL GOVERNMENTS
Inatasan naman ng Department of the Interior and Local Government ang Philippine National Police na tulungan ang mga pamahalaang lokal sakaling ayaw magpa-check up ng isang pinaghihinalaang may novel coronavirus.
Sakop din ng direktiba ang pag-check sa mga condominium unit na may mga residenteng Chinese national.
Nagpahayag naman ng kahandaan ang disaster at health officials ng mga pamahalaang lokal sa Metro Manila.
Ang mga local government ng Pasig, Parañaque at Quezon City ay nagtayo na ng isolation tent para sa mga posibleng kaso ng bagong coronavirus.
Paulit-ulit namang paalala ng mga awtoridad na iwasan ang pagpapakalat ng mga hindi kumpirmadong impormasyon kaugnay ng novel coronavirus, at sa DOH at mga local government na lang makinig.
Ang 2019 novel coronavirus ang pinakabagong strain mula sa pamilya ng mga virus na nagdudulot ng impeksiyon at sakit sa paghinga.
Bukod sa China at iba pang bahagi ng Asya, kumalat na rin ang sakit sa ibang malalayong bansa gaya ng Australia, Germany, France, Finland.

MAYNILA — Sa gitna ng mga pangamba sa bagong uri ng coronavirus, iginiit ng isang doktor na hindi naman kailangan laging magsuot ng publiko ng face mask. 
Ang face mask ay nagsisilbing proteksiyon ng isang tao para hindi mahawa sa sakit ng iba o para hindi makahawa ng iba sakaling siya ang may sakit, ayon sa infectious disease specialist na si Rey Salinel.

Pero mainam lang umano ang paggamit ng face mask kapag pumupunta ang isang tao sa mga masisikip at matataong lugar.
“Doon (congested areas) ka may reason para mag-face mask ka, sa palengke, LRT, MRT, jeep, eroplano. Pero kung walang senyales na kayo ay may ubo, sipon, trangkaso, puwede na kayong hindi mag-face mask,” sabi ni Salinel sa panayam ng “Salamat Dok.”
Bukod sa pagsusuot ng face mask, binigyang-diin din ni Salinel ang paghuhugas ng kamay at pagpapanatili ng malinis na katawan para makaiwas sa novel coronavirus at iba pang mga sakit.

Mga face mask sa Pilipinas, nagkakaubusan dahil sa banta ng 2019-nCoV

Nauna na ring sinabi ng mga health official na sa mga piling pagkakataon lang dapat magsuot ng face mask.
Umapela rin si Health Undersecretary Eric Domingo sa publiko na huwag ubusin ang stock ng N95 face mask dahil mas kailangan ito ng mga health worker na nakatutuok sa paggamot sa mga kumpirmadong kaso ng at hinihinalang may novel coronavirus.

Face masks proteksiyon ba talaga vs bagong coronavirus? DOH nagpaliwanag

Ang 2019 novel coronavirus ang pinakabagong strain mula sa pamilya ng mga virus na nagdudulot ng mga impeksiyon at sakit sa paghinga. Kabilang din sa pamilyang ito ang mga coronavirus na nagdudulot ng severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) at Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).
Sa Pilipinas, may 2 nang kumpirmadong kaso ng novel coronavirus.
Sa bansa rin naitala ang unang pagkamatay ng novel coronavirus patient sa labas ng China, kung saan nagmula ang naturang sakit.

MAYNILA (UPDATE) — Naitala sa Pilipinas ang unang pagkamatay ng isang pasyenteng may novel coronavirus sa labas ng China, sabi ngayong Linggo ng kinatawan ng World Health Organization (WHO) sa bansa, kasabay ng pagpapalawig ng travel ban sa mga biyaherong galing China.
Isang 44 anyos na lalaking Chinese, ang pangalawang kumpirmadong kaso ng 2019 Novel Coronavirus acute respiratory disease (2019-nCoV ARD) sa Pilipinas, ang pumanaw noong Sabado, ayon kay Health Secretary Francisco Duque III.
""This is the first reported death outside China,"" ani Rabindra Abeyasinghe, WHO representative sa Pilipinas, sa isang conference kasama si Duque.
Ang nasabing lalaki ay kasamahan ng 38 anyos na babaeng Chinese na unang kaso ng bagong coronavirus sa bansa.

PH naitala ang unang kaso ng bagong coronavirus

Na-admit sa isang government hospital sa Maynila ang dalawang pasyente noong Enero 25, ayon kay Duque. Nakaranas ng pulmonya, lagnat, ubo, at pamamaga ng lalamunan ang lalaki.
""Over the course of the patient's admission, he developed severe pneumonia,"" ani Duque.
""In his last few days, the patient was stable and showed signs of improvement. However, the condition of the patient deteriorated within the last 24 hours, resulting in his demise,"" dagdag ng kalihim.
Asymptomatic naman ang babaeng pasyente o wala nang pinapakitang sintomas ng virus.
Nagpaalala naman si Abeyasinghe na hindi ""locally acquired"" ang sakit ng lalaki kundi nakuha niya mismo sa Wuhan, na sinasabing pinagmulan ng virus.
""This patient came from the epicenter of this outbreak, Wuhan, China, where there have been very large number of deaths,"" sabi naman ni Abeyasinghe.
Sinabi naman ng Cebu Paficic na nakikipagtulungan sila sa Bureau of Quarantine at National Epidemiology Center para kontakin ang lahat ng mga pasaherong nakasabay ng 2 Chinese national na nagpositibo sa novel coronavirus sa Pilipinas.
Inanunsiyo rin ng Department of Health at Research Institute for Tropical Medicine na 23 patients under investigation (PUI) ang nag-negatibo sa novel coornavirus.
Hinihintay pa ang resulta ng confirmatory test ng apat na PUI.
TRAVEL BAN
Samantala, pinalawig na ng gobyerno ang ban o pagbabawal sa mga biyaherong galing China bilang pag-iingat sa bagong coronavirus.

Bago nito, mga biyahero galing Hubei — ang Chinese province na nakakasakop sa Wuhan — lamang ang naka-ban.
Pero ngayon, inutos ni Pangulong Rodrigo Duterte na isama sa ban ang lahat ng mga biyahero galing China, Hong Kong, at Macau, ayon kay Sen. Bong Go, chairperson ng Senate Committee on Health and Demography.
""The order covers all travelers from China to the Philippines, regardless of nationality,"" sabi ni Go sa radyo DZMM.
Kailangan namang sumailalim sa 14-day quarantine ang mga uuwing Filipino citizen at iyong mga may permanent resident visa, ayon kay Go, ang dating aide ni Pangulong Rodrigo Duterte.
Inabisuhan naman ni Manila International Airport Authority General Manager Ed Monreal ang mga pasahero na may nakatakdang flights papunta at galing China na tingnan ang mga airline website para sa mga advisory at update.
Inabisuhan na rin ng Department of Tourism ang kanilang mga opisina sa China na tiyaking susunod ang lahat sa utos na travel ban.
Pumalo na sa 304 ang bilang ng mga namatay na nahawahan ng novel coronavirus sa China. May 13,700 naman ang bilang ng mga kumpirmadong kaso.

Thousands of Hong Kong medical workers voted Saturday to strike as they urge the government to close its border with the mainland to contain the coronavirus epidemic that has killed 259 people.
The financial hub has 13 confirmed cases of the disease as of Saturday, with 112 patients isolated. 
More than three thousand public hospital staff including doctors and nurses voted to strike if the government fails to meet their demands
""If we do not curb the source (of the virus), the resources of epidemic prevention and manpower will never be enough,"" said Winnie Yu, chairwoman of the Hospital Authority Employees Alliance (HAEA).
""We don't want to go on strike, but the government has been ignoring the demands of the frontline medical workers. We have no choice,"" Yu added.
The HAEA will meet with representatives from their employer -- the city's hospital authority -- on Sunday to negotiate.
The newly formed alliance said 9,000 of its members back the strike, making up 10 percent of the workforce of the city's workforce.
If no deal is reached, around 30 percent of the 9,000 -- those who work in non-essential positions -- would first go on strike next Monday. The rest, who provide emergency services, would afterwards join a four-day strike.
Hong Kong's hospital authority on Saturday said it would come up with a contingency plan.
The city's pro-Beijing administration has resisted public pressure to completely close its border although it has slashed several lesser-used crossings, with the city's chief executive saying on Friday a full closure is not feasible.
The United States has temporarily barred entry to foreigners who had been in China within the past two weeks and Australia said it was barring entry to non-citizens arriving from China.
Italy, Singapore and Mongolia have also taken similar sweeping precautions.

MANILA—Adamson University on Saturday apologized after it received backlash for ordering all its Chinese students to quarantine themselves amid the new coronavirus outbreak.
The school earlier released an advisory, requiring Chinese students, both graduate and undergraduate, to observe a 2-week self-quarantine ""to ensure a healthy and virus-free environment.""
It also urged Chinese nationals ""to postpone all transactions inside the university until Feb. 14, 2020.""

 
""We apologized for the misimpression it may have created,"" said the university, which has revised the advisory, expanding the scope of those who should be covered by the order.
""All students, staff and stakeholders who have traveled to and from countries with confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV, including China and/or Hong Kong, within the last month, or who may have in close contact or had direct exposure to a potential source of infection during their travel abroad,"" part of the memorandum read.
Chinese students and guests who are not limited by the above conditions, Adamson said, are allowed to come to school.

""Urgent appeal to Adamson University to review this advisory!"" she said.
Some online users also slammed the school, describing the memorandum as ""racist.""

HANOI - Vietnam has suspended all China flights as part of ""strengthening measures"" against the coronavirus outbreak, its civil aviation authority said in a statement on Saturday.
The directive applies to all airlines ""which have routes between Vietnam and China"" and is effective from Saturday, it added.
Vietnam Airlines, the country's national carrier, and budget airline Jetstar Pacific said they would stop flying to mainland China along with Hong Kong and Taiwan.
An AFP correspondent on a flight from Taiwan to Vietnam was among 98 passengers told to disembark just as the announcement went public.
""The decision is ridiculous and unacceptable,"" Vietnamese tourist Doan Thi Ngoc Diep told AFP after leaving the plane.
Vietnam is the latest country to impose extraordinary travel barriers after the virus spread to two dozen nations and killed 259 people in China where it originated in the city of Wuhan.
The United States temporarily barred entry to foreigners who had been in China within the past two weeks and Australia said it was barring entry to non-citizens arriving from China.
Italy, Singapore and Mongolia have also taken similar sweeping precautions.
The World Health Organization declared the coronavirus outbreak a global health emergency on Thursday but did not advise international trade of travel restrictions.
Vietnam's announcement came after the country confirmed its sixth case of the coronavirus.
A 25-year-old hotel receptionist working in Nha Trang contracted the SARS-like pathogen after coming into contact with Chinese tourists who were later diagnosed with coronavirus.
She was also the first domestic infection for a Vietnamese national with no known history of travel to China.
Three of the country's six cases were Vietnamese nationals who had traveled to Wuhan.
The receptionist's health is ""stable, no fever or cough"", a hospital staffer told AFP on condition of anonymity, adding she had ""no history of travel to China recently"".
Vietnam has joined Thailand, China, Germany, Japan, South Korea, France and the United States as the only countries with confirmed domestic coronavirus infections.

SHANGHAI - Apple Inc on Saturday said it would shut all of its official stores and corporate offices in mainland China until Feb 9. as fears over the coronavirus outbreak mounted and the death toll more than doubled to over 250 from a week ago.
""Out of an abundance of caution and based on the latest advice from leading health experts, we're closing all our corporate offices, stores, and contact centers in mainland China through February 9,"" Apple said in a statement. 
The company said it looked forward to re-opening stores ""as soon as possible.""
Earlier this week, Apple closed 3 stores in China due to concerns about the spread of the virus.
It is joining a handful of overseas retailers, including Starbucks Corp and McDonald's Corp, in temporarily shutting storefronts as a precautionary measure.

Many other companies, meanwhile, have called for employees in China to work from home and cease non-essential business travel in the first week of February.
Normally, businesses in China would be preparing to return to normal operations following the end of the week-long Lunar New Year Holiday.
Apple remains heavily reliant on China both for smartphone sales as well as for its supply chain and manufacturing. Many factories in Hubei province, including plants run by AB InBev and General Motors Co, have temporarily suspended production due to the virus.
In a recent earnings call, Apple CEO Tim Cook said the company was working out mitigation plans to deal with possible production loss from its suppliers in Wuhan. The city where the virus outbreak originated is home to several Apple suppliers.

""The arrangements are being put in place through our border authorities to ensure that that can be actioned,"" he added. ""Those that do return will be required to go into self isolation for 14 days.""
Australia's foreign ministry also updated its travel advice for China to ""do not travel.""

PHUKET, Thailand - The narrow laneways and pastel-colored shophouses of Phuket Old Town are usually bustling with Chinese tourists during the Lunar New Year holiday, but travel bans and local fears about coronavirus have largely emptied the streets this year.
Just a handful of tourists, many wearing face masks, strolled through the area during daylight hours this week. In the evening, foot traffic increased a little under the glow of the red lanterns strung across the thoroughfare, but remained far below normal levels.
""The impact is tremendous,"" 45-year old Ausana Akaradachakul told Reuters as she waited behind the counter for shoppers in her store selling postcards, straw bags, clothing and jewelry.
""Only a few days after the news broke about the virus, the Chinese tourists were visibly few,"" Akaradachakul said. ""I think about 70 percent of them are gone.""
The beach resort of Phuket is Thailand's second most visited destination after Bangkok and is usually a big draw for visitors from China, who accounted for 11 million visitors last year, particularly around the Lunar New Year holiday.
But China this week imposed restrictions on all overseas tour groups because of the coronavirus that originated in the city of Wuhan and which has infected more than 11,000 people and killed more than 250.

China virus death toll rises to 259, infections surge 

Reduced travel from China alone could result in 50 billion baht ($1.52 billion) of lost tourism revenue, the Thai Tourism Ministry estimated.
The spread of coronavirus beyond China has also affected domestic tourism in Thailand, which has recorded more infections than anywhere but China with 19 cases. Thailand announced its first case of human-to-human transmission on Friday.
Shopkeepers in Phuket said that had left Thai tourists wary of venturing out to join what should have been an annual festival on Walking Street at the heart of the town.
""There are barely any tourists around here. The people we are seeing now are just the locals,"" clothes store vendor Parichart Chaengmanee told Reuters as she sat on a stool outside her empty clothing stall, wearing a black face mask. ""Even the number of Thai tourists is low.""
Shopkeepers are hoping the impact is short-lived, with one sign in a store window reading: ""The Thai people pray for China and hope China will recover soon. China and Thailand are family!""

MANILA (UPDATE) - Communications Secretary Martin Andanar on Saturday called on the public to remain calm and avoid discriminating against anyone amid the rapid spread of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus.
""As the issue of a viral outbreak affects everyone, let us not engage in discriminatory behavior, nor act with any bias towards our fellowmen. The reality is everyone is susceptible to the virus,"" he said in a statement.
Andanar called on Filipinos to empathize with those at their most vulnerable, instead of stigmatizing them.
""We should not let fear turn us against one another, especially if these fears are unfounded,"" he said, adding that the Philippine government is working with foreign authorities to contain the outbreak.
The Philippines on Thursday confirmed its first case of the new coronavirus - a 38-year-old woman from Wuhan, China, epicenter of the respiratory contagion, who arrived in the Philippines on Jan. 21.
Philippine health authorities also continue to monitor 31 people suspected of carrying the strain, wherein 25 of them are admitted in hospitals around the country.

Amid stricter port controls in the Philippines and public vigilance against sickness, some members of the Filipino-Chinese community have expressed lament at how the health scare has fueled xenophobia towards the Chinese. 
“It’s very sad. Instead that we stand as one against this virus, it's becoming divisive,” anti-crime crusader and Chinese-Filipino figure Teresita Ang-See told ABS-CBN News on Friday.
She added: ""There should be no division between the Tsinoy from new immigrants and old immigrants.""

The Federation of Filipino Chinese Chambers of Commerce and Industry Inc (FFCCCII) president Henry Lim Bon Liong also urged the public to avoid expressing outright anti-Chinese sentiment.
""Spreading fake news and racist, xenophobic messages can be more dangerous than the virus itself due to their negative effects of causing confusion, fears, rancor and instability,"" he said in a statement released Friday.
China is the Philippines' traditional ally and long-standing trade partner, Liong said.
""Instead of racist attacks by some quarters, we should commend the China government’s transparency, for their remarkable political will and their immense sacrifices of imposing a lockdown on Wuhan City and its neighbors which involve millions of people,"" he added.
Andanar, meanwhile, appealed to the public not to hoard face masks, saying this ""creates unnecessary scarcity"" and that the limited supply should be reserved for health workers. 
""Let us not resort to panic, sow fear-mongering or spread misinformation. Solidarity, empathy, and cooperation are what we need to successfully take actions that will overcome this health concern,"" Andanar said.

WASHINGTON - While insisting the risk to Americans from coronavirus is low, the Trump administration declared a public health emergency on Friday and announced the extraordinary step of barring entry to the United States of foreign nationals who have recently visited China.

US declares virus 'emergency,' bans travelers from China

In addition, US citizens who have traveled within the past 2 weeks to China's Hubei Province - epicenter of the coronavirus epidemic - will be subject to a mandatory quarantine of 14 days, the incubation period of the virus, officials said.
Americans who visited other parts of mainland China will undergo special health screening upon their return, followed by up to 14 days of ""monitored self-quarantine"" under the temporary restrictions.
The emergency measures were unveiled by US Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar at a White House briefing, shortly before the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and local health authorities announced that a seventh US coronavirus case had been confirmed in Northern California.

WHO declares global emergency as 2019-nCoV spreads quickly 

The latest US patient was identified only as a man in Santa Clara County, south of San Francisco, who became ill after traveling to China and has ""self-isolated"" at home, Sara Cody, director of public health for the county, told reporters.
She said the CDC was seeking to determine whether the man was infectious while flying home.
The US entry ban on foreign travelers to China and the quarantine for Americans returning from Hubei go into effect on Sunday at 5 p.m. EST (6 a.m. Sunday in Manila), Azar said.
At the same time all commercial flights from China would be restricted to international US airports in 1 of 7 cities - New York, Chicago, Atlanta, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle and Honolulu.
KEEPING RISK LOW
CDC Director Robert Redfield told reporters the US government acted after the World Health Organization declared a global health emergency on Thursday over the spread of the respiratory disease.
""I want to emphasize that this is a serious health situation in China, but I want to emphasize that the risk to the American public is currently low,"" Redfield said. ""Our goal is to do all we can do to keep it that way.""
The US State Department warned Americans on Thursday not to travel to China because of the epidemic.
The ban on US entry of foreign nationals who have traveled to China during the past 14 days would exempt immediate family of US citizens and permanent US residents, Azar said. It was not immediately clear how long the ban would be in effect.

China's Hubei reports 45 new coronavirus deaths, total at 249 

The flu-like coronavirus, which is believed to have originated in a seafood and animal market in Wuhan, the provincial capital of Hubei, and was first identified earlier this month, has resulted in 259 deaths in China.
More than 11,700 people have been infected in China, and more than 130 cases reported in at least 25 other countries and regions, with Russia, Britain, Sweden and Italy all reporting their first cases on Thursday or Friday.
None of the US cases has been fatal, and all but one of the patients in the United States was believed to have contracted the disease while they were traveling in the Wuhan area of China.
FIRST US QUARANTINES
The first quarantines of US citizens potentially exposed to coronavirus in China began hours before the White House announcement.
Nearly 200 Americans evacuated earlier this week from Wuhan and voluntarily confined to a California military air base for 72 hours of health screenings were placed under a mandatory 14-day quarantine on Friday. It marked the CDC's first quarantine order in 50 years.
The State Department said Friday it was working with Chinese agencies to arrange additional flights of Americans out of Wuhan. Washington also plans to evacuate non-essential government employees and family members from the US Embassy in Beijing and consulates in Chengdu, Guangzhou, Shanghai and Shenyang due to the outbreak, a State Department official said on Thursday.
The 2-week quarantine of the 195 Americans at March Air Reserve Base, near Los Angeles, runs from the time the evacuees left China on Tuesday.
The original plan was to release the passengers after 72 hours of evaluation and tests, absent any indication of illness, and permit them to take public transportation home. Local health authorities would then continue monitoring the evacuees through the remainder of the incubation period.

US evacuees from China placed on 72-hour 'hold' at California military base for medical evaluation 

CDC officials said then that such a plan posed little or no risk of spreading the virus because individuals incubating the infection before symptoms appear are generally not contagious.
But Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, told reporters on Friday that experts' understanding of the virus was still evolving.
She cited emerging evidence the virus can be spread by someone who is infected but not yet showing signs of being ill, such as fever, cough and other respiratory symptoms.
The CDC also pointed to a limitation of its screening test for the virus - a negative result is merely a ""point-in-time"" snapshot that cannot conclusively rule out the risk of a person developing the disease during the 14-day incubation period.
The blanket quarantine at March air base was instituted after 1 passenger sought to leave the base without permission on Wednesday night, and was immediately slapped with an individual quarantine order by local health officials.
As of Thursday, none of the group at the base had exhibited signs of the disease, local health officials said.

The National Health Commission said in its daily update that 46 more people had succumbed to the respiratory disease.
All but one of the new deaths came in hardest-hit Hubei province, the epicenter of an outbreak that has spread around the world. 
The virus emerged in December in Hubei's provincial capital Wuhan, and has been traced to a meat market that sold wild game.
The number of infections in China also rose by 2,102, bringing the nationwide total to 11,791.
That's despite unprecedented quarantine measures imposed last week on millions of people in Hubei and aggressive preventive steps elsewhere in the country.
The number of new deaths and newly confirmed cases have both spiraled higher on a daily basis since China sounded the nationwide alarm a week ago.
The epidemic has spread far and wide as huge numbers of Chinese traveled within and outside the country for the Lunar New Year holiday that started last week.
It has since ballooned into a global health emergency with cases in more than 2 dozen countries.
The top Communist Party official in Wuhan expressed ""remorse"" on Friday, saying local authorities acted too slowly in containing the virus.

MANILA — With most of the new coronavirus cases coming from China, attention has again focused on the influx of Chinese tourists and workers in the Philippines.
Even in other countries where the 2019 novel coronavirus acute respiratory disease (2019-nCoV ARD) has spread, media has reported a rising anti-Chinese sentiment and even racism. For instance, there have been reports of children of Chinese descent being bullied by schoolmates in the United States and Europe.

READ: Anti-Chinese sentiment brews as world contains new coronavirus

In the Philippines, this has prompted younger members of the Chinese-Filipino community to post about how they are different from the new Chinese arrivals.
One circulating message mentions not only the fact that they were born and raised in the Philippines, but also how they do not eat exotic animals like bats and snakes -- two of the animals being investigated as the source of the new strain of coronavirus, which has killed at least 200 people.
Anti-crime crusader and Chinese-Filipino figure Teresita Ang-See told ABS-CBN News on Friday that she is saddened by how some younger members of their community and Filipinos in general have resorted to distancing themselves from the Chinese on the basis of race.
“It’s very sad. I feel so sad na imbes na sa panahong ito (that instead at this time) we stand as one against this fight, this virus, nagiging divise tuloy (it's becoming divisive),” she said.
“Hindi naman dapat na magkaroon ng division ang Tsinoy sa new immigrants and old immigrants.”
(There should be no division between the Tsinoy from new immigrants and old immigrants.)
The Philippines has seen an influx of Chinese arrivals, with improving ties between Manila and Beijing giving way to more Chinese investments in the country, particularly in offshore gaming, and greater inbound tourism.
Ang-See said Filipinos should respond in a way that is befitting a Christian country.
“Why is this happening? It’s narrow-minded thinking at a time of crisis,” she said in Filipino.
Ang-See was at the Manila City Hall on Friday with her group Kaisa Para sa Kaunlaran and another group the Filipino Chinese Amity Club to turn over 4,000 face masks to Manila Mayor Isko Moreno. On Friday morning, they also handed over 2,000 face masks to the Intramuros Administration.

Ang-See said they decided to donate the face masks to help prevent the spread of the new strain of coronavirus and to support public servants, especially traffic enforcers who also need face masks to protect themselves against pollution.
But she said people should practice proper hygiene as face masks are not enough to protect them.
Ang-See said there are also other Chinese-Filipinos giving out face masks in the Ongpin area in Manila.
This coincides with social media posts of Chinese nationals who were seen distributing free face masks in Makati.
BORDERLESS
Ang-See said people should remember that the virus “knows no boundaries.”
“During these times, we can’t have a you-against-me attitude,” she explained. “We are lucky because the virus did not originate from our country.”
The fast-spreading 2019-nCoV originated from Wuhan, capital of the eastern Chinese province of Hubei, and has killed more than 200 people and infected at least 10,000 as of Friday.
The disease, which manifests as fever, cough and difficulty breathing, has reached beyond Chinese borders, with confirmed cases in other parts of Asia, North America and Europe.
On Thursday, the Philippines confirmed its first case- a Chinese woman from Wuhan who arrived in the country on Jan. 21. She is now asymptomatic yet still confined at an undisclosed Metro Manila hospital.

Philippines confirms first case of new coronavirus

Malacañang on Friday announced a ban on travelers coming from Hubei province, while other countries have completely shut out those coming from all of mainland China.
A RECURRING PROBLEM
Ang-See said there were also instances of racism when the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) spread globally almost a decade ago.
“We haven’t learned from our experiences that viruses have nothing to do with race,” she said.
Newspaper columnist Wilson Lee Flores said: “The recent coronavirus problem seems to have brought out some unspoken misunderstandings, age-old negative stereotypes or some latent anti-Chinese racism in our society and even in other parts of the world.”
The 7th generation ethnic Chinese, who has lived in the Philippines his whole life, called it “unfortunate” and said it goes against the country’s democracy “which protects the equal rights and dignity of all people regardless of ethnic, religious or socio-economic background.”
He said the old stereotypes against the Chinese could be attributed to the Spanish colonial era.
He said that while Filipinos were also victims of discrimination by Spaniards, the colonizers “committed double or triple discriminations against the Muslim or Moro and Chinese minorities based on race, different religion and also fears of Chinese entrepreneurial success.”
VIRUS OF RACISM
“Racism doesn't only victimize certain minorities or communities in our society, it morally diminishes all of us, it threatens social peace, national unity and national progress,” the columnist said.
He said the only positive thing that can be said now is that racism “can be recognized as a real social problem that needs to be condemned as evil (and) that the phenomenon of social media has magnified and amplified this virus of racism which we should fight to stop.”
Health Undersecretary Eric Domingo also said the issue of racism should be addressed, adding that he has heard of how some Chinese-Filipinos now make sure to speak in Filipino in public so people won’t avoid them.
“What we are avoiding is an illness. It’s a virus. It can affect anybody,” he said.
“At this time, unfortunately, cases are coming mostly from China. But since last week there are no more flights from Wuhan and now we have a total ban,” Domingo pointed out.
“I hope we can all just work together. Bullying and being judgmental won’t help us,” he said.

PANGLAO, Bohol—Alona Beach here used to be packed with tourists, but amid fears of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) this popular travel destination is nearly deserted.
Visitors of this white-sand public beach that boasts crystal-clear waters know that, even on weekdays, Alona is usually filled with holidaymakers both local and international. Today is different, though, because the threat of being sick looms.
""We are very affected because there are no group tours anymore,"" said James Cumba, who offers island-hopping services.
He said his business has suffered because of travel cancellations, including from China, where the new coronavirus originated.
Eriko, a Japanese citizen who has been working as a local dive instructor for more than 15 years, said this is her first time to experience such a drop in the number of dive students.
""This is worse than the SARS outbreak,"" she said.
The local government (LGU) of Bohol acknowledged that the tourism industry is struggling.
Bohol, which is putting public-health measures in place, is now thinking of temporarily banning arrivals of Chinese tourists in the province until the 2019-nCoV outbreak ends.
""There is a big implication with the ban, but we are studying it. One thing is for sure, we are not a main gateway,"" said Bohol acting governor Rene Relampagos.
The death toll in China from the new coronavirus reached more than 200 on Friday, with overall cases worldwide rising rapidly in an outbreak that the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a global health emergency.
The death toll in Hubei province -- the virus' epicenter -- has risen to 204 and there were nearly 9,700 cases of infection nationally as of Thursday, Chinese health authorities said. About 100 cases have been reported in at least 18 other countries, with no deaths outside China.

BEIJING - China sent two planes to Malaysia and Thailand on Friday to bring ""stranded"" Hubei province residents back to the virus-stricken city of Wuhan, authorities said.
The Xiamen Airlines flights will pick up the Chinese nationals from Kota Kinabalu in Malaysia and the Thai capital Bangkok, according to the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC).
There are 117 nationals from Hubei province in Bangkok and 100 in Kota Kinabalu who are ""willing to take the chartered flights back to Wuhan as soon as possible"", the CAAC said in a statement.
This is in spite of the fact that Wuhan, capital of Hubei province, is the epicenter of a new virus outbreak that is believed to have originated in a market that sold wild animals.
The city of 11 million has since experienced an unprecedented lockdown, preventing residents from leaving in a bid to stop the deadly virus from spreading further.
The charter flights are expected to arrive in Wuhan at 1200 and 1300 GMT on the same day.
""The charter flights adopt the principle of voluntary ticket purchase,"" the CAAC added.
China's foreign affairs ministry said earlier on Friday that the country would bring Wuhan residents back from overseas ""as soon as possible"" due to the ""the practical difficulties that Chinese citizens from Hubei, especially Wuhan, have faced overseas"".
This comes after a number of airlines announced they were halting or reducing flights to China as the country struggles to contain the spread of a deadly new virus.
On Monday, Malaysia banned visitors from Wuhan and its surrounding Hubei province as well.
The topic was trending online on Friday, with over 67 million views and 21,000 discussion posts on China's Twitter-like platform Weibo.
""These people probably don't want to go back (to Wuhan),"" said one.
Another questioned if residents should be brought back if they were not infected.
When asked about the suspension of international flights at a press conference on Thursday, Zhu Tao of the CAAC said authorities were coordinating arrangements to bring travelers home.
Hospitals have been overwhelmed in Wuhan. AFP reporters saw long queues, with some patients saying they lined up for two days to see a doctor.
As fears of the outbreak have spread overseas, prominent figures in Chinese communities in Italy have warned of episodes of ""latent racism"" against their compatriots by Italians fearful of catching the virus.
China has advised its citizens to postpone trips abroad and cancelled overseas group tours, while several countries including the United States, Germany, Britain and Japan have urged their citizens to avoid travel to China.

MANILA - The Presidential Security Group recommended Friday the “indefinite” suspension of museum tours in Malacañang as the country confirmed its first case of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Acute Respiratory Disease.
All PSG personnel on duty at the Malacañang Complex will also be required to wear face masks as a precautionary measure against the spread of the virus, their commander, Brig. Gen. Jose Niembra said.
“This is a preemptive measure to ensure that the seat of government is secured from this biological threat,” Niembra said.
The recommendation will be submitted to the Palace’s Internal House Affairs Office for approval.
Tours in the Presidential Museum and Library in Malacañang are free but subject to the approval of the PSG.
The PSG recommendation came a day after the Philippines confirmed its first case of the virus—a 38-year-old Chinese woman from Wuhan, where the pathogen is believed to have originated.

Singapore on Friday announced a sweeping ban on arrivals from mainland China as authorities toughened measures to prevent the spread of the fast-spreading 2019 Novel Coronavirus. 
The move was a dramatic expansion of earlier measures that affected only arrivals from central Hubei province and came after the World Health Organization declared the new coronavirus an international emergency.
The virus, which originated from Wuhan, capital of Hubei, has killed at least 200 people and infected some 10,000 mostly in China as of Friday, with several cases confirmed in other parts of Asia, Europe, and North America.

LONDON - A plane chartered by Britain to evacuate its citizens and other foreign nationals on Friday departed the Chinese city at the epicenter of a deadly virus outbreak with 110 people aboard.
The civilian aircraft left Wuhan in central China at around 9:45 am local time (9:45 a.m. in Manila) carrying 83 Britons and 27 foreign citizens, according to the Foreign Office.
A small number of medics were on the plane to provide support to passengers, it said.
The jet will land at Brize Norton Royal Air Force base in central England at around 1:00 pm local time, then head to Spain where the remaining EU nationals will disembark. 
The returning Britons will be isolated for 14 days at a medical facility in the northwest of England.

The Wuhan metropolis is at the heart of the SARS-like virus epidemic that has so far killed 213 people and led the World Health Organization (WHO) on Thursday to declare it an international public health emergency.
The city of 11 million has been subject to an unprecedented lockdown, preventing residents from leaving in a bid to stop the deadly virus from spreading further.
Thousands of foreigners were among millions of people confined in Wuhan, and numerous countries have begun airlifting their citizens out.
'VERY EMPTY'
London had hoped its flight would leave earlier but was forced to delay due to issues getting approval for the departure from Chinese officials. 
British officials had originally planned to repatriate around 200 people, and it was unclear why the eventual number was markedly lower.
Passenger Joe Armitt told Sky News television the plane was ""very empty"" because people were not given enough notice to get to the airport in time.
Armitt added he was only given 3 hours' notice the flight was leaving and that UK officials had warned the Chinese government potentially may not allow his wife to leave.
On arrival, the British evacuees will be taken by bus to Arrowe Park Hospital in northwest England for a 2-week quarantine period.
They will be housed in an accommodation block usually used by health service staff, with access to the internet.
Anyone with suspicious symptoms will be taken to the Royal Liverpool and Broadgreen Hospital, which has a high-level infectious diseases unit.

MANILA - Baguio City has canceled the opening parade of the Panagbenga Festival over the weekend, its mayor said Friday, a day after the Philippines confirmed its first case of the 2019 novel coronavirus acute respiratory disease.
The month-long Panagbenga Festival usually draws in thousands of tourists to the streets of Baguio as it celebrates the ""season of blooming.""
""After due deliberation, I am canceling the Panagbenga street parade tomorrow,"" Baguio City Mayor Benjamin Magalong said in a press conference.
The Cordillera Regional Athletic Association (CARAA) added that ""all events that will draw crowds and visitors in the next three weeks"" are also canceled, he said.

HONG KONG - Markets rose in Asia on Friday after the World Health Organization declared a global health emergency over the new coronavirus sweeping China.
After saying last week they needed more information, the WHO invoked the rarely used designation that experts hope will lead to better international coordination to combat a disease that has already killed 200 people, and sickened thousands more.
But the Geneva-based body stopped short of recommending trade and travel restrictions that could have had a bruising effect on China -- a key growth engine for the world economy.
""This is not a vote of no confidence in China,"" WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesushe said, praising Beijing for its swift action to tackle the outbreak.
China has locked down a swathe of its center, effectively quarantining millions of people in their cities and halting travel around the country.
""We must all act together now to limit further spread... We can only stop it together,"" said Tedros, who traveled to China this week and met with President Xi Jinping.
Foreign airlines -- including British Airways -- have begun cancelling or curtailing flights to and from China, and a number of governments are recommending citizens do not visit the country.
But Tedros said there was ""no reason"" for any of the international travel or trade restrictions announced in recent days.
Investors applauded the WHO's move, plunging back into markets that have lost altitude over recent days as the 2019-nCoV crisis has worsened.
""Sure the WHO raised the alert, but they didn't ring the apocalypse bell so it could be time for risk-takers to come out of hibernation,"" said Stephen Innes, chief market strategist at AxiCorp.
The WHO move ""eased some mushrooming fears by suggesting the number of outbreaks is relatively small"", he said.
Tokyo led the way on Asian equity markets, with the Nikkei 225 up 1.3 percent by the break, Hong Kong rose 0.3 percent, while Seoul and Sydney added 0.4 percent.

WUHAN - A gray-haired man wearing a face mask lay dead on the pavement at ground zero of China's virus epidemic, a plastic shopping bag in one hand.
On what would typically be a crowded street in Wuhan, an industrial city of 11 million under quarantine, there are only a few passersby and they dare not go near him.
AFP journalists saw the body on Thursday morning, not long before an emergency vehicle arrived carrying police and medical staff in full-body protective suits.
The man lay straight on his back in front of a closed furniture store. Medical staff in blue overalls gently shrouded his body with a blue blanket.
The ambulance left, and police stacked supermarket cardboard boxes to hide the scene.
AFP could not determine how the man, who appeared to be in his 60s, had died. AFP contacted police and local health officials afterwards but could not get details on his case.
But the reaction of the police and medical staff in hazmat suits, as well as some of the bystanders, highlighted the fear pervading the city.
A woman standing near the man, wearing pink pajamas and a Mao cap, said she believed he had died from the virus.
""It's terrible,"" she said. ""These days many people have died.""
Wuhan is the epicenter of the outbreak of the new coronavirus, which is believed to have jumped from wild animals at a city market into humans.
The virus, which emerged late last year, has claimed at least 213 lives and infected thousands in China, with at least 159 deaths in Wuhan alone.
With the virus spreading to other countries, the World Health Organization has declared the crisis a global health emergency.

TORMENT
Authorities have imposed an unprecedented lockdown of Wuhan, blocking off roads out of the city and banning flights, in a bid to stop the virus spreading.
Those who are trapped are enduring a tormenting wait for the lockdown to end, for a cure to be found, or even just for check-ups at overwhelmed hospitals. 
AFP reporters in Wuhan have seen long queues at hospitals, with some patients saying they had lined up for 2 days to see a doctor.
Many brought their own chairs for the wait.
With most traffic banned, people who venture outside have to walk or bike everywhere in the huge city.
The dead man on the street on Thursday lay one block from the Wuhan Number Six Hospital, one of the main medical centers for treating those with virus symptoms.
A team of forensic experts who examined him were immediately sprayed with disinfectant by colleagues after removing their hazardous material suits.
One man smoking near the scene was told sharply by police to put out his cigarette and don a face mask.
He quickly followed their orders.
In the 2 hours that AFP observed the scene, at least 15 ambulances passed by, attending other calls.
Finally, a white van with blacked-out windows arrived to take away the man.
The body was zipped into a yellow surgical bag, and carried into the van on a stretcher.
Staff immediately began to clean the ground as the van drove away, disinfecting the streets where the body had laid.

MANILA - Filipinos who may seek medical attention with symptoms of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) will get health coverage from the state health insurance agency, the country's top health official said on Friday.
Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth) convened on Thursday and decided to offer the new coronavirus package.
""The package is about a thousand per day for the hospital that takes care of a patient, even not confirmed, basta (as long as) suspected with novel coronavirus,"" said Duque on ANC's Headstart.
He said if the patient develops pneumonia, there is another PhilHealth package that may apply. 
""If pneumonia sets in then there's pneumonia package of mild, P16,000; severe P32,000,"" he said.
The Philippines on Thursday confirmed its first case of the 2019-nCoV, a 38-year-old Chinese woman from Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the outbreak. She is now in an undisclosed government hospital in Metro Manila and currently asymptomatic. 
Some 31 others are under investigation for the acute respiratory disease. 
At least 200 people have died, while close to 10,000 people have been infected in several parts of China and countries in Europe, Asia and North America. 
Its symptoms include fever, cough, shortness of breath, and breathing difficulties, according to the World Health Organization.

MANILA - There is no present evidence that pets, such as dogs and cats, can be infected with the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV), the World Health Organization said. 
""However, it is always a good idea to wash your hands with soap and water after contact with pets. This protects you against various common bacteria such as E.coli and Salmonella that can pass between pets and humans,"" the WHO said.
The WHO said the spread of the new coronavirus is a global emergency, saying 2019-nCoV can affect ""people of all ages.""

""Older people, and people with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease) appear to be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virus,"" it said.
Are antibiotics effective in preventing and treating the 2019-nCoV? Certainly not, according to the WHO.
""Antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria. The new coronavirus is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment,"" it said.
WHO, however, stressed, ""However, if you are hospitalized for the 2019-nCoV, you may receive antibiotics because bacterial co-infection is possible.""
To date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the virus, according to the WHO.
""However, those infected with the virus should receive appropriate care to relieve and treat symptoms, and those with severe illness should receive optimized supportive care. Some specific treatments are under investigation, and will be tested through clinical trials,"" it said.

BEIJING - China announced Thursday the suspension of all domestic football and postponed indefinitely the top-flight Chinese Super League (CSL) season in response to the deadly viral outbreak sweeping the country. 
The CSL 2020 campaign had been due to kick off on Feb. 22, but was shelved along with ""all types of football matches"" in order to ""carry out prevention and control of the pneumonia epidemic,"" said a Chinese Football Association statement.
The announcement comes just a few hours after the World Indoor Athletics Championships, scheduled to take place in the Chinese city of Nanjing in March, were postponed until 2021 after advice from the World Health Organization.
Football is fanatically followed in the world's most populous nation with cash-rich clubs importing expensive foreign signings such as Brazilians Hulk and Oscar, and Argentina's Carlos Tevez in recent years.
It becomes the latest sport to be hit by the virus which by Thursday had seen more than 7,700 cases confirmed in China with at least 170 fatalities.

WUHAN - China reported its biggest single-day jump in novel coronavirus deaths on Thursday, as confirmation that 3 Japanese evacuated from the outbreak's epicenter were infected deepened fears about a global contagion.
The World Health Organization (WHO), which initially downplayed the severity of a disease that has now killed 170 nationwide, warned all governments to be ""on alert"" as it weighed whether to declare a global health emergency.
As foreign countries evacuated their citizens from Wuhan, the locked-down city where the virus was first detected, concern over the economic impact has steadily intensified.
Airlines have suspended services to China and companies from Starbucks to Tesla have shuttered stores and production lines.

China virus death toll rises to 170, more than 1,700 new cases

Chinese authorities have taken extraordinary steps to arrest the virus's spread, including effectively locking down more than 50 million people in Wuhan and surrounding Hubei province.
But that was yet to pay dividends, with the government reporting 38 new deaths in the 24 hours to Thursday, the highest 1-day total. All but one were in Hubei.
The number of confirmed new cases also grew steadily to 7,711, the National Health Commission said. Another 81,000 people were under observation for possible infection.
The pathogen is believed to have been spawned in a market that sold wild game, spreading far and wide by a Lunar New Year holiday season in which hundreds of millions of Chinese travel domestically or abroad.
'TOTALLY NEW SITUATION'
Japan's infection rate grew to 11 after 3 Japanese citizens among more than 200 on an evacuation flight Wednesday tested positive.
Officials had already confirmed 2 cases in which patients tested positive without having traveled to China, adding to anxiety over human-to-human transmission of the respiratory disease.
""We are in a truly new situation,"" Health Minister Katsunobu Kato told parliament.
The fact that 2 of the 3 new confirmed Japanese cases showed no symptoms underscored the scale of the challenge for health workers.

SAIPAN - The Northern Mariana Islands banned all travelers from China and declared a ""state of significant emergency"" Thursday, as Pacific island states stepped up measures to protect against the coronavirus outbreak. 
Although Chinese tourist traffic is a pillar of the economy in the US Pacific commonwealth, Northern Mariana governor Ralph Torres said the new coronavirus ""poses a significant and imminent threat.""
In China, where the epidemic originated, 170 have died with thousands more infected.
Although no suspected cases of the virus have been recorded in the Northern Marianas, Torres said the risk remained ""substantial"" due to incubation times.
""I find that the public health threat of a traveler from mainland China carrying the coronavirus is significant and cannot be understated,"" he said.
""The Commonwealth Ports Authority shall communicate with all airlines with travelers directly and indirectly from mainland China to suspend the arrival of travelers for the period of this emergency declaration.""

SEOUL - South Korean President Moon Jae-in urged residents not to give in to fear as the country prepared to evacuate the first of around 700 citizens from the epicenter of the new coronavirus epidemic in China on Thursday.
The first of up to 4 planned flights to Wuhan had been due to depart South Korea on Thursday morning, but were delayed for unspecified reasons, Yonhap news agency reported. The flights were still expected to depart by later in the day.
""The weapons that will protect us from the new coronavirus are not fear and aversion but trust and cooperation,"" Moon said in a speech on Thursday, decrying ""fake news"" as creating excessive anxiety.
Protesters used tractors to block access to facilities earmarked as quarantine centers in the cities of Asan and Jincheon, about 80 km (50 miles) south of Seoul, on Wednesday.
The government has proposed to keep the evacuated citizens in isolation at the facilities, usually used as training centers for public servants, for at least 2 weeks to ensure they do not develop symptoms.
Moon tried to reassure residents, saying the initial evacuees would only be those with no symptoms, and they will be held in isolation.
""The government will be taking air-tight steps to ensure the residents of areas where the facilities are do not need to be concerned,"" he said.
South Korea has reported 4 cases of the newly identified virus, all of whom arrived after visiting the central Chinese city of Wuhan where the pathogen appeared in humans late last year.
The new strain of coronavirus has an incubation of between 1 and 14 days and can spread before symptoms show, complicating efforts to screen people at international borders.
It has created widespread alarm because it is spreading quickly and there are still important unknowns surrounding it, but it is still too early to know what its death rate will be, because there are likely to be many cases of milder infections going undetected.
South Korea said the inter-Korean liaison office in Kaesong, North Korea, would be closed until the outbreak eased. North Korea would not allow South Korean officials to enter the office when they arrived on Thursday, Yonhap reported, citing South Korea's unification ministry.

Mike Blake, Reuters


MARCH AIR RESERVE BASE, California - Nearly 200 Americans airlifted from China in the midst of the coronavirus outbreak arrived on Wednesday at a US military base in California, where they will remain isolated for at least 72 hours of medical evaluation, public health officials said.
The group, mostly US diplomats and their families, were evacuated from Wuhan at the epicenter of the outbreak aboard a US government-chartered cargo jet that stopped to refuel in Alaska on Tuesday night before flying on to March Air Reserve Base, about 60 miles (97 km) east of Los Angeles.
Foreign governments have begun flying their citizens out of Wuhan as the death toll has risen and the city has entered into a virtual quarantine, with Chinese authorities trying to contain the virus.

China virus death toll rises to 170, more than 1,700 new cases

The 195 passengers at March air base were medically screened by Chinese government and US State Department officials before boarding the plane in Wuhan, and again during the refueling stop by a team from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC officials said.
All the passengers have agreed to remain voluntarily in special housing at the military base, cordoned off from base personnel, for 72 hours.
""These people are not under federal quarantine orders,"" said Dr. Christopher Braden, deputy director of the CDC's National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases.
""I personally talked to them when they were disembarking and going through their first screening checks. They were happy to be here. They were very cooperative with the questions,"" Braden told a news conference at the Riverside University Health System Medical Center, near the base. ""They want to protect themselves. They want to protect others.""
NO ONE SHOWED SYMPTOMS
The US evacuees, who underwent another round of screening on arrival in California, will be given further medical evaluations, including a blood test for exposure to the virus, over the next 3 days, the officials said.
None of the arriving passengers has so far exhibited any signs of illness such as fever, cough or other respiratory symptoms, the officials said.
The screening in Alaska included a questionnaire to check for factors that would deem them to have been at high risk of infection, including exposure to someone diagnosed with coronavirus or close contact to someone living with a person who was sick.
""There were no individuals who responded to the questions indicating they were high-risk,"" said Dr. Nancy Knight, director of the CDC's Division of Global Health Protection. ""We are reassessing that now.""
One individual on the original evacuation manifest was barred from boarding the plane in China because the person had a fever.

New coronavirus study places incubation period at around 5 days

The State Department ordered its personnel evacuated from the US Consulate in Wuhan and welcomed other American citizens onto the flight because there was excess room on the plane, CDC officials said. The group included an unspecified number of children, ranging from a month-old infant to teenagers, they said.
The plan is to allow the evacuees to return to their homes once the initial evaluation period is over, provided there is no indication of exposure or illness, the officials said.
At that point, absent any symptoms or a positive test result, an individual would be considered non-infectious and be permitted to travel on public transportation without putting others at risk, Braden said.
FREE TO LEAVE?
People who may be incubating the infection before any symptoms appear are not believed to be contagious, Braden said.
Health authorities will continue ""active monitoring"" of all the passengers through the end of a 14-day incubation period, and plans are in place to isolate any individual who shows signs of illness after going home.
If any evacuees test positive or fall ill in the next 3 days, they would be transferred to the Riverside Medical Center for isolation and treatment, and authorities would decide what measures need to be taken for the rest of the group, Braden said.

The global spread of the coronavirus: Where is it?

Asked if someone in the group who tested negative before the 72-hour hold was over would be free to leave the base early, Knight said that would lead to a conversation that ""would be discussed up to the highest levels within the US government.""
""If we think a person is a danger to the community, we can institute an individual quarantine for that person, and we will,"" Braden added. ""If we think it's risky, then we have the tools to protect the public and we will use them.""
So far, 5 cases of coronavirus have been diagnosed in the United States, none of them fatal, Braden said. A further 165, other than the plane passengers, are under evaluation.
""There's no indication we have any transmission from those cases, and therefore the risk for people in the United States, we believe, is low,"" Braden said.

,Jan 30 2020,nCov,Public urged to trust gov’t info as fake news spreads faster than Wuhan virus,"Christian V. Esguerra, ABS-CBN News","
MANILA—At a time when misinformation can spread faster than diseases, Philippine health officials have adopted a stronger social media campaign to combat fake news about the deadly Wuhan coronavirus.
A new Department of Health website is dedicated solely to updates on the disease, formally known as the 2019 Novel Coronavirus, which has killed more than 130 people in China and sickened nearly 6,000 others as of Wednesday.
As officials work to prevent the disease from entering the Philippines, managing what Health Secretary Francisco Duque III described as an “epidemic of misinformation” also poses a challenge.
Groups of fact-checkers from 30 countries have also been working to correct false information being spread on social media.
In the Philippines, Duque cited questionable videos circulating online showing coronavirus patients supposedly dropping dead while awaiting treatment at a Chinese hospital.
The public should be “discriminating and at least verify” the source of such videos, he said.
TRUST GOV’T
The health department’s website “urges the public to source information only from official DOH channels and social media accounts.”
Among the common victims of fake information during a public health crisis situation are hospitals, said Dr. Lulu Bravo, a former official of the Manila-based National Insitutes of Health at the University of the Philippines.
Word can easily spread around that a patient of the Wuhan coronavirus is admitted and prompt others to seek discharge even if they’re still unwell, she said.
While existing health protocols have so far successfully kept the disease out, she said “fake news spreads quickly here in the Philippines” so the public should turn only to official information from the DOH.

False virus news can drag 'better prepared' Philippines: ex-SARS fighter

“Let’s trust the government,” she told ABS-CBN, recalling systems put in place during previous outbreaks such as that of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).
“Beterano na ang DOH dyan.”
SURGICAL MASKS
A World Health Organization official on Tuesday took the opportunity during a press briefing in Manila to reassure those worried about catching the disease.
Dr. Rabindra Abeyasinghe, the WHO respresentative in the Philippines, pointed to several journalists wearing surgical masks.
People should do so only if they have “signs and symptoms of a respiratory infection” or if going to places where there is a “concentration of people that can trigger infections,” he said.
“Normal people going about their normal work don’t need to wear surgical masks or N95 masks,” he told reporters.
“You don’t need to wear a mask from morning till evening.”
INFORMATION SYSTEM
Like the DOH, the WHO has also been dealing with false information being spread around, which makes it more difficult for authorities to contain the new coronavirus.
Abeyasinghe urged the public to get information from the WHO website.
“People are free to access social media and sometimes access incorrect information,” he told ABS-CBN News. “That’s what we’re trying to manage.”
One way to combat the spread misinformation is building “resilient health systems that are well-resourced and prepared to stop outbreaks before they begin,” according to a study by the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies.
“Rather than engaging in censorship to counter actors or ideas individually,” it said, “policymakers and industry should focus on building a resilient information system that is ready to mitigate the effectiveness of misinformation without restricting the free marketplace of ideas.”

MANILA - The Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines issued Wednesday an ""Oratio Imperata"" or a special prayer imploring protection from the novel coronavirus outbreak.
In a statement, the CBCP enjoined all parishes in the country of at least 80 million Roman Catholics to recite the prayer beginning Sunday, Feb. 2, the Feast of the Presentation of the Lord.
The ""oratio"" is expected to be offered in Masses during weekdays and Sundays, after the Holy Communion. 
""In praying, we invite ourselves with all our brothers and sisters suffering with the disease brought by the virus, bring up to God our longing for them to be restored to full health and humbly pray that we may be spared form infection of this virus,"" said Rev. Fr. Marvin Mejia, the CBCP's secretary general. 
The CBCP is also recommending the following:
1. Communion in the hand be practiced ordinarily to help prevent further fear from people who are reasonably cautious about this matter;
2. Regularly check and change the Holy Water in the Holy Water fonts in churches;
3. Provide/install protective cloth on the grills of confessionals; and,
4. Discourage hand-holding during the singing or praying of the ""Our Father"" and the shaking of hand during the Sign of Peace. 
""Let it also be our pastoral duty to remind our faithful to heed the health recommendation of medical experts and officials so that we prevent the acquisition and spread of the disease,"" Mejia added. 
The CBCP is advising parishes, churches, and chapels dedicated to St. Raphael the Archangel and St. Roch (Roche or Roque) to make special prayers and penitential processions. The two are considered patrons in times of pestilence and spread of incurable illnesses.
Below is the full text of the prayer:
ORATIO IMPERATA
God our Father
we come to You in our need
to ask Your protection against the 2019 N-coronavirus
that has claimed lives
and has affected many.
We pray for Your grace
for the people tasked with studying the nature and cause
of this virus and its disease
and of stemming the tide of its transmission.
Guide the hands and minds of medical experts
that they may minister to the sick
with competence and compassion
and of those governments and private agencies
that must find cure and solution to this epidemic.
We pray for those afflicted.
May they be restored to health soon. 
Grant us the grace
to work for the good of all
and to help those in need. 
Grant this through our Lord Jesus Christ, Your Son
who lives and reigns with You, in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God forever and ever. Amen. 
The new strain of the coronavirus, which originated in Wuhan, China, has already killed more than 100 people, and infected nearly 6,000 others.

Measles is more contagious than 2019-nCoV, says DOH
MANILA (UPDATE) - The Philippines on Wednesday is monitoring 23 suspected cases of the 2019 novel coronavirus as 4 others have already tested negative, health officials said.
Four patients were discharged from the hospital after being cleared of the new respiratory virus that is plaguing China, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said in a press briefing.
The Philippines remains free from the 2019-nCoV that has already claimed at least 132 lives in China and infected nearly 6,000 others.
""Confirmed cases, zero,"" Duque said.

China confirms 5,974 virus cases, exceeding nation's SARS total

Health authorities are keeping a watchful eye on 17 cases in the National Capital Region (NCR), 1 in Western Visayas, 1 in Mimaropa, 1 in Eastern Visayas, 2 in Central Visayas and 1 in Davao Region.
Most are foreigners who had traveled to the Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicenter of the respiratory contagion that started from a market selling illegal wildlife.
As infections have been confirmed in other countries, such as the United States, France and many Asian countries, Duque called on the public to remain calm, but vigilant.
To limit the possible transmission of the flu-like virus, he said the public should practice hand hygiene, observe cough etiquette, avoid contact with farm and wild animals, and cook food properly, among others.
""It's better to be proactive and prepared,"" he said.
Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), according to the World Health Organization. 
CONTACT RATE
Dr. Chito Avelino, DOH's epidemiology bureau director, said the infection rate for 2019-nCoV ranged from 2 to 4.
""That means that for 1 individual infected, there's a possibility for him to transmit [the virus] to 2 to 3 or 4 uninfected individuals, at close range. The basic principle is close contact,"" he said.
Compared with other diseases, the new strain of coronavirus is not as contagious, Avelino said.
""Mas nakakahawa ang tigdas (Measles is more infectious),"" he said.
According to Duque, the infectiousness rate of measles is 1 person to 18.
TEST KITS
At the press briefing, Health Undersecretary Eric Domingo said confirmatory test kits or ""primers"" ordered by the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) have arrived in the country Wednesday.
""They are now setting up the laboratory for this. Once the laboratory is set up within 48 hours, they will be able to start running the test for the 2019 novel coronavirus here in the Philippines,"" he said.
The RITM sends specimen samples to the Victorian Infectious Disease Reference in Australia to confirm if the patient is infected with 2019-nCoV. The process usually takes 24 hours.
""The subsequent tests will now be done by RITM,"" Domingo said.
The RITM has 6 pending confirmatory tests in Australia, the results of which are expected Thursday or Friday.

HONG KONG - Migrant support group Mission for Migrant Workers (MFMW) on Tuesday called on the Hong Kong government to provide clear labor guidelines and health precautionary measures for the city's estimated 300,000 foreign domestic workers, after a Filipino domestic helper was quarantined for coming into close contact with 2 people who later tested positive for the novel coronavirus.
Cynthia Abdon, the group's manager, expressed concern on the plight of foreign household helpers who, as mandated by a law in effect since 2003, live with their employers.

""Iyan ba ay ire-recognize ng employer na official sa Labor Department? Nililinaw ba nila... halimbawa connected sa official hospital or health department policy...na i-quarantine ang mga nasa ganitong kalagayan? Ang kanila bang mga trabaho o ang mga sahod nila sa mga araw na sila ay naka-quarantine ay official pa rin ba na dapat nilang matanggap? Dapat. Kasi hindi naman sila ang may cause ng pangyayaring 'yon,"" Abdon told ABS-CBN News.
(Will this case be officially recognized by her employer to be in line with the Labor Department? They want to clarify, for example, with those connected with the official hospital or health department policy, whether those in that kind of condition need to be quarantined? Will they continue to receive salary for the days they are on quarantine? Well, they should, because they didn't cause the situation they are in.)
Abdon said they also received reports domestic workers who spend time outside are told to hurry home, including on their rest days, amid fears of the 2019-nCoV spread. 
""Kaya 'pag nasa loob ka ng bahay (ng employer mo), alangan naman... sabi nila doon ka lang sa loob ng kuwarto mo kung may kuwarto ka man. Paano na 'yong sa mga wala rin kuwarto. Hindi puwede. Mahihiya ka rin kahit paano na hindi ka mag trabaho... kahit day-off mo, kahit holiday,"" said Abdon.
(When you are at your employer's home, they could tell you to just stay inside your room. That is if you have your own room. But what about those without their own room? ... Somehow, you feel ashamed if you do not do some chores, even if it's your rest day, or it's a holiday.)
Abdon urged consulates of migrants-sending countries to coordinate with the host government in disseminating proper and similar information, ""in a language friendly to migrants,"" saying that migrant domestic workers ""are part of the Hong Kong community.""
""Meaning, of course 'yong language ng migrant domestic workers in Bahasa Indonesia, Tagalog, Sri Lankan, ano man 'yan. At the very least, dapat may English. Kasi ngayon, halimbawa, meron kaming Chinese staff. So, nakukuha namin 'yong mga information sa mga Chinese newspapers o Chinese information na pinapakalat nila sa kaniya lang. Pa'no po 'yong mga walang access?"" said Abdon.
(Meaning, of course, such languages of migrant domestic workers as Bahasa Indonesia, Tagalog, Sri Lankan, or whatever it is. At the very least, there should be English. Because right now, we have a Chinese staff. So, we get information from Chinese newspapers or information in Chinese that they are sharing. But how about the rest who do not have access?)
The MFMW complained about confusing instructions on the proper wearing and use of face masks, say, if one is in a closed building.
""Dapat ka bang mag-mask? Hindi ka ba dapat mag-mask? Gaano mo kalimit papalitan ang mask? Pati yan issue 'yan, 'di ba? So ang mahalaga lang, 'wag ma-curtail 'yong right ng ating migrant domestic workers na sa panahon na ganito, pati ang employers ay nagpa-panic na rin, sapagkat hindi malinaw ang mga opisyal na directives ng government,"" said Abdon.
(Should you wear a mask? Should you not wear a mask? How often should you change masks? It's important that our domestic workers' rights will not be curtailed in times like this, because even employers are already panicking because official directives from the government are not clear.)

Pinay in HK quarantined after exposure to new coronavirus: consulate

The Filipino domestic worker in quarantine had been exposed to an elderly couple who tested positive for the novel coronavirus after arriving in Hong Kong from Wuhan by high-speed rail on Jan. 22. They developed fever and were admitted to Prince of Wales Hospital in Shatin on January 23.
The couple had been staying with their daughter and the domestic helper at Lake Silver Estate in Ma On Shan.
The helper showed no symptoms, but has to be quarantined for 14 days from Jan. 23. Health officials stressed she was not a patient, but a confinee.

At a press conference by the Department of Health and Hospital Authority on Monday, Dr. Chuang Shuk-kwan, head of the communicable disease branch of the Center for Health Protection of the Department of Health, confirmed that the Filipino remained asymptomatic, adding she had been quarantined ""just like other local residents"" who are quarantined in the camp.
""All asymptomatic confinees will not be tested because, even if you test, it is negative; it won't be positive usually. So... they are checking the symptoms, they are checking their temperatures and symptoms daily. We have a 24-hour medical post in the camp... Whenever they have symptoms, they will be checked. And then, they will be sent to the hospital for testing and isolation. So, if they are asymptomatic, there is no point to test them,"" Dr. Chuang told ABS-CBN News.
Most offices and businesses in Hong Kong remain closed in observance of the Lunar New Year holidays. In November last year, announcements were made to scrap the annual Lunar New Year parade and the New Year's Eve fireworks display over fears of protest.
A 4-day carnival for the Chinese New Year celebrations was supposed to take place instead, but had been dropped as well in light of the spread of the 2019-nCoV.
As of noontime Tuesday, most government facilities are closed, while others are on special working arrangements. The closures are stretching up to the first week of February, and even the week after for some.
As of Jan. 27, the Center for Health Protection of Hong Kong's Department of Health is monitoring eight imported cases.
The Hospital Authority said 110 patients are under isolation, of whom, 104 are in stable condition.
The public is continuously reminded to strictly maintain personal, food and environmental hygiene.

BEIJING - The World Health Organization's (WHO) director-general said on Tuesday he is confident in China's ability to control and contain the spread of a new coronavirus, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said.
At a meeting with authorities in Beijing, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said he approved of the Chinese government's measures to curb the outbreak so far, according to a statement posted on the foreign affairs ministry's website.
The death toll from the virus has climbed to 106 in China and cases are being reported in a growing number of other countries.

The global spread of the coronavirus: Where is it?

The WHO called the epidemic ""an emergency in China"" on Jan. 23, but stopped short of declaring it a global public health emergency.
Tedros said he does not advocate the evacuation of foreign nationals currently in China, and urged people to stay calm.
Several countries including the United States, France, Japan, South Korea and Morocco have said they will evacuate some citizens from Wuhan, a city of 11 million in central China and the epicenter of the outbreak.
Wuhan, where the virus emerged late last year, apparently in a market illegally selling wildlife, has been put on a virtual lockdown with bans on almost all transport and public gatherings.
Tens of millions of others in Hubei province, where Wuhan is located, live under some form of travel curbs in a bid to contain the spread of the virus.

The coronavirus can cause pneumonia, but it is too early to know just how dangerous it is and how easily it spreads.
Some health experts have questioned whether China can contain it.
Chinese health officials say the incubation period could range from 1 to 14 days, and the virus is infectious during that time. The WHO estimated an incubation period of 2 to 10 days.

MANILA - The Philippine government is studying the possible repatriation of Filipinos from the Chinese city of Wuhan, the global epicenter of a new coronavirus outbreak, as migrant workers there expressed desire to come home.
Malacañang will wait for the recommendation of the Department of Health (DOH) and Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) on the return of some 150 Filipinos from Wuhan, Presidential spokesman Salvador Panelo said, noting that the government has to be “cautious” to ensure that the Philippines remains free of the virus.
“We must consider the health issue on the spread [of the virus]. Ano ba mas makakabuti? That they’ll stay there for a while until the crisis is over or we’ll get them and bring them here and open the possibility of spreading it here?” he told reporters.
Filipinos working in Wuhan, where the virus outbreak started in December, have expressed worries over their condition as the Chinese city sought to control the spread of the virus.

Panelo added that the government would also review the possible repatriation of Filipinos in other countries where there are confirmed cases of coronavirus.

International SOS, a medical and travel security services firm that advises companies on travel, said its guidance for now was that business travel to China outside Hubei province could continue.
But this could be updated if there were major flight cancellations throughout China and more disruptions to ground transport, including rail, International SOS Regional Security Director James Robertson said.
""Many of our clients have chosen to defer or cancel upcoming travel based on their own individual assessments,"" Robertson said. ""If people do choose to travel they need flexible itineraries accounting for extra time for temperature and health screenings.""

WUHAN - The United States and other nations raced to get their citizens out of the locked-down Chinese city at ground-zero of a virus epidemic on Tuesday, as the death toll surged to 106 and the number of confirmed infections doubled to over 4,500.
The deadly virus, which experts believe emanated from a wild animal market in the city of Wuhan last month, has triggered a desperate Chinese containment effort after spreading nationwide and to more than a dozen other countries. 
The government has sealed off Wuhan and other cities in central Hubei province, effectively trapping more than 50 million people, including thousands of foreigners, in a bid to contain the virus as the high-travel Lunar New Year holiday unfolds.
As those trapped in Wuhan have become increasingly anxious, governments have scrambled to devise ways to safely get their citizens out of the city of 11 million.

The global spread of the coronavirus: Where is it? 

The United States, France and Japan are among those to have announced plans for airlifts, but nearly a week after the lockdown the evacuations have yet to happen.
A chartered US-bound flight had been scheduled to leave Wuhan on Tuesday with consular staff and some American citizens.
But the State Department said that had been postponed to Wednesday, without giving a reason.
France has also said it intends to fly its citizens out of the city in the middle of this week, and Japan has similar plans.

Several other countries also were working to repatriate their people, while Germany said it was considering doing so.
The virus can be transmitted between people, although scientists have yet to determine how contagious it is and exactly the way it is spread.
In bids to stop huge numbers of people coming into close contact with each other, China has imposed tight transport restrictions in other parts of the country.
It has extended the Lunar New Year national holiday into next week.
The education ministry on Tuesday also said the spring semester for schools and universities nationwide would be postponed, without giving a resumption date.
DEATH TOLL CLIMBS
Despite the unprecedented measures, the virus has showed little sign of slowing down.
The national health commission on Tuesday said 26 new deaths occurred in the preceding 24 hours, bringing the nationwide total to 106. 
Confirmed infections in China also jumped to 4,515, it said, up from 2,744 on Monday.
There were nearly 7,000 more cases suspected and awaiting confirmation, according to the commission.
The virus has also continued to spread around the world.

On Monday, the first infections were confirmed in Germany, Canada and Sri Lanka.
Fears over containment were heightened on Sunday when Wuhan's mayor, wearing a medical mask, revealed at a press conference that 5 million people had left the city for other parts of the country during the massive travel rush that precedes the New Year holiday.
President Donald Trump said the United States has offered Beijing ""any help that is necessary"" in combating the virus.
But the United States, Turkey, and Germany were among nations urging their citizens to ""reconsider"" all travel to China.
Malaysia on Monday banned visitors arriving from Hubei.
Landlocked Mongolia -- which is heavily dependent on trade with China -- took the drastic step of closing the border with its huge neighbor to cars.
Mongolia also cancelled classes until March 2 and suspended large public gatherings.
DESPERATE EFFORTS
Medical facilities have been overwhelmed in Wuhan, which has become a near ghost-town.
China has deployed hundreds of military medics to ease the pressure, and started building2 hospitals with the aim of finishing them in just 10 days.
AFP reporters saw hundreds of mask-wearing workers toiling around the clock to assemble one of the pre-fab field hospitals.

Construction began just days ago but the outline of a floor was already taking shape and electrical switchboards were up on Monday.
""We have to work fast to combat the epidemic,"" a worker in his 30s, who refused to give his name, told AFP.
Stressed Wuhan residents living under the quarantine expressed fears for the health and dwindling supplies at home.
""I'm getting more concerned every day,"" Do Quang Duy, a 32-year-old Vietnamese masters student in Wuhan, told AFP.
FIGHTING SPIRIT
But Wuhan's people, who have a reputation in China for resilience, sought to project a fighting spirit.
Quarantined residents shouted ""Go Wuhan"" from their windows, according to videos posted online. 
A building lit up the night sky late on Monday with those words in red.

WHO says still probing if Chinese virus can spread before symptoms

The World Health Organization last week stopped short of declaring the outbreak a global emergency, which could have prompted a more aggressive international response such as travel restrictions.
But the WHO on Monday admitted making an error in originally assessing the virus' worldwide threat as ""moderate,"" issuing an update late on Sunday to say the risk was actually ""high at the global level.""
WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus traveled to Beijing this week for discussions with Chinese officials to coordinate on the crisis.

BEIJING - China on Tuesday postponed the start of the spring semester for schools and universities across the country over concerns about a novel virus outbreak.
The decision came as the death toll from the new coronavirus soared to 106 and the total number of cases surpassed 4,000 nationwide.
Students are currently on holiday for the Lunar New Year and the education ministry did not provide a date for teaching to resume.

But a statement from the ministry said teaching institutions would reopen on a case-by-case basis.
School administrators had been instructed to ""require students not to go out, not to gather and not to hold or participate in centralized activities"", the statement added. 
Authorities on Monday decided to extend China's Lunar New Year holiday, originally due to end on Jan. 30, for 3 days to limit population flows and control the epidemic.

MANILA (UPDATE) - The Philippines stopped issuing visas on arrival to Chinese nationals on Tuesday, in a bid to keep the southeast Asian nation free of a new virus that has killed 106 and infected more than 4,500 since emerging in China in December.
There have been no confirmed cases in the Philippines since the coronavirus outbreak began in China's central city of Wuhan, but infections have been confirmed in Japan, Nepal, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, the United States and Vietnam.
""We are taking this proactive measure to slow down travel, and possibly help prevent the entry of the 2019-nCoV,"" Jaime Morente, the commissioner of the Philippines' Bureau of Immigration, said in a statement, referring to the virus.
There is no order barring Chinese nationals from entering the Philippines, however, Morente said.
He did not say when the facility would be resumed. Chinese nationals can still apply for visas at any Philippine embassy or consulate at their places of residence.
Health authorities are monitoring more than 11 suspected cases of the new coronavirus, they said on Tuesday.
The ""visa upon arrival"" facility has been offered to Chinese nationals since 2017, in an effort to boost tourism. Those eligible included investors and businessmen, athletes, delegates to international conventions and tour groups.
Chinese tourists accounted for 22 percent of the 7.5 million visitors to the Philippines between January and November last year, making China the second top nation of origin for international travelers to the country.

TORONTO/BENGALURU, Jan 25 (Reuters) - Canada on Saturday declared the first ""presumptive"" confirmed case of the deadly coronavirus in a resident who had returned from the central Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak of the viral disease.
Ontario health officials told a news conference the patient is a male in his 50s, who arrived in Toronto on Jan. 22 and was hospitalized the next day after developing symptoms of respiratory illness.
Barbara Yaffe, Ontario's associate chief medical officer of health, told reporters that the man is being treated in a public hospital and is in a stable condition.
Ontario health officials are investigating the details of the man's contact with others since arriving in Toronto. Early indications are that he took private transportation home after arriving at Toronto airport and then paramedics brought him to the hospital, they added.
The health officials said it is a relatively small family situation, though they declined to give a number, and there is very little by way of contact. They said his family members have been put into self isolation.
Officials said the results from the provincial laboratory confirming the positive case arrived earlier on Saturday. Once the results from the local laboratory are confirmed by Canada's National Microbiology Laboratory, the case will be declared the country's first confirmed case of coronavirus.
Canada is on high alert to prevent the spread of coronavirus and avoid the repeat of SARS, or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, that killed 44 people in Canada, the only country outside Asia to report deaths from that virus in 2002-2003. Government health officials say Canada is better prepared this time.
The deadly coronavirus has infected more than 1,975 people and killed at least 56 in China. The virus has spread to several countries including the United States, Thailand, South Korea, Japan, Australia and France.

WUHAN (2nd UPDATE) - China on Sunday expanded drastic travel restrictions to contain a viral contagion that has killed 56 people and infected nearly 2,000, as the United States and France prepared to evacuate their citizens from a quarantined city at the outbreak's epicenter.
China has locked down the hard-hit province of Hubei in the country's center in an unprecedented operation affecting tens of millions of people to slow the spread of a respiratory illness that President Xi Jinping said posed a ""grave"" threat.
Outside the epicenter, three cities, including Beijing, and an eastern province announced bans on long-distance buses from entering or leaving their borders.
Originating in Hubei's capital of Wuhan, the virus has spread throughout China and around the world, with cases confirmed in around a dozen countries as distant as France, Australia and the United States.
The US State Department said on Sunday it was arranging a flight to repatriate staff at its Wuhan consulate and other American citizens trapped in the city.
The flight departs Wuhan on Tuesday for San Francisco, it said in an email to Americans in China, while warning of ""extremely limited"" capacity for private citizens.
France's government and the French carmaker PSA -- which has a sizable presence in Wuhan -- also said they were formulating plans to evacuate staff and relatives, who would be taken to a city in a neighboring province for a quarantine period.
Sri Lanka said its Beijing embassy was considering action regarding its nationals in Wuhan.
TRAVEL BANS
China would normally be celebrating the Lunar New Year holiday this week, but Wuhan's eerie quarantine calm deepened on Sunday as new restrictions banned most road traffic in the metropolis of 11 million.
Loudspeakers offered tips slathered with bravado.
""Do not believe in rumors. Do not spread rumors. If you feel unwell, go to the hospital in time,"" the message said.
""Wuhan is a city that dares to face difficulties and keeps overcoming them,"" the female voice added, mentioning the deadly 2002-03 SARS epidemic and 1998 Yangtze River flooding.
Israt Zahan, a Bangladeshi doctoral candidate living in Wuhan said she and other students were staying in their homes as it was ""too risky"" to go outside.
""The bustling city looks like a ghost town from my window. The shops are all shut down. I am rationing the food at my home. It will last for two days. Then I don't know what I would do,"" she told AFP by phone.
Despite anxious scenes at crowded hospitals in recent days, there were no signs of panic in the city. 
But defenses were bolstered elsewhere in the country.
Beijing suspended long-distance bus services into and out of the capital beginning Sunday. Similar suspensions are planned for the entire eastern province of Shandong -- home to 100 million people -- plus the northern cities of Tianjin and Xi'an.
The southern city of Shantou had announced a ban on vehicles entering its jurisdiction after detecting two cases, but authorities later reversed the decision.
Overseas Chinese tour groups will be suspended from Monday while domestic trips have already been halted since Friday.
In the semi-autonomous southern city of Hong Kong, Disneyland announced Sunday it had closed as a precaution following the government's declaration of an emergency to combat the crisis. Shanghai's Disneyland park had already closed Saturday.
VIRUS SPREAD 'ACCELERATING'
The nationwide death toll rose to 56 after 15 new deaths, most of them in Hubei.
Shanghai on Sunday reported its first death -- an 88-year-old man who had pre-existing health problems.
It was the first death reported in an internationally connected major Chinese city outside of Wuhan, where the outbreak is believed to have originated in a market where animals like rats, snakes and hedgehogs were sold as food.
The government says most deaths involved the elderly or people already weakened by pre-existing health conditions.
Fearing a repeat of SARS, China has dramatically scaled back celebrations and travel associated with the New Year holiday, which began Friday, while tourist sites like Beijing's Forbidden City and a section of the Great Wall have closed as a precaution. 
Xi said at a Communist Party leadership meeting on the crisis that China was ""faced with the grave situation of an accelerating spread"" of the virus, calling for stepped-up prevention.
Measures have been ordered nationwide to detect and isolate people carrying the virus on planes, trains and buses.
In Wuhan, China's military has dispatched 450 medics, many with experience combating infectious diseases, to help treat patients in the city, many of whom reported hours-long waits at overwhelmed hospitals.
Wuhan is racing to build two makeshift virus-focused field hospitals within a fortnight to ease the pressure. The first could be ready in just over a week.

WUHAN - The Chinese army deployed medical specialists Saturday to the epicenter of a spiraling viral outbreak that has killed 41 people and spread around the world, as millions spent their normally festive Lunar New Year holiday under lockdown.
The country's most important celebration has been all but canceled for some 56 million people as authorities expanded travel bans in central Hubei province, now affecting 18 cities.
On Saturday, when they should have been celebrating, citizens of Wuhan stood in line at a pharmacy to buy masks from employees in full-body protective suits and surgical gloves.
On the eastern outskirts of Wuhan -- Hubei's capital and the source of the previously unknown 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) -- police manning a roadblock turned away a handful of vehicles trying to exit the city. 
""Nobody can leave,"" an officer told AFP.
But the police allowed some medical workers who had gone home for the holidays to re-enter the city to help at overwhelmed hospitals.
""They need us to go there, otherwise they will be too exhausted,"" said one of the women, pulling a suitcase.
But the respiratory contagion continues to spread.
The nationwide death toll has jumped to 41, the government said Saturday, after 15 more people died in Wuhan.

China virus death toll jumps to 41, cases soar to nearly 1,300

Confirmed infections also surged to 1,287, up from 830 reported 24 hours earlier. Most of the deaths and overall cases have been in Hubei.
In a dramatic escalation of the central government's involvement, China deployed 450 military medical staff to Wuhan, state media said.
The medics, who arrived on military aircraft late Friday, include doctors with experience combating SARS or Ebola and will be dispatched to hospitals that are reportedly short on beds due to a crush of infected patients and worried locals.
The National Health Commission also ordered nationwide measures to detect people carrying the virus on planes, trains and buses across the country.
PROTECT YOURSELF
""Everyone is just trying to protect themselves,"" said a man in a surgical mask at a Wuhan pharmacy where customers were stocking up on masks, gloves and disinfectant.
But the man, who declined to give his name, expressed confidence in Chinese authorities.
""The government is handling this. It's not a problem.""
The virus has caused global concern because of its similarity to SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), which killed hundreds across mainland China and Hong Kong in 2002 to 2003 and spread to a number of other countries.
It has now spread nationwide and to a dozen other countries, with France saying 3 cases had been confirmed there -- the first known European infections.

France confirms first three cases of coronavirus in Europe 

Australia and Malaysia on Saturday became the latest countries to confirm infections.
Beijing's Forbidden City, Shanghai Disneyland, and a section of the Great Wall are among many attractions that have closed as a precaution.
The New Year is usually a joyous occasion for family reunions, but not for many in Wuhan.
""Usually we celebrate as a family. Now, because of the virus I'm not even visiting my parents,"" said Wang Fang, a 49-year-old Wuhan native.
""It'll be great just to be able to make it through (the outbreak).""
TRUMP PRAISE
China's aggressive response has won praise, especially compared to its handling of SARS, when it was accused of reacting sluggishly and stonewalling the international community.
""China has been working very hard to contain the Coronavirus,"" US President Donald Trump tweeted, hours after the United States confirmed its second case.
""The United States greatly appreciates their efforts and transparency,"" he added.
""It will all work out well.""
The virus emerged at a bad time for containment, with hundreds of millions of Chinese rushing home for the holiday.
The timing could limit the economic impact, however, since much of China normally shuts down during the roughly week-long break.
The outbreak emerged in late December, traced to a Wuhan seafood and live animal market that sold a vast range of exotic animals and other bushmeat.

'This time I'm scared': Experts fear too late for China virus lockdown 

The World Health Organization on Thursday stopped short of declaring a global emergency, which would have prompted greater international cooperation, including possible trade and travel restrictions.
Wuhan resembles a ghost town due to the clampdown, but hospitals bustled with worried patients being screened by staff wearing full-body protective suits.
The city's Guiyuan Temple is normally thronged for the Lunar New Year with tens of thousands of devotees paying respects to a deity associated with wealth.
But police manning a roadblock on Saturday turned away AFP journalists, saying the temple was closed to prevent the virus spread.
Authorities began building a new field hospital in Wuhan to deal with the outbreak, which state media said could be ready in 10 days.

HONG KONG - Hong Kong on Saturday declared a mystery virus outbreak as an ""emergency"" -- the city's highest warning tier -- as authorities ramped up measures aimed at reducing the risk of further infections spreading.
""Today I declare the lifting of the response level to emergency,"" chief executive Carrie Lam told reporters.
Lam held emergency meetings with health officials on Saturday morning after returning from Davos as criticism of her administration's response had risen in some quarters.
Of the 5 people who have tested positive for the virus in Hong Kong so far, 4 arrived via a newly built high-speed train terminal, which connects with the mainland.
That has led to calls from some to limit, or even halt, arrivals from the Chinese mainland, which remains the epicenter of the outbreak with 41 people dead so far.

China virus death toll jumps to 41, cases soar to nearly 1,300 

At a press conference on Saturday, Lam said all flights and trains from Wuhan would be canceled until further notice.
There were no restrictions on transport from other Chinese cities, but all mainland arrivals will now need to sign a health declaration form. 
Schools and universities, which are currently on a Lunar New Year break, would remain closed until Feb. 17, she added.
A string of public events, including a new year gala and next month's marathon, would also be called off. 
""We haven't seen serious and widespread infections (in Hong Kong), but we are taking this seriously and we hope to be ahead of the epidemic,"" Lam said.
Lam currently boasts record low approval ratings after 7 months of pro-democracy protests that have left the city ideologically torn apart and helped tip it into recession.
""We must stand united so that we can prevent and control the disease,"" she said, in a nod to the political unrest.

SYDNEY - Australia confirmed on Saturday its first 4 cases of the new coronavirus that has claimed 41 lives in China, becoming the latest country in a growing list to be affected by the illness.
One man was being treated in isolation after arriving in Melbourne a week ago from the Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak.
He has pneumonia but is in a stable condition, health officials said.
Three other men in Sydney who also arrived recently from China had tested positive for the disease and were in isolation in local hospitals.
""They are not particularly unwell,"" New South Wales state chief health officer Kerry Chant told a press conference.
She said public health officials had managed to track most of the people who had been with 2 of the men on their flights from China and none were showing symptoms of the illness.
Officials were still trying to trace the travel of the other man and are waiting on test results from several other people suspected of contracting the disease.
NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard praised the 3 men in Sydney for approaching doctors once their symptoms arose. 
Authorities in Queensland state said 5 other people had been cleared after they were suspected of infection.
The previously unknown 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is thought to have originated in a market in Wuhan where exotic animals and bushmeat were sold.
It has infected around 1,300 people in China and spread to almost a dozen other countries, including France and the United States.

The global spread of the coronavirus: Where is it?

The virus has caused global concern because of its similarity to SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), which killed hundreds across mainland China and Hong Kong in 2002 to 2003.
Health experts say some human-to-human transmission has been recorded, particularly in Wuhan, a city of 11 million now under lockdown in a bid to limit the spread of the disease.
Australian health minister Greg Hunt said passengers who traveled on the same Melbourne-bound plane as the infected man were being contacted ""to provide them with information and advice.""

Officials say 24 deaths have occurred in Hubei, the central province that is home to Wuhan, the city identified as the center of the outbreak.
The death was in the northeastern province of Heilongjiang, which borders Russia and is some 2,000 kilometers (1,200 miles) from Wuhan, the local government said.
It follows confirmation Thursday of the first death outside the epicenter -- an 80-year-old man diagnosed with the new virus in northern Hebei province, who died on Jan. 22.

TAIPEI—Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen called on China on Wednesday to share ""correct"" information about a new coronavirus and for the World Health Organization (WHO) not to exclude Taiwan from collaboration on the outbreak for political reasons.
Authorities have confirmed more than 400 cases of the virus in China, most of them in the central city of Wuhan where the virus first appeared at the end of 2019. Nine people have died.
The virus, which health officials have said can be passed from person to person, has spread to cities including Beijing and Shanghai, with cases have been confirmed in Thailand, South Korea, Japan, as well as Taiwan.

China warns virus could mutate and spread as death toll rises 

Taiwan is not a member of the WHO due to the objection of China, which considers the island a Chinese province with no right to participate in international organizations unless it accepts it is part of China.
Tsai, speaking to reporters after Taiwan's Tuesday confirmation of its first case of the coronavirus, a woman returning to Taiwan from Wuhan, said China had to live up to its international obligations.
Tsai said she hoped for transparency and that China would ""share with Taiwan correct information about the virus.""
""This is also beneficial for China's people. We believe that political considerations should not come before safeguarding people,"" she said.
Taiwan was a part of the international community and faced the same health challenges and risks as everyone, Tsai said.
""I again call on the WHO not to exclude Taiwan due to political factors. Taiwan is at the forefront of global epidemic prevention. There needs to be room at the WHO for Taiwan's participation.""

Taiwan reports first case of new SARS-like virus 

Relations between Taipei and Beijing have nosedived since Tsai took office in 2016, with China suspecting her of pushing for the island's formal independence. She says Taiwan is already an independent country called the Republic of China, it's formal name.
The WHO office in Beijing did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic said in an email to Reuters on Tuesday that Taiwan was being kept informed.
""Taiwanese authorities, including health experts, are being informed through cross-strait channels as well as channels connected with the International Health Regulations. WHO is informed that there is cross-strait contact on this matter.""
The deputy head of China's National Health Commission, Li Bin, told reporters in Beijing earlier that experts from Taiwan had been invited to visit Wuhan and the island was being provided with information.
Taiwan has advised people not to visit Wuhan unless they absolutely have to and has suspended tourist groups from the city from visiting the island.

Taiwan tells people not to go to Wuhan amid China virus outbreak 

Despite political tension, Taiwan and China have close business ties, with billions invested in China by Taiwanese businesses such as Foxconn, a key supplier to Apple .
Foxconn, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, has asked employees from its Wuhan plant in China who are in Taiwan for the Lunar New Year holidays to stay at home given the coronavirus outbreak in the city.
Since the outbreak, Foxconn workers in Wuhan have been wearing face masks and getting their temperature checked, the world's largest contract electronics manufacturer said.
Terry Gou, the billionaire founder of Foxconn, advised employees not to visit China over the holiday.
""The speed of contagion will be no less than SARS,"" he said at a party for the Lunar New Year in Taipei, referring to a Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak that started in China and killed nearly 800 people globally in 2002 to 2003.

The 124th Boston Marathon, scheduled for April 20, has been postponed to September 14 due to the ongoing coronavirus outbreak, the Boston Athletic Association (BAA) announced on Friday.
The historic race, first contested in 1897, is the world's oldest annual marathon and typically takes place on the Patriots Day holiday celebrated in Boston and the entire state of Massachusetts.
After Massachusetts governor Charlie Baker declared a state of emergency on Tuesday, Boston Mayor Martin Walsh decided the race could not proceed as scheduled in April and the BAA said in a statement it ""understands the city's decision.""
""On matters of public health and safety we take our guidance from the officials entrusted with protecting the public in this area,"" said association chief executive Tom Grilk.
""We understand our role, along with our partners, in ensuring a safe environment for all participants, volunteers, spectators, and supporters that meets the standards set by those officials.""
BAA officials have worked with municipal leaders across eight cities and towns where the course for the 26.2-mile event takes place to coordinate plans for September 14 as a new date.
""The BAA's mission of promoting health through sports, especially running, has guided our organization for more than a century,"" Grilk said. ""In collaboration with our many partners, we look forward to welcoming the world to Boston in September.""
The delay means it will be an extra five months before Kenya's Lawrence Cherono will have a chance to defend his 2019 men's crown and Worknesh Degefa of Ethiopia could bid for a repeat in the women's race.
Cherono probably will have to choose between marathon titles to defend because he also won last year's Chicago Marathon and that race is scheduled for October 11.

Vietnam postponed its debut Formula One Grand Prix on Friday, as fears over the spread of the deadly coronavirus decimated the start of the track season.
Scheduled for April 5, the Grand Prix in Hanoi was set to be the third race of the season and the first-ever to be held by the communist country.
Instead it has become the third event of the 2020 championship to be nixed as the virus throws global sport into disarray.
China has already postponed its Grand Prix to an unspecified date, while Australia on Friday cancelled the Melbourne race hours before practice sessions were due to begin.
The Bahrain race was initially due to be held behind closed doors, but it was also shelved soon after the announcement from Vietnam.
Forumla One, the most prestigious competition in motorsport faces unprecedented disruption as fears over the virus cause rip through the global sporting calendar.
""The organizer of Formula 1 . . . Vietnam Grand Prix 2020 officially announces the delay of F1 Hanoi race due to complicated development of Covid-19,"" the Vietnam Grand Prix Company (VGPC) said in a statement.
""The decision to delay the race was made after several discussions and thorough consideration between FIA, Formula One World Championship Ltd, the People's committee of Hanoi and VMA in the consensus of VGPC.""
It added: ""This was a very hard decision as 2020 is the first year Vietnam became (an) official member among the 22 countries hosting the world's most professional and attractive motor race.""

- 10-year race contract -
Last year Vietnam signed a 10-year deal with Formula One to host an event state media said would cost the country $60 million per year.
Just a few weeks ago the country's communist authorities remained bullish over the prospects for the country's debut race around the 5.565 kilometer street track in Hanoi.
They insisted the Hanoi track was ready ahead of schedule and said the race would proceed as planned, making it the third street race on the calendar.
Hosts Vietnam were keen for the glamour of motorsport to reflect the country's economic lift-off and help reshape Hanoi's image as a staid communist capital.
But Hanoi residents were understanding of another disruption to their city with a global health crisis still billowing out.
""My kids were very excited to be able to go to the track to watch a real race,"" said Le Nguyet, a Hanoi resident, who bought four tickets for $190.
""But I support the delay of the race until the situation gets better. It is a correct move. It's not safe for that many people to gather.""
Vietnam on Friday raised the country's total detected cases to 45, among them foreigners.
The Southeast Asian nation shares a porous border with China, where the virus first emerged, but for weeks said it had found only 16 cases of the sickness. 
Districts and townships where cases have been detected have faced swift lockdown as daily life in Vietnam - like most of Asia - has been upended.
This year Lewis Hamilton is aiming to retain the F1 championship in his all-conquering Mercedes.

Greece's Olympic Committee on Friday said it was cancelling the rest of the torch relay for the Tokyo 2020 Games on Greek soil, as large crowds had turned out despite coronavirus warnings.
""The rest of the torch relay on Greek soil has been cancelled,"" the committee said, adding that the Olympic flame would be handed over to Tokyo organizers on March 19 as scheduled, but without spectators.
It noted that crowds had ignored ""repeated warnings"" not to gather in force at stopovers in the torch relay.
Greece has so far declared 117 cases of the coronavirus, one of whom died on Thursday after 10 days in hospital.
The move was announced after a large crowd mobbed Hollywood actor Gerard Butler as he lit a cauldron in the city of Sparta.
Butler had starred as the ancient Spartan King Leonidas in the 2007 epic '300', and repeated his famous line from the movie -- 'This is Sparta' -- for gathered media.
The flame for the 2020 Tokyo Games was lit in ancient Olympia on Thursday amid an unprecedented health lockdown as Greece registered its first death from coronavirus.
The ceremony was held without spectators after dozens of people tested positive for COVID-19 in the broader western Peloponnese. Up to 12,000 had been expected to make their way to Olympia, where the ancient Games were held.
Only 100 accredited guests from the International Olympic Committee and the Tokyo 2020 Organising Committee, compared to 700 originally, were allowed to attend Thursday's ceremony.

,Mar 13 2020,nCov,Conflicting claims: San Juan gov't denies police report of escaping COVID-19 patient,ABS-CBN News,"
MANILA - San Juan City Mayor Francis Zamora on Friday dismissed reports that a woman who tested positive of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) attempted to evade hospital admission.
The patient went to her preferred private hospital after finding out on Wednesday, March 11 she had contracted the disease, he said.
However, the hospital could not accommodate the patient so she was instead escorted by local authorities to a different hospital for immediate treatment, Zamora added.
""She is now in stable condition and receiving proper care and treatment,"" the city mayor said in a statement.
Earlier Friday, National Capital Region Police Office Regional Director Debold Sinas said a patient escaped her police escorts as she wanted to go to a hospital of her choice.
He added the negotiation between the policeman, the woman and her husband took about 3 hours.
“Na-test na siya na positive kaya dadalin na siya sa Quirino hospital. Ayaw niya, gusto niya sa St. Luke's hospital kasi pangit yung doon. Tinanggihan siya sa St. Luke's,” Sinas said.
Sinas said negotiation between the woman and her husband took about 3 hours.
""DOH ang nag inform sa kaniya kasi nga may protocol. Now sinabi niya gusto niya hospital niya. Ang point pa doon may provision tayo kung saan lang hospital na dapat dalin yung mga nag-positive ng COVID-9.""
He pointed out that the woman should not have escaped just because she didn't like the hospital she was brought to.
""Kung tingin niya di maganda yung accommodation 'di kausapin niya yung management, hindi siya tatakas spreading the virus,"" he said.
By escaping, Sinas said the woman had exposed other people to potential infection.
 
He said all those in the couple's home, as well as police personnel who negotiated with them, are now persons under monitoring.
""Panigurado namin na yung tao namin hindi makapag-spread kaya kinausap namin San Juan, pwede ba gawin na silang persons under monitoring, 14 days lang naman yun. They will still function,"" he said.
Sinas said they will not let the incident slide and would file charges against the couple.
""Kung sinabi niyang hindi siya tumakas, nasa kanya yun 'di ba? She'll just answer later on kung anong kaso ipa-file namin...the mere fact that you already threatened the community natin by spreading the virus,"" he said.
Meanwhile, San Juan has recorded another case of COVID-19, bringing the number of infection in the city to 9.
All patients are recuperating in hospitals and currently in stable condition, Zamora said.
It was not yet clear if the new patient is part of the country's 52 confirmed COVID-19 cases. The city government also didn't give further details about the new positive case.
The new strain of coronavirus has infected more than 125,000 people and killed 4,600 others in 117 countries and territories, latest data from the World Health Organization (WHO) showed.

Pope Francis expressed his displeasure Friday with the move by the Italian authorities to close all Catholic houses of worship across Rome until April 3.
""Drastic measures are not always good,"" the Argentine-born pontiff was quoted by the ANSA news agency as saying in his introduction to mass, in uncharacteristically blunt language for the head of the Church.
He nevertheless urged the faithful to show ""responsibility"" and ""cooperate with the appropriate authorities,"" ANSA reported.
Italy has imposed Europe's toughest response to a pandemic that has killed 1,016 people and infected more than 15,000 in the peninsula in less than three weeks.
The government has shut all shops except for pharmacies and groceries in the hope of stemming contagion and easing the burden on Italy's overstretched hospitals.
The Holy See initially resisted the drastic measure of closing places of worship in a country that is overwhelmingly Catholic.
But the papal vicar for Rome said he was finally forced to take the step by ""the even more binding restrictions placed on the ordinary movement of people"" by the government.
""This provision is for the common good,"" Rome vicar Angelo De Donatis conceded.
Catholics have been exempted from the obligation to attend mass as a result.
- 'See the sick' -
The draconian measures only allow Italians to go outside for work or in special circumstances -- such as visiting sick relatives.
Everyone must carry with them a signed form to say they are aware of the risks of being outdoors.
Trains are still running but travellers must show documents to security guards at stations well as airports.
Streets in central Rome are almost completely empty and patrolled by soldiers armed with machine guns.
In video clips from the Tuscan city of Sienna and the southern city of Naples -- reminiscent of similar ones from the Chinese city of Wuhan during its quarantine -- people can be heard singing from their windows over the empty streets.
The pope nevertheless called for priests ""to have the courage to go out and see the sick, bringing the strength of the word of God"".
""We continue to pray together for the sick, for health workers and for the many people suffering from this epidemic"" Pope Francis said.

The English Premier League suspended all fixtures until April 4 on Friday after a spate of coronavirus cases, including Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta and Chelsea winger Callum Hudson-Odoi.
""Following a meeting of shareholders today, it was unanimously decided to suspend the Premier League with the intention of returning on 4 April, subject to medical advice and conditions at the time,"" the Premier League said in a statement.
Everton also announced their entire first-team squad and coaching staff have been told to self-isolate after a player reported symptoms consistent with COVID-19.
Leicester City had three players go into self-isolation on Thursday and Bournemouth said goalkeeper Artur Boruc and four staff members were also self-isolating.
""Above all, we wish Mikel Arteta and Callum Hudson-Odoi speedy recoveries, and everyone else affected by COVID-19,"" said Premier League Chief Executive Richard Masters.
""In this unprecedented situation, we are working closely with our clubs, Government, The FA and EFL and can reassure everyone the health and welfare of players, staff and supporters are our priority.""
The English Football League, which heads up the three divisions below the Premier League, and Women's Super League will also be suspended until April 3.
England's two friendly matches at home to Italy and Denmark later this month have been postponed.
However, the authorities still hope to be able to resume and complete the season at a later date.
""Despite the challenges, it is the Premier League’s aim is to reschedule the displaced fixtures, including those played by Academy sides, when it is safe to do so,"" added the Premier League statement.

NAGOYA - Police in central Japan said Friday they have launched a probe into a man who was infected with the novel coronavirus on suspicion of interfering with business activities, after he went to local eateries expressing his desire to ""spread the virus.""
The investigation came a day after a woman in her 30s tested positive for the virus after coming into contact earlier this month with the man at a drinking establishment in Aichi Prefecture.
The woman who is living with her family in Toyota, Aichi Prefecture, worked at the Filipino pub which the man in his 50s from Gamagori, also in Aichi, visited on March 4 despite authorities' instructions to stay indoors, Toyota city officials said Thursday.
The woman developed a fever on March 8 and currently has a sore throat. She is in stable condition but is scheduled to be hospitalized, according to the Toyota city officials.
The man tested positive for the virus on March 4, a day after his parents, with whom he lived, were found to be infected.
He told them he was going to ""spread the virus"" and went to a bar and the Filipino pub in Gamagori that same night, Gamagori city officials said.
The man stayed at the bar for 15 minutes but did not speak about his infection.
He then went to the Filipino pub and stayed there for around 40 minutes, singing karaoke, and putting his arm around a female employee who was seated next to him, a source familiar with the matter said.
The man told an employee at the pub that he had tested positive for the virus, leading the outlet to report him to the police and a health center. 
Following the report, police officers clad in protective gear hurried to the pub, which had to be disinfected by health officials.
The health center also sought those who came into contact with the man.
Including the woman's case, the number of infections confirmed in Aichi rose to 111, the second largest after Hokkaido among Japan's 47 prefectures.
COVID-19 is a highly contagious pneumonia caused by the new coronavirus, which has infected more than 120,000 people worldwide and claimed over 4,000 lives.

MILAN, Italy—Majority of the Filipinos in this country work in the household service sector. Domestic workers, babysitters and non-cohabiting carers are affected by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Italy has climbed to the second spot with the most number of positive cases at 15,113 and the death toll reached 1,016.
Italy is home to 168,292 Filipinos, according to the Italian National Institute of Statistics.
Marielle (not her real name) works as a cleaner and has to travel for more than an hour every day to reach her workplace outside Milan. She chooses her job over health risks just to earn for her family in the Philippines. Alcantara, uncertain of the government provisions, continue to report to work.
“Gusto ng amo ko na mag-stay pa ako sa trabaho pero sabi ko natatakot na ako, kinailangan ko pa gumawa ng dahilan para makauwi ng maaga,” Alcantara says.
(My employer wanted me to stay longer but I told her I’m scared, I had to make an alibi so I can go home early.)
According to Lorenzo Gasparrini, general secretary of the National Association of Domestic Employer Families, household service workers and non-cohabiting carers can file a leave from work and just recoup the hours lost once the emergency is over.
If the housekeeper wants to continue working and the family wants to suspend work, both parties can find an agreement, possibly written, with the commitment to recouping the lost hours. If the housekeeper insists on coming, the family could grant the worker a vacation leave.
Absence from work can be treated as a holiday period. If the worker is not entitled to a vacation leave, the employer should guarantee compensation in advance without having to terminate the employment relationship. If the housekeeper hired under a contract cannot go to work in the face of the new decree, she may take leave.
Household service workers are excluded from unemployment insurance or from other social safety nets. Families who continue to pay a housekeeper who does not work because of the emergency cannot ask for a refund.
“We are asking families not to lay off workers to avoid leaving them in a situation of absolute poverty in this moment of national emergency. However, employer families should have the same attention as other companies,” Gasparrini said.
Currently, the terms of payment of social security and welfare contributions are suspended, only for the 11 municipalities of the previous declared red zones, until May 1. Given the general lockout of all activities on the national territory, an extension of the moratorium is possible.
Filipino domestic helpers without regular employment contracts and legal documents are also at risk. With the lockdown and stricter movement regulations, a self-declaration document is needed.

This will be the third time in the last decade that Everest's summit will remain empty. Navesh Chitrakar, Reuters/file


Nepal on Friday barred climbers from all mountains -- including Everest -- over the coronavirus pandemic, in a major blow to its tourism industry.
The Himalayan country, which has so far confirmed one coronavirus case, earns 4.4 million dollars a year from climbing permits while the losses to expedition organizers will be even higher.
As well as suspending all climbing permits, Nepal stopped issuing tourist visas on arrival, Yogesh Bhattarai, Minister for Culture Tourism and Civil Aviation told AFP.
""The government has decided to suspend all spring expeditions and scrap permits for the time being. The decision can be reviewed after analyzing the global scenario over the coming month,"" tourism minister Yogesh Bhattara told AFP. 
Expedition organizers and Nepal tourism professionals said the move, which came a day after China barred access from its side, was justified but would cause a financial disaster.
Nepal, still recovering from a devastating 2015 earthquake, was also hoping to attract two million tourists for the first time in 2020, celebrating it as a visit Nepal year. 
US-based Furtenbach Adventures cancelled a move to shift its operations to Nepal after China closed the mountain on Thursday. 
""This is disappointing news for both our expedition leaders and our clients who have trained for months for this year’s climb,"" expedition organizer Lukas Furtenbach said in a statement.
Every spring a tented city of hundreds of foreign climbers and support staff grows at the foot of Everest and other peaks. All have to live in close quarters.
As the air thins, breathing is already difficult at higher altitude -- adding to medical risks if there is an outbreak of any kind among climbers. 
""We understand the dire consequences a COVID-19 outbreak at base camp would have. Sadly, we have to agree that this is a responsible call to make right now,"" Furtenbach said.
Nepal has issued only five permits for the season but none for Everest so far.
Everest attracts hundreds of mountaineers from all over the world each spring, when a window of good weather opens up between late April and the end of May, prompting a rush for the summit.
Last year's spring window saw a record 885 people summit Everest, 644 of them from Nepal and 241 from the northern flank in Tibet.
The traffic-clogged season saw 11 deaths on the mountain, with at least four blamed on overcrowding.

- 'Devastating consequence'-
But the expedition is not cheap. An Everest permit costs $11,000 and the total cost of the climb can be anything between $30,000 and $80,000.
This will be the third time in the last decade that Everest's summit will remain empty.
Climbers abandoned the mountain after the 2015 earthquake triggered an avalanche which killed 18 people at Everest base camp before the season began.
Only one climber reached the summit in 2014, when an avalanche claimed the lives of 16 Nepali guides on the notorious Khumbu icefall that sits above base camp, forcing organizers to cancel their expeditions. 
Santa Bir Lama, president of Nepal's mountaineering association, said the cancellation will have serious repercussion on the tourism industry of the country.
""It would have a devastating impact on our tourism and economy. The companies will suffer and workers even more. But it is a responsible thing to do considering the risks,"" Lama said.
Many guides and support staff depend on the short climbing season for the bulk of their annual earnings. 
""It will be very difficult this year. Not only Everest, we might not get work on other mountains either. All of us have families and children to send to school. This is when we earn the most,"" said Temba Bhote, a guide on Everest.

As he watches his troops firing rockets and artillery shells, one of the many things that marks North Korean leader Kim Jong Un out from the officers alongside him is his coronavirus mask: it isn't there.
Kim has overseen multiple military drills in recent weeks as Pyongyang mounts an all-out drive to prevent an outbreak of the disease that has swept around the world from neighboring China.
Thousands have been quarantined and hundreds of foreigners, including diplomats, confined to their residences.
State media constantly exhort citizens to obey health directives and publish images showing universal facemask use -- except by the supreme leader.
The Rodong Sinmun newspaper, mouthpiece of the ruling party, and official news agency KCNA have shown Kim supervising firing exercises from a trench, tent or shelter four times in the last two weeks.
Every time he has had his face uncovered under a black fur hat, while all the officers next to him have worn black masks.
The North carefully controls and calibrates imagery of Kim, and analysts said his uncovered features send an intended message.
""He may want to show people that he is not afraid of the virus, that he is above infection,"" said Rachel Minyoung Lee, senior analyst with specialist site NK News.
""It is consistent with the crux of North Korea's leadership propaganda: that the Kim leadership is exceptional in every way.""
There would be no sense he was contradicting the official virus guidance, she added: ""North Koreans know that he is in an altogether different league.""
Koh Yu-hwan, a professor of North Korean studies at Dongguk University, said an image of Kim wearing a mask could risk ""undermining his charisma... as if he is some sort of a coward, afraid of catching the virus for his own sake. 
""They aimed to project an image of Kim impervious to the coronavirus as the leader of the Paektu bloodline.""
The ""Paektu bloodline"" is a term for the Kim family who have ruled the North for three generations.
It references the sacred mountain seen as the spiritual birthplace of the Korean people, where the North's founder Kim Il Sung is said to have fought Japanese occupiers during World War II.
Kim was twice last year pictured riding a white horse up Mount Paektu in what was seen as a symbolic appropriation of his grandfather's leadership image.
The North often plays up physical and other similarities between the two men, and the fur hat Kim has been wearing in recent photos recalls old images of Kim Il Sung, including one reproduced on a stamp in 2013.
""It looks like he is going for his grandpa's fashion again,"" said Lee.

A senior Australian politician tested positive for the new coronavirus and entered hospital quarantine Friday, days after returning from Washington where he met Ivanka Trump and US Attorney General William Barr. 
Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton was in the United States last week for a meeting with members of the FiveEyes intelligence alliance -- Australia, the United States, Britain, Canada and New Zealand -- that included Barr. 
He also met with US President Donald Trump's daughter Ivanka on March 6, according to a photo posted by the Australian embassy in Washington, which shows the pair standing close together. 
It is not yet known when Dutton contracted the virus.
""This morning I woke up with a temperature and sore throat,"" said Dutton, an influential member of the government and a key architect of Australia's controversial immigration laws.
""It is the policy of Queensland Health that anyone who tests positive is to be admitted into hospital and I have complied with their advice.""
Dutton said he feels ""fine"" but his diagnosis will raise concerns about whether other members of the cabinet and Prime Minister Scott Morrison may have been infected.
The prime minister's office confirmed Friday that Dutton attended a cabinet meeting on Tuesday, but other participants would not be quarantined.
""Only people who had close contact with the minister in the preceding 24 hours before he became symptomatic need to self-isolate,"" a spokesman said.
""That does not include the Prime Minister or any other members of the Cabinet.""
In contrast, New Zealand Internal Affairs Minister Tracey Martin -- who also met Dutton in Washington -- has self-isolated and will get tested for the virus on Saturday, local media reported.
Morrison will no longer attend a rugby match on Saturday night after earlier saying he would even as he announced a bar on gatherings of more than 500 people.
Dutton is among 184 people in Australia who have been confirmed as having COVID-19.
He is just the latest in a string of political figures around the world to suffer a scare.
Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro has been tested for the virus after a top aide was diagnosed with the disease following a trip to the US during which both met with Trump. 
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is in quarantine for two weeks after his wife tested positive for the virus. 
British MP Nadine Dorries, a junior health minister who helped craft legislation to fight the contagion, is also infected.
Several US lawmakers have isolated themselves after attending a conservative conference in late February.
The White House has insisted Trump does not need testing, despite interactions with several people who have been exposed to the virus, saying ""only people with prolonged close exposure to confirmed positive cases should self-quarantine.""

MANILA - The Philippine government on Friday urged couples to consider postponing their weddings for at least a month as Metro Manila is set to undergo ""community quarantine"" to arrest the spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
This, after the government prohibited large gatherings, including social events such as weddings, and imposed stringent social distancing protocols in an effort to prevent new infections.
Though the Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF) on COVID-19 response has yet to release particular guidelines for weddings, Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles and Trade Secretary Ramon Lopez said couples should look at moving their event after April 15 or at least reduce the number of guests.
“Hindi ho mapipigilan ang pag-ibig. Bawasan na lang nila ‘yong guests… makakatipid pa sila,” Lopez said. 
(Love can't be stopped. They should reduce the number of guests... they could even save money.)
“An informal estimate would be 50 guests, but it really depends on the size of the room,” Nograles, meanwhile, said.
“Siyempre sa wedding, paano magki-kiss ang couple? Paano ang distansya ng couple? Ang daming adjustments na kailangang gawin,” the official continued.
(During the wedding, how will the couple kiss? What about their distance? There are a lot of adjustments that need to be done.) 
Lopez said that couples should expect to be refunded if they have already paid for their reservations at hotels and restaurants. 
If not, couples may file consumer complaints with the Department of Trade and Industry (DIT) through its hotline 1384. 
“Dapat ho may refund, kasi force majeure po ‘yon,” Lopez said.
(There should be a refund because this is force majeure.)

Brownlee had been announced to suit up for Alab as early as February 19, but missed two games due to personal reasons.
Since then, the regional league has rescheduled its play dates, and now ordered a pause in play because of the continued spread of the coronavirus.
With that, Jason Brickman, Lo Domingo, Miah Gray, and Jordan Heading are also flying out with Alab management wishing them a safe flight.

,Mar 13 2020,nCov,Athletes' Village in Tarlac disinfected after repatriates finish quarantine,ABS-CBN News,"



MANILA - Health workers on Friday deep-cleaned and sanitized the Athletes' Village in New Clark City in Tarlac province after hundreds of Filipino sailors from a coronavirus-afflicted cruise ship have completed their quarantine.
Clad in full protective gears, personnel from the Department of Health (DOH) in Central Luzon disinfected the rooms used by the 445 repatriates from MV Diamond Princess to stop the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
""We would like to assure everyone, especially those residing in the adjacent communities of New Clark City, that the Athletes’ Village has been thoroughly sanitized by the DOH,” Bases Conversion and Development Authority (BCDA) president and CEO Vince Dizon said in a statement.

2 repatriates at New Clark City test positive for COVID-19

The rooms of the 2 repatriates who tested positive for COVID-19 were also thoroughly disinfected. Tagged as patients 25 and 26 in the health department's tally of coronavirus cases, they have since been transferred to the hospital.
Amid reports of local transmissions in the country, the New Clark City will also remain on lockdown as a precautionary measure, Dizon added.

 
The Filipino sailors were flown out of Japan on Feb. 25, and were sent straight to the New Clark City for quarantine.
They already underwent a 14-day quarantine on the ship but were required to undergo another quarantine procedure.

Health Secretary Francisco Duque III had commended all health workers who took care of the repatriates.
""We commend the health workers who have been tirelessly caring for our repatriates for the past month. First, those from Wuhan, and now those from Japan. Their dedication to their work and their countrymen is truly inspiring,” he said in a statement.

NEXU Science Communication/Reuters


BEIJING - A Chinese government campaign to cast doubt on the origin of the coronavirus pandemic is fueling a row with the United States, with a Beijing official promoting conspiracy theories and Washington calling it the ""Wuhan virus.""
The spat comes as China tries to deflect blame for the contagion and reframe itself as a country that took decisive steps to buy the world time by placing huge swathes of its population under quarantine.
With cases falling in China and soaring abroad, Beijing is now rejecting the widely held assessment that the city of Wuhan is the birthplace of the outbreak.
Foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian went a step further on Thursday, saying on Twitter that ""it might be US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan"" -- without providing evidence.
He doubled down on his claim on Friday by posting a link to an article from a website known for publishing conspiracy theories about the 9/11 attacks.
Censors usually vigilant against rumors have also allowed Chinese social media users to spread similar claims about the US being behind the virus.
A video showing a US health official saying some flu victims were posthumously diagnosed as having had COVID-19 was among the top searched items on China's Twitter-like Weibo this week, with some users saying it was evidence the virus originated in the US.
Zhao posted the clip on Twitter.
Dali Yang, a political science professor at the University of Chicago, said he believes Zhao was ""tweeting in his official capacity.""
China's intention in promoting the conspiracy theory is ""to divert from domestic discontent"" over the handling of the outbreak, which has killed more than 3,100 people in the country.
SEAFOOD MARKET
The push to question the origin of the disease contradicts China's own initial assessment about the source of the virus, which has now killed nearly 5,000 people worldwide.
Gao Fu, head of China's Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said in January ""we now know the source of the virus is wild animals sold at the seafood market"" in Wuhan.
Chinese authorities themselves saw Wuhan and the rest of Hubei province as a threat as they placed the region of 56 million people under strict quarantine to contain the epidemic.
But Beijing began sowing doubts in late February, when Zhong Nanshan, a respected expert affiliated with the National Health Commission, told reporters ""the epidemic first appeared in China, but didn't necessarily originate in China.""
Scientists, however, have long suspected that the virus jumped from an animal at the Wuhan market to a human before spreading globally.
The World Health Organization has said that while the exact path the virus took between its animal source and humans is still unclear, COVID-19 was ""unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019"".
Christl Donnelly, a professor of statistical epidemiology at Imperial College London, said genetic analysis of coronavirus samples collected from around the world shows a common ancestor in China.
""This is not in any way blaming a particular country,"" she told AFP.
'WUHAN VIRUS'
The United States, meanwhile, has angered China by using language to directly link the virus to the country.
US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has called it the ""Wuhan virus,"" prompting China's foreign ministry to reject the term as ""despicable"" and ""disrespecting science.""
Despite the protests, US President Donald Trump started a televised address to his nation on Wednesday by speaking about the outbreak ""that started in China.""
The WHO warns against naming infectious diseases in a way that encourages discrimination against ethnic groups.
The Trump administration's emphasis on the virus' origin in China is ""part of his dog-whistling politics,"" said Australian National University researcher Yun Jiang.
Robert O'Brien, the US national security adviser, on Wednesday insisted that the virus originated in Wuhan.
Blaming the pandemic on an initial lack of cooperation from Chinese officials and a cover-up when the outbreak first emerged, O'Brien said this had ""cost the world community 2 months to respond"" to the threat.
Beijing called his remarks ""extremely immoral and also irresponsible.""
China's objections have extended to criticizing anyone suggesting the virus originated in the country.
Zhao said last week that journalists using the term ""China virus"" were ""suggesting its origin without any supporting facts or evidence"" and had ""ulterior motives.""
Jiang, the researcher, said that ""by sowing doubts into people's mind about where the virus originated, they're trying to deflect part of the blame for the outbreak.""

BEIJING - China's Wuhan city, ground zero of the new coronavirus outbreak, reported 5 new cases on Friday, the second day in a row the tally has been less than 10, while no locally transmitted infections were reported in the rest of the country.
Wuhan, capital of central Hubei province, recorded the 5 new confirmed cases on Thursday, the National Health Commission said, down from 8 cases the previous day.
The commission said on Thursday China's coronavirus epidemic had passed its peak, even as alarm over the virus intensified elsewhere with global markets suffering record falls and governments unveiling measures to try to slow the spread of a disease that has infected more than 127,000 people worldwide.
As China's new infections have tailed off, its concern has turned to imported cases.
Shanghai reported 2 new cases, while Beijing saw 1, all imported by people traveling to China from affected areas abroad, the health authority said.
Those cases brought the total number of new infections in mainland China to 8 on Thursday, down from 15 the previous day, and the lowest since the healthy authority started publishing nationwide figures in January.
To date, the total accumulated number of cases in mainland China is 80,813.
The death toll from the outbreak in mainland China reached 3,176 as of the end of Thursday, up by 7 from the previous day.
In Hubei province, there were 6 new deaths, with Wuhan accounting for all of them.

SEOUL - South Korea reported more recoveries from the coronavirus than new infections on Friday for the first time since its outbreak emerged in January, as a downward trend in daily cases raised hopes that Asia's biggest epidemic outside China may be slowing.
The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) recorded 110 new coronavirus cases on Friday compared with 114 a day earlier, taking the national tally to 7,979. In contrast, 177 patients were released from hospitals where they had been isolated for treatment.
This marks the first time that the daily number of recovered people exceeded that of new infections since South Korea's first patient was confirmed on Jan. 20.
The latest figures are in line with a downward trend in new cases, which has raised hopes that the outbreak may be easing in Asia's fourth-largest economy.
But officials urged vigilance after new clusters of infections emerged at a call center in a crowded part of capital Seoul, and a government agency in the administrative city of Sejong.
""We've managed to turn the corner, but there are concerns about overseas inflows, as well as possible infections at home around such facilities as call centers, computer cafes and karaoke rooms,"" Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun said at a meeting in Daegu.
Of the latest 110 cases, 61 were from the hard-hit southeastern city of Daegu where a fringe Christian church at the center of the epidemic is located, while 17 and 13 were in Sejong and Seoul, respectively.
At least 109 cases so far have been linked to the call center, operated by an insurance company whose 800-strong workforce is being tested or in quarantine for monitoring.
Seoul City plans to carry out extensive checks on some 10,500 computer cafes and karaoke bars as part of efforts to prevent the spread of the virus in crowded workplaces, Mayor Park Won-soon told a briefing.
Global alarm over the coronavirus intensified, with governments from Europe to the United States unveiling new measures aimed at slowing the spread of a disease that has infected almost 135,000 people worldwide.
South Korea said it will subject visitors from France, Germany, Britain, Spain and the Netherlands to reinforced border checks starting Sunday, after imposing similar rules for China, Italy and Iran suffering a major outbreak.

HONG KONG - A dog held in quarantine in Hong Kong on suspicion of having the coronavirus has tested negative, the government said late on Thursday, easing fears over the possibility of human-to-animal transmission.
The dog, which belongs to a patient who tested positive for COVID-19, will still need to be retested before being released.
The negative result does not mean the dog has not been infected with the virus, Hong Kong's Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) said.
""It is also not uncommon in the earlier stages of infections to have negative result as it often takes 14 days or more for measurable levels of antibodies to be detected,"" it said.
The dog had repeatedly tested ""weak positive"" since late February with low levels of the virus found its its nasal and oral cavity samples, prompting further tests to confirm if it had been infected or if the samples were due to environmental contamination.
The World Health Organization says there is no evidence so far that companion pets can be infected with the coronavirus.
Animal health experts examining the Hong Kong case have said pet owners should not be overly concerned and should not abandon their pets.
Hong Kong has around 131 confirmed cases of coronavirus with 3 fatalities so far.

LONDON/NEW YORK—The coronavirus pandemic shredded the global sporting calendar on Thursday, with men's tennis shut down for six weeks, top European soccer leagues placed on hold, NHL suspended and Major League Baseball's opening day postponed.
Speculation over whether the world's premier sporting events could go forward under the specter of coronavirus culminated in a series of unprecedented postponements and cancellations across the globe, as the sporting world faced an uncertain future.
Major League Baseball said it would delay its season's opening day by at least two weeks, while motor racing's blue-riband Formula One season has also been stalled with the opening Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne called off, according to multiple media reports.

Chelsea's players and coaching staff were ordered into isolation as Callum Hudson-Odoi became the first Premier League player confirmed to have the new coronavirus late on Thursday.
The news casts the viability of this weekend's games further into doubt after Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta tested positive, also throwing their team into lockdown.

Japanese government officials insisted Friday they have no plans to alter the Olympics, including holding it without spectators, after US President Donald Trump proposed a delay over the coronavirus.
The fate of the 2020 Games, scheduled to open in Tokyo on July 24, has been thrown into doubt by the outbreak of the virus, now dubbed a pandemic.
But organizers, Japanese government officials and the International Olympic Committee have insisted preparation for the Games is on track, with no expectations of a postponement or cancellation.
""There is no change in the government policy in that we closely cooperate with the IOC, the organizing committee, and the Tokyo metropolitan government to steadily prepare for holding the Games as scheduled,"" government spokesman Yoshihide Suga told reporters.
He said Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Trump had held a phone call to discuss the outbreak as well as the Olympics.
""In the telephone talks with President Trump, the prime minister mentioned our efforts toward holding the Games, and the president said he highly values Japan's efforts on transparency,"" Suga said.
He did not say whether Trump had repeated his suggestion, made a day earlier, that the Games might need to be delayed.
""I would say maybe they postpone it for a year,"" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Thursday.
""You know, I like that better than I like having empty stadiums all over the place. I think if you cancel it, make it a year later, that's a better alternative than doing it with no crowd,"" he said.
The suggestion was roundly dismissed by Japan's Olympic minister Seiko Hashimoto.
""I'm aware of President Trump's remarks but neither the IOC nor the organizing committee is thinking about delaying or cancelling the Games at all,"" she said at a regular briefing Friday.
Asked about the possibility of scaling back the number of spectators, Hashimoto said: ""We are not thinking about that at all.""
Suga also said the government ""doesn't envisage"" either a Games without spectators or the prospect of athletes withdrawing from the event.
IOC chief Thomas Bach told German television ARD on Thursday that the body would follow recommendations by the World Health Organization, but for now continues to work for a ""successful"" Games.
He acknowledged however that cancellations of Olympic qualifiers are starting to pose ""serious problems"".

NEW YORK, March 12 (Reuters) - NCAA has cancelled its 'March Madness' Division I men's and women's basketball tournaments, citing concern over the coronavirus pandemic which has hit sporting events across the world.
""This decision is based on the evolving COVID-19 public health threat, our ability to ensure the events do not contribute to spread of the pandemic, and the impracticality of hosting such events,"" the National Collegiate Athletic Association said in a written statement.
The NCAA said it would also cancel all remaining winter and spring championships.
March Madness, which attracts millions of viewers and advertising dollars, is among the most popular annual sporting events in North America, bringing together 68 men's and 64 women's teams in venues across the U.S.
The cancellation came amid media reports that two powerhouse programs - Duke University and Kansas University - would not participate in the tournament.
Broadcasters Turner Sports and CBS Sports said they were ""fully supportive of the NCAA's decision"" and would work closely with the athletics organization ""as we prioritize the health and well-being of everyone involved."" (Reporting by Amy Tennery; Editing by Ken Ferris)

The Premier League could be forced into lockdown after Arsenal's match at Brighton was postponed when Gunners manager Mikel Arteta contracted the coronavirus on Thursday.
Arsenal's training ground has been closed and their players and staff have gone into self-isolation following Arteta's shock positive test.
Less than an hour after Arsenal revealed Arteta's illness, Brighton announced that their scheduled clash at the Amex Stadium had been cancelled.
""It's absolutely essential the health and wellbeing of individuals takes priority and with that in mind Saturday's match has been postponed,"" Brighton chief executive Paul Barber said in a statement.
""We apologise to all fans for any inconvenience but trust everyone will understand that we are all facing an unprecedented situation.
""First and foremost our thoughts are with Mikel Arteta and we wish him a speedy recovery.""
The Premier League, who had earlier insisted all games would go ahead this weekend, responded by revealing they will hold an emergency meeting on Friday to discuss how to deal with the global pandemic's effect on their fixtures.
""In light of Arsenal's announcement tonight confirming that their first-team coach Mikel Arteta has tested positive for COVID-19, the Premier League will convene an emergency club meeting tomorrow morning regarding future fixtures,"" the Premier League said.
Arteta said: ""This is really disappointing but I took the test after feeling poorly. I will be at work as soon as I'm allowed.""
There are over 590 confirmed cases of the virus in Britain and 10 people have died from it so far.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson had said the government was ""considering the question of banning major public events such as sporting fixtures"", but was not ready to do so yet.
Now Arteta's illness could force the Premier League's hand and lead to the cancellation of matches this weekend and possibly into the future.
In Italy, the European country worst hit by the virus, Serie A has suspended matches until at least April 3 and Juventus defender Daniele Rugani has been quarantined.
UEFA, European football's governing body, will consider whether to postpone the Champions League and Euro 2020 at a meeting next week.
All French Ligue 1 matches will be behind closed doors until April 15.
The next two La Liga match days have been suspended and this weekend's Bundesliga fixtures are behind closed doors.
Arsenal's league match at Manchester City last Wednesday was postponed and several Gunners players went into self-isolation after Olympiakos and Nottingham Forest owner Evangelos Marinakis contracted the virus.
Marinakis, 52, met a number of Arsenal's players and staff when the Gunners faced Olympiakos in a Europa League tie in February.
- Health crisis -
Arsenal are not the only top-flight club affected by the virus.
Leicester, scheduled to play at Watford on Saturday, said on Thursday that three of their players have shown symptoms of the virus and are self-isolating as a precaution.
The Foxes said the unnamed trio had ""presented with extremely mild illness"" in recent days.
""We've had a few players that have shown symptoms and signs,"" Leicester manager Brendan Rodgers said.
""We've followed procedure and they have been kept away at this moment from the rest of the squad and then we'll see how that develops.""
Chelsea have also been touched by the health crisis, with players told to stay away from training after a member of staff reportedly complained of virus symptoms.
Thursday's training session was cancelled while their Cobham base was deep cleaned before Frank Lampard's side are due to travel to Aston Villa on Saturday.
Manchester City said one unnamed member of their squad, reportedly France defender Benjamin Mendy, is in self-isolation after a family member suffered a respiratory illness.
The relative is being treated in hospital and has undergone tests for the coronavirus, which can cause shortness of breath.
City's Champions League last 16 second leg meeting with Real Madrid, set for Tuesday, has been postponed after one of the Spanish club's basketball players tested positive for the virus.
If the Premier League does decide to play on, Liverpool could be crowned champions on Monday.
If second placed City lose to Burnley, then Liverpool will win the title for the first time in 30 years if they beat Everton in the Merseyside derby at Goodison Park.
Liverpool have lost four of their last six games in all competitions and crashed out of the Champions League on Wednesday.
Now they must wait to discover if they will be allowed to return to action any time soon.

,Mar 13 2020,nCov,"NBA: Coronavirus shutdown likely to be 'at least 30 days,' commissioner says",Agence France-Presse,"

NBA commissioner Adam Silver said Thursday the league shut-down because of the coronavirus pandemic is likely to last ""at least 30 days"".
That would see the league shuttered through what would have been about the last month of its regular season.
""What we determined today is that this hiatus will be, most likely, at least 30 days,"" Silver said on TNT's “Inside The NBA"" program.
The NBA suspended play on Wednesday after Utah Jazz center Rudy Gobert tested positive for COVID-19.
A second Jazz player, Donovan Mitchell, has reportedly also tested positive.
The regular season was scheduled to end on April 15 with the playoffs to begin on April 18.
Silver offered no indication of whether the league was considering shortening either the regular season or the playoffs, and indeed said it was hard to know at this point what the options might be.
Once the 30 days is up, he said, ""the question becomes is there a protocol, frankly, with or without fans, where we can resume play.""
Silver discussed the talks league officials, teams and players union representatives were having before Gobert's positive test about contingency plans in the face of increased coronavirus incidence in the United States.
""Up to a few days ago or even yesterday, the experts were unclear as to whether, as a public health matter, NBA arenas should be emptied,"" he said.
On Wednesday league officials spoke with teams to get their views about the possibility of playing games with no fans in the stands or taking ""some kind of hiatus.""
The decision ended up coming in dramatic style after Utah's game against the Thunder in Oklahoma City was called off just as it was due to start and fans cleared from the arena.
Shortly thereafter the NBA announced that a Jazz player had tested positive for COVID-19 and that games would be suspended from Thursday.
For the time being NBA players have reportedly been told to remain in their team's cities at least through Monday.
Group workouts and practice are not allowed, but team medical staff are in touch with players.
- Economic impact -
Joe Lacob, the Golden State Warriors owner who has a masters degree from the University of California at Los Angeles in public health said in an interview with The Athletic that the eventual economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the league is ""monumental.""
""We just lost virtually all of our revenues for the foreseeable future,"" Lacob said. ""But we have huge expenses that aren't going away. I feel for these part-time employees and local restaurants and Uber drivers and all of the service people that make their living in and around events like ours.
""So many small businesses in the city of San Francisco will be impacted by this series of events.""
While that is undoubtedly true, Silver said that in further talks among owners on Thursday ""not one team raised (the issue of) money.
""The entire discussion was about the safety and health of the players, the community around the NBA and our fans.""
What the league is trying to determine now he said, is ""what makes sense here, without compromising anyone's safety.
""I think it's too early to tell.""

,Mar 12 2020,nCov,Duterte’s foreign trips suspended due to COVID-19 threat: PSG,"Arianne Merez, ABS-CBN News","



MANILA - President Rodrigo Duterte’s foreign trips have been suspended as precautionary measure against the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the Presidential Security Group announced Thursday.
The suspension was based on the recommendation of the Department of Health (DOH), the PSG said on its Facebook page.
“For now, all of [President Duterte’s] foreign travels, especially to those countries with confirmed cases of COVID-19, have been suspended as recommended by the DOH,” it said.
Among the trips that could be affected by the suspension is the President’s supposed participation in the ASEAN Summit in Vietnam next month. 
Vietnam has 35 confirmed cases of COVID-19, latest data from the World Health Organization (WHO) showed.
Earlier, PSG troopers along with personnel of the PSG Station Hospital conducted the disinfection and decontamination of the Presidential palace halls as precautionary measure against the virus.

,Mar 12 2020,nCov,Robredo pushes for work-from-home amid COVID-19 spread,ABS-CBN News,"



MANILA (2nd UPDATE) - Vice President Leni Robredo on Thursday called on government to adopt work-from-home arrangements as cases of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the Philippines continued to rise.
""Sinabi na ng World Health Organization: May mga katangian ng isang pandemic ang pandaigdigang sitwasyon. Ibig sabihin, kumalat na ang virus sa iba’t ibang bansa,"" she said in a video that aired on her official Facebook page.
(The World Health Organization has characterized the situation as a global pandemic. This means the virus has spread in different countries.)
""Sa pagkakataong ito, kailangan kong idiin: Panahon nang ipatupad ang areglong work-from-home. Huwag na nating ipilit pumasok pa sa opisina ang ating mga empleyado, maliban na lang ang mga nakatutok sa pagpapaabot ng kaukulang serbisyo na maaaring umampat sa pagkalat ng virus,"" she added.
(At this point, I have to emphasize: It's time to implement the work-from-home arrangement. Let us not force workers to go to offices, except for those in the front-lines of response to the outbreak.)
If business operations must continue, Robredo suggests skeletal staffing to minimize person-to-person contact.
To stop the spread of the deadly virus, which has so far claimed nearly 4,300 lives worldwide, ""social distancing"" or avoiding public places and staying several feet away from other people must be practiced.
In her public address, the Vice President also urged the government to fast-track the procurement of testing kits that would help diagnose COVID-19 cases.
Front-line agencies must also offer aid to those affected by the pandemic and implement preventive measures in case the infection worsens, she said.
Robredo also called for calm and cautioned against panic-buying and hoarding amid contagion fears. Those exhibiting flu-like symptoms must observe self-quarantine while those exposed to possible carriers of the strain must seek medical care.
PROTECT THE VULNERABLE
As the novel coronavirus continues to spread, the Vice President stressed that the poor would be the most vulnerable against COVID-19.
""Alam po natin: Marami sa ating mga kababayan ang walang sapat na salapi para magpatingin sa mga pribadong ospital. Sa harap nito, dapat na ring tukuyin, italaga, at ipaalam sa publiko ang mga pampublikong ospital na kakayaning tumanggap ng mga may malalang sintomas,"" she said.
(We know that many of our fellow Filipinos don't have the financial resources to go to private hospitals. The government must identify and inform the public on what hospitals are allowed to accept patients suffering from symptoms.)
After reports swirled that a planned lockdown is being proposed in Metro Manila, Robredo believed it would only be effective if there is enough provision in communities, especially for the poor.
The Vice President also said she believed the Philippines, which is prone to calamities and crises, would be able to overcome.
""Mas malakas pa rin ang Pilipino sa COVID-19; kayang daigin ng ating pagkakaisa ang suliraning ito. Pilipino tayo, at sama-sama nating malalagpasan ito,"" she said.
(The Filipino people are stronger than COVID-19. We can overcome this if we stand together as one. We are Filipinos and we will surpass this together.)
As of Thursday, the Philippines has recorded 52 cases of COVID-19, which include 2 deaths.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared a global pandemic as the disease has infected more than 118,000 and killed nearly 4,300 in 114 countries and territories.

SAN FRANCISCO - Twitter has ordered all staff globally to work from home in an effort to stop the spread of the deadly new coronavirus epidemic.
The outbreak has spread across the world since emerging in central China late last year, killing more than 4,600 people, infecting over 126,000 and prompting a wave of travel restrictions. 
The social media platform had already announced a mandatory work from home policy for its staff in South Korea, Hong Kong and Japan earlier this month and suspended ""non-critical"" business travel and events in February.
""We are moving beyond our earlier guidance... and have now informed all employees globally they must work from home,"" Twitter human resources chief Jennifer Christie said in a blog post late Wednesday.

BANGKOK - Thai officials played down the possibility of ""super spreading"" of the coronavirus on Thursday as they reported a group of friends were responsible for the biggest daily rise in the country's cases since the outbreak began.
Officials reported 11 new cases, taking the national tally to 70. One person has died.
The new patients are a group of friends who appeared to pass the virus to each other after one of their number was first infected by a tourist who has since returned to Hong Kong, officials said.
The male and female friends, all Thai nationals aged in their 20s and 30s, socialized and shared drinks and cigarettes on 2 occasions in late February.
""The first patient was infected from a tourist from a dangerous communicable disease area,"" Suwannachai Wattanayingcharoenchai, director-general of the Disease Control Department, told reporters. ""After that, the person had 2 social activities with close friends.""
Officials stressed the foreign source of the group infection and announced they were stepping up travel restrictions for visitors from a list of ""designated dangerous communicable disease areas"" announced last week. Those include South Korea, China, Macau, Hong Kong, Italy and Iran.
""Visitors from the 6 places will need to present medical certificates before they can obtain boarding passes. They must be prepared for a full state quarantine when they arrive,"" said Sukhum Kanchanapimai, the health ministry's permanent secretary.
It was not immediately clear where the state quarantine will take place or when it will begin.

Dr. Raul Destura presents a sample of the locally-developed COVID-19 test kit from the UP-National Institutes of Health during a press briefing on COVID-19 at the Philippine Genome Center in Quezon City on Thursday.


MANILA - A test kit developed by Filipino scientists for the detection of the new strain of coronavirus will have to undergo field validation first before it is allowed for commercial use, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said Thursday.
Around 500 tests using the SARS CoV-2 PCR detection kit developed by the University of the Philippines-National Institutes of Health (UP-NIH) will have to be conducted to ensure its safety and efficacy, said FDA director general Eric Domingo.
To monitor the quality of the results, a parallel test using the gene sequencing technology at the Philippine Genome Center will also be conducted, he added.

UP-developed coronavirus testing kit gets gov't green light

The state regulator earlier issued a certificate of exemption to the test kit, also funded by the Department of Science and Technology (DOST), for field testing due to the increasing cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
""Hindi pa aprubado for commercial use. Hindi pa po ito puwede ibenta sa mga private laboratories,"" Domingo told radio DZMM.
(It's not yet approved for commercial use. It's not yet allowed to be sold to private laboratories.)
If results from the test kit will be satisfactory, it can apply for a certificate of product registration for wide distribution, he said.
The World Health Organization (WHO) can validate the efficacy of the test kits, but it will take some 3 months.
But Domingo said, ""Hindi naman requirement ng ating bansa ang validation from the WHO... Kung 'yun ang hihintayin natin, walang makakapasok na test kit sa atin.""
(The WHO validation is not required in our country... If we will wait for it, no test kit can come in.)

Dr. Raul Destura of the UP-NHI's Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology said the test kit could release results in less than 2 hours using a ""multiplex technology,"" which simultaneously detects the strain of coronavirus and its specificity.
He said they developed the test kit for several few weeks after China, where the outbreak originated, released the full sequence of the novel coronavirus.
""It took us around 21 days to put the entire assay, and several weeks for revalidation sa laboratory performance as required by the WHO,"" the infectious disease specialist told radio DZMM in a separate interview.
Destura, also president and chief executive officer of private research firm Manila Healthtek, Inc., said the test kits could be rolled out to the public in the next few weeks if approved by FDA.
The analytical specificity of the test kit, which refers to its ability to identify specific substance, is 100 percent, he said.

The Philippines has recorded, as of Wednesday afternoon, 49 positive cases of COVID-19, from a new strain of coronavirus that started in Wuhan City, China.

PHILHEALTH COVID-19 PACKAGES
The state health insurance agency is also offering ""isolation package"" and ""referral package"" for its members and dependents with possible symptoms of the coronavirus.
Dr. Shirley Domingo, vice president of PhilHealth's Corporate Affairs Group, said patients placed under observation for suspected coronavirus or those under ""isolation package"" are entitled to P14,000.
Those referred to hospitals capable of performing quarantine procedures and manage infectious diseases or those under ""referral package"" are entitled to P4,000.
Meanwhile, patients exhibiting moderate pneumonia due to COVID-19 are entitled to P15,000 while those with severe pneumonia are entitled to P32,000, Domingo added.
Covered by the package are those admitted starting Jan. 31.
The No Balance Billing (NBB) policy, which enables the vulnerable sectors of the program such as the poor and the elderly to pay no more in excess of their PhilHealth coverage when confined in government facilities, will be applied to COVID-19 claims.
COVID-19 may be fatal for the elderly, the immunocompromised, and those with underlying medical condition but 80 percent of cases globally showed a high chance of recovery ""without needing special treatment,"" according to the World Health Organization. 
WHO said COVID-19 symptoms include fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. The new respiratory disease has left 3,800 dead and affected 110,000 worldwide. 
PhilHealth urged the public to exercise frequent handwashing and other hygienic measures.

MANILA (UPDATE) - Marikina City has 4 new confirmed cases of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), Mayor Marcelino Teodoro said Wednesday.
The patients are part of the country's 33 positive cases of the fast-spreading disease announced by health authorities on Tuesday.

Teodoro said the patients were infected by an 86-year-old American citizen, the country's 9th case of COVID-19.
Among those sickened is the American's 82-year-old wife and his 2 relatives, both 69. They were diagnosed with the disease on March 10.
The American citizen, a Filipino who served in the US military, returned from San Diego, California on Feb. 19 but had a layover in South Korea.
He then exhibited symptoms of pneumonia, including cough and shortness of breath, and was hospitalized on March 6. He tested positive of COVID-19 on March 9.
He is currently in critical condition due to his advanced age, Teodoro said.
""We suspect he's already infected with the disease while returning to the Philippines,"" the mayor added.
Four other household members, who are asymptomatic, are currently quarantined in their home in Marikina.
As authorities scramble to arrest the spread of the virus, Marikina City is mulling creating a quarantine facility with the supervision of the Department of Health (DOH), Teodoro said.
Those suspected of carrying the new strain of the coronavirus can only be confined at the Amang Rodriguez Memorial Medical Center, the city's only medical facility with isolation area.
The city government also plans to procure testing kits and continue disinfecting public places, such as terminals and shopping malls, Teodoro added.

Palarong Pambansa postponed due to COVID-19 threat

Public activities, such as the Palarong Pambansa 2020, are also postponed due to the COVID-19 epidemic.
Government employees and residents are also restricted from traveling to coronavirus-affected countries, such as China, South Korea and Italy.

Major American universities -- including Harvard, Princeton and Columbia -- have been forced to cancel classes because of the coronavirus and move lessons online, affecting tens of thousands of students.
The US government has refrained from imposing an official ban so the often privately run institutions are each grappling with how best to deal with the fast-moving outbreak.
Ahead of the start of spring break at the end of this week, Harvard on Tuesday announced it would transition to having all classes online by Monday 23 March.
The university, located in Cambridge, Massachusetts, asked its 36,000 graduate and undergraduate students not to return to campus after the spring recess and to continue studying remotely ""until further notice.""
""The goal of these changes is to minimize the need to gather in large groups,"" Harvard president Lawrence Bacow said in a statement posted on the university's website.
Without going quite so far, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), also based in Cambridge, canceled all gatherings likely to attract at least 150 people until May 15.
Classes with 150 or more students will move online, starting this week, it added.
In New York, Columbia, New York University and Fordham have all announced that they are switching to remote learning.
Princeton University in New Jersey said it would move all lectures and seminars online from March 23 to at least April 5, as it cancelled events of more than 100 people.
On the other side of the country, in California, at least five universities, including Berkeley and Stanford, have suspended all or most of their in-person classes.
A spokesperson for the American Council of Education (ACE) said it was ""impossible to say"" how many schools and students had been affected because ""the situation changes all the time.""
ACE president Ted Mitchell told the Los Angeles Times the coronavirus was ""probably the greatest short-term challenge facing higher education in a generation.""
