,"February 25, 2020",nCov,"SKorea ‘very grave’, Moon says as coronavirus cases approach 1,000",THE MANILA TIMES,"SEOUL: The novel coronavirus outbreak in South Korea is “very grave,” President Moon Jae-in said on Tuesday as he visited its epicenter and the country’s total number of cases approached 1,000. The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) confirmed 144 new infections, taking the tally to 977, the largest national total anywhere outside China, where the virus first emerged. Scores of events have been canceled or postponed as the outbreak has spread in the world’s 12th-largest economy, from K-pop concerts to the start of the K-league football season, with casualties on Tuesday including parliamentary sessions and the World Team Table Tennis championships. More than 80 percent of the infections have been in South Korea’s fourth-largest city Daegu and neighboring North Gyeongsang province. “The situation is very grave,” President Moon Jae-in said on a visit to Daegu, wearing the uniform of a government emergency official and vowing full government support. “We will achieve a victory in the fight against this virus,” he added.

(Photo by Jung Yeon-je / AFP) The streets of Daegu — which has a population of 2.5 million — have been largely deserted for days, apart from long queues at the few shops with masks for sale. Authorities urged the public to exercise extra caution, advising citizens to stay home if they have a fever or respiratory symptoms. South Korea’s parliament canceled sessions Tuesday as it closed for cleaning after confirmation a person with the coronavirus had attended a meeting last week. The country’s flag carrier Korean Air also reported a cabin crew member had tested positive, without giving details. The staffer may have been infected by a group of South Korean pilgrims who flew to Israel, reports said, adding that the attendant subsequently flew from Incheon to Los Angeles and back last week. And the US hinted at scaling back joint military exercises, with Defense Secretary Mark Esper telling reporters in Washington the two allies’ militaries were “looking at scaling back the command post training due to concerns about the coronavirus.” The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advised travelers to “avoid all nonessential travel” to South Korea. Hong Kong has said it will not allow arrivals from South Korea other than returning residents, while a Mongolian ban on flights to and from the South came into force Tuesday. Organizers of the World Team Table Tennis championship, due to be held in Busan in March, said new dates in June had been “provisionally reserved.” The Korean Basketball League said it would hold matches behind closed doors “until the situation improves.” Government list Three more people had died, the KCDC said, taking the toll to 10. But the case numbers it announced represented the smallest daily increase for four days.

Most of the country’s infections are linked to the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, an entity often accused of being a cult. A 61-year-old female member developed a fever on February 10, but attended at least four church services in Daegu before being diagnosed. KCDC director Jung Eun-kyeong advised Shincheonji followers to refrain from going outside “as much as possible.” With public criticism growing, Shincheonji’s founder Lee Man-hee said the group would provide the government a list of all its members to have them tested for the virus. AFP AFP/CC   "
,"February 25, 2020",nCov,White House unveils $2.5B emergency coronavirus plan,THE MANILA TIMES,"WASHINGTON, D.C.: The White House on Monday sent lawmakers an urgent $2.5 billion plan to address the deadly coronavirus outbreak, whose rapid spread and threat to the global economy rocked financial markets. The White House budget office said the funds are for vaccines, treatment and protective equipment. The request was immediately slammed by Democrats as insufficient and came as coronavirus fears were credited with Monday’s 1,000-plus point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and are increasingly seen as a potential political threat to President Donald Trump. The request was released Monday evening and came as key government accounts were running low. The Department of Health and Human Services had already tapped into an emergency infectious disease rapid response fund and was seeking to transfer more than $130 million from other HHS accounts to combat the virus but is pressing for more. “Today, the Administration is transmitting to Congress a $2.5 billion supplemental funding plan to accelerate vaccine development, support preparedness and response activities and to procure much needed equipment and supplies,” said White House budget office spokeswoman Rachel Semmel. “We are also freeing up existing resources and allowing for greater flexibilities for response activities.” The administration is requesting $1.25 billion in new funding and wants to transfer $535 million more in funding from an Ebola preparedness account that’s been a top priority of Democrats. It anticipates shifting money from other HHS accounts and other agencies to complete the $2.5 billion response plan. Senators returning to Washington after a weeklong recess will receive a classified briefing Tuesday morning on the government’s coronavirus response, a Senate aide said. A spokeswoman for Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard Shelby said the panel “will take their input into account as we continue to do our due diligence to determine what additional resources are necessary.” Democrats said the request is insufficient and said Trump’s attempt to go after existing Ebola prevention funding is dead on arrival. “All of the warning lights are flashing bright red. We are staring down a potential pandemic and the administration has no plan,” said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who blasted a shortage of kits to test for the virus and President Donald Trump’s proposed budget cuts to health agencies like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “We have a crisis of coronavirus and President Trump has no plan, no urgency, no understanding of the facts or how to coordinate a response.” Trump was a vocal critic of President Barack Obama’s response to the 2014 Ebola scare, which barely touched the US but was seen as a factor in that year’s midterm elections, which restored control of the Senate to Republicans. Trump took to Twitter Monday to defend his record. “The Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA. We are in contact with everyone and all relevant countries. CDC & World Health have been working hard and very smart. Stock Market starting to look very good to me!” he tweeted. Among the needs is funding to reimburse the Pentagon, which is housing evacuees from China — who are required to undergo 14-day quarantines — at several military bases in California. Democrats controlling the House wrote HHS Secretary Alex Azar earlier this month to request funds to help speed development of a coronavirus vaccine, expand laboratory capacity, and beef up screening efforts at US entry points. House Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Nita Lowey, called the plan “woefully insufficient.” “Despite urgent warnings from Congress and the public health community, the Trump administration took weeks to request these emergency funds,” Lowey said in a statement. “Their answer now is to raid money Congress has designated for other critical public health priorities.” Azar is slated to testify before the Senate Appropriations Committee on Tuesday, and the US response to the outbreak is sure to be a major topic. The quickly spreading virus has slammed the economy of China, where the virus originated, and caseloads are rapidly increasing in countries such as South Korea, Iran, and Italy. Almost 80,000 people have contracted the disease, with more than 2,500 deaths, mostly in China. The United States, however, has had only 14 cases of the disease spread across seven states. In San Francisco, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi took a walking tour of Chinatown on Monday to let the public know the neighborhood is safe and open for business. Pelosi, a Democrat who represents the heavily Chinese American city, visited the Golden Gate Fortune Cookie Factory, whose owner Kevin Chan, says his business and others are down 70% since the outbreak of the coronavirus. “Çome to Chinatown,” Pelosi said. “Precautions have been taken by our city, we know that there’s concern about tourism, traveling all throughout the world, but we think it’s very safe to be in Chinatown and hope that others will come.” Asked about the Trump administration’s looming request, Pelosi said she would want to know how the money would be used.

,"February 25, 2020",nCov,US and SKorea may cut back military moves due to coronavirus,THE MANILA TIMES,"WASHINGTON, D.C.: The United States and South Korea are considering curtailing joint military exercises due to concerns about the spread of coronavirus, officials said Monday. After a meeting at the Pentagon to review a full range of issues, including a standoff over US demands that Seoul pay a much bigger share of the cost of hosting American forces, Defense Secretary Mark Esper and South Korean Defense Minister Jeong Kyeong-doo told reporters that coronavirus is a threat to their schedule of military exercises. The exercises are held periodically throughout the year and are intended to prepare troops and commanders for potential combat against North Korea. Esper said the top South Korean and American commanders in Seoul “are looking at scaling back” some training exercises “due to concerns about the coronavirus.” He added that he is confident that commanders will find a way to protect troops while also ensuring that both countries “remain fully ready to deal with any threats that we might face together.” Jeong said the coronavirus situation in his country is “quite serious” and has compelled authorities to limit the movement of troops, which makes it more difficult to conduct exercises with American forces. He said there have been 13 confirmed coronavirus cases in the South Korean military. “Because movement has been limited between units, the situation is limited,” he said through an interpreter. South Korea has the second-largest number of cases in the world with 893 and has had a near 15-fold increase in reported infections in a week. In their remarks to reporters, Esper and Jeong left no doubt that their governments are stuck in a difficult standoff over the US demand for an unusually large increase in South Korea’s share of the cost of maintaining US forces on the peninsula. Negotiations have reached a standstill. Jeong said a US threat to furlough Korean workers who support US forces is “a very difficult pill to swallow.” Over the years, the amount that Seoul pays for the presence of about 28,000 US troops has varied, and most recently it was almost $1 billion. But the latest agreement between the two countries expired at the end of last year, and a new pact has not been approved.

AP PHOTO According to the Pentagon, the US has so far been paying the salary costs of the Korean National workforce. But the US funds will run out at the end of March unless the Korean government agrees to pay much more. If no agreement is reached, Esper said, the US will furlough most Korean employees on April 1 and would also suspend some construction and other activities. News reports have said the Trump administration is demanding a five-fold increase in South Korean contributions, to about $4.7 billion for 2020, but officials have not publicly confirmed the specifics. Esper said that South Korea is a “global economic powerhouse” and should contribute more to the cost of having American forces on the peninsula. Jeong said that South Korea increased its contribution by 8.2 percent last year and is considering a higher increase this year. The so-called Special Measures Agreement helps to offset the significant cost of stationing US forces., which have operated there since the Korean War, which lasted from 1950 to 1953. Contributions are divided across three categories: Korean National labor, South Korean-funded construction, and logistics, with the vast majority of South Korean contributions going back into its economy.

,"February 25, 2020",nCov,China: Waging a two-front war on coronavirus and the economy,Frank Ching,"Frank Ching GENERATIONS of journalism students have been told that if a plane crashes, it’s news. If it doesn’t crash, it’s not news. Hence, news tends to be bad news. It isn’t surprising, therefore, that in reporting on the coronavirus currently afflicting China, attention is focused on the number of new infections and deaths every day. Hence, it came as something of a surprise when, on February 6 at the Chinese Foreign Ministry’s daily press briefing, spokesman Hua Chunying before taking questions said there was information from the National Health Commission that she wished to share. During the 24 hours of February 5, she announced, 261 patients had been cured and discharged, while there had been 73 fatalities. Newly confirmed cases, excluding Hubei, the disease’s epicenter, “declined for a second day starting from February 4.” It was a daring move, based on China’s interpretation of the direction in which the fight against the virus was moving. But it was not without reason. The previous day, President Xi Jinping met with Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen and informed the visitor that China’s “most thorough and rigorous measures” to fight the outbreak were “producing results.” President Xi has exuded confidence in this battle against the virus from the beginning. At his meeting with World Health Organization Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on January 28, he let it be known that he was personally in charge of the campaign against the “devil” virus. He showed how an authoritarian government could marshal resources in this battle, without having to answer annoying questions from media or legislators. Since February 5, the Foreign Ministry each day began its briefing with a good-news report. And the figures continued to bear out the official optimism. After 10 days, it seemed evident that the virus was slowly but surely coming under control. But a number of events last week demonstrated that the virus wasn’t that easily conquered and was, in fact, a real devil. On Monday, February 17, the state news agency Xinhua made it known that the annual parliamentary meeting scheduled for March was likely to be postponed. The meeting is normally held alongside the annual meeting of the nation’s top advisory body, each attended by thousands of delegates. These meetings have not been postponed in 25 years. In a way, it makes sense to postpone what is generally called the “two sessions.” After all, in 2003, when another virus lurked in China, the meetings went ahead with deadly consequences. Thousands of delegates from around the country descended on Beijing, bringing with them the severe acute respiratory syndrome virus. The capital, then, became seriously infected. Clearly, China doesn’t want this to happen again. On Wednesday, Xi convened a meeting of the Politburo Standing Committee, a seven-man body at the apex of the Communist Party, which listened to reports on the campaign against the epidemic and studied the coordination of epidemic prevention and economic development. After studying “relevant opinions,” it decided to refer the matter to the full 25-member Politburo. The decisive Politburo meeting, again presided over by Xi, was held two days late on February 21. At that meeting, the Politburo decided that “a turning point in the development of the national epidemic situation has not yet arrived,” meaning the epidemic had not yet reached its peak. This was no doubt disappointing, but probably realistic, in view of outbreaks in hospitals in Beijing and clusters of infections in at least four prisons across three provinces. A release issued after the meeting also highlighted “all-out epidemic control efforts in Beijing,” suggesting serious misgivings over the situation in the capital. On Sunday, Xi delivered a major speech in which he called the current coronavirus a threat the country’s “biggest public health emergency” in 70 years. He made it clear that fighting the virus alone was not enough because of the simultaneous need to advance on the economic front, after a month in which much of the economy had been locked down. Calling the situation a crisis, Xi acknowledged shortcomings in the party’s response, but still voiced confidence in eventual triumph, though he said there would be “a considerable impact on the Chinese economy and society.” So, China today is waging a two-front war. On one hand, it can’t let its guard down where the virus is concerned. On the other, it has to revive its economy, the basis for its global influence. The stakes are high. The global audience is, in effect, viewing an epic battle in which China is battling two foes at the same time, but cannot afford to lose either struggle. The final outcome will be big news indeed.

,"February 25, 2020",nCov,Lazio on Juve’s heels as coronavirus fears rise,Agence France-Presse,"MILAN: Lazio kept their bid for a first Serie A title in 20 years on track as they stayed one point behind leaders Juventus with a 3-2 win at Genoa on Sunday (Monday in Manila), but four Serie A matches were postponed amid growing coronavirus fears in northern Italy. Reigning champions Juve had edged out bottom club SPAL 2-1 on Saturday, but Lazio responded to keep the pressure on at the top, extending their unbeaten run in the league to 20 games in the north-western port city. Third-placed Inter Milan, who are six points behind Juve, saw their game on Sunday at the San Siro against Sampdoria postponed, with Thursday’s Europa League match against Bulgarian club Ludogorets at risk, along with next weekend’s league clash with Juventus in Turin. Three other top-flight matches were also pushed back — between Torino and Parma, Atalanta versus Sassuolo and Hellas Verona against Cagliari. Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte announced late on Saturday that all sporting events in two northern regions would be suspended on Sunday. Strong measures are being taken in Italy with over 152 confirmed cases of coronavirus in an outbreak that has claimed three lives in the country. “I think it’s right to take the necessary precautions,” said Lazio coach Simone Inzaghi. “Do a lot of prevention, try to defeat and understand the problem by stopping the championship, because we shouldn’t underestimate what is happening.” On the pitch in Genoa, Adam Marusic scored the opener for Lazio with less than two minutes on the clock before Ciro Immobile, the top flight’s leading scorer this season, netted his 27th Serie A goal of the campaign six minutes into the second half. The Italian striker pulled six goals clear of Juventus star Cristiano Ronaldo who scored for a record-equalling 11th consecutive Serie A game in his 1,000th professional match against SPAL. Francesco Cassata pulled one back for the relegation-threatened hosts, but Danilo Cataldi secured Lazio all three points despite Domenico Criscito’s late consolation. AFP "
,"February 24, 2020",nCov,G20 gathering weighs coronavirus threat,Agence France-Presse,"RIYADH: The deadly coronavirus epidemic will dent global growth, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) warned on Saturday, as Group of 20 (G20) finance ministers and central bank governors weighed its economic ripple effects at a two-day gathering in Riyadh. The coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) outbreak will shave about 0.1 percentage point from global growth and constrain China’s growth to 5.6 percent this year, IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva told luminaries from the leading 20 economies in the Saudi capital. The gathering comes amid growing alarm over the new virus as Chinese authorities lock down millions of people to prevent its spread, with major knock-on effects economically. Riyadh: Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund Kristalina Georgieva arrives for a Welcome Dinner at the Murabba Palace in Riyadh on February 22, 2020 during the G20 finance ministers and central bank governors meeting. AFP PHOTO The virus has now claimed 2,345 lives in China, cutting off transportation, disrupting trade and fanning investor alarm as businesses are forced to close their doors. “Global growth would be about 0.1 percentage points lower,” Georgieva said. “But we are also looking at more dire scenarios where the spread of the virus continues for longer and more globally, and the growth consequences are more protracted,” she added. At the meeting in Saudi Arabia, the first Arab nation to hold the G20 presidency, financial leaders also discussed money laundering, digital currencies and ways to achieve a global taxation system for the digital era. But at the core of the discussions was an action plan to shield the world economy — already facing a slowdown — from the impact of the outbreak, said French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire. “The question remains open: whether it will be a V-shape with a quick recovery of the world economy or whether it would lead to a L-shape with a persistent slowdown in world growth,” Le Maire told reporters. “This is the key question.” A senior United States treasury official said Washington was “closely watching” the developments relating to the virus and assessing its effects. China has said it will not be sending any leaders from Beijing for the Riyadh gathering, chaired by the kingdom’s finance minister Mohammed al-Jadaan and central bank governor Ahmed al-Kholifey. But it said the Chinese ambassador in the kingdom will instead lead a small delegation. Coordinated answer’
The G20 organizers also hosted a ministerial-level symposium on international taxation on Saturday, focused on the challenges arising from the digitalization of the global economy. “There is a consensus among the G20 members on the necessity of getting this new international taxation system for the sake of fairness and efficiency,” said Le Maire. He urged the gathered leaders to reach a compromise solution by the end of the year over the digital tax on giants such as Apple, Facebook and Google, which has emerged as a key bone of contention between the US and France. Presidents Emmanuel Macron and Donald Trump have agreed to extend negotiations on the proposed French tax on digital giants to the end of the year, postponing Washington’s threat of sanctions against Paris. France has said it would drop its tax if an international agreement is reached under the auspices of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). The OECD says the tax changes under discussion could increase global corporate income tax revenues by some $100 billion (92 billion euros) annually. “A coordinated answer is not the better way forward, but the only way forward,” OECD chief Angel Gurria told the Riyadh gathering. Last month, Britain said its own planned digital tax on hugely profitable technology giants will proceed from April despite US threats of retaliatory tariffs. “You cannot have in a global economy different national tax systems that conflict with each other,” US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in Riyadh. Even as France has put its plans on hold, other European nations like Italy and Austria have introduced their own digital levy. Saudi Arabia’s G20 presidency will see it host world leaders for a summit in Riyadh from November 21 to 22. It will hold more than 100 events and conferences in the run-up to the summit, including ministerial meetings, organisers say. Human rights groups have urged G20 member states to exert pressure on the kingdom over its intensifying crackdown on dissent, which has seen women activists, journalists and political dissidents jailed.

,"February 24, 2020",nCov,Coronavirus puts cruise industry in the dock,The Manila Times,"HONG KONG: Deadly viruses, chickenpox outbreaks and mass cases of the runs: sometimes sailing on luxury cruise ships are not the trips of a lifetime elderly passengers had hoped for. Cruise-goers have fallen sick en masse in the past with their predicament on the high seas coming into sharp focus because the holidays can cost thousands of dollars and are often marketed as trips of a lifetime. “Cruise ships are very prone to outbreaks of common cold and the vomiting virus,” said John Oxford, professor of virology at Queen Mary University of London. “Invariably the ships are overcrowded and with so many passengers, hygiene levels can slip.” The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) logged eight outbreaks aboard cruise ships last year of the highly contagious norovirus, which causes vomiting and diarrhea hardly the stuff of a dream holiday. Measles, E. coli, chickenpox and salmonella poisoning have all broken out on cruises in recent years. “Unfortunately, the more elderly demographic found on a typical liner are more likely to be susceptible to anything which might present a serious health challenge,” warned Dr. Simon Clarke, an associate professor at Britain’s University of Reading. With global concerns mounting about the threat of the new coronavirus, an elderly Japanese man and woman died on Thursday having been on the virus-stricken Diamond Princess. The vessel, moored in Yokohama, Japan, was by far the biggest coronavirus cluster outside the epicenter in China. Some have pointed the finger at Japan’s authorities for how they handled the 14-day quarantine of hundreds of passengers. Annual growth
Stewart Chiron, a leading industry expert, says that cruise ships are nothing like the hotbed of viruses that they are painted out to be and cruise lines take “extensive precautions to keep ships clean.” US-based Chiron says the image of thousands of people crammed together on board ripe conditions for the spread of illness is also wide of the mark. According to him, citing CDC figures, of the more than 31 million people who went on a cruise last year, there were 1,038 cases of norovirus, or 0.003 percent. Chiron and other experts say that the cruise industry has successfully shrugged off past negative headlines and will quickly bounce back once the coronavirus passes. Cruise Lines International Association, the world’s largest cruise industry trade organization, says 17.8 million people took an ocean cruise in 2009, compared with last year’s 31 million, demonstrating its continually growing popularity.

,"February 23, 2020",nCov,Coronavirus cases surge in South Korea,Agence France-Presse,"SEOUL: South Korea reported 142 more coronavirus cases on Saturday, the sharpest spike in infections yet, with many new cases involving patients being treated in hospital for mental health issues. ANOTHER ONE Medical workers wearing protective gear carry a patient infected with the Covid-19 at a hospital in Chuncheon on Saturday. YONHAP / AFP PHOTO The national toll of 346 is now the second-highest outside of China, with the jump in cases at the hospital in the southern city of Cheongdo following a similar spike among members of a religious sect in the nearby city of Daegu. Among the new cases, 92 were “related” to patients or staff at Cheongdo Daenam Hospital, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) said. “Most of the hospital’s patients who have been diagnosed are those who had been staying as inpatients for mental illnesses,” Seoul’s Vice Health Minister Kim Gang-lip told reporters. Some cases show “no confirmed epidemiological connections,” meaning they are not sure where or how they contracted the virus, he added. Authorities reported another death on Saturday, taking the toll to two. Both victims had been inpatients at the hospital. Almost 170 members of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus have now been infected, starting with a 61-year-old woman who attended at least four services at the church’s Daegu branch before being diagnosed. “Those who are related to Shincheonji’s Daegu branch account for 48 percent of all confirmed cases,” KCDC director Jung Eun-kyeong told reporters. KCDC said some 9,300 Shincheonji members in Daegu have either been quarantined at facilities or have been asked to stay at home. Among them, 1,261 said they had symptoms, health officials added. The mayor of Daegu — South Korea’s fourth-biggest city, with a population of over 2.5 million — has advised locals to stay indoors, while access to a major US military base in the area has been restricted. One of the Shincheonji members in Daegu visited China — where the deadly virus was first detected — in January, while some three others are believed to have traveled to other countries, KCDC director Jung said. Cheongdo, some 27 kilometers south of Daegu, is the birthplace of Shincheonji’s founder Lee Man-hee. County officials said on Friday that a three-day funeral was held for one of the church members three weeks ago at a hall owned by the Cheongdo hospital. Shincheonji is often accused of being a cult and claims its founder Lee has donned the mantle of Jesus Christ and will take 144,000 people with him to heaven on the day of judgement. But with more church members than available places in heaven, they are said to have to compete for slots and pursue converts persistently and secretively. President Moon Jae-in on Friday called for a “thorough investigation” of everyone who attended the funeral and Shincheonji services. The central government on Friday had declared Daegu and Cheongdo “special management zones,” with Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun saying the region would be supported with medical personnel, beds and equipment. Authorities in Seoul banned public rallies at three main locations on health and safety grounds. The US army garrison in Daegu — where around 10,000 soldiers, civilians and family members live or work — has restricted access and instructed any American troops who recently attended Shincheonji services to self-quarantine. Shincheonji offered an apology, suspending its worship services and gatherings nationwide. “We are deeply sorry that because of one of our members, who thought of her condition as a cold because she had not traveled abroad, led to many in our church being infected and thereby caused concern to the local community,” it said in a statement.

,"February 23, 2020",nCov,Wuhan doctor dies of coronavirus before wedding,Xinhua,"WUHAN: At a meeting room-turned memorial hall at a Wuhan hospital, doctors and nurses wrote down their memories of Peng Yinhua on three notebooks before rushing back to treat patients infected with the novel coronavirus. Peng, a 29-year-old doctor at the First People’s Hospital of Jiangxia District, was the latest medical worker, and among the youngest, who died from the virus on Thursday night, leaving behind his pregnant wife and a wedding yet to be held. The respiratory doctor became infected while working to combat the novel coronavirus at the hospital. He was hospitalized on January 25 and died at Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital despite all-out efforts to save his life. His colleagues remembered him as an honest, optimistic and hard-working young lad. “I still remember the day when you were transferred to Jinyintan (Hospital), you still looked bright,” read one comment on the notebook. “He is diligent and motivated at work, fulfilling his job faithfully and never complaining about difficulties. He is very popular among us,” said Chen Hao, ward director of the respiratory and critical care department where Peng had been working. Chen said Peng was supposed to tie the knot in November 2017 but the wedding was postponed to February 1 this year as he was then attending a training course. The hospital had allowed him a holiday for the wedding but Peng offered to delay the big day to stand with other colleagues amid the raging epidemic. “Patients swarmed in after our department was designated as an isolation ward. We treated 130 patients in one day, and all doctors ate and slept in the hospital,” Chen said. Peng developed symptoms including loss of appetite and low fever on Jan. 24, the eve of the Chinese New Year. The next day, his CT results showed evidence of infection. "
,"February 23, 2020",nCov,Using technology to cope with disruption caused by the coronavirus outbreak,NOEMI LARDIZABAL-DADO,"NOEMI LARDIZABAL-DADO With no proven cure in sight, the race is on to find a treatment for the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). Meanwhile, the fatalities, the confirmedcases and disruption caused by the coronavirus outbreak continues. The impact on the tech industry is being predicted in a new report by TrendForce, a supply chain analytics provider. TrendForce’s investigation range from semiconductors, memory products, panels, telecommunications, green energy to consumer electronics and automobiles. The Mobile World Congress, the world’s biggest phone show, is no longer taking place this year because of coronavirus concerns. Aside from having a material impact on Apple’s bottom line, a “worldwide iPhone supply would be temporarily constrained.” While the coronavirus outbreak situation brings a strain on tech companies and most retail, restaurants, hotels, airlines, and other offline businesses, an opportunity opens doors for some tech companies. China and major hubs like Hongkong and Singapore use technology to cope with the coronavirus outbreak when citizens stay at home or do remote work. Learning from their experience would also prepare us on how work and the school situation may have to change during a crisis. Remote workers, online students and bored people in the world’s biggest internet population overwhelmed apps, games and streaming sites that they have to deal with the occasional server crash, challenging even the most experienced service providers. Could the Philippines’ telecom providers handle an overload of users?
Let’s look at how some countries leverage technology. Many are forced to stay at home, boosting online activities. Schools in China postponed their Spring classes. Some teachers now stream their classes online. Free online classes are being offered from some tutoring centers. Students ask questions in a live chat box. Studying at home has become an engine driving the growth of online education, according to Global Times China. Digital advertising of online education “increased significantly, which also brings benefits to advertisers”.China’s real estate company, Evergrande claims 10 million people are using its app which allows shoppers to connect with consultants and virtual reality house tours. Even courts are moving online. Shanghai High Court reported a 63 percent increase in online court cases compared to the same period last year. Online court technology is being used in other parts of China but before the trial, the participants needed to be contacted by phone or WeChat and taught how to use the software. Gaming apps, fitness apps, online health services, enterprise collaboration apps, cross-border e-commerce apps are thriving. Thomas Graziani from walkthechat.com reported the change in consumption patterns, boosts some industries. In gaming, top-grossing apps include Tencent’s “Game for Peace” and “Honor of Kings”. The game “Plague Inc.” which lets players “spread and evolve a deadly plague to bring about the end of the human race” was also a hit. Offline gyms like Keep closed down until further notice. Keep, the number 1 fitness app in China used the Douyin live streaming feature to move the classes online. The new “Health” segment in the WeChat Wallet menu covers the ability to track in real-time the epidemic data of every district in every province. Online consultations for doctors in virology are in demand. WeChat Work, the enterprise communication App from Tencent released a set of unique features directed at facilitating remote work such as online meetings up to 300 people. Cross-border e-commerce like Omall and Haitun, is booming because Chinese residents are searching for supplies such as face masks now unavailable in China. The governments of Singapore, Hong Kong, and Macao ordered civil servants to work from home and requested private employers to do so where possible, with only essential staff or emergency service providers still at the office. Some schools have been suspended so teachers conduct classes through digital learning tools, such as Google Hangouts and other video conferencing software. Online classes are challenging for some educators who work with children with special learning needs or disabilities. Working at home for those in the digital based sectors seems effective since one only needs an internet connection and a computer. Brice Lamarque, sales and accounts director at a web and branding agency in Hong Kong was interviewed by CNN Business. Lamarque mentioned “that all the agency’s employees have been working from home this month and would continue for as long as the Hong Kong government advises”. A friend in Singapore in the same sector alternates work days with home and office using whatsapp for office chat and a virtual private network (VPN) to access shared files. Employees in customer service industries don’t have the optionfor remote work. While the coronavirus outbreak has changed the way of life in China and major hubs, technology companies could seize this opportunity for growth, for better internet and online services.

VIENTIANE, Feb. 20 (Xinhua) — China and the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) held a special foreign ministers’ meeting on the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak here Thursday to discuss coordinating efforts in fighting the epidemic. The meeting was co-chaired by Wang Yi, Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister, and Teodoro Locsin, Foreign Secretary of the Philippines, the country coordinator of China-ASEAN relations. The meeting kicked off by playing a video clip showing Chinese people’s concerted efforts to fight the COVID-19 outbreak and leaders of the 10 ASEAN countries showing firm support to China. The ministers made a rallying cry of “Stay strong, Wuhan! Stay strong, China!” at a joint photo session. During the meeting, Wang elaborated on the strong measures taken and the remarkable results achieved by China to battle the epidemic. Under the leadership of Chinese President Xi Jinping, 1.4 billion Chinese people have united to fight the virus, Wang said. China has adopted the most comprehensive, the most stringent and the most thorough preventive measures to establish a prevention system that is effectively stopping the disease from spreading, Wang said. The measures, implemented with the “China speed”, have bought time for promptly saving patients and allowed the world to properly respond to the outbreak, showing China’s role as a responsible major country, he said. “We firmly believe that under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and with the country’s strong mobilizing ability, its system advantage and the overall national strength, China has the ability and confidence to completely defeat the epidemic as soon as possible,” Wang said. The COVID-19 outbreak has posed challenges to China’s economic and social development, but only in a temporary and limited way. Given the resilience and vitality of China’s economy, the long-term positive economic trend would not change, he noted, adding that China will not only win the battle against the virus, but also endeavor to achieve its economic and social development goals. Epidemics see no boundaries, Wang said. Sharing a common future as brothers, China and ASEAN countries should effectively prevent the disease from spreading by carrying out closer and more active cooperation, so as to safeguard the health and lives of the people and to forge a closer China-ASEAN community of a shared future, he said. In this regard, Wang made a four-point cooperation proposal. Firstly, both sides should strengthen coordination for joint disease prevention and control. Efforts should be made to push forward the effective coordination and cooperation between health, quarantine, transport and immigration departments of both sides. The China-ASEAN special leaders’ meeting on coronavirus disease should be held at a proper time to outline and guide the cooperation efforts from a higher level. Secondly, both sides should take a long-term perspective and establish long-acting cooperation mechanism. He proposed to establish a China-ASEAN public health emergency communication mechanism and a China-ASEAN anti-epidemic material reserve center to speed up the response against emergent health issues. Thirdly, both sides should rationally deal with this epidemic and conquer panic. The professional advice from WHO experts should be respected, and the normal exchanges and cooperation among trade and commerce personnel between the two sides should be restored comprehensively at an ealier date. Fourthly, both sides should turn the crisis into opportunity and foster new cooperation growth points. ASEAN and China should push the economy to transform into an Internet and digital economy, enhance cooperation in areas such as digital commerce and mobile payment, and improve cities’ management level to better cope with major urgent public incidents. Foreign ministers of ASEAN countries all highly appreciate China’s firm measures to fight the novel coronavirus epidemic, and its highly responsible and transparent manner. They fully affirmed China’s important contribution to safeguarding regional and global public health security, and believed the Chinese side is abound to defeat the epidemic at the earliest date. ASEAN countries are willing to strengthen cooperation and solidarity with China, exchange experiences and jointly promote the ability on health security in the region, they said. The meeting also adopted a statement on the coronavirus disease 2019. At the joint press conference after the meeting, Lao Foreign Minister Saleumxay Kommasith said at the special meeting, ASEAN foreign ministers, and the Chinese state councilor and foreign minister had jointly and comprehensively reviewed the joint efforts and commitments and charted future direction to further prevent and respond to the outbreak of COVID-19. “We have also shared with each other the best practices, lessons learnt and effective methods in surveillance, detecting and researches,” he added.

,"February 22, 2020",nCov,Coronavirus threatens NKorea chaos,Agence France-Presse,"SEOUL: North Korea’s self-imposed isolation in the face of the coronavirus epidemic raging in neighboring China is its only method of protection from an outbreak that would wreak havoc given its crumbling health system, analysts say. The country was among the first to seal its border with China — its main provider of trade and aid — and has since suspended flights and train services, banned tourists and imposed 30 days of quarantine on resident foreigners. Authorities insist they are in control, with the official Rodong Sinmun newspaper reiterating Friday that: “Fortunately, the new coronavirus infection has not yet entered our country.” But medical infrastructure in North Korea — which is subject to multiple international sanctions over its nuclear and ballistic missile programs — is weak, with inconsistent water and electricity supplies to hospitals and chronic shortages of medicines. “If there is an outbreak, the North Korean system will be helpless,” said Choi Jung-hun, a former North Korean doctor who defected to South Korea in 2012. “It will spiral out of control.” According to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, North Korea lacks “essential medicines, laboratory consumables and diagnostics; medical, therapeutic and diagnostic equipment and supplies for critical and emergency health interventions.” It ranked 193rd out of 195 countries — ahead of only Somalia and Equatorial Guinea — in the 2019 Global Health Security Index of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. Pyongyang has previously resorted to similar methods of national self-quarantine in the face of perceived biological threats. It banned tourists for more than four months from October 2014 to keep out the Ebola virus, even though no cases had been reported in Asia. And it clamped down on travel for six months during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak of 2002 and 2003, which killed nearly 650 people across mainland China and Hong Kong. During a measles outbreak in 2006, Choi — now a research professor at Korea University’s Public Policy Research Institute — was stationed on trains from Chongjin to Pyongyang with orders to detect any passengers with signs of fever. “By the time the train reached Pyongyang, all suspected patients had been removed,” he said, adding all efforts were concentrated on protecting the capital. “The most crucial point is defending the leadership in Pyongyang,” he told the Agence France-Presse (AFP), noting the current virus scare had kept leader Kim Jong Un away from the public eye for more than three weeks. ‘Very abnormal’
North Korean state media has been full of coverage in recent weeks of the anti-virus effort, calling it a fight for “national survival.” Masked officials have been pictured holding emergency meetings and workers disinfecting public places such as railway stations and schools, and the citizens who paid tribute to Kim’s father and predecessor Kim Jong-il on the anniversary of his birth at the weekend also wore masks. The World Health Organization (WHO) has not contradicted Pyongyang’s denial of cases, with its head of health emergencies programs Michael Ryan telling reporters: “At the moment, there are no signals or indications that we are dealing with any Covid-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) there.” But defectors and South Korean media reports claim there have been infections, and Thae Yong Ho, the former North Korean deputy ambassador to London who defected in 2016, cast doubt on the reliability of the WHO’s information. The movement restrictions imposed by Pyongyang were “very abnormal,” he said, and that meant international organizations present in North Korea had no way of establishing facts for themselves. “The only information the WHO office in Pyongyang can get is the one-way single information from the regime.” Pyongyang has always denied it had any cases of SARS, but doctor Choi told the AFP the virus could not be diagnosed because of a lack of equipment. “The North Korean authorities could not determine if a patient had died from SARS or something else.” ‘Not trivial’
Covid-19 originated in Hubei and has since spread to every Chinese province, killing more than 2,000 people, with cases reported in more than two dozen countries. The two Chinese provinces neighboring North Korea, Jilin and Liaoning, have recorded more than 200 cases between them according to official figures, with transport and residential restrictions imposed in the Chinese frontier cities of Dandong and Yanji. Pyongyang had rushed to adopt an “all-out prevention strategy,” said Kee Park, a Harvard Medical School lecturer who has taken part in 18 medical missions to North Korea, adding the impoverished state was paying a “not trivial” price to do so. “These measures reflect the realistic assessment by the government of its fragile health system.” AFP "
,"February 21, 2020",nCov,Coronavirus hits China’s Olympic hopes,Agence France-Presse,"HONG KONG: The coronavirus has destroyed the Tokyo Olympic dreams of some Chinese athletes and disrupted the preparations of others, forcing them to miss tournaments and train in strict isolation — sometimes in masks. Games organizers are adamant that the outbreak, which is centred on the Chinese city of Wuhan and has killed more than 2,100 people, will not derail one of the biggest events in the sporting calendar. But it is likely to compromise the performance of the Chinese team, which numbered 416 at the Rio 2016 Games and has been top three on the medals table at every Olympics this century. Hitoshi Oshitani, Professor of Department of Virology, Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine, speaks during a news conference in Tokyo on Feb. 19, 2020. AP PHOTO There are no known cases among Chinese competitors, but the virus outbreak coincides with a critical stage in their build-up to the Olympics, which begin on July 24. In one stark example, China’s women’s football team resorted to doing stretching exercises in the corridor of a Brisbane hotel after they were quarantined ahead of an Olympic qualifying tournament. China hopes that rival countries will open their doors to its athletes to compete in qualifiers as some nations, including Australia, have issued strict restrictions on arrivals from China. “There will be over 100 Olympic qualifying tournaments around the world between February and April,” said Liu Guoyong, a vice-president of the Chinese Olympic Committee (COC), according to the Xinhua news agency. “The IOC has asked various international sports federations to provide all possible assistance and convenience to Chinese athletes.” Dreams over
Despite their disrupted build-up and missing star player Wang Shuang — who was not allowed to leave her home city of Wuhan, and was videoed training alone on a rooftop while wearing a mask — China’s women’s football team managed two wins and a draw in Australia. They will face South Korea over two legs for a spot in Tokyo, but the “home” match will need to take place abroad. The Olympic qualifying tournament was moved from Wuhan at short notice because of the virus, which has obliterated China’s sporting calendar and forced hundreds of millions of people indoors to stop it spreading. At least the women’s football team’s Tokyo hopes are still alive. The women’s handball team’s campaign ended when they withdrew from a qualifying tournament in Hungary next month, saying they could not organise training in the face of the deadly virus. China were also forced out of a World Cup gymnastics meeting in Melbourne — which offers qualifying points for Tokyo — because of travel restrictions. Olympic qualifying tournaments in boxing, basketball and sailing have all been moved out of China. China topped the medals table when it hosted the 2008 Olympics, but fell to third, behind the United States and Britain, at Rio 2016. ‘Nobody can get out’
Liu, of China’s Olympic committee, is confident that athletes will be able to prepare properly for Tokyo and state media has painted an image of them gamely ploughing on with their training routines. But the all-powerful badminton and table tennis squads have decamped to Britain and Qatar respectively, while the judo team missed the Paris Grand Slam in a blow to their Olympic build-up. China has ordered its teams at home and abroad to train behind closed doors to guard against the virus. “Unless there is an emergency, nobody can come onto the base and nobody can get out,” Cao Zhongrong, coach of China’s modern pentathlon team, told local media by telephone. The pentathletes have been holed up at a Beijing university but were to fly out to Egypt this week, and after that will continue their Olympic preparations in Europe. The squad is not allowed to use an athletics track and field because they are outside the self-imposed exclusion area. They run on treadmills instead. Team members have their temperatures checked repeatedly through the day and have to wear a mask while equestrian training. “I treat this as a special training under hypoxic (deprived of oxygen) conditions in special times,” Luo Shuai, who has already qualified for Tokyo, said.

Daegu’s municipal government said there were 1,001 Shincheonji members in the city, all of whom had been asked to self-quarantine, with 90 of them currently showing symptoms. Those who have symptoms “will be tested as soon as possible”, said Daegu mayor Kwon Young-jin, urging stronger action from the government in Seoul and calling the national response “inadequate.” Shincheonji closed down all its facilities nationwide. “We are deeply sorry that because of one of our members, who thought of her condition as a cold because she had not travelled abroad, led to many in our church being infected and thereby caused concern to the local community,” it said in a statement. The Korea Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) said in a statement that 31 new coronavirus cases had been confirmed nationwide, 23 of them in the cult cluster. Until Tuesday, South Korea had only confirmed 31 infections, but it now has a total of 82. AFP AFP/CC "
,"February 20, 2020",nCov,Coronavirus epidemic has implications for life expectancy,Inter Press Service,"BEIJING: As efforts to contain the coronavirus epidemic enter a critical stage, it is important to remember that the costs cannot be measured purely in economic terms, as the measures taken will have implications for life expectancy across the entire nation. Analysis of historical data from various countries gives insight into the relationship between life expectancy and gross domestic product (GDP) per capita. In the first place, it is clear that countries with higher per capita incomes have longer life expectancies, owing to the ability and willingness of wealthier nations to invest in healthcare, infrastructure and environmental governance, thereby increasing life expectancy and reducing fatality rates. Research suggests that, in general, a 100-percent increase in per capita income under similar conditions equates to an increase in life expectancy of 1 to 3 years. Over the past few decades, with the continued increase in per capita income in China, life expectancy has steadily increased in tandem. On the basis of this, we can make a conservative estimate that a 50 percent decrease in GDP would see a 1.5-year decrease in life expectancy. Thus, for each 1-percent reduction in GDP, life expectancy will decrease by approximately 10 days. ‘Value of life’ theory
This hypothesis can be tested against the economic theory of the “value of life.” In the realm of economics, “value of life” is a relatively mature concept, which refers to the amount that a society is willing to spend in order to increase the average life expectancy. Some will deem the notion of calculating a value for life to be cynical or even repulsive, as life is priceless. From an ethical point of view, this is entirely correct. In reality, however, whether in terms of work, business or social management, a balance must be struck between reducing the risk of fatality and the cost of doing so. In order to identify this balance, a value for life must be calculated in a scientific, if seemingly ruthless, manner. For example, some jobs inherently entail a far higher risk of fatality than others, such as underground mining and construction of ultra-high buildings. From the perspective of purely reducing the risk of death, these jobs should be eliminated. But in reality, doing so would both increase the unemployment rate and have adverse impacts on the natural progression of related work, and ultimately, society as a whole will bear the cost of underdevelopment. In this case, a more rational approach would see the introduction of stronger labor protections for such jobs. Finally, with an income premium determined by the market, high-risk jobs would be rewarded with higher salaries, and an acceptable balance may be achieved. Similarly, enterprise and government must strike a balance between risk and cost in the provision of transportation infrastructure. For example, in designing a new road, governments can reduce the number of fatalities through the implementation of safety provisions, like extra lanes, non-motorized lanes and wider sidewalks. Evidently, however, not all roads are built in this way. Does this mean that the designers of those roads had a disregard of safety? Of course, this is not the case. Even if the proposed road is designed to be impeccably safe, should the cost be RMB 10 billion (approximately $1.4 billion), it is likely that the road will not be built at all, leaving people with no transportation infrastructure. Thus, for such construction projects, the government will issue minimum standards for safety, but it is up to the designer to determine the upper limit. So, how much is a reduction in fatality worth? In determining this, an implicit calculation is made to strike a balance with the value of life. In fact, economists have long calculated the value of life in economic terms based on data from various countries. GDP per capita and life expectancy
Generally speaking, the value of life in developed nations is between 10 and 100 times the GDP per capita. Assuming that the value of life is calculated at 30 times the GDP per capita, the average life expectancy would be around 80 years, or approximately 30,000 days. This inference can be tested by comparing the GDP per capita and life expectancy of different countries. In terms of preventing and controlling infectious diseases, with reference to influenza numbers from previous years, in the absence of large-scale compulsory quarantine measures, the infection rate will not exceed 10 percent of the overall population, and the fatality rate will be around 0.2 percent. Thus, the total number of fatalities relative to the entire population will be 2 in 10,000 (0.02 percent). Assuming that the life expectancy of those who die of influenza is around 60 years, and the average life expectancy across society is 80 years, each person who has died of influenza will have died prematurely, on average, by 20 years. Calculating on the basis of the fatality rate of 2 in 10,000 (0.02 percent), the per capita reduction in life expectancy will be 20 multiplied by 0.02, which is four-thousandths of a year, or about 1.5 days. Therefore, on average, the impact of a mass-scale influenza outbreak on human society is a reduction in life expectancy of 1.5 days. On the basis of this analysis, it is possible to infer a reasonable social policy. If every person infected with influenza, that is, 10 percent of the population, is quarantined for 14 days, and family members who have been in close contact with them (assuming 20 percent of the population) are also be quarantined, the loss to GDP due to their inability to participate meaningfully in the creation of wealth for this period will be 30 percent — 14/365 = 1 percent of GDP. As mentioned above, a 1-percent GDP regression will cause a retrogression across society in medical care, infrastructure and environmental governance, amounting to a reduction in the average life expectancy of about 10 days, a number far greater than the impact of influenza. Pure isolation
Based on this calculation alone, pure isolation is not an effective means of containing influenza, and thus no country or society will implement such measures. Some may deem the above calculation to be alarmist, but in actuality, this does not even take into account the formidable operation costs of isolating so many people, or the costs of restricting population movement. A less optimistic estimation of the losses incurred could be 10 percent of GDP, or even higher, leading to a reduction of the average life expectancy by 100 days or more, possibly amounting to a loss of life equivalent to dozens or hundreds of times the number of deaths attributable to influenza itself. Of course, if quarantine measures are able to isolate the flu at an early, small-scale stage, for example, 1 percent of the population, or within one or two cities, then such measures can still be effective. Once infections spread to over 10 percent of the population, however, the continued isolation of patients and people in close contact with them will amount to a greater overall toll on lives. The present epidemic is distinct from previous influenza outbreaks, and therefore, factors such as mortality, the rate of infection, and the proportion of people who need to be quarantined are different, and a significant amount of data is yet to be observed. The same logic, however, applies to the impact of the economy on life expectancy. Society has established its determination to beat this epidemic, and such an attitude is undoubtedly correct and necessary, and ultimately, this victory will belong to the entire human race. But I also hope that as society strives to beat this epidemic “at all costs,” the above analysis can help society to keep various “costs” to a minimum. We must adopt a scientific and rational attitude in determining the most appropriate means of controlling and eradicating the epidemic. In responding to the coronavirus disease 2019, cancer, cardiovascular disease and other diseases that threaten lives, we must also give comprehensive consideration to social and medical resources, and strike a balance that is conducive to protecting lives. Regularity and security in everyday life and work is an important and fundamental part of life for every person, and we should strive to minimize the impact on this.

,"February 13, 2020",nCov,New coronavirus cases fall,Agence France-Presse,"BEIJING: The death toll from China’s coronavirus epidemic climbed past 1,100 on Wednesday but the number of new cases fell for a second straight day, raising hope the outbreak could peak later this month. As Beijing scrambles to contain the outbreak, the number of people infected on a cruise ship off Japan’s coast rose to 174 — the biggest cluster outside the Chinese mainland. Another 97 people died in China, raising the national toll to 1,113, while more than 44,600 people have now been infected by newly named Covid-19, acronym for coronavirus disease 2019. The World Health Organization (WHO) warned the virus posed a “very grave threat” but that there was a “realistic chance” of curbing the outbreak. Most of the deaths and majority of cases have been in central Hubei province, whose capital, Wuhan, is the epicenter of the outbreak. The epidemic has threatened to harm the world’s second-largest economy, with ANZ bank warning that China’s first-quarter GPD growth would slow to 3.2-4.0 percent, down from a previous projection of 5.0 percent. But in a positive development, the number of new cases has fallen in Hubei for two straight days, according to figures from the National Health Commission. Outside the province, the number of new patients has declined for the past week. “In general, the number of new cases is now slowly decreasing,” Zhong Nanshan, a renowned scientist at China’s National Health Commission, said in a video conference with medical staff in Wuhan on Tuesday. “When does the turning point occur? I can’t say. But I think it’s at its peak in mid- to late-February,” he said. Australia’s chief medical officer was more circumspect, however. “I think we’ve just got to watch the data very closely over the coming weeks before we make any predictions,” Brendan Murphy said. In Geneva, the WHO is hosting a two-day international conference on combating the virus during which it decided to name it Covid-19 — in keeping with guidelines aimed at avoiding linking disease to an animal or a geographic location. Warning it posed a “very grave threat” to the world, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said there was a “window of opportunity to hit hard and stand in unison to fight this virus in every corner.” “If we invest now… we have a realistic chance of stopping this outbreak,” he said. The case of a British man who passed on the virus to at least 11 other people — without having been in China — has raised fears of a new phase of contagion abroad. The 53-year-old man caught the virus while attending a conference in Singapore and then passed it on to several compatriots while on holiday in the French Alps, before finally being diagnosed back in Britain. Higher In the Philippines, the number of persons under investigation (PUIs) jumped to 408 from 382 a day earlier. Health Undersecretary Rolando Domingo Health Undersecretary Rolando Domingo said the number of confirmed cases remain at three. Of the 408 PUIs, 240 are Filipinos while 98 are Chinese. Domingo reiterated that there has been no local transmission in the country. “We are continuously assessing the situation and crafting our own guidelines, based on available evidence, to combat the threat of the Covid-19,” he added. Domingo said two of the 30 Filipinos repatriated from Hubei and quarantined in New Clark City were brought to the Jose. B. Lingad Memorial General Hospital in Pampanga because of diarrhea and “abdominal discomfort.” The two tested negative for Covid-19. The Health official said the Department of Health had identified the 455 persons who had contact with the country’s two confirmed cases. Of this number, 277 have been interviewed and 44 who were found symptomatic have been admitted as PUIs. The others were placed under home quarantine. WITH JAN ARCILLA "

Regional health authorities, however, said the Cordillera remains free of the dreaded coronavirus despite the seven PUIs showing symptoms of the virus and having history of travel to China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan. Dr. Amelita Pangilinan, Department of Health (DoH)-CAR regional director, said of the seven PUIs, four tested negative for the virus based on results of their confirmatory tests from the Metro Manila-based Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM), while the three others have been elevated as PUIs because of their history of travel to China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan. She added that three PUIs in the region include a teacher of English in China and two domestic helpers working in Hong Kong who are reportedly vacationing in the Philippines and are natives of Benguet, Abra and Mountain Province in the Cordillera. Pangilinan said the four individuals who tested negative for the virus were the first reported PUIs in the CAR while the three other individuals were the latest to be elevated as PUIs for showing symptoms of the virus. “We advise sick people to better stay at home and not to stay in crowded places so as not to complicate their condition and spread the illness,” she added. Pangilinan said the Health department is grateful to the PUIs for voluntarily submitting themselves to needed tests for the coronavirus. According to her, the number of days that a PUI stayed in China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan does not matter but what does is their exposure to people who tested positive for the virus. Pangilinan said 21 individuals classified as PUMs who had been in close contact with identified PUIs in the administrative region could now ascertain their health condition considering their exposure to the identified PUIs. She reminded CAR residents that the best way to combat the spread of the virus is for them to keep their immune system strong by eating the right kinds of food, having sufficient sleep and exercise and observing a healthy lifestyle. Tests negative Of the eight PUMs in Bulacan, five were found negative of the coronavirus, leaving only three PUIs, according to Dr. Joy Gomez of the provincial health office (PHO). The three PUIs have been placed under isolation in a hospital. Gomez said results of the patients’ laboratory test would be released on Thursday.
She confirmed that the three PUIs had visited China. Bulacan Gov. Daniel Fernando has urged residents to keep calm and to pray for those currently infected. He had instructed the PHO to continue implementingt preventive measures down to the barangay (villages). The coronavirus originated from China, where it has left over 800 people dead.
It has since spread to at least 27 countries. No confirmed cases The eight PUMs in Zamboanga City are on a 14-day quarantine. Dr. Dulce Miravite said they continue to monitor the situation as there are several others who have travel history to or from Hubei province, where Wuhan city, the reported ground zero for the coronavirus, is located. “Zamboanga City remains to have no confirmed cases as well as no [PUIs] for nCoV. [We continue] to closely collaborate with the DoH and other health agencies including public and private hospitals, conduct information drives, place health personnel in points of entries and other advocacies so that people will be informed with accurate data and prevent panic and confusion,” she added. Miravite said persons who had traveled to China, had exposure to coronavirus cases and are health care workers, but with no signs and symptoms of the disease, are considered PUMs and are required to undergo home quarantine. On the other hand, she added, persons with history of China travel, had close contact with nCoV cases, are healthcare workers but who show signs and symptoms of the virus are considered PUIs and are advised to go to the hospital. Miravite urged the public to monitor, share and spread only validated information from official sources to prevent panic. She said the disease was believed to have been transferred from animal species to humans in a seafood and wildlife market in Wuhan, Miravite added that the virus develops 2-14 days after infection. Its symptoms include colds, cough, fever, shortness of breath and severe respiratory problems.
Preventive measures include regular hand washing with soap and water, covering one’s mouth when coughing and sneezing, drinking adequate water, observing proper hygiene and sanitation and a healthy lifestyle, and avoiding crowded places, she said. The Bureau of Quarantine (BoQ) in Zamboanga City has stepped up its monitoring at sea and airports to prevent the entry of the nCoV, especially passengers of ferries plying Sandakan and Zamboanga. Dr. Omar Aranan, chief of the BoQ-Zamboanga Station, said medical personnel conduct rapid health assessment of all passengers and deportees before disembarking here. “We have nothing to worry because we have people on the vessel,” according to Aranan, who also said the bureau is coordinating with other agencies for the protection of all other ports of entry within its area of responsibility. He added that the BoQ has linked up with shipping agents, different maritime agencies, port authorities and members of the Customs, Immigration and Quarantine Services for consolidation of efforts in trying to prevent the entry and spread of the nCoV. Aranan said the agencies have agreed to stop the issuance of “shore pass” to foreign crew or vessels arriving in Zamboanga City although minimal contacts between the port operators and crew are allowed. He added that they have coordinated with the different port safety security officers on different points of entry, including private wharves, to look at the Safety Security Plan especially for those catering to foreign vessels plying the Zamboanga route. Ship agent representatives have also been required to submit to the BoQ an advance copy of the maritime declaration of health, voyage memorandum and crew list in order for the latter to have the pertinent documents on hand even before the vessel arrives in Zamboanga. In this manner, Aranan said, the BoQ can scrutinize vessels even before they arrive.
Vital decisions or precautionary measures can be done according to the documents on hand, he added. Arriving crew and vessels should also be quarantined for 14 days. Nonetheless, Aranan said, these safety measures are undertaken without hampering trade and commerce. “We do our job at the same time we have to strictly monitor our safety in terms of health,” he added. Because of the Wuhan coronavirus scare, the local government canceled several events included in the celebration of the 83rd Dia de la Ciudad de Zamboanga on February 26. Christian Olasiman, head of the special events team of the local government, said the Inter-school Drum and Lyre Competition and the Grand Civic-Military Parade and the Field Demonstration at the sports complex have been scrapped. The main commemorative program and the Local Achievers Awards, which were originally scheduled at the sports complex, will be held after flag-raising at City Hall grounds, according to Olasiman. He said all other activities for the celebration will continue, but will follow guidelines set by the City Health Office to ensure health security. Under the guidelines, those who have had travel history to China and other countries with confirmed nCoV cases are advised to undergo self-quarantine at home for 14 days; and those feeling sick or not feeling well are advised not to attend any of the activities and just stay home or go to the hospital. Chinese vessels in Bataan In Bataan in Central Luzon, the Philippine Coast Guard on Tuesday reported that more or less 30 crew of two cargo vessels coming from China have undergone quarantine for 14 days as precautionary measure against the coronavirus. Lieutenant Airland Lapitan, Coast Guard Bataan station commander, said MV BMC Catherine loaded with cement left Mariveles on Monday after 14 days of quarantine while Vissai VCT 02, a crude oil tanker, was still in Morong as of Tuesday undergoing quarantine. The two vessels, whose last port of call was China, has at least 15 crew each. With a reports from AL JACINTO, ERNIE B. ESCONDE AND DEXTER A. SEE "

According to a statement by Japan’s Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, the total number of confirmed 2019 nCoV cases is now 70, including the four Filipino crew, and a Ukrainian and American passengers. The ministry said it has tested 336 potentially infected 3,700 passengers and crew on the vessel, and the latest results turned up the six new cases. The Diamond Princess cruise ship, with around 3,600 people quarantined onboard due to fears of the new coronavirus, is seen anchored at the Daikoku Pier Cruise Terminal in Yokohama port on Feb. 10, 2020. AFP PHOTO The ship, carrying passengers from more than 50 countries and regions, has been quarantined since Monday after a passenger, who disembarked in Hong Kong, was found to be infected with the pneumonia-causing virus. The first Filipino crew infected with 2019 nCoV was reported to be responding to medical procedures, and is expected to to recuperate in the coming days. Magsaysay Maritime Corp. (MMC), recently said Princess Cruises, the owner and operator of the said ship, continue to work closely with the Japanese Ministry of Health to care for the guests and crew members quarantined. “Princess has implemented measures to ensure the safety and well-being of everyone on board including limited movement inside the vessel, minimum interaction between people, new safety procedures, provision of protective equipment as well as unlimited internet access to allow guests and crew to communicate with their family and loved ones,” the statement reads. Magsaysay noted that it has kept close contact and communication with the families of crew to keep them updated on their loved ones, since the safety and well- being of its crew on board the Diamond Princess are their utmost priority. They maintained that they are complying with Philippine government guidelines, which include no transits through China, Hong Kong and Macau when joining and returning from the ship, and mandatory quarantine for any crew who return home from these areas. Meanwhile, on Friday, the Norwegian Cruise Line (NCL), the company that hires thousands of Filipino seafarers thru its local agent CF Sharp Crew Management Inc., has already terminated its 2020 Asia program aboard the Norwegian Spirit, citing growing concerns around coronavirus. All Norwegian Spirit trips in Asia have been cancelled, starting from April 15, 2020 until December 7, 2020. Asked for his comments, CF Sharp President Miguel Angel Rocha has eased the worries of the negative effects that the virus brought to its Filipino crew, and said “the NCL group operates under the highest standards of health and safety for their passengers and crew alike, stating that he is “sure that they are taking every precaution that they feel is reasonable and justified.” Rocha explained “changing the itinerary of cruise operation of NCL will not affect deployments, since ships will continue to sail to different destinations.

,"February 12, 2020",nCov,Coronavirus clips wings of Asia’s biggest air show,Agence France-Presse,"SINGAPORE: Asia’s biggest air show opened in Singapore on Tuesday under the shadow of a deadly coronavirus outbreak that has forced companies to withdraw, kept visitors away and is battering the aviation industry. The biennial Singapore Airshow attracts hundreds of global aerospace firms and airlines to the financial hub, where they negotiate multi-million-dollar deals and watch spectacular aerial displays by fighter jets. But the virus — which has killed more than 1,000 in China and spread to more than two dozen other countries — is overshadowing this year’s event. Singapore has so far reported 45 cases, and the city-state last week raised its health alert level to the same as during the deadly 2002-2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak. Over 70 exhibitors decided to skip the air show and withdrawals include US aerospace giant Lockheed Martin, which makes warplanes and defense equipment, Canada’s Bombardier and plane maker De Havilland. At least 10 Chinese companies have also pulled out after Singapore imposed a ban on people traveling from China in a bid to stem the spread of the virus. Organizers decided to push ahead but with precautions in place, such as limiting public tickets, screening participants with thermal scanners to detect fevers and asking them to greet one another by waving from a distance or bowing, instead of shaking hands. The enormous exhibition center hosting the show, filled with a dizzying array of equipment from mock-ups of plane interiors to tanks and machine guns, looked emptier than at previous editions and few major deals are expected this year. ‘Worse than SARS’
Some 930 exhibiting companies are attending and around 40,000 trade attendees from more than 45 countries are expected during the four-day event, down from the previous edition of the show in 2018 when over 54,000 trade participants and more than 1,000 companies took part. Nevertheless, major players, such as Boeing — seeking to recover from a crisis sparked by fatal crashes involving its 737 MAX model — and Airbus, were still in attendance and some deals were signed. They included one by Franco-Italian plane maker ATR, which announced Papua New Guinea airline PNG Air would be a new plane’s launch customer with an order for three. Despite Chinese exhibitors pulling out, China’s air force sent an aerobatics team to take part in the aerial displays that are a highlight of the show. The Chinese fighter jets put on their display just ahead of US warplanes, a rare instance of the rivals’ military aircraft in the same airspace. While Beijing and Washington have long been jostling for influence in Asia, Singapore maintains good ties with both. The mood is expected to remain subdued in Singapore this week as airlines reel from the impact of many nations barring Chinese travelers over the coronavirus outbreak. Aviation consultancy Ascend by Cirium said in an analysis this week there was a reduction in flights from and within mainland China by roughly 25 percent, and predicted the impact on the industry could be worse than during the SARS outbreak. “China is a larger part of the global economy and global airline traffic than in 2003,” said Joanna Lu, the group’s head of consultancy for Asia. The SARS outbreak, like the current coronavirus, began in China before spreading to many countries, and killed hundreds. The International Air Transport Association said it was too early to assess the full damage, but noted that during the SARS outbreak, Asia-Pacific airlines lost an estimated $6 billion in revenues. The tourism industry as a whole will suffer “a massive negative blow” due to bans on arrivals from China, said Rajiv Biswas, Asia-Pacific chief economist at IHS Markit. AFP "

,"February 11, 2020",nCov,MOriental bans overseas travels over coronavirus,Cris Diaz,"MISAMIS ORIENTAL: Gov. Yevgeny Vincente Emano has issued a memorandum prohibiting provincial officials and employees to travel outside the country, citing the outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus acute respiratory disease (2019-nCoV ARD). In his memorandum, Emano said the ban was part of preventive measures to ensure that no provincial workers traveling overseas would become carriers of the 2019-nCoV upon their return to the country. He, however, added that the provincial government was not saying its officials and employees going on foreign trips would contract the virus. If the workers have to travel overseas for “emergency reasons,” according to the governor, they must first get permission from the provincial health officer. Emano encouraged provincial residents who may have just arrived from abroad to voluntarily submit themselves to a 14-day quarantine to make sure that they are free of the coronavirus. The regional office of the Department of Health (DoH) in Cagayan de Oro City said a total of 11 persons were admitted to various hospitals in Northern Mindanao in January this year when the virus was first reported on suspicion that they might have contracted the 2019-nCoV ARD. Of the 11 patients, eight remained in the hospitals, two were considered patients under investigation (PUIs) and one was already discharged. The Health department’s regional office said Northern Mindanao is still negative of the 2019-nCoV ARD and no death from the virus had been reported. The province of Mindoro Occidental PUI was reported to be free of the disease. There were 11 persons under monitoring (PUMs), said the Mindoro Occidental provincial Health Office. The 11 PUMs had reportedly traveled to Japan, Taiwan, Singapore, South Korea and Western Australia. Provincial health officer Maria Teresa Tan said even if there were PUIs and PUMs in Mindoro Ocidental, the province remained free of the coronavirus. She said in case the 11 PUMs, and possibly others, would test positive for the virus, there are isolation rooms ready in three hospitals in the province — Mamburao Provincial Hospital, San Jose District Hospital and Sablayan District Hospital. Tan advised people to observe personal hygiene and cough/sneezing etiquette, wash hands frequently and wear face masks if they are not feeling well. Mayor Romulo Festin of San Jose, Occidental Mindoro appealed for a stop to the spreading of fake news about supposed coronavirus cases because doing so, he said, causes panic among the public. Appeal to Baguio Chinese Another appeal was made by Baguio City health officer Dr. Rowena Galpo, this time addressed to members of the Filipino-Chinese community in the Summer Capital, to help city officials led by Mayor Benjamin Magalong in monitoring members of the community, particularly those with history of travel to China, especially Wuhan city in the last 10 to 14 days. “Please report immediately if anyone who came from those places exhibits any signs and symptoms related to the disease so that that we can take measures and prevent transmission of the virus,” Galpo said. A DoH advisory said symptoms to watch out for are runny nose, headache, cough, sore throat and fever. Zamboanga cases Like Mindoro Occidental, the Zamboanga Peninsula is dealing with at least four PUMs suspected of carrying the coronavirus, according to a local health officer. Dr. Joshua Brillantes, DoH-Region 9 assistant regional director, said “two persons from Zamboanga del Norte and one each from Zamboanga del Sur and Zamboanga City had been placed under the PUM category. Brillantes declined to identify the four individuals, their ages and their addresses “so as not to violate their rights to private life.” The PUMs were earlier reported “to have visited countries now infested with the nCoV virus and arrived last week in their Region 9 residences.” According to Brillantes, all government hospitals in the Zamboanga Peninsula had been placed by DoH-9 on “blue alert status” or on the watch for possible persons infected with the virus. In Barangay Pasonanca in Zamboanga City, residents reportedly were thrown into panic
upon learning that a Chinese, who owns a local fiber optic company in the village, lately came home from Wuhan, where the disease that had killed hundreds in China allegedly originated.

Julian quoted employees as saying the company was equipped with a machine that monitors daily their body temperature. City health officer Dr. Dulce Amor Miravite said local residents who recently visited China were being monitored by her office. Wuhan repatriates In Tarlac, the Health department, in coordination with the Bases Conversion and Development Authority and the provincial government of Tarlac on Sunday said Filipinos who had been repatriated from China were well-accommodated and closely monitored. “All 32 repatriates landed safely and free of any signs and symptoms [of the coronavirus], hence, they were all sent to New Clark City (NCC) for close observation and monitoring for 14 days,” Health Undersecretary Gerardo Bayugo said in a news briefing. If an individual, during his/her stay in a quarantine facility in the NCC, suddenly shows signs and symptoms, the DoH has deployed medical teams to immediately assess and facilitate transfer to hospital for close monitoring. “The DoH will be taking charge of the management, coordination and logistics of the entire quarantine process. Rest assured that repatriated overseas Filipino workers will be attended to and treated with utmost care. Regular monitoring will be conducted to ensure their health and safety,” Bayugo said. Negros hospitals ready A similar assurance was made by five hospitals managed by the provincial government of Negros Occidental that said they were ready to admit PUIs for the 2019-nCoV. Leo Eusebio, head of Hospital Operations Department, identified the hospitals as the Teresita Jalandoni Provincial Hospital in Silay City with eight rooms and eight beds; four beds and four rooms in the Cadiz City District Hospital; three rooms and three beds in the Kabankalan City District Hospital; and two rooms and four beds in the Valladolid District Hospital. The San Carlos City Hospital is also ready, Eusebio said. He added that the health facilities have isolation rooms, as well as private rooms. Nurses who will be assigned to the isolation rooms would no longer be assigned to attend to other patients outside the rooms, Eusebio said.

The World Championship, won last year by world number two Park Sung-hyun, is one of the most prestigious on the US LPGA Tour with the world’s top 20 players and the previous year’s major-winners all participating. The Tour had already announced 10 days ago the cancellation of China’s Blue Bay LPGA from March 5-8 on the southern island of Hainan. The three-event swing would have carried in excess of $5 million in prize money. The coronavirus outbreak has affected several other sports including football and athletics, mainly in China. “Due to the continued health concerns and recent advisories in some Asian countries that large-scale events should be cancelled or postponed as a result of the coronavirus, the LPGA and its partners have made the decision to cancel the 2020 Honda LPGA Thailand and the 2020 HSBC Women’s World Championship,” an LPGA Tour statement said. An elite field of 66 were due to compete for a $1.5 million purse at Sentosa Golf Club from February 27 with defending champion and Park playing along with fellow South Korean Ko Jin-young, the world number one, and third-ranked Nelly Korda of the US. A purse of $1.6 million would have been up for grabs at the Siam Country Club in the Thai resort of Pattaya from February 20, and $2.1 million at the Jian Lake Blue Bay Golf Course on Hainan Island from March 5. LPGA Tour players are currently in Adelaide where the Australian Open begins on Thursday after Sunday’s conclusion of the Vic Open, won by South Korea’s Park Hee-young in Geelong.

France has now detected a total of 11 cases of the novel coronavirus. The new “cluster” is centered on a Briton who had returned from Singapore and stayed in Contamines-Montjoie, near Mont Blanc in the French Alps for four days from January 24, Health Minister Agnes Buzyn said. Istres, Bouches-du-Rhône, France: A bus carry people disembarked from an aircraft leaves the Istres-Le Tube Air Base near Istres, northwest of Marseille, southern France, on February 9, 2020, the aircraft believed to be carrying European citizens flown out from the coronavirus zone in Wuhan, China. The chartered civilian aircraft left the capital of central Hubei province and arrived in the first place at Brize Norton airbase in Oxfordshire, southern England, with more than 200 people on board, before landing in southern France. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the flight had brought back 105 British nationals and family members, as well as 95 European nationals and family members. French Health Minister Agnes Buzyn said that 38 French citizens were due to be among the European nationals on the flight. AFP PHOTO “They show no serious signs” of a life-threatening infection added Buzyn, herself a doctor. The Briton at the center of the new cases is now in Britain and was not counted among the French tally, she told a press conference. In addition to the five Britons who have tested positive for the virus, six other Britons staying in the same chalet have also been hospitalized for observation, the minister said. Altogether there were seven adults on holiday in one apartment in the chalet and a father with his three children who lived in another, local authorities said. Authorities in France and Singapore are now trying to contact people who came into close contact with the initially infected Briton, she said. He was on a business trip and had stayed at a hotel for an event with 94 other foreigners, according to senior health official Jerome Salomon who attended the press briefing along with Buzyn. Other “clusters” have been identified in Malaysia and South Korea around people who attended the same event, he said.

,"February 9, 2020",nCov,Fear of coronavirus exposes flaws in decision-making,The Manila Times,"Granted, extra caution is called for whenever new threats emerge. Safety measures were warranted when the 2019 novel coronavirus acute respiratory disease (2019-nCoV ARD) surfaced about a month ago and when it spread to more than 20 countries, including the Philippines. Those precautions should now be reviewed and adjusted accordingly to the situation at present. Citizens are better served when public policies are based on facts and rational thinking rather than on myths and fear. The starting point there is an examination of the facts. As of press time, there are 34,000 cases of the 2019-nCoV, and the death toll has exceeded 700. That yields a probability of dying of about 2 percent. The morbitity rate seems to suggest that the 2019-nCoV might not be the special pathogen that justifies our current degree of anxiety. This observation was bolstered by a United States news network report, in which a health expert who studies epidemics pointed out that mostly extreme cases of the nCoV were being tested. Because many medical facilities are overwhelmed, the expert said mild cases were likely not reported. In other words, people with only mild symptoms of the nCoV probably just stayed at home to recover. And so, when those mild cases are accounted for, the death rates fall even further. The plain varieties of the flu or influenza make about 1 billion people worldwide sick every year. And from those cases, between 250,000 and 650,000 people die, according to various reports. But during most flu seasons, flights are not canceled. Travel and vacation plans go largely uninterrupted. Perhaps there is truth in saying, ignorance is bliss. In the Philippines, one of the leading causes of death is pneumonia, which claims more than 57,000 lives a year, according to the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA). Some varieties of pneumonia are contagious, and yet public establishments do not break out thermal scanning devices to screen patrons and other people just because of this disease. The same PSA report says the leading cause of death among Filipinos is ischemic heart disease, a condition caused by the narrowing of arteries. This illness accounted for 14.5 percent of all registered deaths in the Philippines in 2016, more than 84,000. Where is the clamor to ban lechon? Levity aside, we are not saying the precautions taken so far have been needless. The threat of a flu pandemic is real. A century ago, the Spanish influenza killed some 50 million people worldwide over two years. Chances are, another deadly pandemic will strike again but, so far, the numbers suggest that the 2019-nCoV is not it. Need for review, reflection The scramble to arrest the spread of the coronavirus did expose legitimate concerns and weaknesses. For one, health authorities need a better system of tracing those infected. Second, the government should examine the capability of our health system to quarantine and care for a flood of patients. And third, the government should review health safety protocols to avoid causing hysteria and unnnecessarily harming the economy. People themselves need to reflect on how they reacted to the nCoV. For starters, there was panic-buying of surgical masks, even though viruses are not airborne. Health officials announced that only those with flu-like symptoms should wear masks, and that others would be better off just by regularly washing their hands and avoiding people with fever and sore throat. More worrisome are reports about the alleged discrimination against the Chinese and even of Filipinos of Chinese descent. Our columnist, Rigoberto Tiglao, wrote about this, and we agree with him that some of the reactions to the coronavirus have been racist and xenophobic. We are troubled by reports of Chinese-looking patrons being turned away at some commercial establishments. We also heard about tourism authorities selectively screening Chinese tourists and other foreigners, as if Filipinos traveling with them were immune to viruses. Sadly, the coronavirus may have exposed a public malady, but not of the medical kind. Even as we continue to take calibrated precautions and prepare for a real peril, we should also reflect on our character flaws and decision-making processes, both of which appear to be in need of remedies.

,"February 9, 2020",nCov,Suspected coronavirus cases now 267 – DoH,Jan Arcilla,"THE number of patients under investigation (PUIs) for the 2019 novel coronavirus acute respiratory disease (2019-nCoV ARD) in the country jumped to 267 on Saturday from 215 a day earlier. According to the Department of Health’s (DoH) situation report posted on its website, the confirmed cases remained at three. Also, two PUIs have died. According to the DoH, 230 PUIs had been admitted to hospitals, 19 had been discharged and 13 refused admission. It earlier said the second PUI fatality died of pneumonia, not nCoV. The first PUI death was that of a Chinese man who died of severe pneumonia and human immunodeficiency virus on January 29. The man’s partner, 38 and also a Chinese, has been placed in isolation at San Lazaro Hospital in Manila. The third case involved another Chinese woman, 60, who returned to China after her second set of samples tested negative for nCoV. Her first sample was found positive for the deadly virus after she traveled to China. On Friday, a repatriation team from the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) entered ground zero of the 2019-nCoV ARD outbreak and handed out relief goods to overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) in Wuhan City who were stranded in their homes over government restrictions limiting travel movements in order to contain the deadly virus. Mark Anthony Geguera and Sanny Darren Bejarin of the Philippine Consulate General in Shanghai coordinated with volunteer members of the Filipino community in the care mission. The DFA team was firming up arrangements with Chinese authorities for the planned repatriation of the Filipinos. “We already have our DFA team inside Wuhan city and they are there working on the ground preparing for the repatriation of our OFWs. They’re taking great personal risk for the sake of our kababayan (countrymen) and I salute them for that,” DFA Undersecretary Brigido Dulay said. The team hired a vehicle to visit neighborhoods with identified Filipino residents in the travel-restricted city and handed out grocery items and basic necessities. A total of 56 persons, including seven spouses and four infants, have confirmed their intent to join the repatriation flight. The DFA initiated the call to bring back the workers last January 28 through the Philippine Embassy in Beijing and the Philippine Consulate General in Shanghai, the foreign service post with jurisdiction over Wuhan in Hubei province. On Thursday, Sen. Christopher Lawrence “Bong” Go said the OFWs in Wuhan and other parts of Hubei may be repatriated “anytime soon.” The senator added that he was coordinating with concerned government agencies to speed up the repatriation of the OFWs who have expressed desire to return home amid the ongoing 2019-nCoV ARD outbreak in China. “They will come [home] soon, anytime in the next few days. We are now preparing for a possible quarantine areas,” Go said in an interview during his visit to fire victims in Quezon City. “This has to be soonest, while observing our health protocols. Once China agrees to it, it is ready. We will bring them home immediately. We are concerned about their situation there. No amount of money can pay for their loneliness and fear in another country,” he added. The senator, chairman of the Senate Committee on Health, said Vince Dizon, president of the Bases Conversion and Development Authority and also Malacañang adviser for flagship programs, was coordinating with the DoH in preparing the Athletes’ Village in New Clark City in Tarlac as a quarantine area for the repatriated Filipinos. In Japan, the more than 500 Filipino crew of a cruise ship stricken with the coronavirus is being looked after by a manning agency that employs them The agency on Saturday said it was on top of the situation and the crew quarantined on board Diamond Princess, which is operated by US-based Princess Cruises, is taken care of.
In a statement, Magsaysay Maritime Corp. said Princess Cruises continues to work closely and cooperatively with the Japanese Ministry of Health to attend to the crew and the passengers of the cruise ship. Public health authorities have allowed 61 people, including a Filipino crew, to disembark from the ship to avail of medical care from local hospitals. “Princess [Cruises] has implemented measures to ensure the safety and well-being of everyone on board including limited movement inside the vessel, minimum interaction between people, new safety procedures, provision of protective equipment as well as unlimited internet access to allow guests and crew to communicate with their family and loved ones,” the statement read. Magsaysay noted that it has kept close contact and communication with the families of crew to keep them updated on their loved ones, since the safety and well-being of its crew on board the Diamond Princess are its utmost priority. “Magsaysay, as well, has been working in close contact with the Department of Health, the Department of Labor, the POEA (Philippine Overseas Employment Administration), OWWA (Overseas Workers Welfare Administration) and the Philippine Embassy in Japan to ensure that all our Filipino seafarers working on board the ship are protected from harm,” the manning agency said. It added that it was complying with Philippine government guidelines, which include no transits through China, Hong Kong and Macau when joining and returning from the ship and mandatory quarantine for any crew who return home from these areas. The 61 people allowed to disembark had tested positive for the coronavirus, while an additional 41 passengers were found to have contracted the virus. The newly diagnosed included 21 Japanese, as well as Americans, Canadians, Australians, an Argentine and a Briton, according to Japan based NHK. Robespierre Bolivar, deputy head of mission of the Philippine Embassy in Japan, said over radio dzMM that the lone Filipino crew positive for the virus seemed to have responded to treatment and is now doing well, while the rest of the 538 Filipino crew and passengers are still undergoing a 14-day quarantine. The quarantine will end on February 19, according to authorities. Also on Saturday, Senior Citizen party-list Rep. Francisco Gamboa Datol Jr. appealed to the DoH and various hospitals nationwide to adopt “extra special caring measures” for senior citizens who are vulnerable to respiratory infection. “The elderly, having weaker immune systems and many with various ailments, are vulnerable to the Wuhan coronavirus and other respiratory diseases,” Datol said. He proposed that caregivers and household members should be advised by their barangay (village) officials and local health care officers on how to take care of seniors with respiratory ailments. The coronaviruses belongs to large family of viruses that range from the common cold to more serious infections. The Department of Education (DepEd) has advised all schools to closely monitor their students’ health status specially for the possible presence of infection or any virus. In a message to reporters, DepEd Undersecretary Alain del Pascua said with the vulnerability of school children in acquiring communicable diseases such as measles, influenza, and chicken pox, all schools are advised to closely monitor the health status of learners. Pascua added that the Preventive Alert System in Schools shall be used for this purpose. In a memorandum dated February 6, he reminded schools that early detection of illness is important for immediate treatment and prevention of outbreaks. Pascua said communicable diseases “may be transmitted from person to person, animal to person, or by touching a person or object that has the bacteria or virus on it, then touching the eyes, the mouth, and/or the nose.” He also reminded schools to closely monitor general signs or symptoms among its learners such as fever, headache, cough, body weakness, fatigue, runny nose, soar throat and rashes. The DepEd earlier created a task force that will closely coordinate with the DoH to address challenges in schools after the 2019-nCoV ARD entered the country. The department discouraged activities at the division or district level that would involve gathering of participants from various schools.

At present, over 30 disinfection robots have been used in isolation wards, ICUs, operating rooms and fever clinics of Wuhan’s major coronavirus hospitals to provide around clock disinfection service. Robots are increasingly being deployed at the front lines of China’s fight against the epidemic in order to reduce cross-infection risks and improve efficiency. On Monday, robot maker CloudMinds and China Mobile’s Shanghai branch donated the first batch of 5G-powered robots to a Shanghai hospital. With the 5G network, the robots can help medical staff carry out tasks involving consultations, disinfection, cleaning and drug delivery. Robot manufacturer Siasun and the Shenyang Institute of Automation of the Chinese Academy of Sciences are also developing a robot that can replace nurses in conducting throat testing for the virus.

,"February 8, 2020",nCov,"Spotlight: World leaders, experts warn against discrimination caused by coronavirus epidemic",Xinhua,"BEIJING, Feb. 6 (Xinhua) — World leaders and experts have called on the international community to discard discrimination against certain groups of people due to misinformation about the novel coronavirus epidemic. Ever since the outbreak of the novel coronavirus that started first in China’s central city of Wuhan, there have been unpleasant cases of discrimination and violence against the Chinese people being reported. Some biased media outlets even tagged the novel coronavirus as “China virus.” Having noticed the situation, United Nations (UN) Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said: “it’s easy to move into … perspectives in which there tends to be discrimination; there tends to be violation of human rights; there tends to be stigma on innocent people just because of their ethnicity.” The chief of the world’s largest international organization also appealed for “a strong feeling of international solidarity, a strong feeling of support to China in these difficult circumstances but also to other countries that might be impacted,” and “a strong concern to avoid the stigmatization of people that are innocent and that might be victims of that situation.” GLOBAL APPEAL FOR NON-DISCRIMINATION
Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has met leaders of the Chinese community in Spain to offer them support in the ongoing coronavirus crisis. Sanchez said he lamented that fears of the virus have led to some Chinese people being victims of xenophobic incidents and caused difficulties to the Chinese community. He made a call for understanding and made a positive valuation of the efforts that China is making to control the spread of the virus. Discrimination against the Chinese because of the novel coronavirus outbreak will not be tolerated, said a U.S. local official in Houston, Texas. Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo made the remarks at an Asian Chamber of Commerce event hosted at the Chinese Community Center. “Asian American community members, especially Chinese community members feel that they are being discriminated against. That is the ugly side of diversity. It’s not to be tolerated in this community,” she said. “Diversity is our strength,” Hidalgo said. “We thrive because of the people that live here. We should not be discriminating ever.” In France, Asians created a Twitter hashtag #Jenesuispasunvirus (I am not a virus) to complain of racism and prejudice amid the novel coronavirus outbreak. As the hashtag went viral, a young woman who was mocked on a bus in Paris and declined to give her name, said “the worst virus is systemic racism … We know very well that a virus has no nationality!” “I was the victim of a racist act by a group of young girls. I could hear them laughing and making fun of me. One said: How do we call Coronavirus patients? Chinese people, right?” she said. As the hashtag spread, tens of thousands people have flocked to Twitter to signal their discontent about discrimination and racism. “A person of Chinese origin is not a person infected with the coronavirus. We are not a virus,” the Association of Young Chinese in France said. STEMMING MISINFORMATION
Misunderstandings and fake news about the novel coronavirus are the major reasons that have led to the possible discrimination and violence. “Let us all be very careful, because there are some signs of discrimination that could turn into episodes of violence,” Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said in a video clip posted on Twitter. “The situation is absolutely under control, so no one in Italy should think of taking advantage of this situation for displays of discrimination or even violence, which we absolutely cannot accept,” said Conte. In order to combat the spread of fake news on the coronavirus epidemic, which could create alarm among the population, Italy’s Ministry of Health has signed an accord with Twitter to highlight the official ministry link in online searches, the ministry said in a statement. It is also in talks with Google to seal a similar deal. Educating the public globally is key, including the sharing of practical, preventive measures through schools, teachers, children and parents, said Yasmine Sherif, director of Education Cannot Wait, a global fund hosted by the UN Children’s Fund. “It is important that we all work together to share accurate information about the coronavirus to help contain the outbreak,” said Sherif. The World Health Organization (WHO) has commissioned a rapid response team from an Austrian university to counter conspiracy theories and misinformation in fighting the novel coronavirus, Austria Press Agency has reported. The team from Danube University Krems, consisting of ten scientific researchers and students, will support the WHO by reviewing studies and reports on the novel coronavirus within 24 hours. The WHO will therefore be able to base its decisions on reliable facts. "
,"February 7, 2020",nCov,‘Coronavirus is enemy not Chinese’,Xinhua,"BEIJING: The real enemy is not the Chinese people but the novel coronavirus, said Yao Fei, the minister counsellor of the Chinese Embassy in Madrid, at a press conference. The conference was called to help spread a message of calm over the virus, which has so far claimed over 400 lives after originating in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. Fears of the outbreak have led to a rise in discrimination against some people of Chinese origin in Spain and elsewhere in Europe, Yao said. “The enemy is the virus, not the Chinese,” he added, saying that both China and its nationals were working tirelessly to contain the spread of the epidemic, which has infected more than 20,000 people. “All Chinese people in China and out are working together in this historic struggle that we have against the coronavirus,” Yao said. The number of people who have recovered from the virus now exceeds that of fatalities, he said, adding that the Chinese government has been working with complete “transparency.” “We have the determination, the confidence and the capacity to win the battle against the coronavirus,” he stressed, thanking Spain and other countries for their “significant, enormous and valuable support to China, which is something we value greatly.” In related development, Vice Premier Hu Chunhua has called for greater efforts to ensure supply of agricultural products and strengthen epidemic prevention and control of the novel coronavirus in rural areas. Hu, also chief of the State Council leading group of poverty alleviation and development, made the remarks during a video teleconference Wednesday. Migrant workers’ returning to work will be well-organized and nearby entrepreneurship and employment were encouraged, Hu said. Efforts shall be made to strengthen the production and supply of vegetables, meat, eggs and milk, grain and other daily necessities, as well as keeping the supply channels unblocked, he said. Hu also called for solid preparations for spring ploughing and striving to achieve a bumper harvest of grain throughout the year. Stressing the need to restore hog production as soon as possible, Hu called for enhanced efforts to prevent animal infectious diseases and prompt response to new outbreaks. Xinhua "

,"February 6, 2020",nCov,Coronavirus infects at least 10 on Japan cruise ship,Agence France-Presse,"YOKOHAMA, Japan: Thousands were marooned on a cruise ship off the Japanese coast on Wednesday, after medics evacuated 10 people infected with the deadly coronavirus, with many facing an anxious wait for their own test results. Passengers on board the Diamond Princess are being confined to their cabins for as long as 14 days and many expressed concern about medication running out. Tests are being carried out on samples taken from 273 of the 3,711 people on board after a former passenger who disembarked in Hong Kong was diagnosed with the virus that has claimed almost 500 lives in China, where it originated. ISOLATED The Diamond Princess cruise ship (top, center) is seen off the port of Yokohama on Wednesday. AFP PHOTO Japanese Health Minister Katsunobu Kato told parliament on Tuesday that tests are being conducted on three groups: those presenting symptoms; those who disembarked in Hong Kong and those who had been in close contact with the infected passenger. Of the 31 results received so far, 10 people tested positive for the virus. They were removed from the vessel and taken to medical facilities, Kato said. The cruise operator said around half the passengers on board the ship are Japanese but there were no immediate details on the nationalities of the other travelers. One Japanese man in his 70s told public broadcaster NHK that stricter quarantine measures came into force on Wednesday. “Until yesterday, we were able to spend time in common spaces and do things like play ping-pong. But from this morning, we have not been allowed to go out of our rooms,” said the man, who declined to be identified. “I tried to go to a restaurant this morning for breakfast but I was told: ‘Please eat in your room.’ So I have been waiting for room service. But it hasn’t arrived yet.” Kato appealed for the passengers and crew, who come from 56 countries, to cooperate with authorities, and said he assumed the quarantine would last around 14 days — the estimated maximum incubation period for the virus. ‘Staring at the sea’
Meanwhile, thousands on board a similar cruise ship that docked in Hong Kong on Wednesday were also being checked, officials said, after three recent passengers tested positive for coronavirus. “Our medical staff immediately went on board to do health check-ups,” said Leung Yiu-hong, an official with the city’s Centre for Health Protection. “Unless they have permission from the Department of Health, all passengers and crew members are not allowed to get off,” he added. More than 20 countries have confirmed cases of the virus, which has infected more than 24,000 in mainland China. The outbreak has prompted the World Health Organization to declare a global health emergency, several governments to impose travel restrictions, and airlines to suspend flights to and from China. Japan has now confirmed 23 cases of the new coronavirus — excluding the cruise ship infections — among them citizens returning from Wuhan, the Chinese city at the center of the outbreak. Tokyo has evacuated more than 500 Japanese citizens from Wuhan, and attracted some criticism for its relatively loose quarantine approach. There have been several incidences of apparent person-to-person transmission in Japan, including a tour guide and bus driver who contracted the virus after coming into contact with visitors from Wuhan. Neither had visited China in recent months. The Diamond Princess is now steaming further out to sea to perform what operator Princess Cruises described as “normal marine operations” before returning off Yokohama to stock up with “food, provisions and other supplies.” One woman on the ship told TV Asahi she was resigned to her fate. “I think you have to accept that we’re staying on the ship. But what I am going to do for 14 days in a cabin? I’m just staring at the sea.” AFP "
,"February 6, 2020",nCov,Zhong Nanshan amends prediction for coronavirus peak,The Manila Times,"The novel coronavirus outbreak may reach its peak in the next 10 to 14 days, Zhong Nanshan, a leading expert tackling the virus, said on Sunday, amending his previous prediction on Jan 28 that the epidemic would peak in seven or 10 days. Zhong, also an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, said current research has shown the virus originated from bats, but whether there are more intermediate carriers between bats and humans requires further investigation. Although there is no effective cure yet, there are at least seven drugs targeting the virus’ genetic material going through various stages of clinical trials, he told Xinhua News Agency. A vaccine is also in the works, though it requires more time to reach clinical application. Chinese renowned respiratory scientist Zhong Nanshan receives an interview with Xinhua in Guangzhou, South China’s Guangdong province, Jan 28, 2020. XINHUA PHOTO “We have learned from the successful therapy of SARS and established a set of effective treatment plans,” he said. “And with the help of various life-support measures we have ensured the recovery success rate of patients.” Based on available information, the medium age of the infected patient is around 59, and 56 percent of all patients are male, he said. The average incubation period of the virus is around five days, with fever being the most common symptom of the virus. There have been a few reported cases of infected patients that showed no obvious symptoms, but they are in the minority and the bulk of preventive efforts should focus on the majority of patients, he said. Zhong stressed the most effective preventive measures are still early detection and quarantine. “The epidemic is still at its growing phase, but we believe it won’t lead to a massive nationwide pandemic, only regional ones if they occur.” Prolonging the Spring Festival holidays, controlling traffic, temperature checks and education as well as other government measures have effectively cut off the source of infection and greatly reduced the spread of the virus, he said. “We believe the epidemic will peak in the next 10 to 14 days, but we still need to enhance preventive measures and not lower our guard,” he said, adding there are many challenges in the current effort. The first is that the outbreak occurs in concentrated areas, stretching local medical resources thin. This situation may improve in the near future, as Wuhan is building two dedicated hospitals and medical personnel and equipment are pouring in from around the country. The second issue is how to differentiate between patients with the common flu and those infected with coronavirus, which can be a tricky task since both illnesses share symptoms. Local hospitals should improve their diagnostic capabilities to relieve some of the workload from hospitals designated to treat the virus, he said. The third issue is how to optimize management and resource allocation to better protect hospitals and medical staff working on the frontline from infections. Zhong said scientists still know relatively little about the novel coronavirus, and he urged them to speed up their research to help tackle the epidemic. “The SARS epidemic 17 years ago lasted nearly six months, since then we have made considerable progress in preventing and controlling major infectious diseases, so we have the confidence to effectively curb today’s outbreak.” "

This photo taken on January 30, 2020 shows a medical staff member getting lunch boxes for patients through a window in an isolation ward at a hospital in Wuhan in China’s central Hubei province, during the virus outbreak in the city.

Remdesivir has also been used for emergency treatment of patients with Ebola. But the drug has not yet been officially licensed or approved for treatment by any global health organization, Gilead added. Gilead is not the only drug firm hoping to find a successful treatment for the coronavirus. Big Pharma rivals Johnson & Johnson and GlaxoSmithKline are also working on vaccines. Biotech company AbbVie said it had seen promising results for treating the Wuhan coronavirus with a mixture of two of its HIV medications and Tamiflu, which is produced in a joint venture by Swiss pharma giant Roche and Japan’s Chugai Pharmaceutical Co. Smaller drug producers Moderna, Inovio Pharmaceuticals and Novavax are also working on treatments. Their stocks have all surged in the past month.

,"February 5, 2020",nCov,Indonesian-controlled newspaper’s alarmist coronavirus coverage,Rigoberto D. Tiglao,"RIGOBERTO D. TIGLAO THIS certainly is another case that proves the wisdom of the Constitution’s framers when they banned the slightest foreign participation in media. The Philippine Star, ultimately controlled by Indonesian tycoon Anthoni Salim through PLDT Inc., last Monday had a banner headline that shocked many: “PH nCoV patients jump to 80.” That is so patently false: we have had only two 2019 novel coronavirus acute respiratory disease (2019-nCoV ARD) cases so far, both involving two Chinese who came from Wuhan, one of whom died the other day. The Health department’s latest official bulletin reports that only 48 individuals are being monitored to determine if they have been infected with the virus. There is no way for anyone, journalistically or linguistically, to claim that even just these 48 persons are “nCoV patients.” They are not patients. Period. The dictionary definition of a “patient,” as any English-speaking person knows, is a person receiving or registered to receive medical treatment for a disease. But these 48 haven’t been infected with the virus, they haven’t received treatment for anything. The Philippine Star itself revealed its stupidity — or nefarious intention to disseminate fake, alarmist news — when it reported that out of these 80 supposed nCoV patients, there were “74 who may have come into contact with the victim.” Some 66 have been advised to “undergo home quarantine for 14 days,” while eight are “people under investigation.” Nope, only two infected so far. So, even as it reported that 66 have been asked to go home and eight are still under investigation, the Star still headlined the report that “coronavirus patients” in the Philippines “jump to 80.” The Philippine Star banner headline was as shocking as it was patently false: out of 17,386 coronavirus patients in 27 countries (February 3 data), 17,205 or 99 percent are in China, which also accounts for a total 361 deaths except for one (here in the Philippines). The next most-infected country is Japan, which has 25 cases. Seven other countries have nCoV patients of 10 or more, which, significantly, are the top countries most visited by Chinese tourists: Thailand with 19; Hong Kong, 15, South Korea, 15; Singapore, 13; Australia, 12; the United States, 11; Germany, 10; and Taiwan, 10. The Philippine Star would have the world think that next to China, we have the most cases of nCoV patients with 80. First boo-boo this year. The Star is part of the multimedia empire controlled by the Indonesian Salim, whose Maynilad Water Services Inc. has been in President Rodrigo Duterte’s crosshairs as allegedly having concluded a water concession contract with previous governments that have only now been found to be disadvantageous to consumers. Salim controls the Star though the holding firm MediaQuest, set up by the pension fund of PLDT, which the son of Suharto’s biggest crony has commanded since 1998. Other than the Star, Salim’s media empire — now the largest in the country — includes BusinessWorld, Channel 5, about a dozen radio stations and Cignal, now the largest cable TV operator. The coronavirus outbreak has generated a wave of misinformation through social media, mostly exaggeration of the epidemic’s deadliness and speed of contagion. There has also been a surge of anti-China sentiment, because the virus originated from Wuhan, and accounts for 99 percent of those infected. What makes the Star’s fake news so condemnable is that it is the first, and apparently only, newspaper of significant circulation to spread such disinformation. The disinformation in social media has spread so fast that Facebook announced that it would delete content “with false claims or conspiracy theories that have been flagged by leading global health organizations and local health authorities. “ Here, the Yellows have disgustingly been using the disease outbreak to fan anti-China xenophobia, and even blame Duterte for the virus also being here. This insanity comes from their odium against him who has pivoted our foreign policy form one of servility to the US that they preferred to an independent one, with more emphasis on closer ties with the emerging superpower in our part of the world. This is the second time this year that the Philippine Star bannered (i.e., put as its main news, in the largest fonts for the issue) alarmist news that distorted facts. Its January 21 banner read: “Phivolcs: Taal recharging for powerful eruption,” which was republished by not a few news outlets, including Microsoft News (Msn.com). The news sensationalized the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology’s report the previous day that there “appear[ed]” to be a resupply of magma beneath Taal. There was no such categorical statement from Phivolcs or any of its officials that Taal would soon have a powerful eruption. Two days later, the Phivolcs lowered the alert levels for the volcano from 4 to 3. Email: tiglao.manilatimes@gmail.com

,"February 4, 2020",nCov,Xi Focus: Commanding China’s fight against novel coronavirus outbreak,Xinhua,"BEIJING, Feb. 2 (Xinhua) — A new hospital built in just ten days in a Chinese city hit hardest by the novel coronavirus outbreak will soon start operation. Approved by Chairman of the Central Military Commission Xi Jinping, 1,400 medical staff from the armed forces are tasked with treating patients in the 1,000-bed Huoshenshan Hospital in Wuhan starting from Monday. This is the latest development in the Chinese people’s critical battle against the novel coronavirus outbreak, with the number of cumulative confirmed cases on the Chinese mainland reaching 14,380 by the end of Saturday. Commanding this fight is President Xi Jinping, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee. Under Xi’s leadership, China has taken unprecedented measures to contain the outbreak, pooling national medical personnel and supplies to the hardest hit regions, building new hospitals, extending the Chinese Lunar New Year holiday, postponing the opening dates for schools and businesses, and imposing travel restrictions. The nation is currently experiencing a peak period of confirmed cases. With prevention and control measures in place, the number of future infections will be significantly reduced, said Li Lanjuan, a renowned Chinese epidemiologist. World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said China’s measures are not only protecting its people, but also protecting the people in the whole world. President Xi’s personal guidance and deployment show his great leadership capability, Tedros said. TOP PRIORITY
Over the past few weeks, Xi has called multiple meetings, heard reports and made important instructions on the prevention and control work. The message is crystal clear: people always come first. Before the Chinese Lunar New Year, as the epidemic spread, Xi ordered resolute efforts to curb the spread, stressing people’s lives and health as the top priority. On Jan. 25, the first day of the Chinese Lunar New Year, Xi chaired a meeting of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee. He reiterated putting people’s lives and health as the top priority and ordered Party committees and governments at all levels to take novel coronavirus outbreak prevention and control as the most important task. On Jan. 27, in an instruction to Party organizations, members and officials, Xi asked them to keep in mind that the people’s interests are the highest priority in the current arduous battle. Xi said in an instruction to the military that the epidemic prevention and control remained grim and complex and demanded the armed forces shoulder their responsibility, fight the hard battle and actively assist local authorities in fighting the epidemic. UNIFIED COMMAND, JOINT EFFORTS
Following a unified command and pooling together efforts from all sectors are key to China’s battle against the novel coronavirus outbreak. At the Jan. 25 meeting of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, a central leading group was set up to form a unified command to oversee the prevention and control work in different localities. In the Jan. 27 instruction, Xi asked Party organizations, officials and members to unite the people in resolutely implementing the decisions and arrangements of the CPC Central Committee, to let the Party flag “fly high at the frontline of the battleground.” On Jan. 28, Xi told Tedros that China has full confidence and capability to win the battle against the virus with concerted efforts, scientific containment and targeted policies under the strong leadership of the CPC. The joint task mechanism was repeatedly stressed. It would help fortify a strong defense against the outbreak by mass participation, according to Xi. INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION
As the virus is highly contagious, the entire world is looking to China’s prevention and control efforts. Xi has stressed releasing information in a timely manner and deepening international cooperation. The Jan. 25 meeting of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee underscored the timely, accurate and transparent release of information to address concerns from home and abroad. Xi told Tedros that China attaches great importance to the cooperation with the WHO. China is ready to work with the WHO as well as the international community to safeguard regional and global public health security, Xi said. "
,"February 4, 2020",nCov,Thailand uses drug cocktail to treat coronavirus patient,Agence France-Presse,"BANGKOK: A Chinese woman infected with the new coronavirus showed a dramatic improvement after she was treated with a cocktail of anti-virals used to treat flu and HIV, Thailand’s health ministry said on Sunday. The 71-year-old patient tested negative for the virus 48 hours after Thai doctors administered the combination, doctor Kriengsak Attipornwanich said during the ministry’s daily press briefing. “The lab result of positive on the coronavirus turned negative in 48 hours,” Kriengsak said. “From being exhausted before, she could sit up in bed 12 hours later.” The doctors combined the anti-flu drug oseltamivir with lopinavir and ritonavir, anti-virals used to treat HIV, Kriengsak said, adding the ministry was awaiting research results to prove the findings. The news comes as the new virus claimed its first life outside China — a 44-year-old Chinese man who died in the Philippines — while the death toll in China has soared above 300. Thailand so far has detected 19 confirmed cases of the virus believed to have originated in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, which is under lockdown. That is the second highest number of cases outside of China, with Japan recording 20. So far, eight patients in Thailand have recovered and returned home, while 11 remain in hospital. In a video released Sunday, Health Minister Anutin Charnvirakul visited a patient from Wuhan who had recovered from the coronavirus, chatting with her amicably in Mandarin as she thanked him and the medical staff. Thai authorities are trying to balance screening of inbound Chinese visitors with the economic needs of its tourist sector, which is heavily reliant on arrivals from the mainland. Messages of support saying “Our hearts to Wuhan” in English, Chinese and Thai were plastered on a Bangkok mall popular with tourists. The bulk of confirmed cases have been Chinese visitors to Thailand, but on Thursday the kingdom recorded its first human-to-human transmission when a Thai taxi driver was diagnosed with the disease. The taxi driver had not traveled to China, but may have had contact with tourists. Thailand’s government is also battling public criticism that it has been slow to evacuate scores of its citizens from Hubei province, at the centre of the outbreak. Anutin said evacuation would happen on Tuesday, and the returnees would be quarantined for 14 days. AFP "
,"February 4, 2020",nCov,Coronavirus now in Tarlac – reports,Jerry Hernandez,"TARLAC: Health experts in this province are now on high alert over reports that the 2019 novel coronavirus acute respiratory disease (2019-nCoV ARD) has reached the province. The reports said six suspected carriers had been confined at a hospital here. On Sunday, the patients, including Americans, Japanese and a Filipino with histories of travel to Hong Kong last January 10 to 22, with flu-like symptoms were initially brought to a hospital in Paniqui town. They were then told to go to the regional epidemiology and surveillance unit (RESU) but instead chose to proceed to the Jecson’s Medical Center (JMC) in Tarlac City and calls were made to the Department of Health (DoH) but no commitment for space was given for their transfer. The JMC, through Dr. Jose Chua Jr., then decided to confine the patients at the facility’s still dormant Station 1. Subsequently, Chua was informed that the DoH-RESU personnel were on their way to the JMC to get sample specimens for laboratory examination at the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) in Muntinlupa City. “We don’t want this to happen, but faced with the challenge, united we are strong,” he said. Meanwhile, Tarlac City Mayor Cristy Angeles issued an executive order on Monday mandating all private and public hospitals, including clinics, to report to her office any patient suspected of carrying the virus. She said instructions were given to city health officer Carmela Go and Hensel Quiling, city disaster risk reduction and management office head, to conduct tight monitoring and quarantine of persons under investigation or PUI until the laboratory results are provided by the RITM. Gov. Susan Yap, on the other hand, urged citizens to practice proper hygiene and sanitation to prevent getting infected with the virus. Local officials called on residents to remain calm and avoid panicking, offering more prayers for their safety. In Negros Occidental, the governor on Monday confirmed that two patients in the province are now PUI for suspected coronavirus. Eugenio Jose Lacson made the confirmation after a close-door meeting with officials from the Provincial Health Office and the Provincial Disaster Risk Reduction Management Office. The governor said one patient is a foreigner from Taiwan while the second one is a overseas Filipino worker (OFW) who arrived recently from Hong Kong. The foreigner was brought to the Corazon Locsin Montelibano Memorial Regional Hospital last Friday followed by the Filipino patient last Saturday. Both patients initially went to a private hospital in the city but were referred to a government health facility. Lacson said both patients exhibited “flu-like” symptoms. The governor added that medical staff of the hospital have already taken the patients’ swab samples. The patients were placed under quarantine while awaiting the results of the samples from the RITM. Lacson said they expect result of the test of the Taiwanese onTuesday and that of the OFW, a woman, by Wednesday. The governor reiterated his call for calm, urging the public to continue with their normal routine. Lacson clarified that “there is no confirmed case yet of the virus in the province.” He ordered all local government units in the province to form their respective task forces against nCoV, and a second meeting will take place today in order to come up with steps against the virus. Lacson appealed to private hospitals in Negros Occidental “ to be prepared and I hope that when there is a need for them to admit cases like these [two cases], they should be willing to treat them.” "
,"February 3, 2020",nCov,"A sober, fact-based piece on the coronavirus threat",Rigoberto D. Tiglao,"RIGOBERTO D. TIGLAO THANK God for social media, or I wouldn’t have chanced upon the following sober, knowledgeable and concise piece posted in Facebook on the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) threat,. Well-researched and written, it beats any article or bulletin here and abroad I’ve read in informing the layman what the 2019-nCoV novel coronavirus is, and the threat it poses. It’s not that usual for a busy physician to write on a scientific topic that makes it understandable and concise enough for a busy layman. The author is Bien Manlutac, an internist at prestigious hospitals in Manila. He should be the next health secretary. Because of the topic’s extreme relevance at this time I am devoting this column’s space to his Facebook piece, which was entitled, “Should we push the panic button on the 2019-nCoV threat in the Philippines?” Manlutac piece
“I am sharing this as an unsolicited advice based on my research from very credible, updated sources as of Jan. 31, 2020. For disclosure, I am an internist-nephrologist with 22 years of clinical experience as a physician, but not an infectious disease specialist, so please take my advice with that grain of salt and keep yourself updated as new information and discoveries come along. To those with more correct and new data, please supply me with such so that we can relay as much useful news to the public as necessary and defuse unwarranted panic. The 2019-nCoV was discovered in 2019 from an outbreak of mostly mild to sometimes severe respiratory diseases in Wuhan, China, hence the designation “2019” and “n” for novel or new. It belongs to the family of coronavirus, one of about seven known, including those that cause the common colds, flu and the deadlier severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), to infect animals and humans. The medical world does not know a ton about it yet but scientists are working on the new phenomenon that now surprisingly has become newsworthy because precisely it was not known before and new, and projected as a seemingly major health threat to humans by media. The 2019-nCoV are fairly common in many species, including cats, cattle, camels, civets and bats but the Wuhan (market) experience has recently suggested that the virus has evolved and had caused animal-to- human transmission and infection resulting in clinical disease. Person-to-person transmission has since been the major source of infection. Once a person gets infected, he can spread the virus mainly through aerosolized respiratory droplets when he sneezes or coughs out the virus, much in the same way as the common flu, SARS and MERS are transmitted. Theoretically, the main route of infection is through the respiratory route meaning by inhaling the virus, but as discovered can be contracted through direct mucosal contact from exposed bodily parts or contaminated sources but apparently less likely from clothing and objects. There is no robust data yet as to how long the virus can survive outside of the body and become infective but initial studies report it can only survive for less than six hours, even less in warm conditions. It is also not known yet how soon one can get infected but analysis of confirmed cases who were with close contacts of infected persons suggests that one can contract it from two to14 days from an infected person, whether symptomatic or not, who is sneezing or coughing from 3 to 6 feet away. Transmissibility
The World Health Organization (WHO) estimated the “R0 (R-nought)” of the new virus at between 1.4 to 2.5, meaning on average 1 sick person would be likely to infect 1.4 to 2.5 persons. In comparison, it pales in transmissibility to the measles virus, which is highly contagious with a R0 of 12 to 18 unprotected persons. So, what are your chances of having been exposed or will be exposed to an infected person? As of the time of writing, available health department data says there are 29 patients under investigation, meaning suspected of having the virus — (1 Eastern Visayas, 4 Central Visayas, 3 Western Visayas, 1 MiMaRoPa, 1 Northern Mindanao,1 Davao, and 18 NCR) — and only 1 confirmed case. The woman from Wuhan who came to the Philippines last January 25 via Hong Kong went to San Lazaro Hospital with a mild cough and at present is asymptomatic. Of the 29 patients under investigation, one has died but the cause of death is unknown yet. There are sporadic cases in Asia, Australia, Europe and US but majority of the 7,700 plus cases are in Wuhan or have come from that area or got exposed to patients with the disease. As of Feb. 2, 2020 (From worldometers.info. RDT’s addition not in the Facebook post). Having said these, the chances of you getting infected in the Philippines is really very low at the moment unless you traveled to Wuhan recently, or was in the same plane as the Chinese woman who arrived last January 25, or was in close contact with her. The disease presents as mild respiratory illness just like the common flu with cough, colds and fever but can get worse to include difficulty of breathing and respiratory failure in worst cases. As of this writing, there have been 180 reported deaths attributed to the virus out of 7,700 plus cases many of whom had mild disease only and have fully recovered already. Just like many other viral illnesses, it appears to be self-limiting as well as to abate with or without specific treatment. SARS or MERS
Given these figures, the chance of one dying from the virus is under 3 percent, meaning the 2019-nCoV is not even close to being as deadly as the virus that caused SARS (10 percent) or MERS (35 percent) that originated from civets and camels, respectively. The more common H. Influenza (bacteria that causes ear infections in children and bronchitis in adults is even deadlier with a case-fatality rate of 3-6 percent in children and a higher mortality rate in adults >65 years old who develop invasive disease. The following are deemed at higher risk of contracting the virus when exposed to a sick person: young children (>5 years old), >65 years old, diabetics, those with chronic kidney disease, COPD, organ transplant patients and immuno-compromised states such as HIV, asplenia, or on chemotherapy. Doctors and hospital personnel are at a greater risk of getting in contact with the virus than the general population at large because of the nature of their work. Treatment is mainly supportive. Many of the deaths from confirmed cases were in the susceptible groups and older patients. If and when you get infected, relax, there is a high 98 percent chance you will live happily ever after. Being novel, a vaccine has not been developed yet for the 2019-nCoV. Hence, protecting yourself by improving your immune system and wearing personal protective equipment are imperative. Being the largest virus in the coronavirus family, an ordinary surgical mask is enough to confer “protection” from the extremely small possibility of inhaling the nCoV given there has been only one case. The N95 mask is designed to prevent inhalation of smaller organisms. In order to protect yourself, a surgical mask would suffice for now (if it’s needed at all), plus frequent washing with soap, or using alcogels or 70 percent alcohol. N95 masks may be better suited and more useful for health care workers at the moment. Remove work clothes as soon as one gets home and wash with detergent and sun dry. If you have a respiratory illness, or insanely suspect you have the virus even when you did not even have close contact with the one confirmed case or have not traveled to Wuhan recently, you are likewise advised to cover your cough or sneeze not with your hands but with a tissue paper and dispose of it immediately and properly. When you don’t have tissue paper, use your sleeve as a shield to lessen the chance of depositing the virus on surfaces that you may handle. I will periodically edit this post as new/correct data trickle in. In the meantime, if you read this and you belong to the general public and not the susceptible groups, is not a doctor or hospital personnel, don’t have symptoms, or didn’t have contact with at least a PUI or the Chinese woman, or did not leave the country recently, do not stress yourself with undue worry because of these aforementioned statements now known about the virus. In Tagalog, “Huwag kang ma-praning.” Do not fear or panic when you read the negative news and vibes generated by mainstream media as well as social media from shared and forwarded posts/messages. Derive, share and believe scientific info coming from credible sources like DoH.gov.ph or CDC.org, and not from invalidated, incredible ones.” Email: tiglao.manilatimes@gmail.com

,"February 3, 2020",nCov,Tokyo to ‘strengthen testing’ for coronavirus before Olympics,Agence France-Presse,"TOKYO: Tokyo governor Yuriko Koike promised Sunday to implement “thorough measures” to protect people from the deadly coronavirus in the run-up to this summer’s Olympic Games. At the opening of the $330 million Ariake Arena, venue for Olympic volleyball and Paralympic wheelchair basketball, Koike said: “I will implement even more stringent measures to tackle infectious diseases. I am having discussions this weekend with senior officials to assure the safety and security of people in Tokyo — specifically focusing on ways to prevent the spread of the virus and strengthen testing systems.” Koike also urged people to wash their hands and wear surgical masks to help protect them from disease. Japan has warned citizens against non-essential travel to China, where the outbreak began, and fast-tracked new rules including limits on entering the country as it tries to contain the spread of the virulent new coronavirus. The flu-like pathogen, which originated in Hubei’s provincial capital Wuhan, has resulted in more than 300 deaths in China. No deaths have been reported so far in Japan. The health scare has led to the cancellation of Olympic qualifying events in China such as boxing and badminton. Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has said the travel warning for China will be raised to level two on the country’s four-point system, advising people to “avoid travel that is not urgent or is not necessary”. The ribbon-cutting for Ariake Arena on Tokyo’s waterfront leaves just the Olympics aquatics centre as the last of eight permanent venues under construction, set to be completed later this month. The new national stadium, built at a cost of $1.4 billion, was unveiled last December after the initial blueprints were torn up by Abe following public anger over spiralling costs. The Tokyo Olympics begin on July 24 with the Paralympics starting on August 25. AFP "

The leading private hospital sent a letter report to Santiago’s office, assuring there is no suspected 2019-nCov infected patients confined in their premises. This advisory was issued in wake of misleading posts of some netizens in the social media, saying there are patients with nCov admitted to several hospitals in this city. A letter reaching Santiago’s office came from St. Anne General Hospital, Mt. Carmel Diocesan Hospital and Lucena United Doctors Hospital said as of press time, there are no patients with nCov in their respective hospitals. The hospitals appealed to the netizens to refrain from posting alarming though fake information because the 2019-nCov is a serious disease. They condemned such act of irresponsibility of some netizens who sow fear among the people of Quezon, instead of posting preventive measures to avoid the virus. "
,"February 3, 2020",nCov,Cebu Pac shares drop on coronavirus fears,Tyrone Jasper C. Piad,"The shares of Cebu Pacific operator Cebu Air Inc. dropped by 10.50 percent week-on-week due to fears over 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), with analysts saying that the airline’s first quarter earnings may decline from flight cancellations. On Friday, Cebu Air shares slid by P2.80 or 3.60 percent to close at P75 apiece from the previous day amid the 2.60-percent plunge for the benchmark Philippine Stock Exchange index. Cebu Pacific Air Airbus A320-200 RP-C3242 NRT. PHOTO BY MASAKATSU UKON VIA WIKIMEDIA COMMONS The budget airline operator’s shares have gone down by 14.77 percent year-to-date. “Investors are pricing in the impact of the outbreak on [Cebu Air’s] financials. As for the cancellation of flights, it will hit bottom-line figures through forgone revenues,” Philstocks Financial Inc. senior research analyst Japhet Tantiangco said. Cebu Pacific recently cancelled its flights to and from China — Beijing, Shanghai, Xiamen, Guangzhou, Shenzen — Macau and Hong Kong as a safety precaution amid the 2019-nCoV outbreak. The trips booked for February 2 to March 29 were affected by the said cancellation. Affected passengers were already notified, the budget airline operator said, giving them the option to rebook flight, refund tickets in full, and store ticket value for future use. Tantiangco said that with the 2019-nCoV still at large, it was possible that passengers would hold their trips for a while. This would be going to weigh on the airline’s net earnings, he added. It was earlier reported that Cebu Pacific might see a drop in net income from flight cancellations, noting that P3 to P4 billion loss was accounted during the Severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak in 2003. But the airline was optimistic that this would not drag on for several months, citing efforts to address the matter. “Passengers will take refunds and given the ongoing epidemic scare, they are seen to abstain from further traveling or at the very least limit it to the essentials,” he said. Diversified Securities trader Aniceto Pangan shared the same sentiment, noting that flight cancellations “will reduce the capacity of the airline by 13 percent.” Regina Capital Development Corp. head of sales Luis Limlingan, meanwhile, said that Cebu Pacific could offset the flight cancellations “with other destinations not affected by the virus.” The airline might also want to focus on its other segments for now, he said, citing cargo business. Timson Securities trader Darren Pangan expressed some optimism. “Bargain hunters may come back to pick up their shares especially when the outlook for the industry recovers,” he said. Last week, the Department of Health reported that a 38-year old female tourist from Wuhan, now quarantined in an unidentified hospital, had tested positive for the 2019-nCov, making her the country’s first confirmed case.

,"February 2, 2020",nCov,2019 novel coronavirus: Facts and hysteria,NEW WORLDS,"GEORGE SIY The best remedy for outbreaks and a possible calamity is a calm study, practical decisions and quick execution. Hysteria needs to be managed or the medical issues will take longer to control and resolve, with much greater economic and social damage than necessary. While everyone should take precautions, the current virus outbreak already shows several points that allow us to calibrate our responses: The novel coronavirus (nCoV) has a low mortality compared to TB, flu, HIV, etc… The flu killed an estimated 80 thousand in the US (https://www.businessinsider.com/wuhan-coronavirus-lesser-threat-to-americans-than-flu-2020-1) alone in 2017-2018 (Center for Disease Control); more than 1.5 million are newly infected with AIDS HIV each year, with some over 600 thousand dying each year; over 1.5 million a year die from Tuberculosis (TB). nCoV trajectory of mortality is much lower (https://www.businessinsider.com/how-wuhan-coronavirus-compares-to-other-outbreaks-pandemics-2020-1), with less than 5 percent mortality so far out of some 20 percent of people who are susceptible when exposed, usually those with weakened immune systems. (The Chinese researchers themselves warned though that this data may not yet be at stabilized levels, and could still mutate.)
China’s Disease Management has been advancing rapidly.  Once the disease was defined, China restricted travel and activity in Wuhan, a city of 11 million, much larger than Chicago of 5 million or New York of some 9 million.  It also restricted activities in several other nearby cities despite the most important festivity of the Chinese New Year, compare this with the occurrence of the H1N1 which started in the USA, but did not or could not restrict movement, eventually with a mortality of over 250 thousand .  China also showed the infrastructure capabilities by building a 1000-bed hospital within a week (https://edition.cnn.com/videos/world/2020/01/31/hospitals-being-built-urgently-for-coronavirus-patients-in-wuhan-china-lc-lon-orig.cnn), and another ongoing this second week. Chinese strengthened disease control.  The World Health Organization (WHO) praised the current open and fast communications with and from China allowing quick establishment of “global prevention and control systems” (https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/29/watch-who-officials-hold-press-conference-on-coronavirus-as-outbreak-worsens.html).  WHO leaders commended China’s response to this outbreak as model for other epidemics.  China is openly working with other countries, contacted the lab in Germany to tell them they had a return positive case.  WHO Health Emergencies Programme Michael Ryan reported that China actively reached out to WHO and other countries to help them respond in more effective ways, and has agreed to welcome an international experts mission.  They also shared research efforts, information in virus gene sequencing.  A China Wuxi-based tech company has also developed by last week, a rapid nucleic test diagnostic kit (http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2020-01/31/c_138745729.htm) that can determine in half an hour if you have the disease, and has started mass production to several thousand kits a day.  There are critics though that at the outset of the disease, the signals of an unusual outbreak was not immediately acted upon. Other countries are pitching in. Germany, Japan, Israel and others have been sending medical supplies, masks, which are in shortage, and even their researchers to help in the efforts to tame this outbreak. Be Calm and Verify News, get Perspective.  Local news released by a TV station released news of a boy as “infected by coronavirus”, not understanding that the coronavirus is a fairly common illness category,  and the boy recovered within 3 days, and tested negative, where the current concern is over the nCoV or Wuhan variety.  But not before creating panic.  Few Philippine media report that over a hundred patients of the disease have already recovered, while reporting other cases that have died of other illnesses as somehow linked to this category.  Many Filipinos in Wuhan (https://www.facebook.com/idsicenter/videos/483798625883502/) have shared videos on social media showing that while there are many inconveniences, overall life is normal and plead with Pinoys back home to avoid over-reaction and Sinophobia. Ambeth Ocampo laments that fanning anti-Chinese resentment (https://opinion.inquirer.net/126992/epidemic-and-massacre-in-1820-manila) and connecting it to the 2019-nCoV might lead to events going out of hand as in a cholera epidemic in Manila in 1820 that saw a mob of some 3000 go on a rampage on the speculations that it was due to a poisoning fo the river by foreigners, which turned out untrue. MANAGE PRIORITIES, CALIBRATE OUR RESPONSES, base decisions on Facts and Logic.  We should treat this outbreak seriously and contain risk areas, but like a business, we  cannot shutdown everything because of possible recessions or competitors, or political situations.  We cannot leave our relations because of any various disagreements, but we need to calibrate our responses.  Tuberculosis and HIV are currently creating infections in alarming rates in the Philippines for years, on top of the periodic dengue outbreaks (UNAIDS reported in October 2019: the Philippines had the fastest growing number of HIV cases(https://www.doh.gov.ph/node/10649) in the world). We need a RESPONSE and MANAGEMENT SYSTEM for all types of outbreaks, calamities, economic and other crises— which should arise from facts and logic, discipline, good execution, and not the emotions, hysteria, unverified news, advice of people who have more opinions than record of success or experience.

,"February 2, 2020",nCov,The great coronavirus scare,Ben Kritz,"MAKE no mistake, infection by the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) causes serious and, in some cases, life-threatening illness, and the outbreak is having some significant economic impact. The real epidemic of what is being commonly called the “Wuhan virus” may not be the potentially deadly virus itself, but rather the media and political reactions to it, which are fueling a global panic. A few unalloyed facts Before I explain that assertion, let us review what is known about the virus so far. 2019-nCoV is similar to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus that created a global panic in 2003, and essentially causes pneumonia in an infected person. The coronavirus was apparently first detected around December 8 in Wuhan, and is believed to have spread from animals or animal meat to humans by way of one wet market in that city. The first death from 2019-nCoV was recorded in Wuhan on January 9. The airborne virus is highly contagious, and can be spread by close contact with infected persons. The infection takes between two and 10 days to reveal itself through symptoms. Researchers are uncertain whether an infected person can spread the virus during the incubation period, but they suspect that is probably the case, given how quickly the infection has spread. They have determined that each infected person, on average, will infect from one to three other people before being isolated for treatment. As of this writing (January 30), 7,711 cases have been positively identified and there have been 171 deaths, with the vast majority of cases being recorded in China. There have been 93 confirmed cases in 20 other countries so far. By the time this reaches print, all those numbers would have gone up, but the mortality rate would probably not. Although it can cause serious illness, 2019-nCoV has a mortality rate of just 2.2 percent, much less than SARS (about 10 percent) or Ebola, which kills half the people it infects. Here in the Philippines, there have been about two dozen people placed under observation on suspicion that they might be infected, and one of those died in San Lazaro Hospital in Manila on Wednesday. That patient, however, was later found to have other serious health problems and was not infected with 2019-nCoV. As of late Thursday, just one of the other suspected cases had been confirmed. Going overboard? In response to the epidemic, 194 countries have imposed some sort of restrictions, from implementing extra screening of travelers at airports to completely closing their borders to travelers from China. Several countries, including the Philippines, have either moved to evacuate their citizens from the worst-affected areas in China, in particular Hubei province, or are finalizing plans to do so. China, for its part, has imposed draconian measures to try to stop the spread of the virus. Wuhan and most of the other urban centers in Hubei have been placed under lockdown, with residents told to stay indoors. There have been travel restrictions of varying severity in other parts of the country, as well, which severely constrained normal life and business during the busy Lunar New Year holiday last week. Several overseas companies with operations in China have suspended them, including Ayala-led Integrated Micro-electronics Inc., which has delayed the postholiday restart of operations at four of its China-based facilities until at least February 10, according to a company statement on January 30. Google also announced it was closing four of its Chinese offices, and Starbucks said it would temporarily close about half of its 2,400 stores in China, as well. Similarly, dozens of airlines have curtailed flights to China. Although there is some justification for the abovementioned measures, China being the epicenter of the outbreak, it is the reaction of populations not obviously affected by what is happening in China that has become by turns bewildering and amusing. Observing Filipinos’ behavior (a friend from the US said Americans have become similarly panic-stricken), one would guess that the country is afflicted by a full-scale epidemic. For this, we can blame the Department of Health (DoH), the local media and, although precious little can be done about it, activity on social media. For its part, the DoH, as the lead agency responsible for dealing with the situation, has been sending mixed signals. While decrying the spread of “fake news” about the disease, its excitement at having something this big to talk about bleeds through its statements. It is actually not at all necessary nor helpful to anyone to discuss “suspected” cases of 2019-nCoV, or the number of persons being “monitored.” The general public, otherwise exposed to news that is being sensationalized for maximum attention-grabbing effect, does not make the fine distinction between “people who might have come into contact with the virus” and “people who are infected with it.” People then carry this misinterpretation with them onto the social media, where the misinformation is amplified and spreads. Meanwhile, real-world economic impacts of the epidemic — tourism, transportation and trade have all taken a serious hit, which is reflected in the financial markets — are being made worse by excessive coverage. Investors who hear news that “investors have been rattled by the outbreak” are going to be rattled in fact, and act accordingly. Keep it in perspective A research paper published in the Journal of Global Health on December 9 — coincidentally just about the same time 2019-nCoV first appeared — examined different ways of calculating mortality rates from the common flu and determined that, on average, about 389,000 people worldwide die from that each year. By contrast, 2019-nCoV is a not particularly lethal virus — a 2.2-percent mortality rate means that one has a 97.8-percent chance of recovering from the illness — and has in almost two months of unchecked spread infected a relatively small number of people, the vast majority of which are concentrated in a relatively small area. Those who have turned up elsewhere, either in other places in China or in other countries, have all been connected in some way with the location of the original outbreak, or with people who are connected in some way. Indeed, it is a serious concern, and work to prevent or cure infections should be prioritized. But reporting on that should remain objective and circumspect, providing information that actually helps people and businesses decide if they need to protect themselves, and in what manner. If information is handled in that way, there will be less ambiguity to breed the inevitable misinformation that the public spreads among itself, and consequently, less irrationality and unnecessary fear. ben.kritz@manilatimes.net

,"February 2, 2020",nCov,Stay vigilant vs misinformation on novel coronavirus,NOEMI LARDIZABAL-DADO,"The last thing anyone wants to do in an emergency or virus outbreak is to panic. And if one panics, there is the tendency to spread unverified information. While the spread of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is speeding up, a deluge of misinformation is circulating on social media platforms and closed spaces.  Panic and false news are as much a problem as the actual medical emergency. A friend lamented on which news about the novel coronavirus is real or not. “What are those videos showing people collapse on the ground and looking like zombie-apocalypse movie scenes? Is the virus spread through the eyes not by mouth, making the mask useless?” While a lot of unknowns surround this virus, conspiracy theories are bound to happen. Hoaxes about coronavirus spread faster than the virus itself. Poynter’s International Fact-Checking Network & the American Press Institute’s Accountability Project affirm the widespread misinformation. Around 48 fact-checking organizations from 30 countries collaborated to debunk false information about the 2019-nCoV. As of Jan. 29, 2020,  the community detected 86 instances of misleading information that deserved international attention.  The largest trend of misinformation gathered is the launch of a miraculous vaccine. This was followed by fake data about the source of the fatal illness. Conspiracy theories come in third. The collaborative project remains active as long as the disease spreads worldwide. You could follow these updates through two hashtags, #CoronaVirusFacts and #DatosCoronaVirus in social media platforms and Poynter.org fact checking coverage. Facebook, Google and Twitter are fighting a surge of half-truths and falsehoods about the new coronavirus outbreak. All three major platforms follow specific policies around health-related posts, aiming to ensure digital conversations won’t cause real-world harm. The fact-check organizations that partnered with Facebook pointed out false coronavirus claims, including fake treatments. Facebook labeled the inaccuracies and lowered their rank in users’ daily feeds. I witnessed how Twitter tweaked search results to fight coronavirus disinformation. To prevent automated search results that are “likely to direct individuals to non-credible content”, Twitter used their search prompt to direct users to authoritative information from organizations like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). That is true for those living in the United States of America. In the Philippines, the search results prompt me to the Twitter account of the Department of Health (DoH) and World Health Organization (WHO) Philippines. Over 15 million tweets related to the coronavirus have shown up in the platform in the past four weeks alone, but Twitter said it hasn’t yet seen “significant coordinated attempts to spread disinformation.”  Search results on “coronavirus” on YouTube yield videos from  ABS-CBN news, Inquirer.net, CNN Philippines as their Top news source. Much of the misinformation takes place in closed spaces where it is difficult for platforms to moderate the discussion. The good news is more people are sharing information from official sources like the WHO. Even if the DoH is the official source for information on novel coronavirus, people noted inconsistencies. A BBC Monitoring article on Jan. 30, 2020 reported on the false health advice on ways to treat or prevent the disease. One advice from Health Secretary Francisco Duque 3rd, is to  “make sure your throat is moist so the virus couldn’t attach to it.” It does not match DoH FAQs section on “What could the public do to prevent the spread of 2019-nCoV?” While a vaccine against the new coronavirus is not yet available, standard recommendations from WHO to prevent infections apply. 1. Clean hands by using an alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water. 2. When coughing and sneezing, cover mouth and nose with flexed elbow or tissue 3. Avoid the consumption of raw or undercooked animal products. 4. Avoid close contact with anyone who has fever and cough. An effective way to fight and overwhelm misinformation is to be truth-tellers sharing reliable and accountable news. When sharing information, add a source with links from official sources or credible news agency. As a responsible citizen, we have the responsibility to discern the source of information and be mindful about the misinformation coming from the media, government and other citizens. Now, more than ever, we need to be vigilant against misinformation and being discriminatory towards the Chinese people. Stay calm, protect yourself and others, and learn how to validate information. To avoid unnecessary panic and anxiety, refrain from relying on social media. Check for updates on the following websites: https://www.doh.gov.ph/2019-nCov

Esmael,"Photo by SOFJ/The Manila Times CYBERCRIMINALS have taken advantage of the 2019 novel coronavirus acute respiratory diseases (2019-nCoV ARD) scare to hack into people’s accounts using malicious files disguised as information related to the virus, a cybersecurity firm said Friday. “The coronavirus, which is being widely discussed as a major news story, has already been used as bait by cybercriminals. So far, we have seen only 10 unique files, but as this sort of activity often happens with popular media topics then we expect that this tendency may grow,” said Anton Ivanov, Kaspersky malware analyst. “As people continue to be worried about their health, we may see more and more malware hidden inside fake documents about the coronavirus being spread,” said Ivanov. According to Kaspersky, the files — under the guise of pdf, mp4 and docx formats — claimed to have video instructions on self-care versus nCoV, as well as updates on the virus. These files, Kaspersky said, contained threats, which would allow cybercriminals to access users’ computer systems, including personal information. Over 200 people have died and more than 7,000 have been infected by the coronavirus that originated from Wuhan, China and has since spread to other countries. In the Philippines, the Department of Health on Thursday confirmed its first case, involving a 38-year-old woman from Wuhan. "
,"February 1, 2020",nCov,A race against time! Wuhan battles coronavirus,Xinhua,"WUHAN, Jan. 30 (Xinhua) — More than one week after Wuhan was put on lockdown, the megacity with a population of over 10 million has been racing against time to battle the epidemic. Zhang Dingyu is president of Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, one of the city’s designated hospitals to admit patients infected with the new virus. He has spent the past 30 days seeing and treating patients since the arrival of the first few cases of pneumonia caused by the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). In the past week, going to bed at about 2 a.m. and getting up at about 4 a.m. has become the 57-year-old doctor’s daily routine. Wearing a protective cap and suit and putting on a face mask, Zhang clutches at the handrail as he slowly makes his way up and down the stairs. He was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as motor neuron disease, though he never revealed the state of his illness to his colleagues. “I have never encountered such pressure as today,” Zhang said. “For me, ALS is like a sword hanging in the air. I want to make a contribution with what limited time I have left.” He added that he has to quicken his pace to save time and indeed more patients. His wife, also a medical worker, was infected with the novel coronavirus and was hospitalized on Jan. 19. Luckily, after medical treatment, she has now recovered. Chinese health authorities announced Thursday that 7,711 confirmed cases of pneumonia caused by the novel coronavirus had been reported in 31 provincial-level regions and the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps by the end of Wednesday. A total of 170 people have died of the disease. The National Health Commission said in its daily report that 1,370 patients remained in critical condition, and 12,167 people were suspected of being infected with the virus as of the end of Wednesday. Wuhan, capital of central China’s Hubei Province and center of the coronavirus outbreak, reported 356 new confirmed cases and 25 new deaths on Wednesday, the provincial health authorities said. On Jan. 23, China locked down the city in an unprecedented effort to curb the spread of the new infectious disease. At present, Hubei has 131 designated hospitals, including 30 in Wuhan and another 101 distributed in the counties and cities of the province, for confirmed and suspected new pneumonia patients, according to Liu Yingzi, director of the Hubei Provincial Health Commission. Liu said that more than 170,000 local medical workers are now fighting the epidemic and 6,097 more from 29 provincial-level regions and the military had also joined by Tuesday.

On the eve of the Chinese Lunar New Year, a traditional occasion for family reunions, Song Caiping left the comforts of home and family for Wuhan. Song was among 450 military medical staff sent to Wuhan, including professionals who had experience in the fight against SARS and Ebola. The medics, in three teams dispatched by medical universities of the army, navy and air force of the People’s Liberation Army, arrived in Wuhan by military aircraft on Friday night. They were mobilized from various hospitals affiliated to the military universities. All of them volunteered for the mission. As a member of the medical team from the Army Medical University, Song and her colleagues took charge of two inpatient areas with the help of doctors and nurses of Jinyintan Hospital. After three hours’ preparation, they began receiving the first batch of 20 infected patients transferred there. “We will stick to prevention and control in a scientific way and standardize the diagnosis process. We can definitely defeat the epidemic and win the battle,” said Xu Dixiong, head of the medical team from the university. At Hankou Hospital, a medical team from the Second Military Medical University took charge of the intensive care unit with 16 beds and newly opened an inpatient ward with 39 beds, rushing to treat critically ill patients with all-out efforts.

They have rich experience in battling contagious diseases,” said Zhou Xianzhi, president of Air Force Medical University. “Some of them took part in major missions such as the battle against SARS and the fight against Ebola in Africa, as well as earthquake rescue missions.” RAPID HOSPITAL CONSTRUCTION
Following Beijing’s SARS treatment model, Wuhan is building two hospitals to treat pneumonia patients infected with the novel coronavirus. The two facilities are expected to be put into use on Feb. 3 and Feb. 5, respectively. Workers, trucks, and excavators are racing against the clock to meet the deadline at the construction sites. At around 6 p.m. Wednesday, construction of power facilities at Leishenshan (Thunder God Mountain) Hospital, one of the hospitals, was completed. Aerial photo taken on Jan. 28, 2020 shows the construction site of Huoshenshan Hospital in Wuhan. (Xinhua/Xiao Yijiu) In only three days, more than 300 workers toiled around the clock to install and adjust 7-km-long high-voltage cables and 26 supporting facilities. The hospital will accommodate 1,600 beds, 300 more than the previous design, as the number of local patients increases. It is expected to expand to 60,000 square meters and provide working space to over 2,000 medical staff. More than 4,000 workers and around 1,000 vehicles and large pieces of machinery have been toiling away at the Huoshenshan (Fire God Mountain) Hospital site day and night. Around 400 prefab rooms have been finished so far. The main pipeline of the drainage system in the hospital site is largely complete. LIFE UNDER LOCKDOWN
In locked-down Wuhan, life goes on. Medical supplies, vegetables and other daily necessities are brought in. Residents are consistently reminded to steer clear of the virus. A Wuhan resident in his 50s surnamed Zhang said he lost his mother on Jan. 25, the first day of the Chinese Lunar New Year. Under the lockdown, Zhang’s family is unable to hold a memorial ceremony. “Amid this unfortunate epidemic, the only gratifying thing is that I could accompany my mother in her last days,” Zhang said. He kept the clothes of his mother to remember her and set up an online chat group to share messages of mourning from relatives. Residents shop at a supermarket in Wuhan, Jan. 27, 2020. (XINHUA/XIONG QI) “After my mother left, it suddenly dawned on me that nothing is that important. The disaster also made my son realize the meaning and value of life,” he said. Sorrow and repentance can translate into confidence and strength to win this unprecedented battle. A hotline was opened Thursday in Hubei Province to help people maintain psychological health amid the novel coronavirus outbreak. An official WeChat account has also been set up to provide 24-hour service. The nation is currently experiencing a peak period of confirmed cases. With prevention and control measures in place, the number of future infections will be significantly reduced, said Li Lanjuan, a renowned Chinese epidemiologist. “As of Wednesday, we have isolated five strains of the virus, two of which are very suitable for vaccine development,” Li said. “It will take at least three months to prove a vaccine for the novel coronavirus is effective.” "
,"February 1, 2020",nCov,"WHO says novel coronavirus outbreak a global health emergency, disfavors travel and trade restrictions",Xinhua,"GENEVA, Jan. 30 (Xinhua) — World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Thursday that the novel coronavirus outbreak has become a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). Speaking at a press conference after a closed-door meeting of the Emergency Committee, he stressed that the WHO disfavors or even opposes imposing travel or trade restrictions on China. Under the International Health Regulations (IHR), the WHO director-general has the authority to determine that an outbreak constitutes a PHEIC when certain conditions are met. The designation is aimed at mobilizing more international resources to deal with the epidemic. Since the IHR entered into force in 2007, the WHO has made multiple PHEIC declarations. Ghebreyesus noted that Chinese President Xi Jinping personally commands and deploys the prevention and containment efforts. “The speed with which China detected the outbreak, isolated the virus, sequenced the genome and shared it with WHO and the world are very impressive, and beyond words. So is China’s commitment to transparency and to supporting other countries,” he said. “In many ways, China is actually setting a new standard for outbreak response,” he added. That reflects not only China’s high sense of responsibility for the lives and health of its own people, but also its strong support for global disease prevention and control, he said. Ghebreyesus said he believes that China will effectively contain and eventually defeat the epidemic, adding that China’s efforts to combat the disease deserve respect and appreciation, and are worth learning. In fact, many of the prevention and containment measures China has taken far exceed relevant requirements for dealing with emergencies, and the measures China has taken are good not only for that country but also for the rest of the world. Now the situation is still developing and more research is needed, and particularly countries with fragile health systems should enhance their responses, said the WHO chief. That is the main reason behind the PHEIC declaration, he said, adding that considering global health security, it is also a necessary step to achieve a scientific, rational and calm response based on evidence, and to help other countries take scientific, reasonable and appropriate measures to prevent the epidemic. Wu Zunyou, chief epidemiologist of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said that the PHEIC declaration is a standard practice of the WHO. “China’s current prevention and control measures are the strictest and very effective. We are confident that we can effectively contain the epidemic and finally overcome it,” Wu said. "
,"February 1, 2020",nCov,Why China’s strategy to contain coronavirus might work,Inter Press Service,"ON January 23, the authorities of Wuhan City, China, sealed off the motorways and shut down all public transport to stop the coronavirus outbreak from spreading. Shortly afterwards, at least 10 other cities in China were under quarantine orders, most of them located in the areas surrounding Wuhan. It sounds unbelievable to quarantine a city of 11 million people, but it may work because movement within and between cities in China relies heavily on public transport infrastructure. Major cities in China are well connected by airports, express railways, motorways and long-distance buses. Once the entry points of these transport routes are controlled and patrolled, people cannot easily get out. The transport infrastructure is built by the state and over 90 percent funded by public money, so control remains in the hands of the authorities. The one-party government in China also helps to effectively implement such a strategy. Another reason this containment strategy may work is that major Chinese cities are large and dense. Wuhan has an urban area of 1,528 square kilometers, which makes it extremely difficult for people to walk out of the city if they are not able to take public transport or travel on the motorways using private cars. People who live on the periphery of the city may still be able to get out through small local road networks that mainly lead to villages or the countryside. As long as the major roads are closed off, they are not able to reach other major cities with a large, concentrated population and the quarantine remains effective. Megacity regions
The urbanization process facilitated by the Chinese state results in big cities surrounded by smaller cities, towns and counties. This form of city cluster, known as megacity regions, are a recent phenomenon in China and their development has been driven by both political and economic factors. The Yangtze River Delta and Pearl River Delta are the most well-known megacity regions, holding enormous economic power and attracting laborers regionally and nationally. Wuhan and its surrounding cities, towns and counties hold similar status in central China, thanks to its strategic location on the Yangtze River and national railway network. The local authority’s Great Wuhan Economic Region plan is intended to promote Wuhan in efforts to become comparable to the aforementioned megacity regions. Megacity regions are connected by transport routes and mostly developed around transport nodes, at both the regional and neighborhood scales. This so-called transit-oriented development means that if the entry points of public transport are closed off in cities of the whole region, to a large extent, people are controlled in the region. Chinese New Year
For more than three decades, Chinese urbanization has seen large-scale domestic migration. People from the countryside and smaller cities and towns move to big cities for more work opportunities and better education and healthcare. Chinese New Year is a most important occasion when people return to their hometowns to celebrate the festival with their families. The coronavirus containment measures coincided with the national movement for the New Year celebration. This massive movement of people, if not controlled, would be a serious threat to containing the virus. People were advised against long-distance travel and the New Year holiday has been extended into February. These measures are to make sure movement within the country is restricted as much as possible. Workers will stay in their home cities as their returns are suspended. The containment measures in Wuhan and other cities are likely to continue until further studies of the virus suggest other effective solutions. At the current moment, international travelers from China have all been checked at airports and some flights have been canceled. Cities nowadays rely on complex systems to operate. The concentration of labor and resources may enable efficiency but leaves them vulnerable to attack. The outbreak puts enormous pressure on Wuhan’s healthcare system as people can only seek treatment in the city. A few high-ranked hospitals in Wuhan possess the best resources, but they cannot cope with the healthcare demand from large groups at the same time. Two new hospitals are being built in Wuhan to deal with the coronavirus outbreak. They are expected to be completed on February 3 and 5 and provide 2,300 beds in total. In the foreseeable future digital technologies and smart city measures may also play a role in dealing with pressure on health infrastructure by, for instance, reporting cases and coordinating the allocation of resources. Wuhan has a reputation for the active integration of smart technologies in urban management. Although effective, sealing off an entire city or region should always be a last resort. It will surely have a negative social impact and damage the economy. BY FEI CHEN, IPS Fei Chen is a senior lecturer of architecture the University of Liverpool. "
,"February 1, 2020",nCov,International community praises China’s response to novel coronavirus,The Manila Times, 
,"January 31, 2020",nCov,Local and international media coverage of coronavirus vital,The Manila Times,"TO get our perspective right on the coronavirus outbreak, it is sensible to monitor and follow the coverage of the outbreak by local media and the wider coverage by international media. Both perspectives are vital for the nation to keep abreast of developments. The local media coverage provides up-to-the-minute reportage on in-country developments, the disease-control efforts and policies of Philippine health authorities and the situation of Filipinos under threat in China, particularly in Wuhan City. The international media coverage provides the bigger picture of the global character of the emergency, the spread of the virus, the nature of China’s strategy to contain the outbreak and the efforts of the World Health Organization (WHO) to help lead in the full containment of this health epidemic. The WHO reports that 16 countries outside of China have confirmed cases. The Philippines is not yet included on the list. The Department of Health on Thursday confirmed that a 38-year-old Chinese woman from Wuhan tested positive for the coronavirus after her laboratory results arrived from the Victorian Infectious Disease Reference Laboratory in Melbourne, Australia. The patient, who is currently asymptomatic, arrived in the Philippines from China via Hong Kong on January 21, but only sought medical help on January 25. Newsmax TV reports that the death toll as of Thursday had risen to 170 in the new virus outbreak in China, with 7,711 cases reported within the country. Thursday’s figures cover the previous 24 hours and represent an increase of 38 deaths and 1,737 cases. Of the new deaths, 37 were in the epicenter of the outbreak in central Hubei province and one in the remoter southwestern province of Sichuan. World health officials expressed “great concern” on Wednesday that the virus is starting to spread between people outside of China. The new virus has now infected more people in China than were sickened there during the 2002 to 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak. Consequently, WHO’s Emergency Committee scheduled a meeting Thursday to reconsider its decision not to declare a global public health emergency over the spread of the Wuhan coronavirus after “deeply concerning” new cases emerged. This is a major new development and should be weighed accordingly. Against this background, we should welcome the encouraging news from China and Wuhan, that no Filipino (overseas worker or visitor) has contracted the coronavirus, and that the estimated 300 Filipinos in Hubei province and Wuhan are safe. The Philippine embassy in China is successfully monitoring and attending to their needs. Two overseas Filipino workers have successfully returned to the country. It will still be some time before we can see the end of this viral outbreak. Medical efforts to develop a vaccine are continuing at a frenzied pace, and it is confidently projected that within the year, an effective vaccine will be developed. That said, we must digest the speculation that the coronavirus infection may not peak until April. At the rate that cases are being confirmed each day, the coronavirus may actually be moving at a faster rate than SARS. A total of 774 people died from SARS, according to the WHO. The SARS crisis began in late 2002 and wound down in July 2003. No one has contracted SARS since. The disease was traced to bats. The Wuhan coronavirus has also been traced to animals, including bats, that were believed to have been consumed by people. The SARS experience suggests that once the situation is contained, activity bounces back sharply and quickly. The risk of the coronavirus being worse than SARS is impossible to predict, but we can contain the disease from spreading by keeping with the news. "
,"January 30, 2020",nCov,‘China coronavirus impact could weaken peso’,"Mayvelin U. Caraballo, TMT","THE negative impact of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) on the Philippine tourism industry could weaken the peso this year, an analyst warned on Wednesday. “The recent fallout from the 2019-nCoV…may be difficult to ascertain, but one area we might take a hit [would] be [in] tourism,” ING Bank Manila senior economist Nicholas Antonio Mapa said in a comment. Passengers from the World Dream cruise ship wear face masks as they visit a theme park in Manila after the vessel, with more than 700 passengers, mostly from China and Hong Kong, arrived the day before at the Port in Manila on Jan. 29, 2020. AFP PHOTO The contagion threat posed by the coronavirus, the analyst said, already curtailed travel to and from China, which could dampen tourist arrivals in the country. “With no end in sight just yet for the virus, we can expect a hit on the tourism sector in the near term as the Philippines may see a drop in its second-most important market,” he added. The economist noted that about 21 percent of foreign tourists arriving in the country are from mainland China, second only to those from South Korea. Tourist arrivals translate to an influx of foreign currency, as well as increased local consumption and sales boost for restaurants, retail and hotels, according to Mapa. “Lower tourist arrivals as a result [of] the virus scare [would] likely slow a steady and burgeoning source of FX (foreign exchange), although some tourists utilize payment apps and other forms of electronic payments to transact in the Philippines,” he said. “Nonetheless, we may have to expect a smaller inflow of these ‘travel exports’ in 2020 with yet another reason for [the] depreciation for the peso,” the economist added. Mapa’s view on the peso is consistent with the Development Budget Coordination Committee’s P51 to P54 peso-dollar assumption this year. Last year, the peso ended at P50.63 against the dollar, a 3.70-percent appreciation from the P52.58:$1 posted on Dec. 28, 2018, falling below the government’s P51.00-52.00:$1 exchange rate assumption for the year.

,"January 30, 2020",nCov,The new coronavirus will die a natural death,Ramon T. Tulfo,"Ramon T. Tulfo THE bubonic plague, caused by fleas and spread by rats, decimated Europe toward the end of the Middle Ages (1346 to 1351). It killed 25 million people or roughly 30 to 60 percent of the population in Europe then, according to the reputable National Geographic. (National Geographic is a non-profit organization that funds conservation and research projects worldwide.) Bubonic plague, also called the Black Death, spread throughout Europe because there was a lack of communication between nations and there were no medical facilities in that continent then. A pandemic like the bubonic plague can and will occur in modern times because the world has become a small community; news of a tragedy happening in one country reaches other countries in seconds or minutes. And because of modern technology, other countries not yet affected can take measures to prevent a pandemic, such as quarantining people coming from the affected country. Advanced medicine also helps prevent a contagious disease from spreading, as the affected community is immediately isolated. Take the case of Wuhan, the ground zero of the new coronavirus outbreak. Of the 2,000 people infected in Wuhan only 56 — or 2.8 percent of the total — have succumbed to the virus temporarily called “2019 – nCov.” If we were still in the Middle Ages, 1,333 patients of the 2,000 people infected — or two-thirds of the total — would have died; and the number of fatalities would have multiplied exponentially. But Wuhan has been able to contain the new coronavirus by a total lockdown of the city. The Chinese government has forbidden anybody to get in or come out of the capital of Hubei province. (One thing good about an iron-fisted rule like the one in China is that when the government gives an order, its citizens follow without question; compare that with the Taal Volcano eruption where people disobey the government order of a lockdown of some areas in Batangas.) And the world, in general, has also been able to check the spread of the new coronavirus by quarantining people suspected of having the deadly ailment. In the Philippines, there have been 11 suspected cases of the disease but so far there has been no death, even with our generally below-par medical facilities. Why? Because people have been made aware of the deadly ailment through the mass media. From March to June, 2003, Hong Kong was gripped by fear of the SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, which killed 286 patients of the 1,750 people infected. Why did SARS disappear? Because of the advent of modern medicine and the temporary isolation of Hong Kong. So, folks, don’t believe the doomsayers who predict the end of the world because of the coronavirus. And don’t believe everything you read in social media; most of the reports come from non-experts or ignoramuses who throw in not even two cents worth of their advice or opinion. You’ll see. The new coronavirus will become old in due time and will die a natural death because of isolation. As one current Filipino wisecrack has it, “Don’t be so afraid of the coronavirus. It won’t last long because it’s made in China.” There goes the Filipino’s wry sense of humor again. "
,"January 29, 2020",nCov,Coronavirus outbreak rams global tourism,Associated Press,"BUSINESSES around the world that have grown increasingly reliant on big-spending tourists from China are taking a heavy hit, with tens of millions of Chinese residents restricted from leaving their country as the coronavirus spreads. Hotels, airlines, casinos and cruise operators were among the industries suffering the most immediate repercussions, especially with the outbreak occurring during the Lunar New Year, one of the biggest travel seasons in Asia. What happens in China means a lot more to the world economy than it did when the SARS outbreak struck nearly two decades ago. In 2003, China accounted for 4.3 percent of world economic output. Last year, it accounted for 16.3 percent, according to the International Monetary Fund. Tourism from China was already down before the virus hit, due in part to the Hong Kong protests and the trade dispute between Beijing and Washington. But about 134 million Chinese traveled abroad in 2019, up 4.5 percent from the year-earlier number, according to official figures. Before the outbreak, the China Outbound Tourism Research Institute predicted some 7 million Chinese would travel abroad for the Lunar New Year this year, up from 6.3 million in 2019. Hong Hong, Thailand, Japan and Vietnam were top destinations, but Chinese tourists are big spenders in cities like London, Milan, Paris and New York. Economist and tourism industry officials said the biggest threat so far is to China’s closest neighbors, with the US and Europe likely to face major repercussions only if the coronavirus outbreak proves long-lived. In Thailand, a favorite destination for Lunar New Year travel, officials estimate potential lost revenue at 50 billion baht ($1.6 billion). Many drugstores in Bangkok ran out of surgical masks and the number of Chinese tourists appeared to be much smaller than usual for the Lunar New Year. The government announced it was handing out masks, and that the airport rail link would be disinfected. Spillover is also probable in Vietnam, Singapore and the Philippines, said Tommy Wu and Priyanka Kishore of Oxford Economics. Hong Kong is especially vulnerable because its economy and its appeal to tourists have already been weakened by months of sometimes-violent political protest. By November, inbound tourism to Hong Kong was already down 56 percent from a year earlier. Visitors from mainland China to the autonomous Chinese gambling capital of Macau was down 80 percent on Sunday from a year earlier, a threat to a regional government that depends on gaming revenue. Gaming and lodging operators in Macau reported higher-than expected cancellations over the weekend as the death toll from the coronavirus rose and the Chinese government extended travel restrictions, according to Instinet analyst Harry Curtis. “Cancellations soared across all of the properties we contacted,” Curtis said in a note. “Pessimism rose on how long it could take for business to recover.” Shares of Wynn Resorts, Las Vegas Sands and MGM Resorts International — which all have operations in Macau — have declined by 18.3 percent, 14.6 percent and 12.1 percent since January 17, respectively. But analysts said it was too soon to tell how deeply their finances would be affected. Adding to the uncertainty was the possibility that Macau’s government could shut down all casinos. Jefferies, an equities research firm, predicted the virus outbreak would affect first-quarter results for the companies, “but how large and will it linger onward remain the questions.” "

These are South Korea, Thailand, Taiwan, Japan, Vietnam, Singapore, Malaysia, Nepal and Australia in Asia-Pacific; the United States and Canada in North America; and France in Europe. At least 40 to 60 seconds of washing the hands with a germicidal soap is highly recommended to make sure germs are prevented from spreading to other parts of the body. The highly contagious respiratory disease has caused global alarm because of its similarity to SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), which also originated in China in 2002 and killed hundreds of people in China, Hong Kong and the rest of the world. What is coronavirus?
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), coronavirus is a large family of viruses that can cause respiratory illnesses such as the common cold to more severe diseases such as the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV. These severe diseases could cause respiratory illness in humans as the virus is zoonotic, which can easily be transmitted between animals and people. The coronavirus as seen through a microscope IMAGE BY SHUTTERSTOCK The Wuhan coronavirus is said to have originated in the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan, a Chinese city about 650 miles south of Beijing that has a population of more than 11 million people. As case numbers in China and abroad increase, authorities hypothesize that human-to-human transmission is possible. Virologist Leo Poon, a scientist in the School of Public Health at The University of Hong Kong and the first to decode the virus, said in a report by CNN that it “causes pneumonia and doesn’t respond to antibiotic treatment.” ‘Spread the love, not the germs’ campaign educates youngsters on the importance of washing hands thoroughly. “The virus initially appeared to spread only by very close contact such as hugging, kissing or sharing eating utensils,” David Heymann, the chairperson of a WHO committee that is gathering data on the virus, said initially. Now, Heymann says evidence is accruing that shows more distant contact could spread the virus such as if a sick person were to sneeze or cough near someone else’s face. While there is no evidence at this point that the virus is airborne and could be spread across a room, authorities advise everyone to take extra health precautions. No verified case in the Philippines
According to the Department of Health (DoH), there is no confirmed Wuhan coronavirus case yet in the country. “Until now, we have no verified case,” Health Undersecretary Rolando Domingo said in a briefing, referring to the 2019-nCoV. The samples sent to an infectious disease laboratory in Australia from a five-year-old patient in Cebu City tested negative for the infection. Although there is no confirmed case of coronavirus infection in the country — dousing fears that have been circulating on social media — Filipinos, however, are advised to take precautionary health measures to protect themselves against the said virus. Since human-to-human transmission is possible, having proper hygiene, such as hand washing with a germicidal soap and water, could play a huge role in preventing the spread of virus — as the hands could spread contamination by touching the eyes, nose or mouth. Basic steps to prevent catching coronavirus
The Manila Times, DoH, Procter & Gamble and Safeguard Philippines today extend their help through educating people of the importance of proper and frequent hand washing to help in the prevention of illnesses and diseases. – When coughing or sneezing, completely cover mouth and nose with a tissue or a sleeve or flexed elbow. – Avoid unprotected contact with wild and farm animals. – Thoroughly cook meat and eggs. – Avoid close contact when experiencing fever and cold or flu-like symptoms. – Wash hands regularly with a proven germicidal soap and warm water for at least 40 to 60 seconds. If soap and warm water are not available, an alcohol-based hand sanitizer should be used. A germicidal soap is recommended for handwashing as it includes antimicrobial ingredients that fight bacteria and fungi, which are microbes that can cause a range of illnesses from skin infections to pneumonia. In other words, this is not the time to depend on perfumed or whitening soaps. Neither is it a good option to go with delightfully scented sanitizers, but it is wiser to choose the germ-killing kind as well. CONTRIBUTED PHOTOS "
,"January 29, 2020",nCov,On the current coronavirus pandemic,The Manila Times,"THE Coalition for People’s Right to Health (CPRH) encourages the public to remain vigilant over the spread of a mysterious respiratory illness in the region. We call on the public health system, through health centers, clinics and hospitals, to be prepared to treat and assure potential patients of free and quality health services, especially while this pandemic threatens our population. We urge the public to remain informed and critical of the data and reporting in order to not spread fake news and further confusion. The Department of Health and governing agencies must communicate adequate and appropriate information campaigns regarding possible sources of infection and available health services in order to prevent panic and disinformation among the public. The investigation toward the source of the epidemic, together with its control and treatment, however, must remain transparent and available to the public. This ensures less ill-informed judgment, which may lead to further discrimination and erroneous shortsighted solutions. CPRH maintains that upholding the right to health of every Filipino goes beyond disease surveillance and curative services, but preventive and promotive approaches, as well. Joshua San Pedro, MD

,"January 28, 2020",nCov,PH visa arrival program suspended to prevent entry of coronavirus-infected visitors,The Manila Times,"THE Bureau of Immigration (BI) has temporarily suspended its visa upon arrival (VUA) program as part of the government’s efforts against the spread of the deadly novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV, which has affected several countries. Immigration Commissioner Jaime Morente on Tuesday said the VUA was usually availed of by Chinese tour groups visiting the Philippines. The move also follows the travel lockdown in several cities in China, particularly Wuhan province where the virus was believed to have originated, shutting down public transport services in several areas in an effort to contain the virus. “The Civil Aeronautics Board has already suspended direct flights from Wuhan province,” said Morente. “We are now temporarilysuspending the issuance of VUA for Chinese nationals to slow down the influx of group tours,” he said. A similar move was done by Taiwan Immigration authorities who, according to an article by the Taipei Times, cancelled permits for 429 people in 24 tour groups from Wuhan, China. However, Morente clarified that there was no order barring Chinese from entering the country. “We have not received any directive imposing policy changes on Chinese nationals,” said Morente. “But we are taking this proactive measure to slow down travel, and possibly help prevent the entry of the 2019-nCov,” he said. Should there be policy changes pertaining to foreign policy, said Morente, it would be through the Department of Foreign Affairs or the Office of the President, on the advice of the Department of Health. Morente likewise clarified that it was not the BI, but the Bureau of Quarantine which has the main responsibility in determining possible passenger-carriers of the virus arriving at airports and seaports. “It is the Bureau of Quarantine (BOQ) who conducts monitoring of arriving passengers to see if they are manifesting symptoms of the corona virus. They have put up measures in place to strictly check arriving passengers,” he said. “They have been very active in giving information to frontline port personnel on how to prevent the transmission of the virus, given the risk of direct contact with possible carriers,” he said. “The BI is always ready to assist the BOQ and the DoH in securing whatever information that they need in order to prevent the entry of this sickness in the country,” he further said. WILLIAM B. DEPASUPIL "

,"January 26, 2020",nCov,Good information is best antidote to panic over coronavirus,The Manila Times,"IN the face of wide public concern about the coronavirus that has spread quickly around the world, we want to share this insight with our readers and the general public: The strongest antidote to panic over a health scare or epidemic is information, good information. Two reports on the coronavirus are particularly relevant. First, Agence France Presse reported last Friday on the countries where cases have been confirmed. It reported that ‘’a SARS-like virus has claimed 26 lives since emerging on December 31 in a market in the Chinese city of Wuhan.’’ It listed the countries that have confirmed cases of the so-called coronavirus: China, Macau, Hong Kong, France, Japan, Nepal, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, the United States and Vietnam. AFP PHOTO Significantly, the Philippines is not among the countries listed. Philippine health authorities are still investigating and testing various cases of suspected coronavirus attacks. Second, a most enlightening article published in the New York Post, on January 25, written by Michael Fumento, a lawyer and journalist who has been reporting on health epidemics since 1986. He wrote: ‘’There appears to be nothing very special about this outbreak of the 2019-NCoV or Wuhan­ virus. It should actually be called the DvV, or déjà vu virus, because we have been through this hysteria before. Over and over. Heterosexual AIDS, Ebola repeatedly, the H1N1 swine flu that was actually vastly milder than the regular flu and, especially, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003. Once you start debunking mass hysteria over outbreaks, it gets easy, because the same patterns repeat themselves. The best remedy for all epidemic hysteria is perspective. How is this new outbreak different and thus potentially more dangerous from other diseases we have dealt with in the past or are dealing with now? Wuhan is repeatedly labeled ‘deadly’ — but so is every other virus most people know about. But especially deadly? Nearly 600 cases have been confirmed with at least 17 reported deaths. An infected American is reportedly doing well. It’s probably true that the death toll is understated, but it’s guaranteed the infection number is. Probably as with, say, flu, the vast majority of those infected have such slight symptoms, they don’t seek medical attention. What we can say for sure is that Wuhan will be a lot worse in China, simply because health care there is vastly inferior, and cases there will often be treatable in the West. It also appears those most likely to die of Wuhan virus fit the same profile as flu fatalities: people over 65, those with compromised immune systems and those with serious pre-existing conditions. Two of the 17 Wuhan dead were 89-year-olds with pre-existing conditions; the youngest was 48 and suffering from diabetes and a stroke. Contagiousness is highly important, of course. But so far, there is no evidence that Wuhan, first reported more than three weeks ago, is more contagious than influenza or spreads differently. Those are the important factors; everything else is noise and tinfoil-hat paranoia. We are breathlessly told it’s spread from human to human. Again, most of the contagious diseases we think of are spread between humans, with some exceptions, such as rabies. It’s inherently bad because it’s new, we’re told. So were swine flu and SARS. Chinese health officials warn that it could mutate further to either become more deadly or more contagious. Same was said about the earlier outbreaks. Actually, viruses usually mutate to become less deadly, to preserve the host body and hence themselves. The media are correct in saying the closest comparison here is SARS. It also was first reported in China and was what’s called a coronavirus. But while they want you to remember SARS as akin to the Black Death with cries of ‘Bring out your dead!’, fact is, there was a grand total of only 8,098 cases, of whom 774 died. Then the disease simply disappeared. More than 7,000 of those cases and about 650 of the deaths occurred just in mainland China and Hong Kong. The United States had just 75 cases and zero deaths.’’ The world should hope that like SARS, the coronavirus will simply disappear soon. "

As of press time, the Coronavirus death toll in Wuhan rises to nine with 440 infected. “The danger posed by possible contamination of a mysterious Coronavirus is highly risky and we cannot afford to expose not only our delegation, but others as well,” reads part of the POC letter signed by its president Abraham Tolentino sent to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) on Wednesday. “Pending definitive word from the World Health Organization, we strongly recommend that the IOC take further steps to mitigate the possibility of any untoward incidents that may arise from the situation.” ABAP Executive Director Ed Picson told The Times on Wednesday that other participating countries have also requested that the OQT be moved to a safe location.

,"January 23, 2020",nCov,China’s coronavirus: The next crisis after Taal?,Ricardo Saludo,"RICARDO SALUDO BEFORE the headline topic, a note on United States President Donald Trump’s invitation for President Rodrigo Duterte to join a March summit between the American leader and the heads of government of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) in Las Vegas. Besides sound arguments cited in The Manila Times editorial yesterday, Duterte’s biggest reason for skipping the Las Vegas meeting is the same one holding him back from the start: The US may detain him, so Vice President Maria Leonor Robredo takes over and restores the full alliance with Washington, including US access to Philippine air bases under the stalled Aquino 3rd-era Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA). Hang on: Will America actually arrest a longtime ally’s visiting head of state, in violation of Philippine sovereignty and international law? Being representatives of sovereign states, ambassadors and other diplomats are accorded immunity from arrest, so national leaders enjoy at least the same privilege, if not far more. And arresting the hugely popular Duterte, whose Pulse Asia and Social Weather Stations ratings are at their highest ever, cannot but plunge relations with the Philippines to the lowest ever, and push us even closer to US rivals China and Russia. Well, here are questions raised by risk experts at the Center for Strategy, Enterprise and Intelligence (CenSEI) think-tank, headed by this writer: Did international law and sovereign rights stop Washington from invading Panama in 1989, to arrest its then strongman Manuel Noriega after his indictment on narcotics charges the year before? And did the Trump administration hesitate in assassinating Iranian general Qassem Soleimani, even if the killer drone attack in Iraq violated its sovereignty? As for Philippine outrage over Duterte’s detention or even his demise or incapacitation in an “accident,” some quarters in the US may just be willing to risk that, expecting successor Robredo to ease nationwide animosity, helped by pro-American Western and local media, plus offers of massive US aid and investment for her regime. And certainly, there would be no great outcry in America over Duterte’s woes, and that’s the only political fallout, which really matters to Washington. President Duterte has long and rightly feared US schemes to take him out of power. His continuing policy to expand ties with Beijing and Moscow do not make such Washington plots less likely. Hence, going to Las Vegas is a gamble he should not take. After eruption, deadly infection
Turning to the headline topic, CenSEI risk analysts are raising serious concerns over the feared entry of China’s coronavirus pneumonia, even as health authorities have been under pressure all year over the measles, dengue and polio outbreaks; the ongoing Dengvaxia mass vaccination charges; and now, the Taal Volcano eruption. Among 440 confirmed infected as of yesterday, nine have died from the illness, all in China, and at least six in Wuhan (population 11 million), capital of Hubei province in central China, where infections are believed to have begun in a public market. Seven out of every 10 patients in serious condition are over 60; most already have other illnesses, like diabetes and hypertension, and 84 percent waited more than a week after showing symptoms before seeking treatment. There is yet no sure way to combat the coronavirus, first identified by the World Health Organization (WHO) on December 31, and closely monitored since then. In its January 17 report, Imperial College London said there could be far more infections, as many as 1,700 cases. Called OC43 and 2019-nCoV, the microbe is like the germs behind the 2003 worldwide severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and another killer disease, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), first spotted in 2012. SARS infected 8,000 and killed 800; MERS caused 2,500 cases, with more than 850 deaths. Genetically, the Wuhan microbe is 70 percent similar to the SARS coronavirus. Hong Kong had 117 suspected cases early this week, including 21 hospitalized. At least one case of the Wuhan pneumonia has surfaced in the Philippines, along with two in Thailand; one each in Japan, South Korea, the United States, and reportedly the Philippines; plus a suspected case in Australia. The US case was a man in his 30s in Washington state on the West coast; he had arrived from China before going to a local hospital. Three US airports have begun screening passengers, like those in Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea and Malaysia. United Airlines reported that American health officials examined two passengers seemingly with symptoms of the Wuhan infection. China has confirmed that the coronavirus, normally found in livestock, pets, bats and other wildlife, can be transmitted from person to person. Yesterday the WHO in Geneva held an emergency meeting on what it called “an international public health emergency.” In humans, the disease causes fever, respiratory illness, and inflammation in the lungs. Can DoH cope with another SARS?
The big question for the Philippines: can the Department of Health cope with the Wuhan pneumonia? The DoH is already stretched by measles, dengue and polio infections last year, and now the Taal Volcano eruption. Can the agency keep the new infection out, or contain its spread if it lands in the country? Health Secretary Francisco Duque 3rd must convene national and local health authorities, immigration and quarantine agencies, and the medical and hospital sectors to get everyone working together to prevent a repeat of the SARS epidemic in the country, while addressing medical and health pressures from Taal and other calamities. Agreed measures should be presented to the Cabinet and the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC). Congress should already discuss what budgetary support and legal measures may be needed to adequately handle a surge in Wuhan pneumonia cases. Mechanisms developed for the SARS epidemic should be updated and cascaded to local governments and transport and border control agencies. Public health protocols should be publicized now, with special efforts by schools nationwide to teach children. Taal has burdened nearby regions. The Wuhan coronavirus can affect every Filipino. Let’s deal with it now. Ric Saludo, president of the Center for Strategy, Enterprise and Intelligence (CenSEI), may be reached at ric.saludo@censeisolutions.com. "

China reported Monday, Jan. 20 a sharp rise in the number of people affected in a pneumonia outbreak caused by a new coronoavirus, including the first cases in the capital. (Kyodo News via AP) At least a half-dozen countries in Asia and three U.S. airports have started screening incoming airline passengers from central China. Many of the initial cases had connections to a seafood market in Wuhan, which was closed for an investigation. Li Gang, director and chief physician of the Wuhan Center for Disease Control and Prevention, told state broadcaster CCTV that “the infectivity of the new coronavirus is not strong.” Infectivity refers to how rapidly the virus may spread between individuals. This “does not rule out the possibility of limited human-to-human transmission, but the risk of continuous human-to-human transmission is low,” Li said. “With the implementation of our various prevention and control measures, the epidemic can be prevented and controlled.” The Chinese government is keen to avoid a repeat of SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, another coronavirus that started in southern China in late 2002 and spread to more than two dozen countries, killing nearly 800 people.

One of the deaths was diagnosed and died in the last 24 hours, while the rest were of previous critical cases, according to the Health Ministry portal. Of the six new cases, one is receiving treatment at the ICU, three in stable condition and two without symptoms. Three of the new cases are from Riyadh, two from Jeddah and one from Mecca. In addition, another six cases, two men and four women, have fully recovered and been discharged from hospital. Besides those daily statistics, the ministry on Saturday also denied some press reports that the newly appointed acting health minister had been infected with the virus, saying the news are baseless and the minister is in good health. MERS is considered a deadlier but less transmissible cousin of the SARS virus which erupted in Asia in 2003 and infected thousands of people. The coronavirus was first discovered in mid-2012 in an old man with acute pneumonia and renal failure. It has spread from Gulf countries to North Africa, Southeast Asia and Europe, killing more than a hundred people and infecting hundreds of others. Saudi Arabia has retained the highest number of MERS cases in the world, registering new cases and deaths almost on a daily basis. PNA/Xinhua  "

The new deaths including one man and two women were reported in Jeddah. Two of the new cases were of females in their fifties and registered in Riyadh, and the third one is a man in his sixties in Medina, who was receiving treatment at the ICU. Meanwhile, one infected woman in her forties fully recovered and was discharged from a government hospital in Riyadh on Monday. Saudi Arabia is seriously fighting the infection and has established three medical centers in the country that are dedicated to receive only MERS coronavirus cases. More centers will be opened soon. The first such case was diagnosed in 2012. Despite the registering of new cases on a daily basis, the World Health Organization has not yet declared the infection as epidemic. PNA "

The patient, a 75-year-old man with underlying medical conditions became ill on Oct. 1, was hospitalized on Oct. 12 and died on Nov. 10. He is a national of Oman, said WHO. A previously-confirmed case from Oman, the country’s first confirmed new coronavirus infection, has died, it said. Qatar also reported an additional confirmed case to WHO. The man, 61 and with underlying medical conditions, became ill on Nov. 4 and was hospitalized on Nov. 7. WHO said he is in critical condition.

The patient, who was born in Morocco but lives in Spain, is receiving treatment at a Madrid hospital and is in a “stable” condition, the health ministry said in a statement. She had spent October in Saudi Arabia, where the disease first appeared in September 2012, it added. The Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has so far claimed 64 lives worldwide, with the greatest number of deaths in Saudi Arabia, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). The WHO said on Monday there were a total of 150 laboratory-confirmed cases of the respiratory disease worldwide. The disease has so far been detected in only four other European nations—Britain, Germany, France and Italy—always among people who had recently travelled to the Middle East. It is unclear whether the woman had gone to the annual hajj pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia, which gathered hundreds of thousands of faithful last month in an event that was nervously monitored for any MERS outbreak. Riyadh had urged the elderly and chronically ill to avoid the hajj and had also advised pilgrims to wear face masks. Experts are struggling to understand MERS, for which there is no vaccine. It is considered a deadlier but less-transmissible cousin of the SARS virus that erupted in Asia in 2003 and infected 8,273 people, nine percent of whom died. Like SARS, MERS appears to cause a lung infection, with patients suffering from a temperature, cough and breathing difficulty. But it differs in that it also causes rapid kidney failure and the extremely high death rate has caused serious concern. In August, researchers pointed to Arabian camels as possible hosts of the virus. AFP "
,"May 25, 2013",nCov,Saudi to send coronavirus samples to US,The Manila Times,"GENEVA: Saudi Arabia said Friday it would send samples taken from animals possibly infected with a deadly SARS-like virus to the United States (US) for testing in a bid to find the source of disease. The Saudi health ministry has “collected large samples from bats and other animals, including camels, sheep and cats,” said Saudi Deputy Health Minister Ziad Memish. So far, there have been 44 lab-confirmed cases worldwide of the virus, which until now has been known as the novel coronavirus, or nCoV-EMC, but was this week redubbed the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus, or MERS. Saudi Arabia counts by far the most cases, with 30 confirmed infections and 17 fatalities, while cases have also been detected in Jordan, Qatar, Tunisia, the United Arab Emirates, Germany, Britain and France. Memish told diplomats gathered in Geneva for the World Health Assembly, the decision-making body of the World Health Organization, that his country until now had not been able to send samples from animals besides bats to the US. “But now… we’ve got an approval to move these samples and they will be shipped for testing,” he said. The virus is a cousin of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which triggered a scare 10 years ago when it erupted in east Asia, leaping to humans from animal hosts and eventually killing some 800 people. Scientists at the Erasmus medical center in Rotterdam have determined that the virus appears to infect the body via a docking point in lung cells, suggesting bats may be a natural reservoir for it. Bats were also pinpointed as a likely natural reservoir for SARS in a 2005 study, and are known carriers of the deadly hemorrhagic fever Ebola. "

Financial markets have gone into a tailspin after grim news of deaths and outbreaks in the Middle East, Europe and Asia, even as the Chinese epicenter appeared to be calming, with the death toll at its lowest for three weeks. But the situation is worsening in other countries, with more than 2,000 cases and 30 deaths reported abroad, prompting a raft of restrictions on travelers from infected nations. South Korea, Italy and Iran have logged particularly sharp increases in infections and deaths, while several countries in the Middle East reported their first cases of the novel coronavirus. South Korean tourists leaving Israel wait at a pavillon separated from the main terminal of Ben Gurion International Airport. AFP PHOTO But WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyes insisted the virus could still be contained, praising China’s drastic quarantine measures in several cities for helping to prevent an even bigger spread. “For the moment we are not witnessing the uncontained global spread of this virus and we are not witnessing large-scale deaths,” Tedros told reporters in Geneva. He added, however, that countries should be “doing everything we can to prepare for a potential pandemic.” The term “pandemic” is used to describe an illness that spreads across numerous communities. South Korea hotspot South Korea, which has the largest number of cases outside China, reported 60 more infections and one more fatality on Tuesday, raising its death toll to eight and total patients to nearly 900. South Korea’s outbreak has centered around a religious sect in Daegu, the country’s fourth largest city. The country is on its highest “red” alert. As part of the containment efforts, school holidays were extended nationally while the 2.5 million people of Daegu were told to remain indoors.  The US Centers for Disease Control raised its caution level to warn Americans against “all nonessential travel to South Korea.” Italy, which has reported seven deaths and over 200 cases, has locked down 11 towns, while upcoming football matches in its Serie A and the Europa League will be played behind closed doors. With police manning checkpoints to enforce a blockade, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte has said that residents could face weeks of lockdown. Iran fears The disease — officially known as COVID-19 — spread to new countries including Afghanistan, Bahrain, Iraq, Kuwait and Oman. At least 12 people have died in Iran, the highest toll outside China. But there were concerns the situation might be worse than officially acknowledged. The semi-official ILNA news agency quoted one local lawmaker in hard-hit Qom — a religious center — who said 50 people had died there. The Iranian government denied the report, and pledged transparency. Even so, authorities have only reported 64 infections in Iran, an unusually small number that would mean an extremely high mortality rate. Michael Ryan, head of WHO’s health emergencies program, said a team from the UN agency would be arriving in Iran on Tuesday. But he cautioned against drawing any conclusions about the mortality rate. Iran “may only be detecting severe cases” because the epidemic was still at an early stage, he said. Several countries have taken measures to prevent arrivals from Iran. Bruce Aylward, leader of a WHO mission of international experts, said it was time for China to start lifting some of the restrictionsAFP – MATTHEW KNIGHT China peak In China, 508 new cases were reported, with all but nine at the epicenter in central Hubei province. Although that was up from 409 on Monday it was much lower than new infections being reported just a week ago. China’s death toll reached 2,663 on Tuesday, after 71 more people died. WHO’s Tedros said the epidemic peaked in China between January 23 and February 2. China has placed some 56 million in Hubei and its capital under quarantine since late last month, while other regions have enacted some forms of travel curbs and measures to keep millions more people indoors. Bruce Aylward, leader of a WHO mission of international experts, said late Monday it was time for China to start lifting some of the restrictions. “Obviously they want to get society back to a more normal semblance of what probably is the new normal, because this virus may be around… for months,” Aylward said. Reflecting the disquiet, global markets plunged on Monday, with Wall Street off 3.6 percent. Bargain buying helped some Asian markets into the green on Tuesday, but disquiet remained, with Tokyo dropping 3.0 percent by lunchtime. AFP "

AFP PHOTO Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte urged people “not to give in to panic and follow the advice of health authorities.” “We should not be afraid because of the rising numbers,” he told public radio station Rai Uno, adding in another interview that cases were being discovered “because we are carrying out thousands of checks.” The head of Italy’s civil protection department, Angelo Borrelli, told a news conference that 152 people had now tested positive for the virus in the country, including the three deceased. The cancer patient had been hospitalised for a few days, said Lombardy’s health chief, Giulio Gallera. “She’d been tested and they already knew she had the coronavirus,” he said, adding that it was too early to know whether the virus was the actual cause of death. The deaths, and steadily rising number of cases of infected people, have prompted a series of security measures to try to check the spread of the contagion. Eleven towns — 10 in Lombardy and 1 in neighboring Veneto — are under lockdown, with some 50,000 residents prohibited from leaving. Regional authorities have ordered gathering spots, such as bars, restaurants and discos to close. AFP "

Iran’s confirmed death toll rose to eight, prompting travel bans from neighboring countries. China’s numbers of daily new infections are well down from the outbreak’s early height. But the country’s authorities have sowed confusion about the data by repeatedly changing their counting methods. Meanwhile, South Korea reported another large jump in new virus cases Monday a day after the the president called for “unprecedented, powerful” steps to combat the outbreak that is increasingly confounding attempts to stop the spread. The 161 new cases bring South Korea’s total to 763 cases, and two more deaths raise its toll to seven.

All but one death were in Hubei province, where the outbreak emerged in December. Significant jumps in cases outside China have raised concern of the outbreak getting out of control. South Korea has the third-highest national total behind China and Japan, and cases have rapidly increased in Italy and Iran in just a few days. Most of Japan’s cases were from the Diamond Princess cruise ship, where nearly one-fifth of its 3,711 passengers and crew became infected. More than 140 of South Korea’s new cases were in and near Daegu, the city of 2.5 million people where most of the country’s infections have occurred. Five of the seven deaths were linked to a hospital in Cheongdo, near Daegu, where a slew of infections were confirmed among patients in a mental ward.

Unable to go out, the 29-year-old is now sealed inside her compound where she has to depend on online group-buying services to get food. “Living for at least another month isn’t an issue,” Guo told Agence France-Presse (AFP), explaining that she had her own stash of pickled vegetables and salted eggs. Wuhan, Hubei, China: This photo taken on February 22, 2020 shows a medical staff member treating a patient infected by the COVID-19 coronavirus at a hospital in Wuhan in China’s central Hubei province. Authorities in Wuhan on February 24 reversed a decision that would have allowed some people to leave the quarantined city at the centre of China’s deadly virus epidemic. AFP PHOTO But what scares her most is the lack of control — first, the entire city was sealed off, and then residents were limited to exiting their compound once every three days. Now even that has been taken away. Guo is among some 11 million residents in Wuhan, a city in central Hubei province that has been under effective quarantine since January 23 as Chinese authorities race to contain the epidemic. Since then, its people have faced a number of tightening controls over daily life as the death toll from the virus swelled to over 2,500 in China alone. But the new rules this month barring residents from leaving their neighborhoods are the most restrictive yet — and for some, threaten their livelihoods. “I still don’t know where to buy things once we’ve finished eating what we have at home,” said Pan Hongsheng, who lives with his wife and two children. Some neighborhoods have organized group-buying services, where supermarkets deliver orders in bulk. But in Pan’s community, “no one cares.” “The three-year-old doesn’t even have any milk powder left,” Pan told AFP, adding that he has been unable to send medicine to his in-laws — both in their 80s — as they live in a different area. “I feel like a refugee.” The “closed management of neighborhoods is bound to bring some inconvenience to the lives of the people,” Qian Yuankun, vice secretary of Hubei’s Communist Party committee, said at a press briefing last week. Demand for group-buying food delivery services has rocketed with the new restrictions, with supermarkets and neighborhood committees scrambling to fill orders. Most group-buying services operate through Chinese messaging app WeChat, which has ad-hoc chat groups for meat, vegetables and milk — even “hot dry noodles,” a famous Wuhan dish. More sophisticated shops and compounds have their own mini-app inside WeChat, where residents can choose packages priced by weight before orders are sent in bulk to grocery stores. In Guo’s neighborhood, for instance, a 6.5-kilogram (14.3-pound) set of five vegetables, including potatoes and baby cabbage, costs 50 yuan ($7.11). “You have no way to choose what you like to eat,” Guo said. “You cannot have personal preferences anymore.” AFP "

Piad,"THE government and the private sector should be able to prepare effective contingency plans for disasters and crises to ensure business continuity and immediate recovery, an official of the Department of Tourism (DoT) said. This was brought up as the tourism sector has been paralyzed since coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) outbreak following the travel ban from virus-infected countries, DoT Undersecretary Alma Rita Jimenez said in a forum in Pasay on Monday. “We ought to plan better. We will be facing this in increasing frequency and magnitude,” she said. The “exact nature” of Covid-19, which she described as a “burden” to the public health system, has remained unclear and this should mobilize the government and private sector to take strong safety precautionary measures. “Tourism is an industry that can hasten the spread of infectious diseases because transfers are invariably linked to travel,” she explained. Across Asia, the economic impact of Covid-19 outbreak has been felt already, Jimenez said. Thailand, for example, is expecting tourism arrivals to plunge by 5 million and anticipating losses of up to $8 billion in revenues. Indonesia is also anticipating a $4-billion revenue loss for its tourism industry. Singapore, meanwhile, is looking at a 30-percent revenue dip this year amid the outbreak. On the local front, the National Economic Development Authority recently said that tourism sector could potentially lose P22.7 billion in revenues per month due to the epidemic. Apart from preparation, Jimenez warned of the spread of false information about the virus that could not only foment public fear, but can also lead to further economic loss. Wrong information could adversely affect business decisions, she stressed. Walter Panganiban, Asian Institute of Management-Disaster Operation Center lead, shared the same sentiment. “Apart from potential health crisis, we are also facing credibility crisis,” he said. He pointed out that many are still misled by false information usually spread through social media, urging users to be more vigilant in consuming content. Panganiban also called for early planning of disaster and risk preparedness program to temper impact. “Tourism has become a huge global business that accounts for 10.4 percent of global gross domestic product and 10 percent of global employment,” Jimenez added.

,"February 25, 2020",nCov,Conservatives sweep Iran elections,Agence France-Presse,"TEHRAN: Iran’s conservatives claimed victory Sunday in a general election marked by the lowest turnout since the 1979 Islamic Revolution amid public anger against the government, an economic downturn and the disqualification of half the candidates. A conservative resurgence would heap pressure on beleaguered President Hassan Rouhani and signal a shift from four years ago when reformists and moderates won a slender majority in parliament. The interior ministry announced results of 95 percent of the 208 constituencies in Friday’s election, declaring the names of the winning candidates but without specifying their political affiliation. “Victory for the anti-American candidates, a new slap for Trump,” crowed the ultra-conservative Kayhan newspaper. “The people have disqualified the reformists,” it added, alluding to Rouhani’s backers, who have been weakened by President Donald Trump pulling the United States out of a landmark nuclear deal and by a slew of economic and political crises. Seventeen women were elected, the website of the government newspaper Iran said — the same number as in the outgoing 290-seat parliament. Interior Minister Abdolreza Rahmani Fazli announced the participation rate was 42.6 percent — the lowest in four decades. The election came two days after Iran announced its first cases of the deadly new coronavirus that emerged in China. “We held these elections when there were various incidents in the country: we had bad weather, there was this coronavirus disease, there was the plane crash,” Rahmani Fazli said, referring to the January 3 downing of a Ukrainian airliner, which killed 176 people. He said that in such a scenario “the turnout rate seems perfectly acceptable for us.” A low participation had been widely forecast, as a conservative-dominated electoral watchdog disqualified about half of the 16,000-odd candidates, mostly moderates and reformists. The Fars news agency said a second round would be held in at least 11 constituencies. One woman candidate has qualified for the second round, Iran newspaper added. Voter apathy marked the polls, but Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei lauded the people’s “huge participation” despite what he termed “negative propaganda” by foreign media. AFP "
,"February 25, 2020",nCov,Beggar-thy-neighbor practices don’t help with global epidemic control,The Manila Times,"After the outbreak of the novel coronavirus epidemic, the World Health Organization (WHO) has repeatedly advised against travel or trade restrictions and called on all countries to implement decisions that are evidence-based and convincing. However, there are still certain countries that didn’t follow the WHO’s authoritative advice and took excessive restrictions. Such beggar-thy-neighbor and selfish practices didn’t help with epidemic prevention and control, but created fear and panic, disturbed normal international personnel exchange and cooperation, and exerted negative impact on the order of the international aviation market and the development of the global economy, causing rising anxieties among the public. In front of the epidemic, any impulsive, irrational or unwise behavior could bring about secondary challenges. When the WHO declared the outbreak of the novel coronavirus in China a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) according to the International Health Regulations (IHR), it did not recommend any broader restrictions on travel or trade. Thanks to China’s decisive and effective prevention and control measures, the number of confirmed cases reported overseas only accounts for less than 1 percent of the total number worldwide. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) noted that adopting measures that go beyond the recommendations of the WHO and the ICAO without a proper risk assessment may result in unnecessary negative effects. “Responses that are anchored in fear, misinformation, racism and xenophobia will not save us from outbreaks like COVID-19.” That’s from a joint statement made by 16 health law scholars from the U.S., the U.K., Canada, Switzerland, Chile and Italy in a commentary published on The Lancet. They called on countries to start by rolling back illegal travel restrictions that have already been implemented and by supporting WHO and each other in implementing the IHR. Such voice show respect for the international laws and are conducive to safeguarding global common interests. Scientific research and practices indicated that taking extreme restrictions such as halting flights cannot really reduce the risk of virus spread. Canceling flights, cruises and locking down borders when it’s not advised by international agencies will be not only an act of economic self-harm but also a wasted opportunity to learn from the mistakes of the past, said an article published by American media. In the era of globalization, the world needs to conform to the trend of the times and jointly shoulder responsibilities and cope with challenges. Since the outbreak of the epidemic, national leaders of Thailand, Cambodia, Pakistan, and Canada have made it clear that they won’t ban entry of Chinese nationals. French President Emmanuel Macron said that France respects the professional guidelines proposed by the WHO in responding to the COVID-19 epidemic, and its response to the outbreak is generally objective, adding that the French Consulate General in Wuhan is still operating. Canadian Health Minister Patty Hajdu believes that it lacks basis and is unreasonable to ban entry of Chinese nationals. Thai Deputy Prime Minister and Public Health Minister Anutin Charnvirakul said imposing a travel ban on Chinese citizens won’t help the government’s fight against coronavirus. Cambodian Prime Minister Samdech Techo Hun Sen visited Beijing amid the raging epidemic, showing support from the Cambodian government and the Cambodian people. Kang Seung Seok, the new consul general of the Republic of Korea (ROK) in Wuhan, arrived in the city amid the epidemic on Feb. 20. These facts prove that the strong and resilient relations between China and these countries are unbreakable and cannot be destroyed by certain countries. In the era of globalization, the interests and destinies of countries are intertwined. To respond to the epidemic is by no means to stop all socio-economic activities. The right choice is to try to ensure normal economic activities on the premise of strengthening health and safety protection. However, excessive or even extreme restrictive measures adopted by some countries, such as cancelling flights, will only lead to more negative impacts of the epidemic, causing lose-lose results and casting a shadow on world economic growth. According to U.S. media reports, Washington’s comprehensive restrictions will severely hurt U.S. companies that rely on Chinese products or target Chinese customers. Goldman Sachs recently released a report anticipating a 0.4 percentage point slowdown of U.S. annualized growth in the first quarter due to the coronavirus outbreak, as the U.S. restrictions will reduce the number of Chinese tourists by 28 percent and their spending by $5.8 billion. When speaking with U.S. President Donald Trump over phone, Chinese President Xi Jinping noted that it takes joint efforts from all countries to bring the epidemics under control. He also said China hopes that the U.S. will assess the epidemic in a calm manner, and adopt and adjust its response. In response to public health emergencies, panic, chaos, and excessive restrictions are not suggested. In the era of globalization, adopting beggar-thy-neighbor and selfish practices is not able to keep oneself unharmed. The right practice is to strengthen international cooperation and work together to cope with challenges in a scientific, rational and responsible manner. Those who treat their neighbors as threats and plunder a burning house will hurt not only the interests of the world, but also those of their own.

,"February 24, 2020",nCov,"South Korea put on high alert, Italy battles virus outbreak",THE MANILA TIMES,"SEOUL, South Korea: South Korea’s president said on Sunday that he was putting his country on its highest alert for infectious diseases, ordering officials to take “unprecedented, powerful” steps to fight a soaring viral outbreak, while a continent away in Italy, authorities battled to contain Europe’s first major outbreak of the virus. China also reported hundreds more infections for a total of about 77,000, and Iran raised its death toll from the virus to eight — the highest toll outside of China. While the number of patients worldwide is increasing, some virus clusters have shown no link to China and experts are struggling to trace where those clusters started. The Iranian health ministry said there were now 43 confirmed cases in Iran, which did not report its first case of the virus until Wednesday. In Italy’s northern Lombardy region, which includes the nation’s financial capital, Milan, the governor announced Sunday that the number of confirmed cases stood at 110. Italy now has 152 cases, the largest number outside of Asia, including three deaths, the most recent on Sunday. Venice, which is full of tourists for Carnival events, reported its first two cases, said Veneto Gov. Luca Zaia, whose region includes the lagoon city. It wasn’t immediately known if the two infected had participated in Carnival festivities.

Cinemas and theaters were also ordered shuttered, including Milan’s legendary La Scala. Warning that China’s virus epidemic is “still grim and complex,” President Xi Jinping called for more efforts to stop the outbreak, revive industry and prevent the disease from disrupting spring planting of crops. Xi defended the ruling Communist Party’s response as “timely and effective” in a video conference with officials in charge of anti-disease work, according to the official Xinhua News Agency. “The current epidemic situation is still grim and complex,” Xinhua cited Xi as saying. “Prevention and control are at the most critical stage.” South Korean President Moon Jae-in said his government had increased its anti-virus alert level by one notch to “Red,” the highest level, in response to the spread of the disease that has infected more than 600 people in the country, mostly in the last few days. The step was last taken in 2009 to guard against a novel influenza outbreak that killed more than 260 people in South Korea. Under the highest alert level, authorities can order the temporary closure of schools and reduce the operation of public transportation and flights to and from South Korea. Moon’s education minister, Yoo Eun-hae, said later Sunday that the new school year for kindergartens, elementary, middle and high schools in South Korea has been put off by one week and will start on March 9. Moon said the outbreak “has reached a crucial watershed,” and that the next few days will be critical. “We shouldn’t be bound by regulations and hesitate to take unprecedented, powerful measures,” he said. South Korea announced 169 more cases of the new virus, bringing the country’s total to 602. It also reported three more fatalities, raising its death toll to six. Mainland China reported 648 new infections for a total of 76,936. The daily death toll fell slightly to 97. In all, 2,442 people have died in the country from COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus. The number of new Chinese cases has seesawed daily but has remained under 1,000 for the past four days. Several changes to how infections are counted, however, have made it difficult to draw conclusions from the figures.

More than 80% of the country’s cases are in Hubei, where the death toll has also been higher than the rest of the nation. Most of the South Korean cases have been reported in the country’s fourth-largest city, Daegu, and the surrounding area. According to the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, some 320 cases have also been confirmed to have links to a branch of the local Shincheonji church in Daegu, which has become the biggest cluster of viral infections in South Korea. Shincheonji, which has been viewed as a cult movement by mainstream Christian organizations, tried to defend itself from growing public anger directed at the church. In a video statement posted on its website, church spokesman Simon Kim said Shincheonji has shut down all its 1,100 local churches and other facilities since one of its church members tested positive for the virus on Feb. 18, the first patient in Daegu. Earlier Sunday, Daegu Mayor Kwon Yong-jin said there were concerns that the number of those infected in the city could see yet another massive increase because authorities were launching intensive examinations of church members with virus-related symptoms. Meanwhile. a cruise ship passenger who had been hospitalized after testing positive for the new virus died on Sunday, the third fatality from the Diamond Princess, Japan’s health ministry said. The ministry also announced 57 more cases of infections from the ship, including 55 crew members still on board and two passengers who had infected roommates and are in a prolonged quarantine at a government facility. With the new cases, 691 people have been infected on the ship, or nearly one-fifth of its 3,711 passengers and crew. Japan has confirmed a total of 838 cases and four deaths from the virus, including those on the ship. Meanwhile, a diplomatic row erupted after Israel turned back a South Korean airliner, underscoring fear and tensions over the fast-spreading outbreak. A Korean Air flight with 188 passengers that landed at Tel Aviv’s Ben Gurion airport Saturday evening was taxied away from the terminal while authorities allowed only 11 Israelis to enter the country. The plane returned to South Korea with the rest of the passengers on Sunday, according to airline officials. Seoul’s Foreign Ministry said Sunday that it was closely monitoring the incident and providing active consular assistance to South Koreans staying in Israel. It said it will evacuate South Korean tourists from Israel if necessary. Yonhap news agency cited South Korea’s Foreign Ministry as registering a strong protest with the Israeli government. South Korea earlier informed Israel that a group of tourists who traveled to Israel and the West Bank for a week this month tested positive for the virus upon returning home. Israeli and Palestinian health authorities asked people who were in close contact with the tourists to quarantine themselves. South Korean health authorities said Sunday that 18 of the 39 South Koreans who had made the group pilgrimage later tested positive for the virus. She said the 21 others were being tested.

(AP Photo/Luca Bruno) Israel’s Foreign Ministry issued travel warnings to South Korea and Japan due to the coronavirus, and the Health Ministry ordered Israelis returning from those countries to remain in home quarantine, as previously ordered for those returning from Hong Kong, China, Macau, Thailand and Singapore. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will be adding more restrictions on entry to Israel from additional countries, including Australia and Italy. Jordan said it was denying entry of non-Jordanians coming from Iran and South Korea, on top of a previous ban on those coming from China. Nationals arriving from those countries will be quarantined. Downtown Daegu was mostly deserted Sunday, with shelves at some supermarkets and stores empty. Many restaurants, bars, real-estate offices and tour agencies shut down as traffic nosedived and people stayed home, ordering food and supplies online. Kim Mi-yeon, who opened her cake shop in Daegu on Sunday despite worries about infection, said she received only one group of customers. “I’m also worried about being infected, but I still opened my shop today to make a living,” she said by phone. “On weekends, I used to hire five part-time employees, but I’ve recently told all of them not to come. How can I hire them at a time when I have fewer then 10 customers a day?” AP "

Piad,"Corporate earnings report may provide some optimism this week in the local bourse that has been trading sideways due to worries over the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) outbreak. “We see an upward bias as corporate earnings continue to come out,” Philstocks Financial Inc. senior research analyst Japhet Tantiangco said, noting that the main index is seen to trade within the 7,300 to 7,500 territory. Last week, among the firms that announced its 2019 financial reports were Jollibee Foods Corp., DM Wenceslao and Associates Inc., AyalaLand Logistics Holdings Corp. and Integrated Micro-Electronics Inc. Tantiangco, meanwhile, said that fears from Covid-19 might still put investors at the sidelines this week. “The optimism brought by the results, however, will be tempered by the Covid-19 concerns which continue to linger,” he added. Brokerage firm 2TradeAsia shared the same sentiment over the Covid-19 outbreak. “As the macro picture awaits more cogent policies to counter Covid-19’s economic impact, corporate watcher will continue to heed for capital expenditures and earnings feelers for 2020.” “Volume scenario in the coming week may be characterized by a crescendo, with a holiday (February 25) early in the week possibly thinning out turnover, before later finding momentum on funds’ window dressing,” it added. On February 25, the local bourse will be closed in observance of the EDSA People Power Revolt anniversary. 2TradeAsia pegged the immediate support and resistance within the 7,200 to 7,300 mark and 7,450 to 7,500 level, respectively.

,"February 24, 2020",nCov,"Virus hits shipping, causes global strain",Agence France-Presse,"LONDON: Sea freight transport, the lifeblood of trade and a bellwether of the global economy, has been blown off course by the new coronavirus, sparking general alarm. As analysts pore over charts to gauge just how badly Chinese mega-factories have been hit, figures provided by cargo ship traffic paint a gloomy picture. The Baltic Dry Index (BDI) reflects the daily price of moving goods such as coal, rice and wheat along routes deemed representative of the global market. Some call it the canary in the coal mine for the economic world. The BDI has now reached lows last seen in early 2016, when the shipping sector was suffering a supply and demand imbalance in the wake of the 2008-2009 global economic crisis. Its “capesize” index for the largest category of ships — ones that cannot even squeeze through the Suez or Panama Canals — is at historic lows. “The latest slump is directly related to the coronavirus epidemic in China and the subsequent restrictions on activity,” London’s Capital Economics consultancy said in a research note, referring to the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), “Given that China accounts for about 40 percent of global seaborne trade, it is not so surprising that freight rates have tanked.” Lars Bastian Ostereng, an analyst with Norway’s Arctic Securities, said the outbreak “basically led to full stops in many ports in China.” ‘Free fall’
Louis Dreyfus Armateurs, a global merchant based in France, is one of many shipping giants approaching China with caution. The 169-year-old company has banned its seafarers from going ashore and stopped relieving its crews at Chinese ports, resulting in considerable disruptions. “The coronavirus epidemic is a very serious event for the market,” Antoine Person, a top executive at the firm, told Agence France-Presse. China does not just produce goods but is also a major consumer with a booming middle class and the world’s largest population. It accounts for “about 35 percent of all seaborne dry bulk imports in the world,” Ostereng of Arctic Securities said. With the number of reported deaths from Covid-19 now above 2,400 and swathes of the country under effective lockdown for a second month, Chinese demand might suffer for months to come, Ostereng said. This would impact exports to China from around the world, including the United States and Europe, with accompanying political repercussions. “Power generation in China has dropped and steel mills are reportedly cutting capacity utilization which, respectively, point to lower demand for coal and iron ore,” Capital Economics wrote. That in turn reduces Chinese imports of coal and steel produced in places such as Australia and Brazil, impacting their economies. The price of shipping both commodities is reflected in the BDI index, which is in “free fall,” Capital Economics said. In addition to importing raw materials — Chinese factories consume nearly 40 percent of metals produced in the world — the factory slowdown has forced the world’s largest shipper to brace for the year ahead. Denmark’s AP Moller-Maersk said on Thursday that the outbreak has “significantly lowered visibility on what to expect in 2020.” “We expect a weak start to the year,” it warned. Seasonal swings
Ambrose Evans-Pritchard, the international business editor of The Daily Telegraph, wrote on Thursday that the shipping collapse was “threatening weeks of chaos for manufacturing supply lines and the broader structure of global trade.” He conceded that optimists expect Chinese demand and factory output to explode once the restrictions end and businesses try to make up for lost ground. But no one can be sure when that will be — or if the world has avoided another viral wave that reaches pandemic proportions. Some shipowners, intermediaries and other market actors said factors such as which way the unpredictable China-US trade war goes would weigh as well. Person, the Louis Dreyfus Armateurs executive, said that “new shipping standards and weather events are also behind the fall in the BDI.” The weather, for one, will certainly improve, and the extended Lunar New Year festivities in China have ended, raising some hopes. But Chinese factories are still experiencing severe worker shortages and Evans-Pritchard is unconvinced. “Fiscal stimulus is coming but the transmission channels will remain blocked as long as the lockdown measures stay in place,” he wrote. “But to lift the curfew risks losing control of the virus.” AFP "

If our partner agreed that funds will increase, we may need other part of the group,” its president and chief operating officer Joseph Chua told reporters last week. Flag carrier Philippine Airlines (PAL) will “definitely going to be of use,” he added. MacroAsia’s share in the consortium, with Chinese partner China Communications Construction Co. Ltd., is only 40 percent, Chua noted. According to him, while MacroAsia has no specific number yet of how much it intends to raise for its share, the company is looking to tap debt bonds. “We are going to debt bonds. We are not looking at issuing [shares],” he said. MacroAsia in a disclosure last February 14 said the consortium bagged P208.5-billion phase one of the project, two months after it submitted its proposal to upgrade the gateway in Cavite. The provincial government of Cavite is eyeing to break ground on the phase one of the SPIA development within the second quarter, once the consortium signs the contract documents. However, Chua said they have yet to meet their Chinese counterparts amid the new coronavirus outbreak. The first phase of the project covers the construction of the first runway, expecting to cater to 25 million passengers annually. The initial phase also involves the development of the Sangley connector road and bridge to link the Kawit segment of the Manila-Cavite Expressway to the airport. "
,"February 24, 2020",nCov,PH needs its own Center for Disease Control and Prevention,The Manila Times,"IF there is a lasting and sobering lesson from the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic, it is the fact that mankind still needs to up its game in combating and wrestling to the ground infectious diseases like Covid-19. We in the Philippines must learn, too, this message to heart. There is much merit and timeliness to the current legislative proposal for our Congress to create a Philippine Center for Disease Control and Prevention, similar to what many countries, both developed or emerging, have today. As the Covid-19 outbreak approaches its climacteric and, hopefully, its full control by modern medicine and health authorities, the idea of establishing our own infectious disease control center has gathered more urgency and wider support. AFP PHOTO Rep. Joey Salceda of Albay deserves to be commended for recognizing quite early the dangers of a global epidemic arising from the outbreak and our country’s unpreparedness for such. While so much of the world was still sleeping, Salceda filed on January 29 House Bill (HB) 6096, which seeks the passage of the Center for Disease Control (CDC) and Prevention Act of 2020. This was well before the whole world became aware of the wide-ranging and deadly threat of the new coronavirus. The threat and its toll are now well-known and staggering. The objective of HB 6096 is clear and straightforward. In its explanatory note, it says: “This bill would make the country better prepared for what this proposal calls ‘sudden onset health emergencies’ or those emergencies whose risk exponentially increase over time, absent any intervention.” The CDC that will be created by the Act will absorb communicable disease units in a newly established Communicable Disease Prevention Bureau. It would also absorb the Disease Emergency Management Bureau, the Epidemiology Bureau of the Department of Health and the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine, according to the bill. The functions of the center include active surveillance of diseases through epidemiologic and laboratory investigations, data collection, analysis and distribution; developing operational programs relating to communicable diseases; conducting operational research aimed at developing communicable disease prevention; and recommending the exercise of certain powers by the president in the case of an epidemic. The measure also grants broader quarantine powers to the Health secretary and authorizes local government units to use calamity funds during a state of health emergency. The center will be headed by an executive director who will be appointed by the president, with the rank of an undersecretary to manage and direct activities and advise the Health Secretary on policy matters. “Our lack of institutional capacity to implement comprehensive public health management programs, as well as the present orientation of border law enforcement toward prevention of human trafficking and smuggling, but not toward public health protection, stymies the country’s ability to decisively address the risks of communicable disease,” Salceda said. The model for the proposed disease control center is clearly the well-known and highly regarded United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which is the leading national public health institute of the US. The CDC is a US federal agency under the Department of Health and Human Services and is headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia. Its main goal is to protect public health and safety through the control and prevention of disease, injury and disability in the US and internationally. The CDC focuses national attention on developing and applying disease control and prevention. It especially trains its attention on infectious disease, food-borne pathogens, environmental health, occupational safety and health, health promotion, injury prevention and educational activities designed to improve the health of US citizens. In addition, the CDC researches and provides information on non-infectious diseases such as obesity and diabetes. Its focus has broadened to include chronic diseases, disabilities, injury control, workplace hazards, environmental health threats and terrorism preparedness. The CDC is organized into “centers, institutes and offices,” with each organizational unit implementing the agency’s activities in a particular area of expertise while also providing intra-agency support and resource-sharing for cross-cutting issues and specific health threats. We will not find a better model for our disease control center than America’s CDC. We can learn best practices in meeting a health emergency from it. "

The Department of Foreign Affairs on Saturday night said the infected 34-year-old Filipino, who was not identified, was in stable condition. Foreign Affairs Assistant Secretary Eduardo Meñez said the embassy “maintains close coordination with the UAE authorities, assuring that our kababayan (countryman) is being given maximum care and support.” He added that the 43-year-old Filipino earlier reported infected with the Covid-19 was transferred to another medical facility and was being closely monitored since his condition was not improving.

,"February 24, 2020",nCov,US: Russian fueling Covid-19 alarm,Agence France-Presse,"WASHINGTON, D.C.: Thousands of Russian-linked social media accounts have launched a coordinated effort to spread alarm about the new coronavirus, disrupting global efforts to fight the epidemic, United States officials say. The disinformation campaign promotes unfounded conspiracy theories that the US is behind the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) outbreak in an apparent bid to damage the US image around the world by seizing on health concerns. State Department officials tasked with combating Russian disinformation told the Agence France-Presse (AFP) that false personas were being used on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to advance Russian talking points in multiple languages. “Russia’s intent is to sow discord and undermine US institutions and alliances from within, including through covert and coercive malign influence campaigns,” said Philip Reeker, acting Assistant Secretary of State for Europe and Eurasia. “By spreading disinformation about coronavirus, Russian malign actors are once again choosing to threaten public safety by distracting from the global health response,” he added. The claims that have been circulating online in recent weeks include allegations that the virus was a US effort to “wage economic war on China,” that it is a biological weapon manufactured by the Central Intelligence Agency or part of a Western-led effort “to push anti-China messages.” Russia on Saturday (Sunday in Manila) denied the accusations, with Foreign Ministry spokesman Maria Zakharova telling the TASS state news agency: “This is a deliberately false story.” The disinformation campaign was identified by US monitors in mid-January after Chinese officials announced a third death from the new coronavirus in Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak. Close coordination observed
Disinformation and false theories about the novel coronavirus are considered a serious threat. Several thousand online accounts previously identified for airing Russian-backed messages on major events such as the war in Syria, the Yellow Vest protests in France and Chile’s mass demonstrations are posting “almost near identical” messages about the epidemic, according to a report prepared for the US State Department’s Global Engagement Center and seen by AFP. The accounts run by humans, not bots, post at similar times in English, Spanish, Italian, German and French and could be linked back to Russian proxies, or carry similar messages to Russian-backed outlets such as RT and Sputnik, it said. “In this case, we were able to see their full disinformation ecosystem in effect, including state TV, proxy web sites and thousands of false social media personas all pushing the same themes,” said Special Envoy Lea Gabrielle, head of the Global Engagement Center, which is tasked with tracking and exposing propaganda and disinformation. During many past news events, the accounts would post actively for up to 72 hours. But messages about the new coronavirus have been uploaded every day over the past month a sign, US officials said, of Russia’s investment in a story unlikely to disappear soon from the headlines. US intelligence has also said that Russia interfered through social media manipulation in the 2016 election and seeks to do so again in 2020. AFP "

,"February 24, 2020",nCov,"As risks of global Covid-19 increase, so must vigilance in PH",Dan Steinbock,"DAN STEINBOCK In addition to the Chinese mainland, the struggle against the new cases and outbreak clusters of the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) is shifting to countries outside China. IN the Philippines, the few positive cases have been associated with Wuhan. But that’s not the end of the struggle. As the Covid-19 is now beginning to go global, a set of new risks loom in the horizon, including (but not limited to) international complacency, botched quarantines, “super-spreaders,” evacuations and poorly monitored self-quarantines. Additionally, potential new risks include weaker health care systems, untraceable virus clusters, extended incubation periods and local transmissions — along with the resurgence of old risks and clusters. What the Philippines needs is seasoned management of human and economic risks. In light of proximity, feedback effects and the large numbers of overseas Filipino workers, the country is not immune to risks, but there are several scenarios as to how those risks might play out. New virus risks outside China
Internationally, the number of total confirmed coronavirus cases now (Feb. 23, 2020) is close to 79,000, while the number of deaths is nearly 2,500. Outside China, the number of confirmed cases exceeds 1,400, while the number of deaths is almost 15. While these numbers will continue to climb, the low starting point suggests China’s draconian measures may have saved many lives within and outside China. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said about preemption measures outside China’s borders. Risk of international complacency (World Health Organization or WHO member-states). On February 4, WHO chief Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.said it was countries outside China — not China — that had proved slow in sharing complete information about cases. After almost a month of international crisis and global alert, three of five WHO member-countries had failed to provide adequate information in a timely manner. It was only after Tedros’ public statement that some member states began to share data with WHO. As the timeline suggests, the number of cases outside China soared after February 4 and the missed opportunities of greater international cooperation (see figure). Covid-19 international risks have soared since early February Risk of botched quarantines (Diamond Princess cruise). On February 3, more than 3,700 passengers and crew were quarantined by the Japanese Ministry of Health after one passenger on the ship tested positive for Covid-19. Just two-and-a-half weeks later, some 635 passengers tested positive for the virus, while two passengers had died after contracting the virus. It is this cruise and its substandard quarantine measures that account for almost half of all international cases. Risk of super-spreaders (South Korean cult church). From the start, potential super-spreaders who could endanger others have been a great concern. On February 10, a 61-year-old woman, who worships at the Daegu cult church, developed fever but twice refused to be tested for the virus, claiming she had not recently traveled abroad. After she had attended at least four services before the diagnosis, 40 other members of the church were infected. Risks of evacuations (State Department vs Center for Disease Control and Prevention or CDC). As countries seek to rescue citizens from infected territories, failed evacuations can pose new risks. Last week, the United States CDC urged to keep 14 infected US citizens in Japan, yet the State Department put the infected on a plane with healthy people, claiming that a plastic-aligned enclosure would mitigate infection risks. Risks of poorly monitored self-quarantines (several countries). On February 21, California health officials said 7,600 people who had returned to the state after visiting China during the virus outbreak had been asked to quarantine themselves at home this month. Self-quarantine can help health officials to allocate vital resources to the most critical cases, yet any laxness in self-quarantine could endanger far more lives. Moreover, the CDC is not tracking how many people from each US state who have returned from China have been asked to isolate themselves. Unknown risks and world’s most vulnerable
In addition to the threats that we understand, there are potential, more challenging risks, which we understood poorly or don’t even know about. Risks of untraceable virus clusters (several countries). In South Korea, Singapore and Iran, virus clusters have led to leaps in cases. As it is becoming harder to trace where the clusters started, the virus may be spreading too broadly for traditional public health steps to contain it. That highlights the importance of Chinese standard-setting measures that several countries are now emulating in part or fully. Risk of real incubation period (faster, longer than presumed). Initially, clinical evidence suggested that the incubation period was two to 14 days, which then became the standard for quarantine measures. In the past weeks, Chinese authorities have extended these periods because new evidence suggests that, with possible outliers, the incubation period could be zero to 27 days. Risks of weaker health care systems (poorer developing countries). In late January, the WHO declared the ongoing virus outbreak a “public health emergency of international concern” (Pheic). The goal was to boost international coordination against the expected internationalization of the outbreaks. As WHO officials have repeatedly noted, the Pheic was motivated by the possible effects of the virus, if it would spread to countries with weaker health care systems. Although the numbers of cases are still low outside proximate Asia, virus clusters have already emerged in emerging Asia, big European economies, North America, the Middle East and Russia. The real question is how forcefully the virus will arrive in the rest of the Americas and particularly Africa. Risks of local transmission. On February 21, when the virus had spread to 25 countries, local cycles of transmission had already occurred in 12 countries after case importation. In Africa, Egypt has so far confirmed one case. As such cases are expected to proliferate, the probability of such risks will climb accordingly. In modeling simulations based on air travel, new research indicates that the highest importation risk involves a set of countries — including Egypt, Algeria and South Africa — that have moderate to high capacity to respond to outbreaks. In turn, countries at moderate risk — including Nigeria, Ethiopia, Sudan, Angola, Tanzania, Ghana and Kenya — have variable capacity and high vulnerability. Covid-19 international risks have soared since early February Amid their struggles against the Ebola virus and the unprecedented locust plague, many countries in Africa are struggling to step up preparedness to detect and cope with Covid-19 virus importations. Consequently, resources will ultimately have to be prioritized, particularly in countries with moderate risk that might be ill-prepared to detect imported cases and to limit onward transmission. Old risks could resurface along with the new
As new risks are evolving, old risks are not yet fully gone and likely to pose lingering threats even in China. Risk of “closed spaces” (prison systems, nursing homes). On February 21, Chinese prisons reported some 500 new cases of infections among inmates and guards. It was followed by news of infections in nursing homes. Both cases highlight the high transmissibility of the virus in spaces of confinement. Risks of new potential mutations and infection scenarios. The plausible current assumption is that, like seasonal influenza, the Covid-19 is causing mild and self-limiting disease in most people who are infected, with severe disease more likely among older people or those with comorbidities (e.g., diabetes, pulmonary disease). But if the scenario changes towards wider community transmission with multiple international foci (or toward new kind of mutations), current mitigation procedures will prove inadequate and countries will be more likely to emulate Chinese measures.

,"February 24, 2020",nCov,PAL Holdings seeks to cushion virus effects,Tyrone Jasper C. Piad,"The operator of Philippine Airlines (PAL) can potentially cushion the adverse impact of travel bans due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) outbreak with its recent authorized capital stock hike. PAL Holdings Inc. announced last week it approved the increase of its capital stock to P30 billion from P13 billion, amending its articles of incorporation to do so. The flag carrier said that it needed fresh capital to support its expansion plans. Philippine Airlines Airbus A330-300 PHOTO FROM WIKIMEDIA COMMONS “The increase in capital stock is a good strategy in the long term to sustain its profitability as the global growth persist despite a slowdown in the short term,” Diversified Securities trader Aniceto Pangan told The Manila Times in a mobile message. For Philstocks Financial Inc. senior research analyst Japhet Tantiangco, the capital increase could position the company to follow its expansion plans amid the current slowdown. “Now, the increase in funds gives the company the power to pursue its development plans even if its going through losing times right now,” he added. Still, both analysts flagged the worries over Covid-19 still weighing on PAL shares. PAL shares on Friday dipped by 20 centavos or 2.78 percent to finish at P7 apiece, amid the 0.58-drop for the Philippine Stock Exchange index. Its shares were flat week-on-week. Year-to-date, the flag carrier’s stocks have gone down by 10.83 percent. “We currently have a travel ban on China which results to forgone revenues for the air transportation company,” Tantiangco said. “PAL will continue to be bearish in the near term due to the pessimism of the [Covid-19] virus but looks promising in the long term,” Pangan added. The Philippine Airlines operator, along with other industry players, recently cancelled flights to and from Covid-19-affected countries as safety precaution. Tantiangco added that bleak outlook toward PAL shares was also fueled by anticipated poor 2019 full-year financial performance as indicated by its nine-month report. In the January-September 2019 period, PAL saw its consolidated net loss widen by more than two-fold to P7.95 billion from P3.43 billion year-on-year on the back of lower revenues, coupled with higher expenses. “Another culprit to be blamed on PAL’s plunge in the local market is the expectation of another year of losses for 2019. And PAL has already been running on losses since 2017,” Tantiangco said. “Overall, the decline in PAL’s share price can be attributed to their negative financial and operating performance as well as the dim prospects brought by the ongoing epidemic,” he added. This week, the Philstocks analyst said PAL shares were seen to continue trading at the P7 level, pegging the resistance at the P7.40 mark. "
,"February 24, 2020",nCov,South Korea raises highest virus alert level,Agence France-Presse,"SEOUL: South Korea is raising the alert on the new coronavirus to the “highest level,” President Moon Jae-in said on Sunday as the country reported 123 new cases. South Korea has seen a rapid surge in the number of coronavirus cases in recent days after a cluster of infections emerged from a religious sect in the southern city of Daegu last week. The national toll of 556 cases is now the highest outside China, apart from the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan. ON HIGHEST ALERT South Korean President Moon Jae-in speaks during a government meeting on the coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic at the government complex in Seoul on Sunday. The country raised its alert level to the ‘highest’ as the country added 123 new cases. AFP PHOTO “The Covid-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) incident faces a grave turning point. The next few days will be crucial,” Moon said following a government meeting on the virus. “The government will raise the alert level to the highest level of ‘grave’ according to experts’ recommendations and drastically strengthen our response system,” Moon said. He also urged officials not to hesitate from taking “unprecedented powerful measures” to contain the outbreak. On Sunday, South Korea reported 123 new cases and two deaths, taking the country-wide toll to four. One of the victims was a patient being treated for mental health issues at a hospital in Cheongdo, a southern city linked to the religious sect where around 100 new cases were reported. Among the latest infections, 75 involved the Shincheonji Church of Jesus in the nearby city of Daegu, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) said. More than 300 cases have been linked to the church, starting with a 61-year-old woman who developed a fever on February 10 and attended at least four church services in Daegu before being diagnosed. Some 9,300 Shincheonji members in Daegu had either been quarantined or had been asked to stay at home, said KCDC director Jung Eun-kyeong, with more than 1,240 saying they had symptoms. Daegu South Korea’s fourth-largest city, with a population of 2.5 million reported more than 90 new cases on Sunday, bringing the city’s total to 247, mayor Kwon Young-jin said. “The crisis level of Daegu and the North Gyeongsang province is grave,” said Kwon, who advised locals to stay indoors. The mayor asked all Shincheonji members with symptoms to come forward and be tested. Authorities have yet to reach around 670 members of the church. Shincheonji is often accused of being a cult, and claims its founder has donned the mantle of Jesus Christ and will take 144,000 people with him to heaven on judgement day. But with more church members than available places in heaven, they are said to have to compete for slots and pursue converts. “Hiding is not the answer. If you hide, it could hurt your health, your family’s health, and will not help in the early cessation of the situation,” Kwon said. ‘Increased caution’
Daegu and Cheongdo the birthplace of Shincheonji’s founder Lee Man-hee were designated as “special management zones” on Friday. Among the new cases were 18 people who recently returned from a group pilgrimage to Israel, the KCDC said. It was unclear how they had contracted the infection, but authorities said one of the victims were likely exposed to the virus before their trip, given Israel has reported only one confirmed Covid-19 case so far. Israel has issued an entry ban on South Koreans and refused to allow non-Israelis to disembark from a Korean Air plane on Saturday. The US State Department on Saturday raised its travel advisory for South Korea, joining a handful of countries bolstering their vigilance after its rapid spike in the number of infections. United States citizens were asked to “exercise increased caution” when travelling to South Korea, where “sustained community spread” has been reported. “Sustained community spread means that people in South Korea have been infected with the virus, but how or where they became infected is not known, and the spread is ongoing,” the State Department said on its website. Separately, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also issued an “Alert Level 2” travel health notice, saying “older adults and those with chronic medical conditions should consider postponing nonessential travel.” Great Britain has also advised its nationals “against all but essential travel to Daegu and Cheongdo.” AFP "
,"February 24, 2020",nCov,Chinese restaurants starved for cash,Agence France-Presse,"BEIJING: It is lunch time in Beijing, but the only diner in Cindy’s Cafe is an employee having a staff meal — it has been closed for more than three weeks as China battles a deadly virus epidemic. Restaurants are taking a huge hit as many people across the country of 1.4 billion have been either under some form of quarantine or are reluctant to venture outside since late January over fears of contagion. At Cindy’s Cafe in Beijing’s Roosevelt Plaza, dine-in revenue has fallen to zero, and relying on deliveries hardly makes up the shortfall, said manager Cai Yaoyang. This photo taken on Feb. 20, 2020 shows a lone man eating in a restaurant where all but one of the tables has been pushed to the walls in Beijing. AFP PHOTO “On a good day in the past, we could earn over 1,000 yuan ($143) a day from deliveries,” Cai told Agence France-Presse. “Now, it’s just around 200 to 300 yuan a day. The impact is especially big.” He estimates losses to the company, which has more than 10 outlets in China, could be “at least a few million (yuan)” given rent and unused stock from the unexpected Lunar New Year closures. “If there is no business, staff may be asked to take more days off,” said Cai. Many restaurants have suspended dine-ins to help curb the spread of the virus, but eateries that have resumed operations remain largely empty, with people still encouraged to stay home to avoid infections. The new coronavirus has killed more than 2,400 in China and infected nearly 77,000. At an outlet of Bellagio Cafe, another restaurant chain, employee Zhu Xiangying told AFP it had only made 30,000 yuan in around 10 days, compared with over 200,000 yuan in normal times. Selling fresh produce
The China Cuisine Association said in a report this month that the country’s restaurant industry saw 4.67 trillion yuan ($665 billion) in catering revenue last year, with earnings over the Lunar New Year break making up over 15 percent. With millions of people staying indoors during the festival this year, those holiday earnings have evaporated. Some, including hotpot chain Haidilao — which has temporarily closed its China outlets — have turned to selling fresh and frozen products directly to communities. In Yunhaiyao, a chain specialising in Yunnan cuisine, restaurant tables are piled with fresh vegetables instead of cooked dishes — ready to be packed and delivered to housing compounds. Yunhaiyao, which has more than 100 outlets in China, now bulk-buys groceries for residents near its stores as a new income stream. It has also rolled out a fresh line of prepared ingredients so customers can quickly whip up Yunnan specialities while cooped up at home. Zhao Yebule, store manager at Yunhaiyao’s Tongzhou branch in Beijing, said deliveries can rake in up to 6,000 yuan daily. But the company is still in a pinch. Li Jianying, a regional manager overseeing 10 outlets, said only around half of his staff were ready to resume work. Others cannot leave their residential compounds freely or face a 14-day quarantine when they return to Beijing. “Our sales are just about 10 percent that of regular times before the epidemic,” with delivery sales falling by half, he added. Yunhaiyao remains worried about expenses such as rent, and has taken a 10 million yuan loan to ease cashflow pressures. Li, however, stressed there were no plans to cut staff for now. ‘Sharing’ employees
One way out is to “share” employees with other businesses that are enjoying an increase in demand: e-commerce platforms. JD.com saw a 215-percent spike in fresh food sales over the Lunar New Year, while Meituan Grocery’s daily sales in Beijing tripled at its peak during the holiday. Li estimates “a few hundred” Yunhaiyao staff have taken on short-term work with third-party firms like supermarkets or online platforms. Cai added Cindy Cafe was in talks to help workers find temporary employment. JD.com and JD-backed Dada Group have offered more than 35,000 jobs, with over half being frontline roles such as couriers and drivers, while around 40 workers from restaurant chain Putien now staff Meituan Grocery as well. Yet, the current situation remains a looming threat to jobs. A survey by Peking and Tsinghua universities, covering around 1,000 small-and medium-sized enterprises, said about 85 percent of these firms could only survive up to three months on their cash reserves. Even as policymakers extend preferential loans and introduce tax breaks — among a slew of other measures — authorities “won’t be able to extend life support to all,” said Capital Economics in a report on Wednesday. “The longer the disruptions drag on, the harder it will be to avert significant damage to employment,” it added. As it is, the big players are hurting. Lao Xiang Ji, which has some 800 outlets, estimates it suffered at least 500 million yuan in losses, said chairman Shu Cong Xuan in a video on the company’s WeChat account. Another major chain, Xibei Noodle Village, said on social media that it “cannot last for long” with tight cash flow. AFP "

,"February 24, 2020",nCov,Poliovirus in Cebu,Marit Stinus-Cabugon,"MARIT STINUS-CABUGON RECENTLY, it was found that there is circulating in the Butuanon River in Mandaue City the vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2. This shouldn’t come as a surprise to anyone considering that the river has been a dump for both industrial and household wastes for decades. Nevertheless, the presence of poliovirus has got everyone worried. Mandaue City Mayor Jonas Cortes immediately declared Butuanon River and two other waterways that traverse the city off-limits. Families and individuals who are living along Butuanon will be relocated. The City Health Office has sent stool samples to the Department of Health (DoH) in order to locate the source of the poliovirus. Both Cebu City and Mandaue City are planning vaccination drives. This, of course, must be done in coordination with the DoH considering that the only existing stockpile of the needed vaccine — the monovalent oral polio vaccine type 2 (OPV2) — is kept by the United Nations Children’s Fund (Unicef), only to be released upon instruction from the World Health Organization (WHO) director general. The type 2 component of OPV was removed from routine immunization worldwide in 2016. Despite being the richest province in the country and home to the Philippines’ most modern international airport and numerous industries and big commercial establishments, Cebu has very low polio immunization rates. The Provincial Health Office reported that for 2019, 56 percent and 50 percent of the target was met for OPV (type 1 and 3) and inactivated polio vaccine (IPV), respectively. In Mandaue City, about three in four children received all three doses of OPV, while for IPV the figure is only a little over 50 percent (Sun Star Cebu). Unicef and WHO have constantly been reminding us that the reasons that “the risk of further polio transmission continues to be assessed as high” in the Philippines, are: chronically below-target immunization coverage; deficient performance of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) surveillance; and poor sanitation and hygiene conditions (Unicef-WHO Philippines Polio Outbreak Situation Report 16, Feb. 19, 2020). The Health department is helping with the AFP surveillance. As for sanitation and hygiene, Cebu’s local government units (LGUs) haven’t mentioned plans to address the fact that thousands of households, even in Metro Cebu, do not have sanitary toilets and adequate supply of water. The Metro Cebu Water District (MCWD) has asked the DoH’s Research Institute for Tropical Medicine to test the water in production wells near the Butuanon River to make sure it isn’t contaminated. But this does not address the larger issue of water supply. The MCWD recently got a new chairman and directors after Cebu City Mayor Edgar Labella sacked the board appointed by his predecessor. If the novel coronavirus outbreak hasn’t taught us that hygiene is the critical factor in preventing the spread of infectious diseases, then the presence of poliovirus in our own community should. With a fresh mandate, the MCWD must now show that it was the old board that stood in the way of expanding and improving water supply services. Even if the new board decides to privatize the water district (as what it intends to do, according to rumor), the local government is ultimately responsible for the welfare and health of the public. This responsibility cannot be privatized. The detection of poliovirus in the Butuanon River is a wake-up call. It must compel our LGUs to ensure that all children under five are fully immunized, that all households have sanitary toilets and adequate, affordable water supply, and that garbage is properly stored and collected (a diaper was reportedly found in the river). Such interventions would help improve public health and reduce the risk of contracting infectious diseases for everyone. Of course, children in particular would benefit as they are more at risk. Let us all be reminded that the Philippines ranked 110th out of 180 countries in the “Child Flourishing Index” in a report commissioned by WHO, Unicef and The Lancet medical journal and released last week. The term “flourishing” covers “surviving” and “thriving.” The Philippines’ flourishing score of 0.56 (surviving, 0.55 and thriving, 0.58) on a scale from 0 to 1 with 1 the optimal score, signals that there is much room for improvement. Cebu’s tourism sector and electronics and semiconductor industry are among the most affected by the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak. About 40 percent of materials used in the industry come from China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, according to the Semiconductor and Electronics Industries in the Philippines Foundation Inc. (Sun Star Cebu, Feb. 17, 2020). The industry accounts for almost 60 percent of Philippine exports. The discovery of poliovirus in Cebu may have come at the most challenging of times. The best solution is to strengthen our defense against diseases outbreaks by improving hygiene and sanitation and disease monitoring, and making sure that all children are fully immunized. The DoH with WHO, Unicef, LGUs and nongovernment organizations have vaccinated millions of children in Mindanao and Luzon since the polio outbreak was declared last September 2019. Indeed, we can rise to the challenge. "

The health of Masako, who was fit enough to attend all of Naruhito’s ceremonies when he was sworn in as emperor last year, is a major talking point in Japan. Hopes were raised that she had recovered from her illness as she was present at a series of public events last year but Naruhito warned the empress was “still on the path to recovery”. HAPPY TIME File photo of Japan’s Emperor Naruhito and Empress Masako posing at their residence in Tokyo, Japan ahead of the Emperor’s 60th birthday. AFP PHOTO “Her condition has its ups and downs and her fatigue tends to be prolonged after a big event or when events take place one after another,” he told reporters at a news conference to mark his 60th birthday. “I want her never to extend herself too much but continue to work on what she can do,” he said, describing her as “a good consultant on both private and official matters”. The Harvard-and Oxford-educated Masako left behind a promising diplomatic career to marry into the royal family in 1993. In 2004, the palace disclosed she had been undergoing treatment for stress-induced adjustment disorder, which has forced her to skip some royal engagements. The couple’s only child Aiko, 18, will study Japanese literature starting in April at Gakushuin University, of which Naruhito is an alumnus. She cannot succeed her father because tradition dictates that only a male heir can ascend the Chrysanthemum Throne. Naruhito’s younger brother Akishino is first in line to the throne. His son, 13-year-old Hisahito, is second. Aiko would lose her royal status once she marries a commoner. That has raised the prospect of a succession crisis if Hisahito does not have a son but the emperor refrained from commenting on the male-only rule. He said he talks about the issue with Akishino but went no further than that.

,"February 23, 2020",nCov,The low-key carnage of niche PH tech jobs,Marlen V. Ronquillo,"MARLEN V. RONQUILLO Financial services giant Wells Fargo, for one reason or another, broke the pattern of silence on the technology employment front. Employers of Filipino tech workers — whether these are technology companies, multinational banks and financial institutions or other service-oriented entities with global operations — usually cut jobs, announce so-called job “redundancies” and “retirements” under an atmosphere of silence. Wells Fargo’s outlier move was to announce the mass layoff of its 700 Filipino tech workers, with a promise to pay them until the end of the year, probably to give them time to move into transition jobs. Wells Fargo was both frank and straightforward. Through a spokesman, it said that all of the 700 Filipino technology jobs would be axed by the end of the year. All. Of course, there is nothing new to Well Fargo’s mass layoff of its Filipino tech workers other than the decision to speak publicly about it and offer them full pay up to the end of the year. The cutting of niche technology jobs has been going on for quite some time.
Niche tech jobs in the country, especially the tech jobs that were categorized as “Regional Operating Headquarters” (ROHQ) tech jobs before the passage of the Tax Reform for Acceleration and Inclusion (Train) Act, are being moved into other global sites without much ado and much fanfare — the ironic offshoring of the jobs previously offshored to Manila. These are mostly jobs in programming, automation and network engineering, the jobs that were called ROHQ jobs before the Train Law. They were called such because the jobs were held by tech workers with special, hard-to-find skills, and the regional headquarters of the global tech firms in the Philippines had been allowed by the Bureau of Internal Revenue, before the passage of the Train Law, to give these highly skilled workers a tax rate of 15 percent.   The Train Law upped the rate to 25 percent.  The minimum yearly salary of the ROHQ tech workers was P900,000 a year. What is going on and why?  Since we are not hearing anything from the Labor and Employment people, here is a brief backgrounder. The reasons behind the mass layoff of Filipino tech workers were eminently captured in the Wells Fargo statement on the mass dismissal. Some jobs will be moved to India. Some jobs will have to be consolidated in specific sites in the United States. Small, inefficient sites will be closed down and the American workers in these small sites will have to move into the major sites. Or…. The “or” simply means that if you do not relocate to the major sites, you will lose you job. The offshoring of the offshored jobs from Manila to India is, however, the most dominant reason for the loss of niche Filipino tech jobs. US-based technology companies, which offshored jobs to the Philippines in search of efficiency and lower operating costs two decades ago, are the ones doing the most of the relocation of tech jobs to India.
The main driver of the relocation is cost. A highly skilled Filipino tech worker in automation, high-level programming and network engineering earns an average of P100,000 a month. The entry-level salary for India-based jobs of the same critical category is around P12,000 to P15,000 a month. It is usually an American of Indian descent who is high up in the hierarchy of US-based technology companies that announces the lay-off of the Philippine jobs. And the main pitch to the Filipino tech worker about to get the ax is this:  Sorry, we can hire 10 India-based workers at that salary level. Most of the time, there is a little ruse involved. Before his or her dismissal, the highly skilled Filipino tech worker is asked to train batches of India-based on his or her job expertise. The training of the India-based workers normally takes a few months or a few weeks. For network engineering work, the highly skilled Filipino worker is sent to the many technology enclaves in India for the on-site training work, which normally takes a few weeks or a few months. A month or so after his or her return home, he will be given the sad news of his dismissal.
The laid-off tech workers take things in stride, grounded as they are on the realities of job offshoring and the vagaries of globalization. They neither sue nor invoke Philippine labor laws to get compensation. The mass layoff was not a public thing until the Wells Fargo statement on the layoff of all its 700 Philippine-based tech jobs. Are the Philippine government officials even aware of what is going on the tech front?  In an ideal world, they should be concerned. The Philippine economy runs on two engines, two acronyms, really: OFWs and BPOs — overseas Filipino workers and business process outsourcing. Issues affecting the BPO front should be at the front, back and center of Philippine policy. Knowing the realities of our underwhelming polity, the laid-off tech workers are not expecting anything from government. What with the Philippine leadership consumed with these priorities: – Scrapping a television franchise – Terminating the Visiting Forces Agreement – Pandering to Philippine offshore gaming operators or POGOs (Exhibit A is the “pastillas” scam and the tax evasion which the government seems not to mind) and other Chinese interests – Cluelessly dealing with a serious coronavirus outbreak – Playing the flute as the African swine fever or ASF wipes out hog-producing centers across the country. And one other thing. Seriously considering a military pivot to Putin and his thugs.
Wow. What a country. "
,"February 23, 2020",nCov,‘Window to stop virus shrinking’,Agence France-Presse,"Cases surge in ME; Italian town on lockdown BEIJING: Fears mounted on Saturday over the rise of new cases and fatalities outside China from the new coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) outbreak as the World Health Organization (WHO) warned of a shrinking window to stem the spread of the deadly disease. The warning came as the first European died from the new Covid-19 strain, which first emerged in December in central China but has now spread to over 25 countries and caused more than a dozen deaths outside the country. WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned that the “window of opportunity” to contain the international spread of the outbreak was “narrowing” as cases surged across the Middle East and in South Korea. He warned that if countries did not quickly mobilize to fight the spread of the virus, “this outbreak could go in any direction. It could even be messy.” Cases of the deadly virus were reported in a range of countries in the Middle East on Friday (Saturday in Manila) with the first cases in Israel and Lebanon. Iran said four people there had died and 18 had been infected from the outbreak. Iraq and Kuwait, which share borders with Iran, were on high alert for a potential outbreak after banning travel to and from the Islamic republic, although they have not confirmed any cases domestically. A 78-year-old Italian man died after testing positive for the virus, and a number of cases reported across the Middle East, including the first infections in Israel and Lebanon. A second person died in South Korea, authorities reported Saturday, as the number of cases in the country spiked. Italy has locked down 10 towns and asked over 50,000 people to stay home — a move with echoes of China’s lockdown of entire cities in Hubei province at the center of the outbreak. Lockdown Streets were deserted and residents warned to keep out of an emergency room on Saturday in an Italian town placed under lockdown as a second death from coronavirus sparked fears throughout the region. “No entry” read the sign on the emergency room in the small town of Codogno with a population of 15,000 where three people have already tested positive for the virus, including one 38-year-old man now on life support. On Saturday, Italian news agency ANSA reported a second death from the virus in the Lombardy region, where Codogno is located. It came one day after the death of a 78-year-old retired bricklayer from the Padua area in the nearby Veneto region, the first local person in Europe to die from the coronavirus. ANSA reported that the new victim was a woman. No further information was immediately available. Italy’s health minister said that the man who died on Friday, Adriano Trevisan, had been admitted to hospital 10 days earlier for an unrelated health issue. He was one of two people in the Veneto region with the virus, where another confirmed case overnight in a 53-year-old man brought that number to three, president of the Veneto region, Luca Zaia told Rai24 news. In Lombardy, 16 other people were discovered to have caught the virus and the region took immediate measures to isolate affected areas. In Rome, three people are being treated in isolation for the virus. Hotspots In China, the number of cases outside Hubei, where millions remain under quarantine, has been generally declining, although new hotspots were found in several prisons and hospitals Friday. But just 31 new cases were reported outside the central province Saturday, as the national number of cases rose past 76,000. The outbreak has now claimed 2,345 lives in China. Concerns have also risen about the reliability of the official data, however, after Hubei officials changed methods of counting cases and amended their figures again. The United States advised citizens to avoid traveling by cruise liner in Asia because it said the vessels acted as amplifiers of the virus. Several Australians and an Israeli evacuated earlier this week from the stricken Diamond Princess cruise ship tested positive for coronavirus on returning to their home countries.
They were previously cleared in Japan. ‘Critical moment’ Nearly 400 new cases were reported nationwide in China on Saturday, less than half the number of new cases the previous day. The drop in new cases of the novel coronavirus came as officials in Hubei province were ordered to revise figures to clear “doubt” around the data. Officials retroactively revised upwards previously reported data for two days in the last week — the latest in a string of amendments to the figures officially reported at the epicenter. Several changes in Hubei’s counting method have further complicated efforts to track the spread of the illness. China has said the slowing cases are evidence that its drastic containment measures are working — but fresh infections emerged at two Beijing hospitals, and more than 500 others were reported in prisons across the country. In a letter to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation thanking the organization for its financial support, Chinese President Xi Jinping said China was at a “critical moment” in the fight against the outbreak. Xi said the “unprecedented measures” were “delivering substantial results.” "

The meeting comes amid growing alarm over the coronavirus as Chinese authorities lock down millions of people to prevent the spread of the disease, with major knock-on effects for the global economy. The impact of the epidemic may be short-lived, but it comes as the global economy remains “fragile,” International Monetary Fund (IMF) Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva told a gathering in Riyadh on Friday. Georgieva said the economic impact could see a “V-shaped” trajectory, with a sharp decline in China’s gross domestic product followed by a sharp recovery. She warned the situation could have more dire consequences for other countries as the impacts spill over. The virus has now claimed 2,345 lives in China, cutting off transportation and forcing businesses to close their doors. China has said it will not be sending any leaders from Beijing for the Riyadh gathering, but the Chinese ambassador in the kingdom will instead lead a small delegation. “We have been closely watching the developments of the virus and assessing its potential effects on economic growth,” a senior US Treasury official told reporters. “We expect ministers and governors will discuss the global economic outlook, particularly as it relates to the coronavirus outbreak.” The G20 organizers will also host a ministerial-level symposium on international taxation on Saturday, focused on the challenges arising from the digitalization of the global economy. The symposium will be attended by US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, along with a host of other financial leaders. The Saudi presidency will see it host world leaders for a summit in Riyadh from November 21 to 22. It will hold more than 100 events and conferences in the run-up to the summit, including ministerial meetings, organizers say.

Some 120 million parcels have been collected by deliverymen as of Tuesday, while about 80 million were delivered, data from the bureau showed. The country’s major courier firms began to resume services from February 7 after an extended Spring Festival holiday due to the novel coronavirus outbreak. The bureau asked courier firms to ensure safe and efficient services, especially those involving the delivery of epidemic-relief supplies and daily necessities. Delivery service is in high demand during the epidemic as many residents prefer making online orders and getting food and other products delivered to them. Telecom data showed that the courier sector is one of the earliest industries to resume operation. Many courier firms are encouraging “non-contact delivery” to reduce contagion risks, with the deliverymen putting orders in a self-collection container or a pre-determined place. "
,"February 23, 2020",nCov,DIY virus protection: Hong Kongers making own masks amid shortages,Agence France-Presse,"HONG KONG: With chronic face mask shortages in the midst of a virus outbreak, Hong Kongers have started making their own — with a pop-up production line and seamstresses churning them out on sewing machines. In one of the most densely populated cities on earth, face masks have become hot property as people scramble for protection against the new deadly coronavirus. Long queues — sometimes thousands strong — routinely crop up outside pharmacies when supplies are in, and there is anger at the government’s failure to have stockpiled. Some are turning to DIY solutions — albeit of questionable quality. Judy, a 73-year-old out shopping in the district of Wanchai, was spotted in a homemade mask. “I found the material — my handkerchief, and some non-woven fabric — and I combined them and used some wire for the top, and some elastic,” she told Agence France-Presse, declining to give her surname. While Hong Kong’s economy reels, business has been brisk on one street in the working-class Sham Shui Po district that boasts many fabric and tailoring shops. A colorful array of cloth masks hangs outside many of the cramped storefronts as shoppers haggle over the din of whirring sewing machines. Elase Wong, a tailor, said she was giving away her face mask sewing design. “Some people couldn’t buy any masks… So if they can make them themselves, that would be great,” she told Agence France-Presse. “I hope everyone can achieve self-sufficiency.” Pop-up assembly line The cost of masks has skyrocketed with scarcity and the government resisting price controls or rationing, as in nearby Macau and Taiwan. A set of 50 simple surgical masks can sell for up to HK$300 ($40), while the top of the range N95 variety is going for as high as HK$1,800 a box. A film director surnamed Tong was this week putting the finishing touches to a face mask assembly line in an industrial building. “I was shocked by the price of face masks,” he told Agence France-Presse. “I did some research and realized that masks are not that difficult to make. Why do people have to bear such a high cost? Because there is no production line in Hong Kong.” With the help of an investor he managed to import a machine from India, and plans to ship more. Currently in the testing phase, the device will produce 60-80 surgical masks per minute from Saturday in a dust-free room. Tong said the masks will be sold online for HK$1-2 each, limited to one box per person. The administration of chief executive Carrie Lam says it is doing all it can to secure new supplies of face masks amid a global shortage. Output has been ramped up on a prison labour production line and there are plans to set aside HK$1.5 billion to support the creation of domestic factories. The lack of stockpiles has sparked criticism of Lam, even from among her pro-Beijing political allies. Many have expressed surprise that a city which suffered 299 deaths during the 2003 SARS outbreak was not better prepared. Since SARS, which Beijing initially covered up, Hong Kongers have embraced higher communal hygiene standards and face masks have long been a common sight, especially during the winter flu season. Joseph Kwan, a public health expert from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, said widespread mask use during SARS also lowered cases of the common cold that year. In a tightly packed city like Hong Kong, new viruses will “spread like wildfire if nobody wears a mask”, he said. “It would be a public health disaster.” "
,"February 23, 2020",nCov,Covid-19 exposes fragility of tourism-based economy,Ben Kritz,"IT comes as no surprise that the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) epidemic has a chilling effect on the global travel and tourism sector, but despite some surprisingly forthright assessments by government authorities who are usually unreasonably optimistic about any sort of bad news, the general public may not appreciate just how bad the situation is. Southeast Asia has been particularly hard-hit, primarily due to the loss of Chinese visitors. Last week, Thailand reported it expected tourist arrivals to decline by 5 million this year, erasing 250 billion baht (about $8 billion) in potential revenue. Tourist arrivals from China, usually about 1 million a month, dropped by 90 percent this month. Elsewhere across the region, other countries are reporting their tourism business is down by 30 to 50 percent. Here in the Philippines, estimates of actual and potential losses vary, but none of them are very encouraging. The National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) said last week the country could lose P22.7 billion a month from tourism alone if the epidemic persists. The Department of Tourism was a bit more optimistic, predicting that revenue losses for the February-to-April period would be about P42.9 billion, or about P14 billion a month. Airline ticket refunds alone will account for about P3 billion of that in February and March, according to the Air Carriers Association of the Philippines. Every disease epidemic in the recent past — severe acute respiratory syndrome, Middle East respiratory syndrome, bird flu, swine flu — had a significant damping effect on the tourism industry, but Covid-19 has been far more damaging due to an unfortunate confluence of circumstances. First, the virus outbreak became serious just as the Lunar New Year travel season began. The scale of human movement during China’s biggest holiday is mind-boggling. Without the virus, the Chinese would have taken 3 billion trips in about a month’s time; the combination of the Chinese government’s own restrictions on travel and travel bans imposed by other countries cut that volume by 80 to 90 percent by some estimates. Second, the epidemic had a negative impact on travel by people from other countries, because it seemed to single out tourists. For weeks, the top stories about the epidemic were those about foreigners trapped in quarantined cities in China, or the several cruise ships in the region that were left stranded due to being quarantined at sea — for good reason, in most cases, as cruise ships have turned out to be fairly effective disease incubators. The impression that travel was particularly risky might not be quite accurate, but it was nevertheless the impression the public was given, and has aggravated the tourism slump. Third, even at a time when the absence of Chinese tourists and the relatively minor actual impact of Covid-19 on other countries made conditions ideal to boost domestic tourism and events to mitigate the losses from vanishing foreign tourism, unreasonable fear of the infection from governments and the public alike caused events to be canceled and kept people at home. This very likely has caused an additional downturn in sectors that straddle tourism and the rest of the domestic economy, such as retail, restaurants and entertainment. Economic soothsayers have offered quantified predictions of the epidemic’s impact on the broader economy, forecasts that ought to be taken with a grain of salt, but do at least all consistently point in the same direction. Last week, S&P Global Ratings and Moody’s Investors Service both cut their 2020 GDP growth forecasts for the Philippines to 6.1 percent. NEDA, meanwhile, has forecast that the impact of Covid-19 would cut between 0.3 and 0.7 percent from GDP this year. There are few, if any, economic sectors that are completely impervious to the effects of a black swan like the Covid-19 epidemic. By the same token, there is no sector that is as completely exposed to virtually every black swan as tourism. And as history shows, tourism is the sector that is typically the least likely to have an effective continuity plan. That is not necessarily a knock against tourism authorities here, but rather the apparent nature of the business, because countries perceived as being a whole lot smarter and better equipped have not performed significantly better. The only logical response, which no tourism authority or booster wants to hear, is to redirect the effort put toward promoting tourism and integrating it into the broader economy into developing other parts of the economy instead. On a policy level, tourism should be considered an added rather than a core value to the economy, especially in a country like the Philippines, where rich resources and a reasonably stable economic foundation offer options that less evolved and more poorly endowed countries like Cambodia or Laos do not have. ben.kritz@manilatimes.net

The Archdiocese of Pampanga, however, urged priests to just put water on the feet of the faithful instead of touching and kissing these during the Mass on Maundy Thursday. The Archdiocese of Manila, meanwhile, reminded the faithful of the true meaning of the 40-day Lenten season that starts on February 26. On Thursday, the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of the Philippines (CBCP) issued additional liturgical guidelines on the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). As a precautionary measure, it recommended the sprinkling of a small portion of blessed ash on the crown of the head of the faithful instead of marking the forehead with a cross. The CBCP also said that instead of kissing or touching the Cross for veneration, the faithful could just genuflect or make a profound bow. Meanwhile, the Diocese of Caloocan asked the faithful to wear face masks during the “Kumpisalang Bayan” (mass confession). “During confessions, whether inside the confessional box or outside, both priests and penitents are advised to wear protective masks. Ideally, the penitent brings his/her own mask. Parishes should be ready to provide for those unable to bring their own,” the diocese said in a statement. It added that penitents are also allowed to confess their sins by writing them down on a sheet of paper and handing them personally to the priest after saying the introduction, “Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.” “After ‘reading’ their confession, the minister may ask the penitents some questions thereafter, give some admonition, recommend acts of penance and give absolution verbally.

As a professional, I would describe the current situation in the financial markets as uncertain, though investors have so far let their positive conviction dominate, particularly in the stock markets. The sell-off in Chinese stocks around the Chinese New Year has largely recovered again, so currently in the stock markets, the major reactions are limited to single stocks or sectors, like when Apple Inc. last February 18 warned about current supply chain constrains. But other parts of the financial markets have actually moved more, and I expect a general increased risk for the rising nervousness among investors if the Chinese situation doesn’t improve soon. The currency pair euro against the dollar has moved lower, especially in the past two weeks, thereby reaching the lowest level in three-and-a-half years. It leads to the question of whether the euro is getting weaker, or if the greenback is getting stronger? I see the true answer in two-fold, as there is a growing risk that European countries like Germany could be hurt the most by the virus outbreak in China. The very steep drop in the German ZEW index from 26.7 to 8.7, which was way below expectations, reflects the worry among German investors, and potentially corporations (released February 18). It’s not a big surprise if the euro suffers from this kind of nervousness, but I also assess that there has been a certain degree of flight toward the dollar. The capital/investor flight toward the dollar does not necessarily represent a strong flight to quality, but could just as much mean a flight to liquidity. Investors have not reduced risk significantly, but various other segments including corporations, have increased their cash position to be able to maneuver under unknown conditions such as buying goods from new suppliers, which might require a cash down payment, as an example. A natural parking slot for an increased cash position is the US dollar and treasury bonds. Other important areas in the financial markets have also moved. Oil has dropped 15 percent just within one-and-a-half months, and China could be the biggest explanation. China is simply big numbers, where the real drop in oil demand might be as high as 3 million barrels per day. Though the underlying demand drop is counterweighted by some Chinese refiners that increased their stock of crude oil as they, after all, consider the oil price as cheap. There are also some indications that the official China uses are the lower prices to build strategic oil reserves, like how the American government has strategic oil reserves. All in all, a lot of unusual and contradictory forces influence the assessment of the financial markets right now, which might be an explanation why the markets so far remain pretty calm. One of the biggest effects I expect is that the upwards trend in inflation, which several large Western economies have explored since October, will reverse for a while. The energy prices are of course, not the sole component in the inflation number, though together with the pressure on other commodity prices and lower activity here and there, the inflation rate should turn lower. This takes some heat away from the large Eurozone and American central banks, as they have been cutting interest rates in an environment with rising inflation. I doubt whether the central banks would go as far as lowering the interest rates again as a reaction on the macroeconomic risks due to Covid-19. Though the bond investors share the expected lower inflation outlook, which is visible in, for example, the US 10-year treasury yield that now is trading very close to 1.50 percent again. The current downward trend in the yield partly reflects the expected drop in inflation, but also because the before-mentioned capital flows into the US has partly been invested in bonds. I don’t regard the lower treasury yields as a predictor for increased concern about an upcoming economic crisis in the US nor the global economy. So far, the biggest macroeconomic effect of the virus outbreak in China is the downward pressure on inflation. Though if China (apart from Hubei province) doesn’t get back to normal very soon, then the nervousness will spread across the global financial markets.

,"February 22, 2020",nCov,‘Asia-Pacific airlines could lose $27.8B to China virus’,Agence France-Presse,"PARIS: Airlines operating in the Asia-Pacific stand to lose a combined $27.8 billion in revenue this year due to the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) crisis, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA). The estimate is based on projections of a 13-percent full-year decline in passenger demand, mostly in China, the trade body said in a statement on Thursday. “This will be a very tough year for airlines,” IATA Chief Executive Officer Alexandre de Juniac said. “Stopping the spread of the virus is the top priority.” IATA said its estimate assumed that Covid-19 behaved like the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak nearly two decades ago, which was “characterized by a six-month period with a sharp decline, followed by an equally quick recovery.” This will be the first time since the 2008-2009 financial crisis that demand for air travel has declined, de Juniac said. Airlines in China’s domestic market alone are estimated to lose around $12.8 billion in revenues. Carriers outside the Asia-Pacific are seen to suffer $1.5 billion in losses. This brings worldwide airline revenue lost to the virus to a projected $29.3 billion, IATA said. However, if the virus spreads more widely to Asia-Pacific markets, then the impact on airlines from other regions would be larger, the body warned. IATA previously estimated Asia-Pacific airlines to register a growth of 4.8 percent this year, but they are now on course instead for a contraction of 8.2 percent. But there are some factors potentially softening the blow, according to the organization. “Governments will use fiscal and monetary policy to try to offset the adverse economic impacts. Some relief may be seen in lower fuel prices for some airlines, depending on how fuel costs have been hedged,” it said. It was therefore difficult to predict by how much exactly lost revenue would weigh on profits. But airlines are already taking “difficult decisions” to cut capacity, or even routes, IATA said. "

Health Assistant Secretary Maria Rosario Vergeire gives a briefing on the coronavirus disease 2019. PHOTO BY JOAN ARELLANO Health Assistant Secretary Maria Rosario Vergeire in a press briefing in Manila said there are about 480 Filipinos aboard the ship. The Diamond Princess, which is docked in a Japan port, has the most number of infected people outside China with 634 confirmed cases. Among 3,200 people aboard the ship are 558 Filipinos, mostly crewmembers. The Filipinos with symptoms of the coronavirus disease 2019 or Covid-19 will not be included in the repatriation. The repatriates will be quarantined at the New Clark City in Capas, Tarlac. “[The] Bases Conversion Development Authority has graciously agreed to once again lend their facilities for the quarantine. They will allow us to use other buildings in the [New Clark City] to accommodate the number of repatriates and have committed to augment the number of personnel who will support operations,” said Vergeire. The protocols for bringing home Filipinos from Wuhan City in China will be applied to Filipinos from the Diamond Princess; meaning, they have to be isolated for 14 days upon arrival. There are 16 hospitals that will serve any repatriates with symptoms of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like disease. The DoH will shoulder the costs of the medical needs and hospitalization expenses as well as their transportation. The Department of Transportation will pay for the transportation of the Filipinos from Haribon Airport to New Clark City. The Overseas Workers Welfare Administration will also provide livelihood packages to the repatriated Filipinos after the quarantine period as well as their transportation expenses upon returning to their respective destination. Last Wednesday, Foreign Affairs Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr. met with Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi in Vientiane, Laos on the eve of the Special Asean-China Foreign Ministers Meeting on responding to the Covid-19 epidemic. Locsin extended the Philippines’ sympathies to the Chinese people, especially to those in Wuhan in Hubei Province. He conveyed the government’s appreciation for the assistance and facilitation of the Chinese government in the repatriation of Filipinos from Hubei on February 8. Wang also expressed appreciation to the Philippines, as the country coordinator for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean)-China relations, for facilitating the foreign ministers’ meeting. A similar meeting was held in 2003 during the outbreak of SARS, which recorded a global death toll of 774. Still on the Covid-19 outbreak, the Department of Education (DepEd) on Friday said it was monitoring three students as patients under investigation. One of them, a Grade 7 student from Lasam, Cagayan, is on home quarantine.
The other two are elementary students, DepEd said. Results of tests on the three on February 17 turned out negative,” the Education department said, noting that their exposure was from their mothers who arrived from Macau in China. DepEd also bared that two students in from Cebu province with upper respiratory tract infection were being “closely monitored” by rural health units since February 12. The two were exposed to their fathers, who had traveled recently to a coronavirus-affected area. WITH JAVIER JOE ISMAEL AND JAN ARCILLA "

,"February 22, 2020",nCov,Lest we think our female leaders incapable of gravitas,Yen Makabenta,"YEN MAKABENTA First world
I decided to write this column because my wife (better half, significant other, etc.) knocked me on the head when I wondered aloud: Why do our female public officials evince the opposite of gravitas? Why do they wind up trivializing public office, instead of ennobling it? Is there a gender limitation? I raised the issue because there is currently on display two egregious examples of female leadership missing the mark. First, there is Tourism Secretary Bernadette Romulo Puyat who, in the middle of the coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic, found it opportune to proclaim to the world that travel is still “more fun and safe” in the Philippines. She issued the assurance after the Department of Health recommended the cancellation of big events and other mass gatherings in the country in order to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Second, there is Sen. Mary Grace Poe, who has co-opted “mass media and communications” as part of the sphere of her Senate Committee on Public Services, as she maneuvered to lead a Senate inquiry into the controversy concerning the renewal of the broadcasting franchise of ABS-CBN Corp. It is not lost on the public that Senator Poe exceeds other senators in frequently calling for Senate inquiries and that ABS-CBN, through its ANC channel, invariably broadcasts these hearings live, giving Ms. Poe premium TV exposure. The ladies bill their actions as being “in the public interest.” More accurately, however, they fall into the tradition of lackluster performance by women in our public service and public life, a tradition graced by such notables as former president Corazon Aquino, former chief justice Maria Lourdes Sereno, Vice President Maria Leonor Robredo and Sen. Leila de Lima. Without delving into the shortcoming of each one, I want to discuss here the concept and quality of gravitas, which is the attribute that all leaders and statesmen aspire to possess or project the most. Gravitas as substance and depth
Gravitas was one of the Roman virtues, along with pietas, severitas (gravity and self-control), or disciplina, dignitas and virtus, that were particularly appreciated in leaders. It may be translated variously as weight, seriousness, dignity and importance, and connotes a certain substance or depth of personality. It also conveys a sense of responsibility and commitment to the task. Gravitas was one of the virtues that allowed citizens, particularly statesmen, to embody the concept of romanitas, which denotes what it meant to be Roman and how Romans regarded themselves, eventually evolving into a national character. Many Roman philosophers praised constantia (perseverance, endurance and courage), dignitas and gravitas as the most important virtues. This is because it made dignified men capable. These are additional concepts that accompany Roman actions. The men of the ruling upper and upper-middle classes were educated in a public school system, where classical language and literature formed basic elements of the curriculum, particularly exuding gravitas, or the dignified and serious conduct allowed Romans to maintain a persistent element of conservatism and traditionalism. According to the Roman emperor and philosopher Marcus Aurelius, the cultivation of gravitas involves acting with sincerity and dignity and this is said to be achieved by being temperate in manner and speech as well as by carrying oneself with authority. There is no account of how old Roman statesmen, realizing that they could no longer meet the standards of romanitas to perform their public function with dignity and gravitas, committed suicide or simply refused take food. This is how the Romans defined themselves and their honor. In Greece, Aristotle identified three essentials of persuasive communication — a big component of personal presence: – Logical argument — the ability to articulate your points clearly – Emotion — the ability to create or control emotion in your listeners – Character — the ability to convey integrity and goodwill. In the British education system, gravitas was seen as one of the pillars of the moral formation of the English gentleman during the Victorian and Edwardian eras. It is partly derived from the notion of aristocratic pedigree, indicating polish, grace in manner, as well as dignity in outward appearance. Mystery and power of gravitas
Not surprisingly, gravitas is most often discussed in relation to male leaders and statesmen. In an illuminating essay in his book, Second Draft of History (Basic Books, New York, 2006), Lance Morrow discusses at length and in depth the mystery and power of gravitas. He credits gravitas to both men and women. He simply leaves to the historical record which gender has shown it the most. To Morrow, gravitas is principally deep moral seriousness, which in turn conveys weight and size in the person. He wrote: “Gravitas is a secret of character, and grasp and experience, a force in the eye, the voice, the bearing. “Sometimes, as with say, Winston Churchill, it announces itself as eloquence, and sometimes it proclaims itself as a silence, a suspension full of either menace or Zen. The Japanese believe a man’s gravitas emanates from densities of the unspoken. “Gravitas is a phenomenon of power, but the forms and styles of power are various. Dictators are ever strutting the tinhorn’s impersonation of gravitas. “Martin Luther King brought his gravitas to bear against men of power who were morally vacant.” Morrow cites men and women in history who possessed gravitas. He contends that a peculiarly powerful form of gravitas may arise out of suffering; it draws its authority from the redemptive example of Christ and also from Greek tragedy: the terrible moral power of woe. Mother Teresa, says Morrow, has this gravitas of the redemptive. Whole cultures may be judged weighty or weightless by the calibration of suffering. Russian history seems like an entire universe of gravitas. Mikhail Gorbachev is a figure of gravitas among world leaders; he achieved his effect by opening and airing out the communist system. The earlier generation of Soviet leaders (Leonid Brezhnev, for example) sat upon the world’s stage like dark boulders. Morrow concludes: “Weight is not enough. Gravitas is weight with complexities of life and intelligence in it.” He goes on: Pope John Paul 2nd has gravitas; Jimmy Carter does not. Ronald Reagan possessed a gravitas of authenticity. Margaret Thatcher undoubtedly had gravitas. Barbara Jordan, who impeached Richard Nixon in the United States Congress via powerful oratory, was a figure of gravitas. Franklin Delano Roosevelt attained gravitas as America recovered from the Great Depression to prevail in World War War 2. And then a haberdasher from Missouri took over to the shock of many. But then Harry Truman acquired historical size and force. The man proved he had gravitas and plenty of spunk. Gravitas cannot be faked
Secretary Puyat and Senator Poe will be hard put to show great moral seriousness when one is spreading fun in travel, and the other is posing before the TV cameras. Filipinos should not hesitate to apply the historic measure of gravitas to their leaders because of loyalty, gallantry or deference. We know gravitas when we see it in a leader, whether male or female. Gravitas cannot be faked. yenobserver@gmail.com "
,"February 22, 2020",nCov,South Korea virus cases surging,Associated Press,"SEOUL: South Korea reported more virus cases Friday and declared a “special management zone” around a southeastern city where the surging outbreak, largely linked to a church in Daegu, threatens to overwhelm the region’s health system. In the capital, Seoul, officials banned major downtown rallies and shut down a big park to avoid mass public gatherings where the virus could spread. Workers in protective gear also sprayed disinfectant in the city’s subway. Health authorities reported 52 new cases of the illness, raising South Korea’s total to 156, most of them since Wednesday. The spike, especially in and around Daegu, has raised fears the outbreak is getting out of control in the country. And the first two cases were confirmed in South Korea’s 600,000-member military, a Navy sailor and an Army officer who had both reportedly visited Daegu recently. Prime Minister Chung Se-kyun said in a televised statement the central government would concentrate its support to the southeastern region to ease a shortage in sickbeds, medical personnel and equipment. “A month into the [coronavirus disease 2019] outbreak, we have entered an emergency phase,” Chung said. “Our efforts until now had been focused on blocking the illness from entering the country. But we will now shift the focus on preventing the illness from spreading further in local communities.” The surge of infections in Daegu and several cases in Seoul with unclear infection routes forced government officials to acknowledge Thursday for the first time that the virus was circulating in the local population. Initial cases of the illness in South Korea had been connected to China, where the virus has infected 75,000 people and caused more than 2,200 deaths. South Korea on Thursday reported its first virus-related death, one of 11 outside mainland China. AP "
,"February 22, 2020",nCov,"Covid-19 deaths hit 2,247",Associated Press,"HONG KONG: Hopes for a slowdown in the spread of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) were dashed Friday as the number of new cases rose in China, and outbreaks worsened in Japan and South Korea. Authorities in China’s Hubei province confirmed an additional 411 cases of the virus Thursday, 62 more than the previous day, taking the total number of cases at the epicenter of the outbreak to 62,442. There are an additional 14,000 or so cases outside Hubei, with the majority in other parts of mainland China. The death toll from the outbreak now stands at 2,247, after more deaths in mainland China Thursday, including 115 in Hubei, seven more than the previous day. More than 42,000 patients remain hospitalized across Hubei, including 2,018 in a critical condition. So far, 11,788 patients have been treated and discharged since the outbreak began. Meanwhile, fears are growing of self-sustaining epidemics elsewhere in Asia. Outside China, the largest coronavirus outbreaks have been in South Korea and Japan, where hundreds of people were infected on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which began disembarking passengers this week from Yokohama Bay. The number of cases in South Korea has soared, from 28 a week ago to at least 156 as of Friday morning. The outbreak there is centered around the southern city of Daegu. Among the 52 new cases, 39 are linked to the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, The Temple of the Tabernacle of the Testimony. South Korean authorities Thursday were seeking to question more than 1,000 church members who attended a service with one of the recently confirmed cases. Daegu’s mayor asked the congregation and their family members to self-quarantine at home. Three other new cases connected to Daegu involved members of the military. Medical teams have been dispatched to the city, where they will test people without overseas travel history or relation to other confirmed cases. Until now, tests have only been conducted on cases with recent travel history to China, Hong Kong and Macao, or on people showing suspicious symptoms of the virus after being in contact with confirmed cases. On Friday, the South Korean government designated Daegu and neighboring Cheongdo as “special management areas” for infectious disease. In Japan, where attention has been focused for weeks on the Diamond Princess cruise liner docked at Yokohama, fears are growing of a separate outbreak centered around Nagano, northwest of Tokyo. At least 94 cases have been confirmed in the area, and one death, none of which have any connection to the ship. Cases have also been reported as south as Okinawa and on Kyushu, according Japanese public broadcaster NHK. On Thursday, the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) issued a new travel advisory for Japan, but only at the mildest level, which recommends people “practice usual precautions” and avoid contact with sick people. “At this time, CDC does not recommend canceling or postponing travel to Japan,” the agency said. By comparison, it currently lists mainland China as a level 3 warning and advises travelers to “avoid nonessential travel.” The notice excludes Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan. AP "

Seven guards and 200 inmates tested positive for the virus at Rencheng prison in eastern Shandong province, the Provincial Health Commission said at a press conference. Xie Weijun, head of Shandong’s justice department, was sacked over the outbreak along with two other provincial prison administration officials and five officials from the penitentiary, officials said. Wu Lei, director of Shandong’s prison administration, said the new cases showed that “the implementation of our prevention and control measures has not been effective”. Another 34 cases were found at Shilifeng prison in eastern Zhejiang province, leading to the ouster of its director and another official. Hubei, the hard-hit central province where the virus emerged late last year, said Friday 271 cases were reported by its prisons on Thursday, including 220 that had previously not been known to provincial authorities. Hubei announced earlier on Friday that a total of 411 new cases of the virus were confirmed in the province on Thursday, but later revised its figure up to 631 to include the prison numbers. The clusters came as Chinese authorities have pointed to a drop in officially reported new cases this week as evidence that quarantines and other drastic measures to contain the virus are working. Most of China remains paralyzed over fears of contagion, with people slowly trickling back to work, schools remaining closed, and Beijing ordering returnees to self-quarantine for 14 days. New cases at two hospitals in the country’s capital have also emerged. AFP "

,"February 22, 2020",nCov,US chemical weapons attack vs China confirmed?,Mauro Gia Samonte,"MAURO GIA SAMONTE MONDAY had been eagerly anticipated. That was the day Chinese Ambassador to the Philippines Huang Xilian would speak on the topic: “The 2019 nCoV — Impact and Challenges” at a forum sponsored by the Association of Philippines-China Understanding (APCU). But as far as I was concerned, it had been wrongly placed. To begin with, I remembered it only from an invitation posted on my Facebook page by the only guy in the world who calls me Comrade, Rene Velasco, and I thought the invite said Sunday evening. Checking again with Rene, I was righted on the date of the event, which fell on that Monday, 9:30 a.m. In a cacophony of events to attend, you tend to confuse details, so a cursory reading of the Rene Velasco invitation to the Ambassador Huang event got me just focused on the name of the venue: Astoria Hotel. But Monday was color-coding for my son Ogie’s sedan, which I regularly use to get to my appointments, so quite early in the day, I had him drive his car to Binangonan where I would switch cars with my granddaughter for me to enter Metro Manila unfettered by the traffic ban. Damn this Waze; it directed us from Binangonan through a maze of routes that ultimately got us parking in front of an edifice on Arnaiz Avenue in Makati, with the proud announcement: “Your destination is to your left.” Indeed, the building signage read: Astoria Hotel. But whaddya know, the doorman, after a quick inquiry with the desk, says, “Sorry, Sir. There is no booking for the ambassador here.” So, I call Rene pronto: “Comrade, where you? Am at Astoria.” “Comrade, am at Astoria,” comes Rene’s answer. “Whaddya mean Astoria? Am here.” “Whaddya mean you’re here? Am here, Astoria Ortigas.” “Sir,” butts in the doorman. “There is another Astoria in Ortigas.” I punched my head, swearing, henceforth let not hotels have branches. They make you miss important events. So, sorry, Mr. Ambassador Huang. There were a lot of things I would have loved to clear up with you. For want of factual data, my commentary on the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) (The Manila Times, February 7 to 8) could only work on a hunch, albeit exceedingly strong, that the current outbreak of the disease is man-made, and more specifically, United States-made. My method in this respect has been proven effective and correct to a large degree: viewing social phenomena in their interrelationships with one another. The virus outbreak comes at a time of the simmering tension between the US and China largely brought about by their conflict over the South China Sea and their contest for domination in the world economy; at a time when the US must admit its inferiority to China in the nuclear arms race, hence clear US incapacity to beat China in this arena; at a time when Trump’s trade war against China has boomeranged, causing a major slump in the US economy; at a time when the Hong Kong turmoil has been exposed as a machination of the US black hand; at a time when the alleged Chinese mass attack on Muslims in Xinjiang province has similarly been uncovered as a US propaganda ploy; at a time when quite a number of social phenomena have crystallized a need for the US to cripple China as a way of deterring US decline as a world power. My method impels me to situate the 2019 nCoV (which has been renamed Covid-19 by the World Health Organization) in this interplay of world social events and situating the virus outbreak thus, I could not but end up not just suspecting but postulating that the epidemic is the US way of weakening China, something it could no longer accomplish through armed hostility. If I could not point a finger at the US in this respect, at least I was pretty sure some others, those who have the luxury of time to do research, could take the cue and pick up the issue from there. It is a very welcome event, therefore, when a reader, calling herself JM Co Manahan, posted on my Facebook account her comment on my article, “China up against a horrible kind of US missile.” In question form, the reader narrated facts otherwise unavailable to me in the immediate sense. It gratifies me no end that her comments have a way of validating my initial insights on the subject. Here are some quotes from JM Co Manahan’s comments: “1. Despite many Caucasians being in Wuhan, why did the virus appear to solely attack the Chinese or those of Chinese descent? “2. Why was the coronavirus outbreak first reported 14 days after 172 US military personnel arrived in Wuhan for the Military World Games on October 18? The incubation period (for the virus to live) is 14 days. How coincidental, isn’t it? “3. Why did Harvard collect DNA samples of Chinese people in China a year ago under a research project? (The implication here is that some ‘special thing’ was being prepared to target only those with the Chinese DNA; the sole known fatality in the Philippines from the Covid-19 attack is a Chinese.) “4. Why and how did a shipment of exceptionally virulent viruses from Canada’s NML biological labs end up in China in March, 2019? “5. Why did the US withdraw or evacuate its embassy workers and staff based in Wuhan immediately after the Military Game ended in October? “6. Reports mentioned an android was used to spray viruses on pigs in Wuhan.” * * * I kept to my quiet corner in the subsequent Kamuning Bakery Café Pandesal Forum (Thursday last), intending just to listen to the sole guest, Sen. Sherwin Gatchalian, when Wilson Lee Flores, the forum moderator, thought I needed to join in the discussion and asked for my comments. So, I threw some of the major questions cited above, which the senator without much ado declared as conspiracy theories, fake news, he said, which should not be given much weight. That got me into pressing one single question, “Among the reported victims of the 2019-nCov, has there been one that is non-Chinese?” I cited one fatality in the Philippines, still that one was a Chinese. Senator Gatchalian cited a case in Singapore and another one in Thailand, but could not ascertain whether those fatalities are Chinese or not. The point I was driving at is, the virus seems to target only Chinese. And the question I would have asked Ambassador Huang at the Astoria affair is, “Why? Why only Chinese? Why not any of the whites who were also in Wuhan at the time of the outbreak?” But then answering the question — and a lot of others raised by reader JM Co Manahan — just would not belong in an occasion meant to foster camaraderie and solidarity among peoples in times of world crisis. Former president Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, APCU chairman emeritus, as reported by Rene, set the tone right when she recognized the worldwide danger posed by the novel coronavirus and lauded China’s prompt action to contain the epidemic. “We strongly support China’s decisive and inclusive efforts to combat the disease. We are confident of and hopeful for the early success of our common resolve and fight against the disease for the good health and well-being of the Chinese and Filipino peoples and humankind,” she said. Similarly from Rene’s report, Ambassador Huang expressed appreciation for Philippine support in these times of China’s need. “I hear many Filipino friends, from ministers to ordinary people, said ‘China go! Wuhan go!’ I was really touched. The Chinese government and the Chinese people will bear this kindness in mind,” he said. He called for calm and balance under the situation, saying, “It is our hope that governments of all countries, including the Philippines, will understand and support China’s efforts, respect the professional advice of the WHO (World Health Organization), avoid overreaction, avoid creating panic, and ensure the normal cooperation and exchanges between countries.” "

While striving to achieve these goals, the group, headed by Vice-Premier Sun Chunlan, has been focusing on containing the spread of the virus in Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, and preventing the epidemic situation in the rest of Hubei from reaching the same level of severity, said Ding Xiangyang, deputy secretary-general of the State Council, China’s Cabinet. “The ferocity of the virus, the scale and magnitude of its spread, and the resulting pressure faced by the whole of society, are unprecedented,” he said at a news conference held by the State Council Information Office in Wuhan. “By sending the work group to Wuhan, the central leadership has sent a message that the city is not an isolated island and is not fighting alone,” he said.

In order to effectively cut the infection sources, the group was directly involved in devising the landmark decisions to put Wuhan under lockdown — suspending transportation and restricting the movement of residents — and extending the Spring Festival holiday by 10 days. “Enforcing quarantine measures is the most cost-effective and efficient way to reduce infection,” he said, adding that despite some misunderstanding and controversies during the initial rollout of these policies, the authorities had resolutely implemented these measures, which have proved effective in stamping out the virus’s spread at its root. Lian Weiliang, deputy head of the National Development and Reform Commission and another member of the central work group, said on Thursday that medical supplies have now been secured overall and supplies of daily necessities are sufficient. He said the authorities in Wuhan are aiming to provide a total of over 70,000 beds to accommodate patients and those under quarantine, including over 30,000 at designated hospitals. The group has also attached great importance to medical treatment, sending a total of 278 national-level medical assistance teams to Hubei province comprising 32,395 health workers, Yu Yanhong, a member of the group and a senior official with the National Health Commission, said on Thursday. In addition, the group is tasked with enhancing oversight over poor implementation of containment measures, launching investigations and urging rectification, added Ding from the State Council. “We have held talks with local government and health authorities in Wuhan to resolve issues such as delays in treatment and unclear statistics,” said Ding, adding that the group has warned officials that they will be held accountable for failures. Outside Hubei, the number of new infections has dropped for 16 consecutive days. In Wuhan, the number of daily new infections has dropped from upward of 4,000 cases in mid-February to less than 2,000 recently, and the explosive growth rate of new infections in the city and Hubei has leveled off, Ding said. “However, the situation remains grim and is subject to change. As we wage an all-out fight against the disease, we must be more determined, steadfast and resolute and fight until the final victory,” he said. Drop in new infections
The National Health Commission reported 394 new confirmed cases on the Chinese mainland on Wednesday, sharply down from 1,749 cases the previous day. Another 1,779 infected patients were discharged from hospitals on Wednesday. “For the second day in a row, the number of discharged patients has exceeded new infections, with the gap widening. This demonstrates the outcome of the country’s rescue efforts and the downward pressure on medical care,” commission spokesman Mi Feng said on Thursday. The death toll rose by 114 on Thursday to 2,118 and the cumulative number of confirmed infections stood at 74,576. That includes 29 foreign citizens who contracted the virus in China, and 18 of whom have recovered and were discharged from hospitals, and two died, according to the central work group. In Hubei, the center of the outbreak, there were 349 new infections on Wednesday, the first time that daily new infections had fallen below 1,000 since late January. The latest diagnostic guideline for novel coronavirus pneumonia removed the category of clinical determination of cases, referring to infections confirmed through symptoms and CT scans rather than nucleic acid testing, according to the commission. “Counting clinically diagnosed cases was implemented as an interim policy aimed at facilitating timely treatment of suspected cases and reducing the mortality rate when the surge in infections in Hubei far outpaced its testing capability,” said Wang Guiqiang, head of the infectious disease department at Peking University First Hospital. Health experts have decided to remove the category and align the counting methods in Hubei with the rest of the country since the region’s testing capability has caught up and the backlog of patients awaiting diagnosis has been cleared. The number of provincial-level regions that reported zero confirmed cases on Wednesday rose to 13 on Wednesday from eight a day earlier. The remaining regions have each added less than 10 cases in one day, according to the National Health Commission. However, Wang Chen, president of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, said that novel coronavirus is likely to turn into a chronic disease and coexist with human beings like flu. “This is entirely possible and we need to be prepared for it by understanding its transmission modes, virology information, and improving therapies and prevention measures,” he said. Comparisons have often been drawn between the novel coronavirus and a closely related pathogen that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome, which claimed over 700 lives worldwide in 2002-03 and was thought to have disappeared, but Wang said SARS transmits fast and kills its human hosts rapidly, thus hindering its ability to reside in people for extended periods.

As of date, the Palace official said there were 497 Filipinos who were to be repatriated to the Philippines. He said the repatriated Filipinos were expected to arrive early next week at the Clark International Airport through two chartered flights from the Haneda Airport. “The IATF warrants that the prospective repatriates should have completed a fourteen (14)-day quarantine period in Japan and have secured clearance certificates from the latter’s Ministry of Health before their embarkation for the said travel,” he said. Upon arrival, Panelo said that “any repatriate who will manifest symptoms of the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) shall be brought immediately to the nearest hospital that may be referred by the Department of Health.” “With respect to asymptomatic repatriates, they shall be securely transported to the Athlete’s Village in New Clark City to again undergo fourteen (14) days of quarantine,” he added. CATHERINE S.

Caraballo, TMT","GEOPOLITICAL tensions and the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-2019) outbreak lead to net outflows of foreign portfolio investments reaching an eight-month high in January, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) said on Thursday.  In a statement, the BSP said last month’s $486.10-million net outflows of these investments, also called “hot money” — so called because of how easily these go in and out of the economy — was higher than the $320.96-million net outflows in December last year. The latest amount, it added, was the largest since the $749.84 million in May and reversed the year-earlier net inflows of $762.82 million. The January outflows resulted from the $1.23-billion inflows and $1.72-billion outflows recorded that month. “Developments for the month included [the] continuing geopolitical tensions between the [United States] and Iran; ongoing trade negotiations between the US and China; renegotiation of the contracts of the country’s water concessionaires; and investor concerns on the spread of the novel coronavirus originating from Wuhan, China,” the BSP said. IHS Markit Asia-Pacific chief economist Rajiv Biswas said January’s portfolio capital outflows likely reflected risk aversion as global investors became increasingly concerned about the economic impact of Covid-19 on China and the rest of Asia. “Investors shifted toward safe haven assets and away from emerging markets equities and currencies, which likely also impacted…the Philippines capital markets,” he added. Biswas noted, however, that “once the Covid-19 epidemic is brought under control, there should be some rebound in Asian asset classes, although there are still considerable uncertainties about when the epidemic will end.” Outflows last month was 20-percent higher than the $1.43 billion registered in December and 32.5-percent higher than the year-ago’s $1.29 billion. The US remained the main destination of the repatriated funds, accounting for 62.1 percent. January inflows, meanwhile, increased by 10.9 percent from December’s $1.43 billion. Year-on-year, it was 40.1 percent lower than $2.06 billion. The bulk, or 65.9 percent, of registered investments were placed in Philippine Stock
Exchange-listed securities, which cover property companies; holding firms; banks; food, beverage and tobacco firms; and telecommunication companies. The rest — 34.1 percent — were put in government securities. Top foreign investors last month are the United Kingdom, the US, Singapore, Luxembourg and Hong Kong. Their investments make up 79 percent of the total. Last year, net outflows of hot money hit $1.90 billion, an about-face from 2018’s $1.20-billion net inflow. The 2019 tally compares with the Bangko Sentral’s forecast of $8-billion net inflows for the year. "

Originating in the city of Wuhan in the East Asian country’s central Hubei province, Covid-19 has spread to more than two dozen countries, claimed the lives of at least 2,120 people — including one, a Chinese tourist, in the Philippines — and infected more than 74,000 others as of Thursday. The virus forced companies in China to suspend their operations for weeks, inflicted blows to global trade and tourism, and disrupted supply chains. Limlingan’s remarks come after Beijing touted a big drop in new virus cases as proof its epidemic control efforts are working. Chinese officials said this week that these efforts, including quarantining tens of millions of people in Hubei and restricting movements in cities nationwide, have started to pay off. More than 600 new infections were reported in Wuhan — the lowest daily tally since late January and well below the 1,749 new cases on Wednesday.

Latest data from PPA showed that its 2019 net income was 31 percent higher than the 2018 figure of P5.553 billion. Also, the latest figure is the highest in PPA’s history. The agency’s total revenues also soared by 5 percent to P18.352 billion from P17.5 billion in 2018. PPA General Manager Jay Daniel Santiago PPA General Manager Jay Daniel Santiago attributed the robust growth in the agency’s net income to “changes being implemented by the current administration.” “The changes range from manual to automated processes, installation of sophisticated, effective and higher productivity port equipment, compliance with the world’s best port management practices and most especially, the shift in the outlook of employees to public service with reliability, integrity and accountability,” said Santiago. South Harbor, Batangas, Davao, Surigao and Bataan/Aurora were among the port management offices that recorded significant positive performance. “The positive deviation comes mainly from lay-up fees, ro-ro (roll-on, roll-off) fees, domestic dockage fee, pilotage, utilization of the vessel traffic monitoring system and other income,” the statement said. Meanwhile, PPA’s total expenses decreased to P8 billion from P9.476 billion in 2018 and its non-cash expenses to P2.727 billion. “With this strong performance, the PPA again shall be able to help government achieve its goal of giving comfortable lives to every Filipino not only through higher dividend remittance but also through efficient, effective and fast delivery of port services to our stakeholders and port users,” said Santiago. The PPA would be revisiting its first quarter targets to take into account global concerns like the spread of the coronavirus disease 2019, Brexit, dispute in the West Philippine Sea, and other safety and environmental concerns. “Even with the continuing threat of global concerns, ‘business as usual’ is not an option but reducing the risk of these threats coupled with management anchored on best practices and public-service committed government personnel, our gateways connecting to the tourism and trade centers of the world, will remain competitive and responsive to any current global demands,” Santiago said.

In a briefing on Thursday, RCBC Corporate Planning Group head Ma. Cristina Alvarez said the Yuchengco-led lender’s profit last year grew by 25.58 percent from the P4.3 billion in 2018. “The main drivers for the growth were our core business, represented by our net interest income, and our fee income or non asset based income,” Alvarez said. RCBC’s gross revenues grew 35 percent to P35.9 billion as interest income from loans and receivables expanded by 21 percent, driven by the solid volume growth and sustained margins across all customer segments. Its non-interest income increased significantly by 125 percent coming from stronger contributions in treasury-related and fee-based income, which includes deposit and branch fees, trust fees, and card related fees — both for credit and debit cards. The lender’s small and medium enterprises and consumer loan segments saw solid double-digit growth of 29 percent and 18 percent, respectively. Credit cards also saw a robust growth with card receivables accelerating by 44 percent and a card base of almost 877,000 growing by 26 percent year-on-year. Cardholder spending also rose by 30 percent, making RCBC Bankard the fifth largest credit card company in the Philippines based on that metric, according to the bank. Total assets of RCBC expanded by 18 percent to reach P771.3 billion as of end-2019 with investment securities and regular loans (net of interbank loans) driving the growth at 36 percent and 11 percent, respectively. Its capital funds stood at P83.2 billion and well above the minimum regulatory requirement with a capital adequacy ratio of 13.8 percent and common equity tier 1 ratio of 12.9 percent. Return on equity recorded an improvement of 69 basis points to 6.5 percent. “The bank took advantage of the opportunities that presented itself in the market. That is why you can see a very strong growth in net income,” said RCBC Senior Executive Vice President and Treasurer Horacio Cebrero 3rd. Cebrero also highlighted that the bank is optimistic about its performance this year despite the expected impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak on the economy. He added that Philippine economic growth would still hit 6 percent this year. “Hopefully, with the growth that we’re estimating, we will register a double digit (growth in net income) — still answering to the call of the government to support them in the infrastructure projects,” Cebrero noted. “There will also l be a lot of consumer demand because the economy is still growing,” he also said.

WHISTLEBLOWER Immigration officer Allison Chiong briefs senators about the bribery scheme. PHOTO BYMIKE ALQUINTO The President spared Immigration Commissioner Jaime Morente and vouched for his integrity. “Kahapon (Yesterday), I terminated all sa kay (all those under) Morente. Apparently, Si Morente mahal ko ‘yan kasi chief of police ‘yan dito, mabait ‘yan,” Duterte said in his speech during the graduation rites of Public Safety Officers Basic Course class in Davao City. “‘Yung lahat sa NAIA, file-an mo ng kaso tapos pinaalis ko na (All those at the NAIA. I told Morente to file a case, and then, I dismissed them,” he said. On Monday, five airport immigration officials were relieved after Sen. Ana Theresia “Risa” Hontiveros exposed what she said was a payoff scheme involving several Immigration officials who give Chinese easy access to the country for a fee of P10,000 each. Palace spokesman Salvador Panelo said Duterte found probable cause to order the relief of the officials. Panelo did not say how many officials and employees are covered by the President’s order and what their names were. Panelo said the officials facilitated the entry into the country of Chinese nationals to work for Philippine offshore gaming operators (POGOs) without going through proper immigration procedures. “As we have repeatedly stressed, there are no sacred cows in this administration,” Panelo said. “Any official or employee who commits any wrongdoing, any transgression of the law in the performance of their respective duties will be meted with punishment that they deserve and in accordance with our penal laws.” Panelo said the present situation at the immigration bureau, “as well as how it is being run by Commissioner Jaime Morente,” will be taken up at the next Cabinet meeting. Cases will “most likely” be filed against the relieved officials, he added. On Monday, Sen. Ana Theresia “Risa” Hontiveros exposed what she said was a pay-off scheme involving several Immigration officials that gives Chinese nationals easy access to the country for a fee of P10,000 each. During a hearing, Hontiveros showed screenshots of a group chat of immigration officers discussing a list of names of foreigners and their flight details. Once a Chinese arrives, the immigration officer on duty would leave his booth and escort the foreigner to a holding room, where the visitor’s passport is processed for entry.
The procedure is unauthorized, Hontiveros said. The bribe is called “pastillas” because the money to be distributed to immigration officers were rolled inside a sheet of bond paper resembling the milk candy wrapper. The immigration officer who provided the information to Hontiveros said that syndicates operating at the airport and BI compete for the bribe from POGO-bound Chinese. Immigration Officer 1 Allison Chiong came out in the open Thursday and provided more details on the bribery scheme. “As a frontline immigration officer, I have personally witnessed various illegal transactions over the years involving the extortion of money in exchange for unimpeded passage to the Philippines,” he said. As news of the operation spread, other syndicates wanted in on the action and started submitting their own list of Chinese willing to pay bribes. The syndicates work with travel agencies in China, which submit the names of the arriving Chinese. “These syndicated groups would often compete with each other to gain favor from the Chinese travel agencies,” he said. “I noticed that Chinese who fit the profile of an employee for a POGO company enter our country with a tourist visa applied for at Philippine consulates,” Chiong said. Immigration officers were given a list of Chinese who were to be allowed entry to the Philippines without going through the immigration process. “The influence of these Chinese organizations and personalities became more apparent when they started providing immigration officers lunch meals, wrapped in Chinese newspapers. However, this recently stopped due to the travel ban on incoming Chinese nationals, due to be novel coronavirus,” he said. Each immigration officer in on the scheme receives around P20,000 weekly if the officer is assigned at NAIA 1. An officer assigned to NAIA 3 receives P8,000 weekly, Chiong said. He identified the immigration personnel heading the syndicates as Totoy Magbuhos, Deon Albao, Paul Borja, Anthony Lopez, and Dennis Robles. He said the illegal activity started after the Department of Justice removed the overtime pay of immigration officers in 2016 . “To cope with the substantial deduction of their salaries, some immigration officers decided to offer VIP services for immigrants who are casino high-rollers,” he said. Involved immigration officers received P20,000 from each high-roller, “in exchange for the latter’s convenient and seamless immigration,” he said. Chiong said that “sensing the immigration officers’ lucrative operation, the Travel Control Enforcement Unit chiefs, namely Bien Guevarra, Glenn Comia and Den Binsol, who were then under former Ports Operation chief Red Mariñas, decided to take over the operation.” “They took control of the collections from entering and departing passengers then disbursed commissions at the end of every week,” he said.

Thursday said priests would no longer smear the forehead of the faithful with ash on Ash Wednesday. They will instead sprinkle ash on the head to avoid physical contact. CBCP President Archbishop Romulo Valles Archbishop Romulo Valles, president of the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of the Philippines (CBCP), on Thursday issued the directive as a precautionary measure against the spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). He said the ashes to be showered on the crown of the head “signify our repentance from sin, which has marred the grace of Baptism.” On Good Friday, during the celebration of the Passion of the Lord, the CBCP “strongly” recommended that churchgoers “refrain” from kissing or touching the cross for veneration. “Instead, the faithful are requested to genuflect or make a profound bow as they venerate the cross,” Valles said. The new guideline is the second one released by the CBCP amid the Covid-19 threat. Last month, the CBCP suggested that communion be taken by the hand and discouraged the faithful from holding hands when they pray “Our Father” during the Mass. The bishops also issued an oratio imperata (obligatory prayer) against the spread of Covid-19 which has infected more than 75,000 people and killed more than 2,000. "

In a memo signed by Education Secretary Leonor Briones, the department said the events could push through so long as precautionary measures were strictly followed. “This is in accordance with the joint statement of the Department of Health, Department of the Interior and Local Government and Department of Tourism on public gatherings,” the memo read. DepEd noted that the event’s organizers should ensure an adequate supply of water and soap in schools, and hand sanitizers or rubbing alcohol at entrances of schools and offices. Cleanliness, including the regular disinfection of doorknobs and handles, must be maintained. The department had suspended all national and regional activities as a precautionary measure to prevent the spread of Covid-19. Among the activities were the National Schools Press Conference in Tuguegarao City, the National Festival of Talents in Ilagan, Isabela and the National Science and Technology Fair (NSTF). The student journalism and talent competitions, which were originally scheduled on February 17 to 21, have been moved to March 9 to 13, and the NSTF to March 2 to 6. The Education department also reminded all personnel and students who decide to proceed with their travel to countries identified to have confirmed cases of Covid-19 that they would be subjected to a mandatory 14-day self-quarantine. Students on quarantine, those excused from attending school-based activities that involve a congregation of learners, will not be marked absent so long as they are given Alternative Delivery Modes of education. DepEd also directed schools to dedicate weekends to schoolwide general cleaning and intensified disinfection efforts. Earlier, DepEd allowed its local officials to suspend classes as a preventive measure for Covid-19, especially in the areas where there are confirmed cases. Local DepEd officials can also suspend classes if “one school has confirmed a case of Covid-19” and “if two or more schools in one city or municipality have a confirmed positive case of the disease.” "
,"February 21, 2020",nCov,Have faith: Mankind as one will overcome global health emergency,The Manila Times,"THERE is encouraging news on both the scientific and economic fronts amid all the gloom over the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) outbreak. First, United States scientists (some of whom have already won the Nobel Prize for chemistry) have announced a breakthrough in their research to develop a vaccine and treatment for Covid-19. This could bring closer or faster the ultimate surmounting of the health pandemic. AFP PHOTO Second, China’s central bank has announced a $10-billion stimulus to ensure “reasonable and abundant liquidity” in the country’s banking system, and to provide more monetary and credit support for hospitals and medical institutions at the frontline of the battle against the virus. This has started to inject life and verve into stock exchanges across the Asia-Pacific region. The news from the United States was especially cheering. US scientists announced Wednesday that they had created the first 3D atomic-scale map of the part of the novel coronavirus that attaches to and infects human cells, a critical step toward developing a vaccine and treatments. The breakthrough has come as the death toll from Covid-19 jumped past 2,000, almost all of them in mainland China, where 74,185 cases of infection have been confirmed since it first emerged in late December. The team from the University of Texas at Austin (UT Austin) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) first studied the genetic code of the virus made publicly available by Chinese researchers, and used it to develop a stabilized sample of a key part called the spike protein. They then imaged the spike protein using cutting-edge technology known as cryogenic electron microscopy, publishing their findings in the journal Science. “The spike is really the antigen that we want to introduce into humans to prime their immune response to make antibodies against this, so that when they then see the actual virus, their immune systems are ready and loaded to attack,” UT Austin scientist Jason McLellan, who led the research, told the Agence France Presse (AFP). He said he and his colleagues had already spent many years studying other members of the coronavirus family, including SARS, the severe acute respiratory syndrome, and MERS, the Middle East respiratory syndrome, which helped them develop the engineering methods required to keep the spike protein stable. Their engineered spike protein is itself being tested as a potential vaccine by the NIH. The significance of this breakthrough cannot be overestimated. The US research team is sending the map of its molecular structure out to collaborators around the world so they can improve it by making it provoke a greater immune response, the AFP reported. The model could help scientists develop new proteins to bind to different parts of the spike and prevent it from functioning, to treat those already infected. These are what are known as anti-virals. “This is a beautifully clear structure of one of the most important coronavirus proteins — a real breakthrough in terms of understanding how this coronavirus finds and enters cells,” said virologist Benjamin Neuman at the Texas A&M University-Texarkana, who was not involved in the work. “The structure shows that although the spike is made of the three identical proteins, one flexes out above the rest, effectively giving the virus a longer reach,” he added. According to Neuman, another useful aspect of the molecular structure developed by the US scientists for vaccine development is that it maps out the size and location of chains of sugar molecules the virus uses in part to avoid being detected by the human immune system. Cryogenic electron microscopy uses beams of electrons to examine the atomic structures of biomolecules that are frozen to help preserve them. Three scientists credited with developing the technology were awarded the 2017 Nobel Prize in chemistry. With these developments in both scientific research and economic and financial management, the world should have more confidence that humanity, working together as one, will overcome Covid-19. "

Earlier Thursday, South Korea said it has confirmed a total of 82 cases of the virus. The mayor of the South Korean city of Daegu urged its 2.5 million people on Thursday to refrain from going outside as cases of a new virus, linked to a church congregation, spiked and he pleaded for help from the central government. Mayor Kwon Young-jin made the appeal in a nationally televised news conference after the southeastern city and its nearby towns reported 35 additional cases of infection with the new coronavirus on Thursday. In Japan, nearly 700 people are feared infected by the virus on top of the over 500 passengers of the cruise ship that left Yokohama Wednesday. Kwon also asked Daegu citizens to wear masks even indoors if possible. He expressed fears that the rising infections in the region will soon overwhelm the city’s health infrastructure and called for urgent help from the central government in Seoul. “National quarantine efforts that are currently focused on blocking the inflow of the virus (from China) and stemming its spread are inadequate for preventing the illness from circulating in local communities,” Kwon said. The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said 28 of those 35 new patients went to church services attended by a previously confirmed virus patient or contacted her at other places inside a Daegu church. That patient is a South Korean woman in her early 60s who has no recent record of overseas travel, according to center officials. She tested positive for the virus on Tuesday, becoming the 31st case in South Korea. On Wednesday morning, Daegu confirmed 13 cases and 11 of them either went to the same church with the woman patient or contacted her at a hospital, according to the disease control center. AP "

Seriously, the revered Jose P. Laurel Sr. says we citizens are particles of sovereignty. If so, the Palace tenant may not ignore the sovereign whom he, as No. 1 public servant, is pledged to serve in dealing with transcendental matters such as the Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA) and its dimensions beyond Sen. Bato dela Rosa’s canceled visa. On the VFA, we again heard Tantrum Ego in the Palace, to the tune of Solitaire. No public consultation of any kind. Basta! In 1991, not to extend, or terminate, the bases treaty, the people were heard through the Senate, which had conducted hearings. The spirit of Article XVIII, Section 25, may be invoked here. It says: “After the expiration in 1991 of the Agreement between the Republic of the Philippines and the United States of America concerning Military Bases, foreign military bases, troops, or facilities shall not be allowed in the Philippines except under a treaty duly concurred in by the Senate and, when the Congress so requires, ratified by a majority of the votes cast by the people in a national referendum held for that purpose, and recognized as a treaty by the other contracting State.” The spirit of the Constitution seems to be that in dealing with the bases, etc., with a longtime ally expressly identified, the US, where millions of Filipinos reside, whose language we even use, the less that we decide on a royal utos ng hari di mababali, the better. Involve the Senate, even the people, as particles of popular sovereignty, through a referendum. It is democracy versus royalty. Else, to borrow from another language (Hokkien), bwisit. Perhaps. Or do we deal with a pure “political question,” where a decision is exclusively lodged in one branch of government? Maybe, but one-man royalty would then trump democracy with its sounds and noises. The people cannot be echa fuera. Prez Cory even marched to the Senate in the wind and rain in 1991. She failed to get two-thirds of us to concur and we consequently ended the continuous presence of foreign troops on our soil for centuries, maybe a world record. We were America’s last plantation, but thereafter we can enter into any treaty with anyone, but approximating equals, at arm’s length, and not as an imposition by a colonial master. For the Prez to end the VFA, which I might even favor, but, given 9/11 and China’s hegemonic irredentism, the people should have been heard, through the National Security Council, the Senate, or even including the House, to make sure that the final outcome would be psychologically satisfying in terms of complying with the democratic process. The gesture for acceptability and legitimacy of democratic decisions matters. No Basta! (Here, or in the case of ABS-CBN Corp., if it had breached a contractual obligation in the 2016 campaign by not airing candidate Digong’s ads, paid for, then it should be sued for damages. Gag rule? To me, more speech, not less, in a matter of public concern, free expression; let the superior thought prevail in the marketplace of ideas. I am more concerned with the Prez condemning an accused, which can drive an unfairly pressured judge to seek early retirement.) Else, we’d be particles of slavery, mga aliping busabos, on whom the will of the great one is imposed. The VFA had to go because Senator de la Rosa can no longer accept a reported and arguably illegal and unethical gift to watch a bout in the US, at the expense of fellow senator Manny Pacquiao, skilled in the Manly Art of Modified Murder whose main objective is to harm a fellow human being. Two Pinoy boxers battered two Aussie boxers to death in 2015; one Aussie (Brayd Smith) was even a law student. I am comfy though watching basketball where injuries sadly also occur of course but that is not the raison d’etre of the game. Collateral damage. We may all be concerned, however, that, for the first time in many years, we have no easy convenient access to the NBA, now that we are entering the critical phase after the February All-Star break. This may be another failure of the administration, another first, if somewhat relatively petty. The local leagues, Covid-19 has also disrupted, but it’s business as usual in the NBA. But not for us, ordinary viewers, for months now, NBA-starved. Too bad our Prez cannot bully the NBA. He must have been shocked that Trump took the questionable VFA termination unquestioningly, punctuating the savings even. What, no eating of humble pie, with the US crawling and pleading for us to reconsider? If our Prez may be seen as a proud and profane braggart, Trump may be even more so. Then, from out of the blue, Digong says his move ensures Trump’s reelection. That is decidedly not our Prez’s business. He has to read Trump’s Art of the Deal. Prez Cory had to deal with various challengers but she beat them all — from Marcos down the line — working with all her might, praying with all her heart and leaving the rest to God. Next week, we mark another anniversary of our Brief Shining Moment when we shocked and awed the world with our selfless patriotism in a virtually bloodless transition in 1986. We also mark on Monday, February 24, another year of Sen. Leila de Lima’s incarceration, the third anniversary. She had committed the unforgivable sin of probing Meyor Digong’s human rights record when she was Commission on Human Rights chairman.

,"February 21, 2020",nCov,"Virus brings two foes together, Japan and China",Agence France-Presse,"BEIJING: As China faces increasing isolation, with some countries closing off borders over coronavirus fears, an unlikely friend has emerged — historical arch-foe Japan. After decades of war and animosity, donations and Japanese ballet dancers shouting their support are among the gestures that have endeared Japan to Chinese people and state media. News that the Japanese government sent a plane bearing thousands of pieces of protective garments for the hard-hit central city of Wuhan received more than 170 million views on the Twitter-like Weibo platform. The flight, the fifth of its kind chartered by Tokyo, was met with gratitude on the Japanese Embassy’s Weibo account, but also concern for Japan’s own battle against the outbreak. “You’re the best! You’re the best friend and neighbor of the Chinese people!” wrote one user. “But I hope you can also defeat the epidemic soon.” “Keep some for yourself please,” wrote another. Japan, which is set to host the Summer Olympics this year, has confirmed at least 79 cases domestically and one death, and more than 600 other infections on a cruise ship. In late January, photos of boxes of donated masks from Japan bearing a line of classical poetry went viral on Chinese social media. “Foreign lands separated by mountains and rivers, we share the wind and moon under the same sky,” the boxes say, quoting a Tang-dynasty text. China’s Foreign Ministry said it was “extremely touched” by the poetic gift. “The epidemic is temporary, but friendship endures,” said Foreign Ministry spokesman Hua Chunying, praising photos seen online of Japanese pharmacies with signs saying, “Let’s go, China!” Japan ‘vulnerable’
The virus has killed more than 2,100 people and infected more than 74,500 in China since it first emerged late last year. The current goodwill between the East Asian neighbors is a far cry from the diplomatic spats that have characterized their relationship in recent decades, from maritime disputes to lingering anger over victims of Japanese wartime sexual slavery. Japan invaded China in the 1930s and the two countries fought a full-scale war from 1937 until Japan’s defeat in World War 2 in 1945. China sees Japanese politicians’ periodic visits to Tokyo’s Yasukuni war shrine honoring convicted war criminals as a sign of aggression. But now, “in such hard times and particularly because of the attacks and criticisms [from other countries], the Chinese government and people are just grateful for such show of support,” said Victor Teo, an assistant professor of Japanese studies at the University of Hong Kong. At the same time, “it is definitely in Japan’s national interest that the health threat remains contained, too,” Teo told the Agence France-Presse (AFP). “Japan is extremely vulnerable because of her intense people-to-people and economic exchanges with China.” While the United States and several other countries have banned travelers from China, Japan has only prevented arrivals of people from two of the Chinese provinces hardest hit by the epidemic. Donations and shows of support from Japanese businesses were “natural” not just for humanitarian reasons, “but also for economic reasons,” Satoshi Amako, China expert at Waseda University, said. “It’s become clear that if the Chinese economy is hurt, the Japanese economy receives an impact from it and vice versa.” ‘Deeper incentives’
Relations between Asia’s two biggest economies have warmed in recent years after suffering in 2012 when Tokyo “nationalized” disputed islands claimed by Beijing. Shinzo Abe made the first visit to China by a Japanese prime minister since 2011 last year. President Xi Jinping was expected to visit Japan this year. “Deeper incentives” are driving an improvement in Sino-Japanese relations, Richard McGregor, a senior fellow at the Lowy Institute, told AFP. “China is always more solicitous to Japan when ties with Washington go south,” he added. US President Donald Trump’s disregard for allies could give Beijing “a chance to begin to crack the US-Japan alliance,” reducing US dominance in the region, McGregor said. But not everyone in China is impressed with Japan’s displays of goodwill. News about dancers from Tokyo’s Matsuyama Ballet company singing the Chinese national anthem onstage and cheering on Chinese viewers received more than 100 million views on Weibo. State-run tabloid Global Times described the performance as showing “inner respect and praise” for China. But some viewers blasted the video as melodramatic and inappropriate, pointing out the anthem’s historic roots in anti-Japanese resistance during the 1930s. “This is a little too much, don’t they know who it was who wanted to enslave us during that era?” AFP "
,"February 21, 2020",nCov,"Global economy still slowing, dangerously vulnerable",Inter Press Service,"SYDNEY and KUALA LUMPUR: In an annual ritual early in the year, most major economic organizations have released forecasts for the global economy in 2020. Incredibly, almost as a reminder of where financial power resides in this day and age, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) released its forecasts at the World Economic Forum’s 50th annual meeting in Davos. Although the IMF revised its global economic growth prognosis slightly downwards from its October 2019 forecast, it still offers the most optimistic prospect of 3.3 percent growth in 2020. The World Bank’s forecast of 2.5 percent — identical to the United Nations estimate — is the lowest, with the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (OECD) at 2.9 percent. The IMF justified its optimism by improved market sentiments following the Phase One United States-China trade deal and diminished fears of a “no-deal Brexit.” Goldman Sachs describes these developments as “A Break in the Clouds,” forecasting global growth at 3.4 percent in 2020, while Morgan Stanley sees ‘Calmer Waters Ahead,’ expecting 3.2 percent in 2020 and 3.5 percent in 2021. Perils of ‘talking up’
It is not unusual for these organizations to be optimistic: after all, they do not want to be seen as naysayers, or prophets of doom, especially if their pronouncements are later denounced as self-fulfilling prophecies. But “talking up the economy” can have grave consequences, as with the 2008-2009 global financial crisis (GFC). Then, the IMF revised its forecast upward in July 2007, a month before the US “sub-prime” mortgage crisis morphed into the worst global downturn since the Great Depression of the 1930s. Meanwhile, the OECD was confident that any US “soft-landing” would be offset by robust European economic performance. Such forecasts fostered a false and ultimately dangerous sense of invulnerability and complacence before the storm broke. Policymakers ignored warnings by the UN since 2005 about fundamental weaknesses, including growing global imbalances and the debt-financed US housing bubble. As is now well known, the collapse of the US sub-prime mortgage market brought down world finance and, eventually, the global economy. Hazards of forecasting
Thankfully, it is customary to include some cautionary notes with these annual forecasts, even when optimistic. For example, the IMF now warns of more downside risks, including geopolitical tensions, social unrest, trade tensions, and developing economies’ financial turmoil. Both the UN and the IMF fear that the climate crisis can trigger financial stress, further slowing economic growth. To make matters worse, ignoring fundamental weaknesses and focusing excessively on ephemeral short-term trends can be dangerously misleading. To be sure, forecasting is extremely hazardous, and sometimes compared unfavorably to astrology. Forecasters factor in plausible developments, but completely unpredictable “black swan” events, such as the novel coronavirus pandemic, can upset even the best of forecasts. Meanwhile, the World Bank warns of ballooning debt, both public and private. The UN and the World Bank also note that the sharp productivity growth slowdown since the GFC has reduced long-term growth and poverty reduction prospects; furthermore, high inequality will also delay such progress. Both the UN and the IMF note that high and rising inequality also engenders greater social and political polarization, unrest and instability. Additionally, the UN also warns of deepening political polarization and growing scepticism about multilateralism as significant downside risks. But none mention that the long-run effects of income inequality on both consumption and output can be quite large, delaying economic recovery by limiting aggregate demand and capacity utilization. Policy failure
Such fundamental weaknesses owe much to policy failures. Unlike the New Deal following the Great Depression of the 1930s, all too many contemporary policymakers shy away from addressing core problems, such as financial excesses, rising household debt, exorbitant executive salaries vis-à-vis stagnant, if not declining real wages, that also contributed to the GFC. Low (negative) interest rates, due to unconventional monetary policy, especially “quantitative easing” (QE), have not promoted productive investments, and allowed less-productive firms to survive. Thus, QE failed to boost productivity. “Easy money” has been used for share buy-backs, mergers, acquisitions and inflated executive remuneration. Thus, as before the GFC, “fictitious capital” is being systemically generated once again, contributing to asset price bubbles and endangering financial stability. “Easy money” from developed economies has also flowed to developing countries in search of better returns, making them more vulnerable, besides raising their indebtedness yet again. QE has also contributed to rising inequality. Meanwhile, major central banks have exhausted much of their means for lending at very low or even negative interest rates as they have very limited room to cut interest rates further. No fiscal savior
Besides reducing overall revenue collection and marginal income tax rates, the longstanding trend from direct to indirect taxation has shifted tax incidence from incomes to consumption, largely at the expense of the middle class. Pursuing fiscal austerity under various guises, governments have slashed social and infrastructure spending in favour of public-private partnerships skewed in favor of influential corporate interests. Fiscal austerity also slowed economic recovery and technology adoption to the detriment of productivity growth. Such fiscal reforms have not only exacerbated inequality, but also kept countries and households in debt bondage. And as governments have less fiscal space with rising debt, their ability to respond to crises — financial, climate or pandemic — is severely compromised. Missed opportunity
Had national policymakers, led by the G20, embraced the UN recommendation for a Global Green New Deal to stimulate recovery, address the climate crisis and reverse growing inequality, the global economy could have been put on a more inclusive and sustainable path. Such hopes remain even more elusive in an increasingly fractured world where multilateralism itself has been discredited and deliberately undermined by ethno-populism’s relegitimization of jingoism.

The global spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), which originated in Hubei province, China, sadly revealed man’s darker nature and thoughtless tendency to be prejudiced and discriminating. Fortunately, national organizations such as the Federation of Filipino Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry Inc. (FFCCCII) were quick to address the burgeoning issue, urging Filipinos, through strongly worded statements, to avoid making “racist” remarks and fanning the fires of misunderstanding. Henry Lim Bon Liong, president of the chamber, told Boardroom Watch: “I don’t want to pit local-born Chinese against the mainlanders. Masama ‘yan (That’s wrong). “Aba, galing din China ang mga ninuno natin (Why, our forefathers also came from China). “In fact, one of the responsibilities of our association is to help anyone from China assimilate [into Philippine society].” Immigrant’s tale
Dr. Lim, who boasts of a raft of civic awards and honorary degrees for his indefatigable efforts to “give back” to the country, embodies the quintessential immigrant story that’s been heard before, but never ceases to amaze in the retelling. His father Lim Seh Leng arrived in the Philippines on that proverbial boat from Fujian province in southern China, a boy of only 11, along with other fortune seekers. He wound up in Binondo, the Chinese enclave across the Pasig River from Manila’s elegant Spanish settlement, Intramuros. The senior Lim met and married Maria Co Chiao Ti, and together the couple had seven children, of which Dr. Lim was the eldest and his only sister, the youngest. Dr. Lim recalls that so fervently did his father wish to acquire Filipino citizenship, he lapped up any bit of Filipino trivia he could, such as Q: What is the Filipino’s favorite pasttime? A: Sabong (cockfighting). He could even sing the National Anthem flawlessly. He achieved his ambition, and in 1964, he and his family became Filipino citizens. Dr. Lim’s father found his early business niche, setting up Sterling Bookbinding, which has the Sterling photo album as its main product. Sterling Paper Products Enterprises, which featured school and office supplies, later joined the group. As the oldest son, Dr. Lim was made to learn the ropes as early as his high school years. “I was the bodega (storeroom) boy, the agent and in charge of delivery,” he says with a chuckle. He also accompanied his dad on business trips across the country and overseas. “He taught me the value of money and quality products, as well as the art of negotiating.” From him, the boy learned that risks were part of life’s game and came with unique rewards. “He challenged me to sell at a high price, which went against the conventional wisdom of selling low and selling more. Sell high, he said, and still sell even more. However, the product had be of good quality and different from the others.” Growing up fast
In 1976, Dr. Lim experienced his first major setback: his father, then only 49, died suddenly in Hong Kong. At just 25, he had to assume the presidency of Sterling Co., not to mention fill the yawning void left by his parent in the family’s life. “I knew from the start that his were big shoes to fill.” It also didn’t help that there was no lack of naysayers predicting the company would go down under his watch. Dr. Lim and his team at the Filipino-Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry building in Binondo With President Rodrigo Duterte during last year’s swearing in of the chamber’s new officers, led by Dr. Lim In his Coast Guard Auxilliary officer’s uniform. PHOTOS BY MINDY GANA EXCEPT THE MALACAÑANG EVENT The years that followed saw Dr. Lim struggle to keep the company afloat and raise its profile, especially Sterling notebooks, their main product. He credits his brash youth and wish to honor his father’s memory as motivating factors. “I forced myself to believe in what I could do. Looking back, some would say that it may have been pure nerve that gave me the courage and ability to run Sterling Co. at a very young age. Or, it may have even been the impulsiveness of my youth. But earning the approval and respect of my father was one of my biggest motivations during those challenging times in my mid-20s.” An engineering graduate of the University of the Philippines Diliman, Dr. Lim later realized he should have heeded his father’s earlier counsel to pursue an economics, marketing or management degree. “Engineering didn’t help you understand balance sheets,” he declares. To catch up, he enrolled in business courses at the Ateneo de Manila as well an Executive Education Program at Harvard Business School. These opportunities, he reflected in a previous interview, showed him “that no one is too old or too successful to learn something new.” Such gung ho attitude was to serve Dr. Lim well in the late 1990s when he embarked on an enterprise far removed from his comfort zone. He became a hybrid-rice entrepreneur. Rice entrepreneur
For one, who readily admits he had no idea how much a kilo of rice cost in the market at the time, Dr. Lim has crossed oceans. He says he owes his epiphany to former president and close friend Joseph Estrada, who said he would make agriculture the cornerstone of his platform should he win the elections. The prospect of enhancing rice production efficiency and the farmers’ quality of life fired him with an intensity that made him defy friends and associates, who predicted he would fail in this venture. “It was my mother, who encouraged me to develop our own Filipino hybrid rice with the help of Prof. Yuan Longpin (known as the ‘Father of Hybrid Rice’) and purchase that 40 hectares in Laguna for our plantation.” To handle the agricultural operations of Sterling Co., Dr. Lim established SL Agritech, the initials “SL,” for his father Seh Leng. In November 2000, Dr. Lim again encountered a devastating watershed in his life. Fresh from the opening of a family owned department store in Olongapo City, the van, ferrying Dr. Lim and relatives back to Manila, figured in a head on collision. He lost his mother and younger brother in the accident and suffered five broken ribs, which kept him from lying flat for months. “I cursed Heaven as to why this had to happen, and I survived,” he says impassively two decades later. “But they say things happen for a reason.” About two months after, one of Dr. Yuan’s Chinese researchers claimed that Dr. Lim’s mother appeared to him in a dream, issuing instructions to go to Plot 8 in the hacienda to check on developments in their hybrid-rice experiment. What he discovered must have been positive, leading to the successful production, distribution and marketing of SL-8H or Doña Maria Premium Rice, in loving honor of the Lim matriarch. The rice seeds are not only utilized in the Philippines but in other Asian countries such as Indonesia, Bangladesh, Vietnam and Myanmar. SL Agritech has been engaged in rice exportation in the Middle East and US since 2013. Legacy defined
At a stage when most tycoons are firming up their legacy, Dr. Henry Lim Bon Liong is one of the lucky ones to have discovered his early on. “I want to be remembered as someone, who raised the standard of living of the farmers in Southeast Asia through hybrid-rice technology,” he says. “I want it to benefit, not only our Filipino farmers, but also those in the region, and even as far as Africa.” Whether through innovative rice production, meaningful civic projects or strengthening cultural bonds, Dr. Henry Lim Bon Liong is a bridge builder extraordinaire. * * * Lessons from dad
Dr. Henry Lim Bon Liong learned about life’s realities early on. He had the best teacher he could ask for: his father. • He did not spoil me with riches or luxuries that many of my classmates took for granted. But he provided me with the best gift of all — a good education. • He showed me the only way to achieve my dreams was through hard work and determination. I studied his ways and learned from him as diligently as I could, and I did. • He taught me the value of money and quality products and the art of negotiating.

The huge vessel moored in Yokohama near Tokyo is easily the biggest coronavirus cluster outside the Chinese epicenter, with 621 positive cases confirmed among the passengers and crew. On Wednesday, 443 passengers disembarked from the ship after testing negative for the COVID-19 virus and not showing symptoms during a 14-day quarantine period. The complete removal of the passengers was expected to take at least three days. More passengers left the ship on Thursday, packing into yellow buses and leaving for stations and airports for home. But questions are increasingly being asked as to the wisdom of allowing former Diamond Princess passengers to roam freely around Japan’s famously crowded cities, even if they have tested negative. “Is it really safe to get off?” screamed a headline in the Nikkan Sports tabloid.

Passengers were confined to cabins except for brief trips on deck wearing masks and gloves, when they were told to keep their distance from others. But a specialist in infectious diseases at Kobe University rocked the boat with a video slamming “completely chaotic” quarantine procedures onboard, in rare criticism from a Japanese official. “The cruise ship was completely inadequate in terms of infection control,” said Kentaro Iwata in videos he has since deleted, saying “there is no need to discuss this further.” The videos had been viewed more than a million times in Japanese and hundreds of thousands of times in English. ‘I was so scared’ Japan’s health ministry lashed out in defense, saying it had conducted “consultations on appropriate infection control in the ship” with experts and taken a range of measures. The Diamond Princess cruise ship, with around 3,600 people quarantined onboard due to fears of the new coronavirus, is seen anchored at the Daikoku Pier Cruise Terminal in Yokohama port on Feb. 10, 2020.

In addition, risky and safe areas were strictly divided and there was a station installed for safely removing contaminated gear, the ministry said. “We’ve been doing our best in the circumstances,” Health Minister Katsunobu Kato told MPs on Thursday morning. “I want you to understand that not only our officials at the health ministry but also Self-Defense Forces officials and medical officials are working desperately hard,” he added.

(Jun Hirata/Kyodo News via AP) Iwata, who spent several hours on the ship, had alleged: “There was no distinction between the green zone, which is free of infection, and the red zone, which is potentially contaminated by the virus.” He said he was so concerned at what he saw on the ship during a brief visit on Tuesday that he has placed himself in a 14-day quarantine to avoid infecting his family. “I was in Africa dealing with the Ebola outbreak. I was in other countries dealing with the cholera outbreak. I was in China in 2003 to deal with SARS… I never had a fear of getting infection myself,” he said in the video in English and Japanese. “But inside Diamond Princess, I was so scared… because there was no way to tell where the virus is.” Several countries have evacuated their citizens from the ship and insisted they endure a further 14-day quarantine when they arrive on home soil.

Caraballo, TMT","S&P Global Ratings has trimmed its growth outlook for the Philippine economy this year as it believes the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) outbreak will weaken the country’s supply chains.  The credit rating agency now projects Philippine gross domestic product (GDP) to expand by 6.1 percent, lower than its previous forecast of 6.2 percent. The updated outlook, which S&P released in a report on Wednesday, is higher than last year’s economic expansion of 5.9 percent, but lower than the 6.5 to 7.5-percent growth target of the government. “This article focuses more on economic than viral transmission, and we see four channels: People flows, supply chains, goods trade and commodity prices in order of importance,” the debt watcher said. For the Philippines alone, it explained the economy was more vulnerable to supply chains than people flows. “More uncertain is the impact on supply chains,” S&P said, highlighting that the Philippines was both upstream and downstream from China with processed intermediate trade with the country accounting for about 15 percent of overall trade. It also said the country was dominated by electronics components, which might experience region-wide disruptions. “The OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) estimates that the Philippines’ domestic value-added in gross exports is over 75 percent, which is high by emerging market standards, although it is likely to be lower in the electronics industry,” the credit watchdog added. On the investment side, S&P said China’s inward foreign direct investments (FDI) in the Philippines was only 3 percent of GDP, while the Chinese share of approved FDI was typically less than 3 percent. The S&P report comes a day after Moody’s Investors Service trimmed its growth outlook for the Philippines to 6.1 percent after taking into account the impact of the Covid-19 outbreak on the demand and supply chain in the Asia-Pacific. Earlier, the government estimated that the outbreak’s impact could shave as much as 0.7 percent of the country’s GDP if it lasts the entire year. "

BoC data provided by Dominguez revealed that the number of 20-foot equivalent units (TEU) or containers from China dropped by 62.15 percent to 11,050 from February 1 to 18 from 29,195 in the same period in 2019. This brought the year-to-date tally of these TEUs to decrease by 14.36 percent to 77,878 from 90,936 year-on-year. While the drop is “concerning,” the Finance chief is optimistic that shipments from other countries would offset the reduced Chinese imports. “We believe that this slack will be taken up in other markets. We hope that this doesn’t last too long,” he said. His remarks are consistent with a new report from Moody’s Analytics that warned of mounting economic damage amid the continued spread of the coronavirus, which first broke out in the city of Wuhan in China’s central Hubei province. Covid-19 has killed more than 2,000 people — including one, a Chinese tourist, in the Philippines — and infected over 74,000 others as of Wednesday, as well as disrupted supply chains. Moody’s economists said the spread of the virus had surpassed expectations and effectively shut down large parts of the Chinese economy. “Given China’s central role in the global economy — it is the second largest economy in the world, accounting for 16 percent of GDP (gross domestic product) — the economic fallout is spreading quickly around the globe,” they added. The economists believe the global economy would feel the ill effects of the East Asian country’s economic problems through three principal channels: Chinese tourism and business travel, manufacturing, and commodities. Disruptions in global manufacturing alone would weaken Southeast Asia, according to them. Earlier, the National Economic and Development Authority urged the government to increase its efforts against downside risks brought by health- and climate-related hazards that can affect the trade sector. It said the government needed to remain vigilant of the risks brought about by the onslaught of disasters in the Philippines and the Covid-19 outbreak. WITH A REPORT FROM AFP "

Regina Capital Development Corp. managing director Luis Limlingan said some investors were prompted to give the country “a chance for bargain hunting” as the new number of Covid-19 cases declined in China. “Some investors have given the country a chance for bargain-hunting as new Covid-19 cases in China continued to fall with markets less [focused] on the outbreak,” Limlingan said in a text message. AAA Equities head of research Christopher Mangun said the majority of Asian markets gained, following a decrease in the number of people affected by the virus outbreak. “A lack of selling pressure allowed regular buying to take prices of blue chip issues higher than usual. This may be because we have been seeing foreign inflows in the last couple of days,” Mangun said. Similar to the local stock market scene, most Asian stocks ended in the green. Tokyo and Hong Kong surged by 0.89 percent and 0.46 percent, respectively. But Shanghai lost 0.15 percent.

During TMP’s turnover ceremony for its new president on Monday night, Trade Secretary Ramon Lopez called on the carmaker to build more local parts to help further develop the vehicle manufacturing industry in the country. TMP formally welcomed its new president Atsuhiro Okamoto during the occasion. “We call on Toyota Motor Philippines to again expand local operations, increase local sourcing and build a higher domestic content for your operations in the country as we would like to make the Philippines your regional production hub for certain models, like the Vios,” Lopez said during his keynote speech. He expressed hope the Vios would be manufactured by TMP not only for the Philippine market, but also for the export market. TMP is actively involved in the Comprehensive Automotive Resurgence Strategy (CARS) Program of the DTI, having recently committed a P5.42-billion investment related to the program. TMP Chairman Alfred Ty said that they continue to export close to $1 billion of Philippine-made auto parts annually. Lopez also told reporters that he is encouraging localization of sources, especially now that a number of factories in China have shutdown from the spread of the coronavirus disease 2019. For his part, TMP First Vice President Rommel Gutierrez assured that the company is not affected by factories closing in China. “We have enough stocks. We are still evaluating [but] no impact, as of now,” he said. New TMP president TMP also announced the appointment of a new president in Okamoto who is succeeding Satoru Suzuki who has led TMP the past four years. The incoming president began his career with Toyota Motor Corp. in 1992. Okamoto also served as the executive vice president of Toyota Motor Asia Pacific. “Mr. Okamoto brings with him a very youthful and forward looking leadership that, I believe, is most needed at this time of motorization for the Philippines,” Ty said. Okamoto said TMP will continue to provide quality vehicles for the Philippine market. “As TMP’s new president, I would like to reiterate to all TMP team members, dealers and suppliers alike, the importance of dedicating our work to contribute to society. We will continuously do so by providing ever better cars and services to enhance the quality of life of Filipinos,” Okamoto said. For his part, Suzuki led TMP in achieving some of its milestones in the past four years. This includes TMP attaining a 39.5-percent market share and bagging its 18th consecutive Triple Crown last year. The Philippines also became the third largest market of Toyota in Southeast Asia—following Indonesia and Thailand—and TMP soared to the ninth in the Toyota Global Ranking during Suzuki’s term. Suzuki capped off his term with TMP winning the Philippine Quality Award for Performance Excellence from the government. "
,"February 20, 2020",nCov,Asian markets up on virus impact hopes,Agence France-Presse,"HONG KONG: Asian markets rebounded Wednesday as hopes the deadly new coronavirus will have only a short-term impact on corporate earnings and economic growth prevailed. Falls on US and European markets — after Apple’s warning that it would miss its quarterly revenue forecast due to the epidemic — did not carry over to Asia as investors bet on policymakers doing what is needed to minimizes the fallout. The illness, which has killed more than 2,000 people and infected over 74,000, has disrupted supply chains and forced the cancellation of high-profile sporting and cultural events. As stimulus measures are rolled out in China and elsewhere, “Asia seems confident that the region’s governments will ‘do what it takes’ to offset the coronavirus slowdown,” Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst for Asia at OANDA, said in a commentary. After four straight sessions in the red, Tokyo’s benchmark Nikkei 225 index closed up 0.9 percent. Hong Kong put on 0.5 percent, but mainland China’s key Shanghai Composite Index was off 0.3 percent. Elsewhere, South Korea rose 0.1 percent even as the number of confirmed cases of the virus jumped by nearly two-thirds. Taipei gained 0.9 percent and Sydney put on 0.4 percent. The more sanguine mood came as Chinese officials released a study showing most patients have mild cases of the coronavirus, and World Health Organization officials said the mortality rate was relatively low. IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva has said there could be a cut of around 0.1-0.2 percentage points to global growth but stressed there was much uncertainty about the virus’s economic impact. Anne Anderson of UBS Asset Management in Sydney played down concerns. “It’s important to contextualize the impact of the virus — we’re not expecting a permanent cut in global growth,” Anderson told Bloomberg TV. “The combination of the fiscal-monetary and the belief that we will transition through this over the coming months mean we’re still on steady footing.” The optimism flowed into European markets, with the major bourses opening higher.
London’s FTSE 100 was up 0.6 percent, the Paris CAC added 0.3 percent and Germany’s DAX put on 0.4 percent. Gold in favor Apple’s announcement that it would miss its March quarter revenue forecast while global iPhone supplies would fall jolted markets and sparked renewed demand for safe-haven assets such as gold. Not everyone is convinced the economic impact will be fleeting, however, suggesting Wednesday’s gains could be temporary. “The debate on whether [Covid-19] is a transient economic shock or worryingly a more longer-lasting global economic headwind appears to be shifting in favour of the latter following Apple’s admission,” said Rodrigo Catril of National Australia Bank. China is the world’s biggest importer and consumer of oil, and crude prices have been particularly sensitive to the epidemic that has spread to nearly 30 countries and territories. Brent Crude was up 0.8 percent and West Texas Intermediate was 0.9 percent higher. "

Competitor Puma said “business in China is heavily impacted due to the restrictions and safety measures implemented by the authorities.” More than half of its own stores and partner outlets are closed at the moment, it added. Adidas said it faced “a significant number of store closures” in its network of 500 owned stores and 11,500 franchises in China, while fewer people are shopping at those which remain open. The group’s “Greater China” region, which includes Taiwan and Hong Kong, has for years been one of the fastest-growing areas of the world for Adidas sales. And the Asia-Pacific region as a whole accounted for around one-third of Adidas’ 6.4 billion euros ($6.9 billion) in revenues in the first nine months of 2019. Despite the coronavirus’ spread to some other countries in the region, “we have not yet observed any major business impact outside of Greater China,” Adidas said. But Puma said “business in other markets, especially in Asia, is suffering from lower numbers of Chinese tourists.” Looking ahead, neither company could predict how big the impact of the virus would be on their annual results. Puma said it expected the situation to “normalize in the short term”, keeping the company on track to achieve its full-year targets. Adidas bosses will provide an update when the company releases its 2019 earnings data on March 11. "

Ritu Phogat, who initially followed her father and two elder sisters into wrestling, is now charting a new path after making an explosive MMA debut in November. Phogat’s father Mahavir, and her sisters Geeta and Babita were the subject of 2016 movie “Dangal,” telling the story of the wrestling coach who raised his daughters to become Commonwealth champions. In this photograph taken on on Feb. 12, 2020, Indian MMA fighter Ritu Phogat poses for a picture during an interview with Agence-France-Presse, in New Delhi. AFP PHOTO But Ritu, 25, is forging a different career. After winning her first MMA fight in less than three minutes, she will face China’s Wu Chiao Chen at this month’s ONE Championship fight night in Singapore, which will be held behind closed doors because of the coronavirus. The youngest Phogat daughter is trading an attempt at an Olympic medal to tackle MMA, but she said she was attracted by the lure of making history in her new sport. “I got a chance to train with the best in Singapore and there was no looking back,” she told Agence France-Presse during a promotional event in New Delhi. “There was the 2020 Olympic Games but I thought that I would do well in mixed martial arts. I have come with an aim of becoming the first girl from India to become a world champion in mixed martial art.” ‘One has to take risks’
The nimble but strongly built Phogat said wrestlers were a good fit for the fast-growing contact sport, which is yet to take off in India. “Top seven champions in mixed martial arts are wrestlers, so I believe that wrestlers have an edge in this sport with their ability to take down the opponent,” she said. “It is all a matter of skill. You just have to practise hard. I think MMA is not much different from wrestling in terms of preparation.” Phogat, who said she was inspired by watching Russia’s Khabib Nurmagomedov and Conor McGregor of Ireland, admitted she was running a risk by switching sports. “I had a good career in wrestling so this decision was a big risk for me. But I did not want to miss the opportunity,” she said. “One has to take risks to do something new and as an athlete I am ready to embrace every challenge.” She added: “Without the support of my father and sisters I would not have been where I am. My father always taught me to be far-sighted, hard-working and with strong resolve. Three traits will take you a long way.” Phogat won 48kg gold at the 2016 Commonwealth Wrestling Championship and followed it up with a silver in the under-23 world championships the next year. Her father Mahavir, who is now training his niece Vinesh for the Tokyo Olympics, backs his third daughter to make it big in MMA. “She used to watch a lot MMA and one day told me that I will win a gold in this game.

,"February 20, 2020",nCov,Why not use pork barrel for a PH ‘toilet revolution’,Yen Makabenta,"YEN MAKABENTA First word
ONE memorable reform that our first Miss International Gemma Cruz-Araneta effected while serving as Tourism secretary in the aborted Joseph Estrada administration (1998-2001) was her policy decision to require all commercial gasoline stations all over the archipelago to provide adequate rest rooms or toilet facilities to travelers and motorists. The service is truly a boon and a success; it’s far more significant than all the talk about the Philippines being “more fun” as a travel destination While doing research these past few weeks on the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) outbreak and China’s healthcare system, I came across significant reports on the “toilet revolution” that China under President Xi Jinping has effected as a pillar of its health and sanitation policy. (This was personally interesting for me because during a visit to China some years back as part of a Philippine delegation, one of the running themes during our tour was finding a Western-style toilet to meet our needs, whenever we were not at our hotels.) Heath and sanitation instead of ‘pork barrel’
While reviewing the recent reports on China’s alternate “cultural revolution,” it struck me that the Philippines could also do itself a world of good if it commits to its own “toilet revolution.” My simple reform idea is this: Since congressional “pork” is universally abominated by the nation (revered only by legislators), why don’t we persuade the President and the legislature to jointly exercise political will and channel the illegal pork appropriations to an earnest program to upgrade and modernize the health and sanitation system in the country with a two-fisted “toilet revolution.” Instead of budgeting billions of pesos every year for the pork kickbacks and electioneering activities of senators and congressmen, and watching them turn all that money into waiting sheds, basketball courts, social halls and other pseudo projects that do no good, the government should utilize the money for a serious program to modernize the health and sanitation system of the archipelago. One effect of the current Covid-19 crisis has been to expose the flaws and limitations of China’s toilet revolution. You will not find a better introduction to the concept and story of this revolution than a recent report in the Asia Times newspaper by journalist Gordon Watts titled, “China epidemic exposes flaws in China’s ‘Toilet Revolution,’” (Asia Times, Feb. 17, 2020): 100 percent ‘civilized toilet culture’
“A ‘Toilet Revolution’ was launched in China five years ago. The aim was to eliminate epidemics such as the deadly Covid-19 outbreak, which has so far claimed nearly 1,800 lives and infected more than 70,000 people. “Geared to upgrade hygiene and sanitation in urban and rural parts of the world’s second-largest economy, up to 68,000 toilets were built or refurbished between 2015 and 2019. “By the end of 2019, an additional 64,000 toilets will come online as part of the ultimate goal to have a 100 percent ‘civilized’ toilet culture by 2030. “‘The toilet issue is not a small issue. It is an important part of civilized construction in both urban and rural areas,’ President Xi Jinping said at the launch of his ambitious building program. “Five years later, what has become crystal clear is that the government needs to roll out a new Belt and Bathroom policy. Probably, with the same fanfare that preceded Xi’s vision of new Silk Roads crisscrossing the globe, which later became known as the trillion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative. “In 2018, a major report entitled ‘The Toilet Revolution in China,’ which was published in the Journal of Environmental Management, illustrated what was at stake if the country failed to get it right. “Apart from rural regions, there are more than 100 city clusters with populations of one million-plus, according to Demographia’s World Urban Areas report. “‘The toilet revolution requires a concerted effort from many governmental departments. It needs to address not only technology implementation, but also social acceptance, economic affordability, maintenance issues and, increasingly, gender considerations,’ a team of academics and scientists mainly from the University of Science and Technology Beijing stressed. “‘Aligned with the ecological sanitation principles, it calls for understanding issues across the entire sanitation service chain. Public-private partnership is also recommended to absorb private capital to make up the lack of funds, as well as arouse the enthusiasm of the public,’ they added. “Yet that last statement has failed to materialize, despite a succession of high-profile campaigns and programs from the central government in Beijing. “Massive urbanization over the past three decades has further exposed weak links in the sanitation system and a deteriorating state of overall healthcare. “‘Since the early 1990s, China has undergone an unprecedented scale of urbanization, driving millions of rural villagers into cities. These cities create ever greater health risks: air pollution and pandemics such as SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) in 2003, avian influenza in 2013 and now the new coronavirus outbreak have become the largest threats to people’s health in urban areas,’ Xun Zhou, of the University of Essex in the United Kingdom, wrote for The Conversation, an academic website. “‘Making the current outbreak worse is the state of the Chinese health system: overloaded, ineffective, expensive and chaotic. While there have been some attempts to reform the Chinese health system, most were carried out in a haphazard fashion. For example, in the aftermath of the SARS crisis, many public health units were reconfigured into local centers for disease control, but a systematic prevention program for infectious diseases remains absent,’ she added. “While hard numbers for Xi’s ‘Toilet Revolution’ policy are sketchy, up to last year $4 billion had been pumped into the project. “Unlike rural areas, the standard of urban facilities in China has improved dramatically in the past 30 years with upgraded sewage networks. But more needs to be done. “‘Arguably, the biggest investment the government has made to address the broader public health problems associated with disease outbreaks is the toilet revolution. Started a few years ago to bring flush toilets to rural households and improve public toilets in crowded urban centers, it lifts sanitation standards,’ Christopher Balding, of the Fulbright University Vietnam in Ho Chi Minh City, told the Nikkei Asian Review. ‘A fundamental problem in Chinese public health is low hygiene standards in toilets, restaurants, hospitals and meat markets.’ “Tackling these problems has now become a priority for Xi’s administration, which has been rocked by public anger on how the crisis has been handled. “Xun Zhou, of the University of Essex, is convinced there needs to be a fundamental shift in Beijing’s approach to sanitation and health issues even at the cost of economic growth. “‘In the PRC (the People’s Republic of China), protecting people’s lives and their physical health has remained largely political rhetoric,’ she said. “‘Seventy years after the founding of the PRC, China is a long way from being the disease-free ‘socialist garden’ imagined in the CCP’s (China’s Communist Party) utopian plans. If the SARS outbreak in 2003 was a wake-up call, the current coronavirus crisis should be an urgent warning: protecting lives should be given priority over the growth of GDP before it’s too late.’ “It appears the ‘Toilet Revolution’ needs to be just that … a social revolution to stamp out further epidemics in the world’s most populous nation.” Why reform PH health and sanitation
The model for our ongoing Build, Build, Build program to modernize infrastructure from north to south in the archipelago is clearly China’s massive and dramatic infrastructure development program which has thrust China into modernity and leadership in the world. No country has built more railways, bridges and modernized roads more extensively than it has. President Rodrigo Duterte surely had this model in mind when he agreed with his economic managers to wager all in Build, Build, Build during his term. Before the Duterte administration becomes history in two years’ time, it should roll the dice one more time. It should put its bet on a toilet revolution to revolutionize health and sanitation across the length and breadth of the Philippine archipelago. This mini revolution will be as well remembered as Build, Build, Build. And no one save porkers will miss the pork barrel. yenobserver@gmail.com "

MS Westerdam was turned away by several Asian ports before Cambodia agreed last week to allow its more than 2,000 passengers and crew to disembark. But jubilation dimmed over the weekend when an 83-year-old American woman was stopped at a Malaysian airport and diagnosed with the virus that originated from China and has now killed over 1,800 people. By the time she was diagnosed, scores of fellow passengers had moved through different countries — including Singapore and Thailand. Four are currently being monitored in Bangkok. “Some people say it brings the virus to Cambodia, but Cambodia has not had the disease [among its people],” Cambodia’s Prime Minister Hun Sen said in a speech on ­ Tuesday. Cruise operator Holland America said tests for 406 passengers now at a Phnom Penh hotel were negative, and they could continue their journeys home. For those who’ve made it to the United States, local health departments — working with the US Centers for Disease Control — are following up with passengers who might have had contact with the infected American, it added. Three hundred passengers in Phnom Penh would fly to Dubai, Hun Sen said, while 100 others would take a chartered flight to Japan. Authorities are also arranging another flight for passengers remaining in Sihanoukville — the southern coast where the Westerdam is docked — though Hun Sen did not say where that was headed. The bombastic premier had greeted disembarking passengers on Friday with embraces and flowers. As countries in the region scrambled Monday to restrict access to Westerdam’s passengers, those in Phnom Penh were taken on a tour of the capital under the glare of state-aligned media.

,"February 20, 2020",nCov,Trade virus gets viral,Rolly G. Reyes,"ROLLY G. REYES WE can now say that economic pain due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) is spreading fast and furious. All you have to do is munch some indigestible facts from international media hubs. Like the home TV shopping phrase “But wait, there’s more,” it is easy to summarize the blisters that impacted the financial markets, banking and manufacturing sectors. We all know that the epicenter of the virus is China, which is now the top trading partner for many of the world’s biggest economies, including Germany and Japan. And here they are at random:
British HSBC (Hong Kong Shanghai Banking Corp.) is planning to trash 35,000 jobs, as it has been depending on China for growth. Add to this Cathay Pacific’s announcement of its flight capacity cuts for the months of February and March. The airline revealed that cuts to flight capacity are also likely in April. Car manufacturers Jaguar Land Rover stated that it is now facing production problems in its assembly plants in England, as it has been its practice to rely heavily on parts made in China. Its competitors, like Renault, Hyundai, Chrysler, Toyota, Honda, GM and Ford, reported a similar situation. The supply chain has been disrupted as car parts manufacturers across China were ordered closed to prevent further contamination. Dozens of global airlines have also curtailed flights to and from China. Technology is also affected as Qualcomm forewarned that the uncertainty is sure to make a dent in the demand for smartphone chips. QCOM is the biggest maker of phone chips. Smartphone production is expected to decline 12 percent year-on-year this quarter, which would make it the lowest quarter in five years. China’s local governments have locked down cities and businesses and restricted travel. This is understandable to achieve the initial step of containment and stop the further escalation of infection. We have to laud the Chinese citizens’ courage to adopt quarantine voluntarily. Scientists tend to compare the current coronavirus threat to the severe acute respiratory syndrome or SARS epidemic in 2003. But based on World Bank statistics, China’s share of global economy rose 34.3 percent from a measly 7.86 percent in 2003. Even giant Apple is expecting to miss its forecasts as well. Most communication related industries are labor intensive as they usually operate on assembly line methodology. As if this were not enough, a large number of optic fiber suppliers are based in Wuhan. Hotels, airlines, luxury retailers and cruise lines also have been hard hit as much of China — home to some of the world’s biggest spending tourists — is locked down until further notice. As of press time, here are the latest updates: The World Health Organization (WHO) reports 92 cases of human-to-human transmission outside China. Asian stocks fall after Apple warns of low profit.

Passengers aboard the MS Westerdam cruise ship, which was turned away by five countries over coronavirus fears, were allowed to disembark in Cambodia on Friday. Singapore confirms four new cases of coronavirus, bringing the citywide total to 81 confirmed cases. A vaccine for Covid-19 could take 12 to 18 months to develop, according to Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general for the WHO. Hong Kong has reported one more confirmed case of Covid-19 last Tuesday, bringing the citywide total to 62 cases, according to the Hong Kong Health Department. China reports more than 2,000 new cases and 139 deaths, mostly in Hubei province, epicenter of the disease. Infections and deaths continued to climb after the government this week changed the criteria by which it tracks cases. Officials early Saturday reported 2,641 new coronavirus cases and 143 additional deaths in the previous 24 hours. The coronavirus epidemic topped two benchmarks on Tuesday, according to new numbers released by officials in Hubei province. With the 132 new deaths and 1,693 new cases reported by Hubei officials, the global death toll of the virus climbed above 2,000, and the total number of confirmed cases rose to more than 75,000. Jaguar Land Rover has flown in parts in suitcases as the effects of coronavirus take a toll on the carmaker’s supply chain. It said it could start to run out of Chinese parts for its UK factories after two weeks. Russia will bar the entry of Chinese visitors into the country to prevent the spread of the coronavirus outbreak. The suspension went into effect last Thursday at midnight and will impact Chinese nationals attempting to enter Russia for employment, tourism, education and private purposes. In all these, China is adopting harsh measures to address the problem and to limit the effect. The trade giant is deeply committed to reduce anxiety brought by the outbreak as the consequences could be catastrophic. Good work, good deeds and good faith to all. "
,"February 20, 2020",nCov,Xinhua Headlines: Traditional Chinese medicine offers oriental wisdom in fight against novel virus,Xinhua,"WUHAN, Feb. 18 (Xinhua) — Another 1,701 patients infected with the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) were discharged from hospitals Monday, bringing the total number of discharged patients in China to over 12,000 since the epidemic. When scrutinizing the commonalities of those people, the contributions of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) can not go unnoticed. “Western medicine offers important life-supporting measures such as respiratory and circulatory assistance, while TCM focuses on improving patients’ physical conditions and immune function. They complement each other,” said Zhang Boli, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering. Last Friday, the first phase of a sports center-turned hospital began operation in Wuhan, the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak. It is the city’s first TCM-oriented temporary hospital. A total of 800 patients will receive treatment there once the second phase is completed. The medical team of 209 doctors and nurses from 20 TCM hospitals in five provinces led by Zhang have since been carrying out TCM clinical treatment and research at the hospital. The recommended TCM treatment plan includes multiple herbal prescriptions targeting fever, heavy coughing, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, shortness of breath and tiredness. A specific chapter detailing TCM treatment during a patient’s medical observation, clinical treatment and recovery was included in the latest version of the COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment scheme released by the National Health Commission. Wuhan’s coronavirus control headquarters have since ordered integrated treatment of TCM and Western medicine, especially among non-critical patients, and observation of TCM’s curative effects at designated hospitals. Statistics show that 2,220 medics from TCM hospitals and institutions across China have been sent to aid the epidemic fight in Hubei so far. Over 75 percent of COVID-19 patients are receiving TCM treatment in Hubei and over 90 percent in other parts of China. On Feb. 6 alone, 23 patients in Hubei were discharged after receiving integrated treatment of TCM and Western medicine. Zhang said patients with mild symptoms showed obvious improvement after TCM treatment, and for critical patients, TCM decreased their lung exudation, stabilized blood oxygen saturation and reduced respiratory support and antibiotic use. TCM has never missed a single fight against epidemics throughout Chinese history. TCM classics have provided sufficient evidence of how TCM cured epidemic diseases such as smallpox over the past several thousand years. The 2003 SARS fight was a recent example. TCM offered timely and effective solutions to the treatment and recuperation of SARS patients. “Compared with Western medicine, TCM offers highly varied prescriptions to each and every patient based on their unique conditions during different stages of the disease, which is more flexible and targeted,” said Xiong Jibai, a TCM expert and consultant to the coronavirus treatment group of neighboring Hunan Province. Hunan has sent hundreds of medical workers to help fight the epidemic in the city of Huanggang, one of the hardest-hit cities in Hubei. Zeng Puhua, vice president of the affiliated hospital of Hunan Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine, has been working around the clock in the SARS treatment-model hospital of Huanggang since late January. “Clinical experience has repeatedly proven that TCM plays an active and effective role in the treatment of pneumonia-related epidemics,” he said. According to Hunan’s health commission, TCM was used in the treatment of nearly 95 percent of the admitted patients. Among the discharged, over 90 percent underwent integrated treatment of TCM and Western medicine. In the city of Bozhou, eastern China’s Anhui Province, TCM has shortened the course of treatment and reduced medical expenses for seven discharged COVID-19 patients taking herbal soups or capsules. “Patients showed quickened fever reduction after using TCM, and obvious alleviation of certain symptoms such as coughing, tiredness and loss of appetite. Some critical patients became non-critical,” said Zhang Nianzhi, a chief doctor at the respiratory medicine department of Anhui Provincial Hospital of TCM. Discharged patients are required to stay home for another 14 days. Zhang said a 14-day herbal compound treatment based on TCM theories is prescribed to help them restore their pre-illness state. Zhang has planned to include 100 discharged patients into the herbal compound treatment group, to follow their symptoms, physical and chemical indicators, CT results and living quality for one year. Thirty patients have so far been taking the prescription. Non-drug treatment such as cupping, acupuncture and scraping is another feature of TCM, which can help patients recover more effectively after being discharged from hospitals, said Tong Xiaolin, an academician of Chinese Academy of Sciences and head of the treatment group of the state administration of TCM.

,"February 19, 2020",nCov,Passengers begin leaving after ship’s virus quarantine ends,Associated Press,"YOKOHAMA, Japan: Hundreds of passengers began leaving the Diamond Princess cruise ship Wednesday after the end of a much-criticized, two-week quarantine that failed to stop the spread of a new virus among passengers and crew. Results were still pending for some passengers who’ve been tested for the coronavirus that has infected tens of thousands of people in China and more than 540 on the ship. Some passengers said on Twitter they received health check forms asking if they had symptoms such as a headache, fever or coughing. Passengers who tested negative and had no symptoms still had to get their body temperature checked before leaving. Japanese soldiers helped escort some passengers, including an elderly man in a wheelchair who wore a face mask and held a cane. Some passengers apparently called taxis to get home; others got on buses to be transported to train stations. Some people still in their ship cabins waved farewell from their balconies to those who’d already disembarked. “I’m a bit concerned if I’m okay to get off the ship, but it was getting very difficult physically,” a 77-year-old man from Saitama, near Tokyo, who got off with his wife, told Kyodo News. “For now, we just want to celebrate.” An unidentified passenger is surrounded by the media after she disembarked from the quarantined Diamond Princess cruise ship Wednesday, Feb. 19, 2020, in Yokohama, near Tokyo. Passengers tested negative for COVID-19 started disembarking Wednesday. (AP Photo/Jae C. Hong) About 500 passengers were expected to leave Wednesday, and Japanese officials will spend several days staging the high-stakes evacuation of about 2,000 others who were kept aboard the ship at the Yokohama port near Tokyo after one passenger who departed the Diamond Princess earlier in Hong Kong was found to have the virus. The ship, which some experts have called a perfect virus incubator, has become the site of the most infections outside of China, where the illness named COVID-19 emerged late last year. As of Tuesday, 542 cases have been identified among the original 3,711 people on the ship. Even though Japanese officials insist the number of infected patients is leveling off, dozens of new cases on the ship continue to mount daily. On Tuesday, 88 people tested positive; a day earlier 99 others were found to have been infected. Crew members, who couldn’t be confined to their rooms over the last two weeks because they were working, are expected to stay on the ship. The ship’s operator, Princess Cruises, said in a statement Tuesday that 169 people who tested positive recently were still on the ship as they waited for transportation to hospitals. The safety and transport logistics for moving hundreds of people will test Japanese officials. The United States evacuated more than 300 people over the weekend who are now in quarantine in the US for another 14 days. South Korea earlier Wednesday returned seven people from the cruise ship, placing the six South Koreans and one Japanese family member into quarantine. Other foreign passengers were to be picked up by chartered flights sent from Canada, Australia, Italy and Hong Kong. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga defended Japan’s handling of the quarantine: “In the beginning, the United States expressed gratitude for the Japanese side. And there are many Americans who chose to stay on the ship,” Suga said. The US government said Americans who chose to remain on board the ship in Japan instead of returning on a chartered flight cannot return home for at least two weeks after they come ashore. The governments picking up other passengers have similar policies. US officials cited the passengers’ possible exposure to the new virus while on board the Diamond Princess.

Hong) Japanese health officials say the 14-day quarantine on the ship was adequate, noting that all but one of more than 500 Japanese returnees from the epicenter of the virus in China who initially tested negative were found to be virus-free at the end of their 14-day quarantine. Those officials also defended precautions taken on the ship. About 1,000 crew members were told to wear surgical masks, wash their hands, use disinfectant sprays and stop operations at restaurants, bars and other entertainment areas after Feb. 5, when the first group of 10 infections was reported and the start of the 14-day quarantine was announced. Passengers were instructed to stay in their cabins and not walk around or contact other passengers. Those in windowless cabins could go out on the deck for about an hour each day. The quarantine was largely for passengers because crew members kept sharing double rooms and continued to serve guests by delivering food, letters, towels and amenities, and entering passenger cabins for cleaning. Crew members also ate in groups in a crew mess hall. "

Caraballo, TMT","MOODY’S Investors Service has lowered its growth forecast for the Philippine economy this year after taking into account the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) outbreak on the demand and supply chain in the Asia-Pacific. The Quantum-ultra class cruise ship “Spectrum of the Sea” docked inside the Manila South harbor on 16 February 2020. Despite the threat of the COVID-19, the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) allowed the ship to dock at a port in Manila. Photo by: Mike Alquinto The credit ratings agency now projects the country’s gross domestic product (GDP) growing to 6.1 percent this year, instead of the earlier 6.2 percent, it said in a report on Tuesday. The outlook is higher than last year’s economic expansion of 5.9 percent, but lower than the 6.5 to 7.5-percent growth target of the government. Although the debt watcher did not specifically discuss the Philippines, it said it assumed that the economic impact of the Covid-19 outbreak on the region would be limited to the first quarter. “Our baseline assumption is that the economic effects of the coronavirus outbreak will continue for a number of weeks before tailing off and allowing normal economic activity to resume,” Moody’s Senior Vice President Christian de Guzman said. Covid-19, which first broke out in the city of Wuhan in China’s central Hubei province in late December, has spread to more than two dozen countries, infected over 72,500 people and killed over 1,800 others, including one in the Philippines, as of Tuesday. According to Moody’s, the impact would be felt in trade and tourism, and in some sectors through supply-chain disruptions. “This shock comes on the back of a marked slowdown in 2019 as decelerating global trade hit the region,” it said. With this, the credit rater lowered its growth forecast for China this year to 5.2 percent from 5.8 percent previously, “reflecting a severe but short-lived economic impact, with knock-on effects for economies across the region.” Moody’s also expects Macao and Hong Kong to be hit the hardest, given their close economic integration with China. Reduced Chinese demand for Asia’s exports and supply chain disruptions represent the two most direct transmission channels for slowing economic growth, although services trade adds a third channel, it added. As such, the credit watchdog said goods and commodity exporters are most exposed to a protracted fall in Chinese demand, while tourism hubs relying on Chinese visitors would also be vulnerable. “If [the] outbreak grew to pandemic proportions and [lasts for] several months into the year, downside risks to the global economy would be more severe and amplified beyond China through a number of different channels,” it warned. Earlier, the government estimated that the outbreak’s impact could shave as much as 0.7 percent of the country’s GDP if it lasts the entire year. "

Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) chief Caesar Dulay speaks during the 2020 BIR Tax Campaign Kickoff at the Philippine International Convention Center in Pasay City on Feb. 18, 2020. PHOTO BY ENRIQUE AGCAOILI “Early this year, we [faced] some challenges, [which] continue to challenge us. And this [would] probably challenge our economy,” BIR Commissioner Caesar Dulay said during the tax agency’s 2020 tax campaign kickoff in Pasay City on Tuesday. “And for BIR, in particular, we have a challenging year in terms of revenue collections,” he added. As an example, Dulay cited how the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) outbreak would affect business operations of airlines and other tourism-related firms. Airline companies are included in the so-called Large Taxpayers Service of the BIR, which is tasked to collect P1.6 trillion this year. Covid-19, which first broke out in the city of Wuhan in China’s central Hubei province in late December, has spread to more than two dozen countries, infected over 72,500 people and killed over 1,800 others, including one in the Philippines, as of Tuesday. Despite this, Dulay said the BIR would just have to come up with ways on how to offset the anticipated lower collections from these firms. “We will not use this event transpiring now as a reason for not achieving [our] goal and exceeding our gains obtained in 2019,” he added. “We will continue to work with excellence and efficiency, so that the mandate given to this agency will be achieved with the cooperation and help of all,” the Internal Revenue chief said. “For 2020, the goal is for efficient and extra service from the men and women of the BIR,” he added. This year, the BIR is tasked to collect P2.5 trillion in taxes, 7.29-percent higher than the P2.33 trillion collected in 2019. Earlier, BIR Deputy Commissioner Arnel Guballa admitted that the agency expected reduced tax collections from large taxpayers next month as the January 12 eruption of Taal Volcano in Batangas province and the Covid-19 outbreak hurt businesses. He said most of these large taxpayers informed the agency that their voluntary payments for this month would not be as a good as what they remitted in the previous months. "
,"February 19, 2020",nCov,Facing the challenge of Covid-19,Ambassador Carlos Salinas,"The life of a seafarer may be filled with the kind of adventure and excitement of which their land-based counterparts can only dream. On the other hand, that exciting life is also beset with dangers, threats and uncertainties, of which land-based workers have no first-hand knowledge. The year 2019, however, ended with a challenge that is still confronting all of us — sea-based and land-based workers, Filipinos and foreigners, young and old alike. That challenge goes by the name Covid-19. It was reported on February 11 that the virus has now claimed more lives and infected more people than the SARS outbreak did in 2003. It has also spread to at least 26 countries outside China. When faced with something menacing and unfamiliar, there is a tendency for us to react in ways that may result in misinformation and prejudice. Last January 30, when the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak of Covid-19 to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), the WHO’s Emergency Committee issued a statement reminding people to refrain from behavior that “promote stigma or discrimination.” The WHO issued useful guidelines on precautions to prevent the virus from spreading that when you come right down to it, are quite basic rules of proper hygiene. On top of these basic precautionary measures, the international maritime organization (IMO)) has additional advice to ensure the safety of seafarers. Last January 31, the IMO issued Circular Letter No.4204, providing information and guidance on the precautions to be taken to “minimize risks to seafarers, passengers and others on board ships from the coronavirus. Member states are advised to urge all stakeholders (companies, managers, crewing agents, etc.) to promulgate information to ensure that seafarers, passengers and others on board ships are provided with accurate and relevant information on the coronavirus outbreak and on the measures to reduce the risk of exposure if they are likely to be engaged on ships trading to and from ports in coronavirus-affected States.” Last February 4, the luxury cruise ship Diamond Princess docked in Yokohama Bay and was placed under quarantine for 14 days to isolate and monitor the passengers and crew members on board the ship. CNN reported that the ship has a total of 2,670 passengers of which 537 are Filipino seafarers. On February 10, the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) reported that the number of Filipinos on board the ship infected with the virus has risen to five, and the number of other nationals hs risen to 130. The DFA said the infected Filipino seafarers “are now being treated in hospitals in Japan,” including all the other infected passengers. On February 13, Japan announced its first death from the coronavirus outbreak, hours after confirming 44 more cases on the cruise ship. DFA added that Japanese authorities are in constant communication with the Filipinos while the Philippine Embassy is closely coordinating with Japanese officials “to provide them all possible assistance.” Such cooperation is the key to combating the Covid-19 challenge. It is not an exaggeration to say that openness and transparency are empowering. They will make the public vigilant and save lives. Let us hope and pray that this outbreak will plateau and will soon be over. Before I end, I wish to welcome newly appointed fellow IMO Goodwill Maritime Ambassadors, former representative Jess Manalo (Angkla party-list chairman) and Ms. Josephine Francisco (of the NYK-FIL Ship Management Inc.). The IMO Maritime Ambassador Scheme was launched by former IMO Secretary General Koji Sekimizu in 2015 to further promote the importance of shipping and to encourage careers in the maritime industry. I have had the privilege to represent this program for the country, and over the last two years, have endeavored to draw focus on strengthening maritime education; promoting government, diplomatic and industry engagement; advocating gender equality and marine environmental protection; increasing public awareness of shipping; and introducing the significance of the maritime industry to Filipino youth. Much more work needs to be done, and together with my colleagues with whom I look forward to collaborating, it is my hope that we can continue to celebrate our industry and pay tribute to the heart and soul of shipping — the global maritime professional.

,"February 19, 2020",nCov,"China deserves credit, not criticism, for Covid-19 handling",The Manila Times,"IT is unfortunate that political and economic fears have infected the national conversation about the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), and made China and the Chinese people the devils in the epidemic saga because an objective assessment of the situation casts China in a far more positive light. Rather than criticizing the Chinese government for what it did or did not do in the course of fighting the Covid-19 outbreak or demonizing the Chinese people, we ought to give them credit for likely preventing a much greater global disaster. At press time, the Covid-19 epidemic is by no means under control. There have been some hopeful observations that the spread of the illness is “slowing down,” but it may be too early to draw that conclusion. New cases of the infection are appearing in China and elsewhere, and the death toll is still hovering about 100 per day. AP PHOTO Observing how fast the virus can spread should make one appreciate the measures the Chinese authorities have implemented to try to bring the epidemic under control. Very early in the outbreak, China moved to isolate the affected areas and prevent movement of the virus; in fact, the first news many people elsewhere in the world, including here in the Philippines, had of the Covid-19 outbreak was when it was announced that the city of Wuhan had been placed under lockdown. The quarantined areas were expanded rapidly as the disease progressed; China either halted flights to other countries on its own or calmly accepted those countries’ doing so; and most internal travel was halted, as well. This was a tremendous economic and social sacrifice for China, because Covid-19 struck during the Lunar New Year holiday season, the biggest travel holiday of the year. Before the seriousness of the outbreak was generally known outside China, experienced observers predicted that Chinese travelers would make 3 billion trips during the holiday. Imagine what might have happened had the Chinese government not taken the steps it has. For one thing, a considerable number of those 3 billion trips, several thousand at a minimum, would have been tourists visiting the Philippines. The number of Covid-19 cases here could have been astronomical; they have not been, and in fact, have been a relatively minor problem in spite of public fear of the illness. That the Philippines seems to have dodged the bullet, so to speak, can be attributed entirely to China’s early action, and our own authorities following China’s lead — although it could be argued that local measures could have been implemented sooner. China’s battle against Covid-19 is providing benefits to the rest of the world in other ways as well. We are learning a great deal about how to deal with large-scale epidemics by observing the Chinese, knowledge that, unfortunately, will most likely be needed in years to come as new diseases emerge. We are also discovering areas not really considered prior to the Covid-19 outbreak where people are especially vulnerable such as on cruise ships. And although it is a bit of a dubious lesson, the display of bias and animosity toward the Chinese by the public has also been instructive in helping government and the media shape the message about the crisis so that we can do a better job of replacing fear with facts. Are there things that China has done wrong or could have done better? Absolutely. There have been a few mistakes and even the Chinese authorities would likely admit that. It is to be expected that not everything will run smoothly, for any country, when faced with an enormous, completely unexpected and rapidly evolving crisis. It is, after all, easy to make analytical judgments in hindsight. All things considered, China has done an admirable job, and may have saved us all. Give them a little credit for that. "

The Philippines clinched a spot in the men’s division of the qualifiers for the Olympic debut of 3×3 basketball in Tokyo after taking the No. 20 spot in the world rankings with 9,468,741 points on the cut-off date of November 1, 2019. The Filipino squad is set to take on Slovenia, France, Qatar and Dominican Republic in Pool C of the 20-team OQT which will also feature world powerhouses USA, Mongolia and Netherlands. Only three teams will join host Japan and top-ranked squads China, Serbia and Russia in the Summer Games. FIBA 3×3 manager Ignacio Soriano, meanwhile, recently bared that the OQT is still a go amid the threats of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak. “For now, the first reaction is to keep the Olympic Qualifying Tournament in India as it is,” said Soriano during a recent visit to the country for an ocular inspection at the SM Megamall which will be the venue of the FIBA 3×3 World Tour Manila Masters on May 2 and 3.

Now, you’ve done it! Now you’ve broken a lamp, and now you’ve got no one to blame it on but yourself!” Linus: “Maybe I could blame it on society!” If we agree with Linus, then we can dump it all on society, especially the coronavirus that has wreaked havoc not only on health but also politics and sports and other fields where politicians rally support for their advocacies or athletes break records and their backers and fans riot and smash more than lamps in case of a defeat in the elections or in the boxing ring. Many local leagues from basketball to volleyball have indefinitely potsponed scheduled games, with players forced to sit it out and wait for the virus from Wuhan to blow over. Apparently hurting the most are Filipino athletes who had been aiming for glory in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics but who have not secured berths in the quadrennial games. At this writing, only gymnast Carlos Yulo and pole vaulter EJ Obiena are the only two Filipino athletes who had punched a ticket to this year’s Olympiad in the Japanese capital Among the local athletes, weightlifter Hidilyn Diaz and boxer Eumir Felix Marcial have been the two stronger bets for slots in Tokyo, only for the qualifiers in their respective events to be canceled mainly because of the virus that reportedly has killed more than a thousand people in China alone. Unfortunately, Diaz, Marcial and a handful of others dreaming of taking part in what is considered to be the championships of championships of the world have only until June to qualify for Tokyo and the Games opens on July 20. This is where the problem lies for the Olympic organizers. Also at this writing, Tokyo is adamantly dismissing suggestions that the 2020 Olympic Games be postponed, with the hope, perhaps, that a vaccine against the coronavirus would be developed before July. Also, perhaps, Japan, the first Asian country to host the Olympic Games in 1964, wants to be known as also the first Asian country to hold it for the second time. What to do under the circumstances? Maybe the organizers can reduce the number of qualifiers, without of course compromising the criteria for qualification. In this way, the playing is leveled to the relief of aspiring Olympians who have trained for four long years for the chance of a lifetime to compete with the best of the best and emerge better than the rest. But then health is wealth and the coronavirus is a medical issue that the organizers of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics can’t — shouldn’t — sacrifice before the altar of commerce. "

The widening fallout of the outbreak is threatening large public events and damaging output and tourism in Japan. A further spread of the virus could undermine growth and potentially push the country into recession, analysts say. Japan’s Emperor Naruhito waves to well-wishers during a New Year’s greeting ceremony. Japan said it would cancel a public gathering to celebrate his birthday as fears grow over the spread of the new coronavirus in the country. AFP PHOTO Citing “circumstances,” the Imperial Household Agency said it would cancel Emperor Naruhito’s public birthday address on February 23, his first since his coronation last year. The event regularly attracts tens of thousands of people to the inner grounds of the Imperial Palace in the heart of Tokyo. The last time the emperor’s birthday celebration was canceled was 1996, amid a hostage crisis at the Japanese embassy in Peru. Organizers of the Tokyo Marathon, one of the world’s biggest such races, say the 38,000 general participants who signed up for the March 1 race will not be allowed to compete. Instead, the event will be limited to top-level competitors. A total of 176 elite runners and 30 elite wheelchair athletes are registered for the race. A hospital in Sagamihara, 50 kilometers west of Tokyo, said it would stop admitting new patients after one of its staff tested positive for the virus after treating an inpatient who died of the disease this month. Japanese media reported Monday that an additional 99 people on the quarantined cruise ship Diamond Princess off Yokohama have been confirmed to have been infected with the coronavirus, bringing the number of people infected to 454.

The policy took effect on February 10. Instead of queuing to submit the required documents for financial and medical assistance, requirements will now only be received via drop box, which was placed at the lobby of Pagcor Corporate Annex, 1105 United Nations Avenue, Ermita, Manila. Patients who will submit documents via Pagcor drop box will receive text notifications as regards the status of their request. Pagcor’s Vice President for Corporate Social Responsibility Jimmy Bondoc said even with the implementation of the new policy, the agency will continue to prioritize the medical requests of patients who are undergoing chemotheraphy and dialysis. He added that all documents to be submitted to Pagcor must be authentic and complete. “Incomplete documents will not be processed while those who submit fraudulent documents may have to face legal consequences,” he explained. The requirements for financial and medical assistance are as follows: 1) signed request letter addressed to Chairman Andrea Domingo or Pagcor; 2) medical abstract; 3) social case study; 4) photocopy of valid government IDs of patient and relative of patient; 5) contact numbers; 5) email address; and 7) proof of assistance from Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office (PCSO) – Certified True Copy of Guarantee Letter or Index Card. To follow-up on the status of their request, parties are advised to submit a photocopy of their PCSO Index Card/Guarantee Letter, with the patient’s name, contact number, and exact date of submission of request. These information will likewise be submitted via drop box. Meanwhile, Pagcor will again notify the requesting parties via text message to update them of the status of their requests. "
,"February 19, 2020",nCov,The next president should be highly steeped in data and science,Marlen V. Ronquillo,"MARLEN V. RONQUILLO DO you recall a big decision made by government in our contemporary history that was decided by science and data? Do you recall a big decision made by the current government that was decided on the parameters of science and data ? The answer to the two questions is none. A big, big no. Do you know of a scientist and data person with internationally acclaimed credentials and with oft-cited publication and work (breakthrough work in a field of science, not the publications that can be sourced at Avenida/Recto in Manila) who has held a Cabinet rank and is often asked to shed light on important matters, particularly those that involve policies that need guidance from science and data? A scientist-Cabinet member with rock star status? One with the rank of primus inter pares. The answer to all is also this one — none. Most Filipinos do not even know the name of the secretary of science and technology, the present one and those who served in previous administrations. From his many TV appearances, Health Secretary Francisco Duque 3rd is known by many, although not for competence and brilliance. The bumbling, shambling, blundering Duque is supposed to be the lead person in the fight to rein in the impact of the many challenges on the health front, whether these be domestic problems or those grave ones stemming from global pandemics. Duque’s alleged self-dealing was also exposed by Sen. Panfilo Lacson and that gave him media exposure, only of the wrong kind. But what he does and what he says are all suggestive of one thing — the utter incompetence of Dr. Duque. Same with Mr. Beningo Aquino 3rd’s Health secretaries, who bungled the dengue vaccination and who made the Dengvaxia vaccine synonymous with utter bankruptcy and incompetence. The general environment of worry and anxiety over the spreading coronavirus is rooted in the thinking of most Filipinos that the disease prevention front, a Cabinet cluster headed by Duque, is underwhelming and cannot be trusted to do its job well. And that at the very top, no one is cracking the whip for an all-out effort to contain the coronavirus disease 2019. From Duque upward, the perception is one of cluelessness and meandering about wondering what to do. The health situation over the past few years has fueled the sense of worry and fear. Just in August last year, the Department of Health declared a dengue epidemic. A yearend report for 2019 said more than 1,300 had died from dengue and more than 350,000 had been affected. Polio is resurgent, made worse by a measles outbreak. That we are facing a health crisis right now is the understatement of the year and the lack of leadership on the health sector is adding to the national litter. The Congress, obsessed with “pork,” the past Congresses and the present one, has made sure that the total budget of health remains below the 5-percent of the gross domestic product benchmark set by the World Health Organization. This disregard for health investments has been sanctioned by past presidents and Mr. Rodrigo Duterte. A government with no regard for strategic investments, first for education and second for health, is usually a government with no concern for human capital. And that kind of government is usually a government that does not base its public expenditures on science and data. Tragically, we have been having that kind of government throughout our contemporary history. The unscientific spending thrusts of government is the reason why our education sector is on an inexorable march to mediocrity. For the first time, the Philippines participated in the global ranking of 15-year-old students on math, science and the critical skills that matter. The survey done by the Program for International Student Assessment was both tragic and embarrassing for our education sector. Of the 79 countries ranked, our 15-year-old students ranked last in reading and second to the last in science and math. We have to thank the Dominican Republic, a country that has the consuelo de bobo of having many millionaire superstars in major league baseball, for saving us from the rank of pinakakulelat in science and math. (In contrast, not one player from this hoops-crazy country has broken into the National Basketball Association, even as a bench warmer.) While it is true that the education sector gets the biggest slice of the national budget year in and year out, more than 80 percent of that budget goes to salaries and wages and maintenance and operating expenses. Very little goes to capital expenditures and the pork-obsessed Congress would rather fund dubious “flood control” projects than classrooms. The news from Bicol, one of the poorest regions in the country, is heartbreaking. It says 70,000 elementary school pupils, from Grades 1 to 6 , cannot read in both English and Filipino. This is probably the harsh reality in most public schools in the country. And this is a by-product of rote budget writing, budget writing that ignores the science-backed imperative of investing in human capital, first and foremost. There is no science and data that undergirds our investment priorities. It’s about time we stopped electing professional politicians to the presidency. We have been through exhausting cycles of politician-leaders crafting policies without the underpinning science and data. We are vulnerable and helpless against pandemics, of the human-killing or the animal-killing kind. Our education and health sectors are in shambles. Right now, there is this tragicomic optimism — and this is in the area of transport science — that soon, the trip from Cubao to Makati would just take five minutes because of a massive building program. We have never heard of what transport scientists call “induced demand.” That the estimated 11,000 private vehicles added into the metropolitan roads each month will clog the roads sooner or later. Of course, that false optimism is understandable. There is no science in every important public undertaking. And this should change in the next election cycle. "

INCHEON, South Korea: Director Bong Joon-ho smiled and waved at a waiting crowd on Sunday as he arrived home in South Korea, his first trip back since he won four Oscars for his movie “Parasite,” including the award for Best Picture. The crowd clapped and cheered as Bong walked out of the arrivals gate at Incheon International Airport. “It’s been a long journey in the United States and I’m pleased that it got wrapped up nicely,” Bong said, speaking in Korean. “Now, I am happy that I can quietly return to creating, which is my main occupation.” He also joked that he would wash his hands to join the movement to defeat a new virus that has sickened tens of thousands, mostly in China. South Korean director Bong Joon-ho waves upon his arrival at the Incheon International Airport in South Korea. AP PHOTOS “I’ll diligently wash my hands from now on and participate in this movement to defeat coronavirus,” he said. As of Sunday, South Korea had 29 confirmed cases of the new virus, which the World Health Organization has named COVID-19, referring to its origin late last year and the coronavirus that causes it. “Parasite” was the first non-English-language film to win Best Picture in the 92-year history of the Academy Awards, and is the first South Korean movie to ever win an Oscar, stunning moviemakers and fans around the world. Bong plans to hold a news conference with the staff and cast of “Parasite” today, Wednesday in Seoul. The great divide
Kim Da-hye, a 29-year-old South Korean, said that moving into a semi-basement apartment was her least-preferred option when she was looking for a new place to live. But after a rigorous search and a close examination of her finances, she was forced to settle for a “banjiha,” the Korean word for a cramped basement flat. South Koreans are reveling in writer-director Bong’s dark comic thriller, ‘Parasite,’ which won this year’s Academy Awards for best film and best international feature. Bong Joon-ho’s Oscar-winning film has powerfully brought banjiha dwellers like Kim to worldwide attention, thanks to its depiction of two families — one living in a semi-basement apartment and the other in an airy mansion — and the differences in their social status. In 2015, around 1.9 percent of South Koreans lived in semi-basement apartments, according to data from Statistics Korea. It’s an affordable choice for urban dwellers in Seoul, one of the most expensive cities in Asia. The apartments, which are often cramped and sometimes squalid, generally cost between $210 and $500 a month with a hefty deposit. Kim, who moved into her $211-a-month banjiha apartment after leaving her job to take care of her mother, is no fan of her current accommodations, which flood during the rainy season. “During one summer, I left the house with the window open,” she said. “When I came back, there was water all over and the walls were wet.” She says that when she dries her laundry, “the walls get damp and my laundry smells.” Prior to moving in, she was very concerned about the apartment’s toilet, which sits much higher than the floor in order to prevent flooding. “My bathroom has stairs just like that place,” Kim said, referring to the basement toilet in the film that spews out filthy sludge during a flood that destroys the house. “I could slip while climbing the stairs,” Kim said, laughing and pointing at the two steep steps leading to the square bathroom. She joked that she doesn’t attempt to go to the bathroom when she’s drunk. Since the apartment is half underground, it is difficult for sunlight to seep through the window, causing the walls to mold. “It’s easy to see inside from outside and vice versa,” Kim said, adding that her window also invites dust from cars and motorcycles on the street. Mixed feelings
Kim said she has mixed feelings about the film despite sharing her name — Da-hye — with the daughter of the affluent family. “At the start of the movie when an image flashed of a drunkard who was peeing on the street, I didn’t find it funny,” she said. “I felt a bit bitter because (the movie) had moments I could totally relate to. I had mixed feelings because it didn’t feel like someone else’s story.” “I thought it really resembled reality,” Kim said. “(The father in the movie) wanted to climb higher but ended up going lower than where he was before. That’s similar to how I feel about my future.” Juwon Park, AP "

More than 72,000 people have now been infected in China and hundreds more abroad, although the WHO stressed the disease has infected a “tiny” proportion of people outside its epicenter and the mortality rate remains relatively low. The outbreak is threatening to put a dent in the global economy, with China paralyzed by vast quarantine measures and major firms such as iPhone maker Apple and mining giant BHP warning it could damage bottom lines. Trade fairs, sports competitions and cultural events have been disrupted, while several countries have banned travellers from China and major airlines have suspended flights. The cruise ship industry has come into focus as hundreds of people became infected aboard a vessel off Japan. One passenger tested positive after disembarking another liner in Cambodia. The WHO, which has previously said travel restrictions were unnecessary, rejected the suggestion that all cruises should be halted. “Measures should be taken proportional to the situation. Blanket measures may not help,” WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters in Geneva. The WHO has praised China for taking drastic measures to contain the virus. Authorities have placed about 56 million people in hard-hit central Hubei under quarantine, virtually sealing off the province from the rest of the country. Other cities far from the epicenter have restricted the movements of residents, while Beijing ordered people arriving to the capital to go into 14-day self-quarantine. Cruise concerns More than 450 people have tested positive for the virus aboard the quarantined Diamond Prince cruise ship off Yokohama in Japan. On Monday, the US repatriated more than 300 Americans, who now face another 14 days under quarantine. Attention was also turning to the Westerdam, a cruise ship in Cambodia, where many of the 2,200 people aboard passengers were allowed to disembark after all initially receiving a clean bill of health. They were met by Cambodia’s premier, taken on a bus tour of the country’s capital, and allowed to fly around the world. But an 83-year-old American woman was later diagnosed with the virus after arriving in Malaysia. ‘Less deadly’ than SARS The official death toll in China hit 1,868 Tuesday after another 98 people died, most in Hubei. There were nearly 1,900 new cases — a drop from the previous day and the lowest figure this month. Reported new infections have been falling in the rest of the country for the past two weeks. Tedros warned that the trend “must be interpreted very cautiously,” adding that it was too early to tell if the decline would continue. But with the mortality rate at around two percent, the novel coronavirus is “less deadly” than its cousins, such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) or Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), the WHO said. There have been some 900 cases around the world, with only five deaths outside the mainland — in France, Japan, the Philippines, Taiwan and Hong Kong. More than 80 percent of patients with the disease have mild symptoms and recover, the WHO said. “This is a very serious outbreak and it has the potential to grow, but we need to balance that in terms of the number of people infected. Outside Hubei this epidemic is affecting a very, very tiny, tiny proportion of people,” said Michael Ryan, head of WHO’s health emergencies programme. Economic fears Despite the WHO’s reassurances, global concerns persist, with an international inventions show in Geneva postponed and panic-buying in Hong Kong and Singapore. Supply chains of global firms such as Apple supplier Foxconn and automaker Toyota have been disrupted as key production facilities in China were temporarily closed. Apple said it did not expect to meet its revenue guidance for the March quarter, as worldwide iPhone supply would be “temporarily constrained” and demand in China was affected.

,"February 18, 2020",nCov,PSEi rallies after sustaining hefty losses,Jordeene B. Lagare,"LOCAL shares on Monday soared by more than half-percent following a gloomy performance in the past week, with the market cheering on the measures to curtail the spread of the coronavirus disease-2019 (Covid-19). The benchmark Philippine Stock Exchange (PSEi) surged by 0.62 percent or 44.85 points to end at 7,326.85 while the wider All Shares climbed by 0.45 percent or 19.59 points to finish at 4,338.70. Regina Capital Development Corp. managing director Luis Limlingan said Philippine stocks notched a gain as steps are being taken to address the outbreak that first emerged two months ago. “New measures taken in Hubei and Wuhan to curb movements under the new appointed leaders,” Limlingan added. Earlier, Chinese Finance Minister Liu Kun said “targeted and phased” steps in reducing taxes and expenses would be in place to aid entities such as cutting or exempting value-added taxes. These would apply to businesses providing essential goods or logistics. Also, additional funds will be provided to provincial authorities. “Minor gains in several blue-chips allowed the PSEi the end slightly higher despite average trading volumes and more foreign outflows. The general sentiment remains extremely cautious despite the lack of panic selling today,” AAA Equities head of research Christopher Mangun said. Mangun said the majority of investors are on the sidelines waiting for a better environment and that trading would go sideways for the time being. Yesterday’s performance of local shares was a “short-term bounce to test the resistance at
7,400 levels,” according to Unicapital Securities equity analyst Christopher Adrian San Pedro. “In the local front, I expect the investors to go on a wait and see mode as they await the release of the 2019 earnings result among selected index stocks,” said San Pedro, adding investors would also await global updates on the Covid-19. In Asia, Tokyo plummeted by 0.69 percent but Shanghai and Hong Kong surged by 2.25 percent and 0.52 percent, respectively. US markets were closed to commemorate Presidents’ Day. Back in Manila, most sectors ended in the positive territory, with holding firms and industrial gaining 1.35 percent and 0.61 percent, respectively. About 782.59 million shares were traded for P7.83 billion. Winners outnumbered losers, 107-77, while 49 issues were unchanged. "
,"February 18, 2020",nCov,Who’s the best management consultant in town?,Rey Elbo,"WHEN that question comes up, some of us rattle off names, in less than three seconds like a football kicked by a player in a penalty kick, even without having a personal experience with those people. Indeed, it’s not the right approach. Even if you ask for referrals, you don’t usually get the best. Therefore, we should be discerning of the consultant’s capacity and character to weed out those who shamelessly claim to be a guru or sensei (teacher). Guy Kawasaki is right: “Don’t call yourself a guru or an expert. If you are a guru or an expert, people will know it.
If you aren’t one, no one is going to believe you” after that. So how would you choose one that is best suited for your specific needs? Forbes is doing an annual survey with the latest 2019 report showing that “Bain & Company and Deloitte tied for the title of most-recommended consultancy yet again, each earning nods in all 32 sectors and functional areas, but it was Accenture that won the most five-star ratings, garnering 20 in addition to 11 four-star ratings.” However, these consultancies cater to multinationals and are beyond the budget of many organizations. So what’s the alternative? In 95 percent of the cases, if organizations would need new strategic ideas to propel them to greater heights, they would simply hire individual consultants or freelancers who can give the right price for the right amount of service. They don’t go for big consultancies. Unfortunately, many choose the wrong approach. Sometimes, we choose based on the suggestions of social media, unmindful, if not ignorant of the fact that these consultants buy thousands of followers (many are fake accounts) from service providers who sell them at the cheap rate of about $7 for 1,000 followers. The truth of the matter is even if one has millions, if not hundreds of thousands of followers, there’s no guarantee one can reach the revered popularity of Steve Jobs. Bias toward objectivity In theory, we call this approach as “action bias” or the decision made by people who are uncertain of what to do and yet they would want to do something rather than wait doing nothing and suffer adverse consequences. Action bias is what’s being done by medical experts in confronting the ill-effects of the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-2019) that has resulted in more than 1,600 fatalities in China alone. Covid-2019 has no known cure and yet doctors must administer some known medicines to patients, rather than wait for the vaccine or whatever cure that may or may not be discovered. Forming an objective criteria is an action bias. Rather than be swayed by the personality or the popularity of some consultants, it’s better to define first and foremost what needs to be done under the circumstances that is to form an objective criteria. And it all depends on what your organization needs. Whatever is important to you must be followed. This means identifying those important success factors and assign points based on their weight. Therefore, it’s best that you list down those indispensable factors to make things happen. So, let’s discuss some basic considerations here: One, having an impressive work experience with clients. This is a tricky proposition. If you ask a prospective consultant about a list of his clients, he will choose only those names that appeared neutral or those who experienced good results. But how many of these self-serving list compare to those who are unhappy whose names are not divulged? How would you know the truth, in the first place? Two, years of managerial experience in the corporate world. Would you hire a consultant with 35 years working as a clerk in an organization? Conversely, would you hire a consultant with only ten years of managerial experience? The same thing is true for people with doctorate and MBA degrees in the academe who may not have tried working in the real, corporate world. Even a solid experience in government service may not help, knowing how the bureaucratic system operates. Third, even consultant-rock stars have limited expertise. They may be good in one area in management but could be exceedingly a bozo when assigned in another situation. For example, a human resource expert in banking can’t do well in the manufacturing sector or vice versa. Even a so-called professional, say in implementing world-class manufacturing strategies could miss one basic management strategy respect for people. Last, making a decision based on the price tag alone. American quality management genius W. Edwards Deming (1900-1993) said: “Don’t decide based on the price tag alone.” You haveo be intelligent enough to discern why a consultant offers the lowest bid, say at P30,000 per day compared to the average proposals of other consultants at P120,000 per day. That’s because having a low bid is “an obvious anomaly” and “a red flag,” proclaims Charles Piper of Fraud magazine (2012). “Wolfpack” interrogation If you’re looking for a consultant for an important project and a long-term partnership, and you’re willing to pay several hundreds of thousands for it, the best way to go is via a face-to-face panel interview where you can ask hardball questions to test one’s qualification.
Also known as a “wolfpack” interrogation, do it as if you’re hiring someone for a key management position. Who knows? If a prospective consultant is clearly a rock-star who possesses hot skills, then you want to keep him for life to get the best out of him for the benefit of the whole organization. In addition, list down important questions that your team may ask. Having a uniform set of questions ensure that all prospective-consultants are treated with the same hardball questions as the rest. That’s to ensure objectivity. So if you’ll ask me the question on “who is the best management consultant in town?” The answer lies in your hands. If you think that Consultant A is suited for your organization, then you’re right. If you think Consultant B is better for other things, then you’re also right. Just let me know the considerations that pushed you to make that “intelligent” decision.

,"February 18, 2020",nCov,Strawberry Festival canceled,Dexter A. See,"LA TRINIDAD, Benguet: This year’s crowd-drawing Strawberry Festival has been canceled due to fears of the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). Mayor Romeo Salda convened the Strawberry Festival Executive Committee and after deliberation it was voted to cancel the famous strawberry picking activity. The festival was supposed to run from February 27 to March 8. Salda said the decision to cancel the festival was made after a meeting was called by President Rodrigo Duterte regarding the tourist attractions in the municipality. “We subjected the proposals whether to cancel or postpone this year’s Strawberry Festival
to a vote. The proposal to cancel got most of the votes of the members of the Executive Committee. That is why we have no recourse but to cancel this year’s festival,” the mayor added. He said the decision to postponement was decided upon because there would not be much supply of strawberries ready for picking. Strawberry harvest peaks from April to May.
Salda said the Strawberry Festival would most likely push through on June 26, the town’s founding anniversary. He added that the committee hasdlined up several activities such as a public bidding during trade fairs, street dancing, float parade, strawberry lane at the municipal park and concerts, among others. The Strawberry Festival has been one of the major crowd-drawing events in the Baguio-La Trinidad-Itogon-Sablan-Tuba-Tublay area, which compliments the Panagbenga or the flower festival in nearby Baguio City. This year’s Panagbenga was also canceled because of the Covid-19 scare. "

Caraballo, TMT","Overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) sent home over $30 billion in remittances last year, an all-time high, data from the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) showed on Monday. A man counts dollar remittances at a money changer in United Nations Avenue in Manila. PHOTO BY RUSSELL PALMA In December alone, personal remittances — whether in cash or kind and capital transfers between households — reached $3.21 billion, up from $3.15 billion a year earlier and 21.86 percent higher than the $2.63 billion in November. The full-year 2019 personal remittance was $33.46 billion, a 3.9-percent increase from $32.21 billion in 2018. “The sustained growth in personal remittances during the year was primarily driven by the 3.5-percent increase in remittances from land-based workers with work contracts of one year or more that amounted to $25.6 billion from $24.8 billion,” the Bangko Sentral said in a statement. The 6.5-percent rise in personal remittances from sea-based and land-based workers with work contracts of less than one year amounted to $7.1 billion, up from $6.7 billion the year earlier. The BSP said OFW remittances accounted for 9.3 percent and 7.8 percent of the gross domestic product and gross national income, respectively, last year. “Much of the remittances from OFWs were in the form of cash that were coursed through the banks,” it added. Cash remittances rose by 1.9 percent to $2.90 billion in December from $2.84 billion a year earlier. It also surged by 22.34 percent from $2.37 billion in November. In 2019, cash remittances jumped by 4.1 percent to $30.13 billion from $28.94 billion in 2018. “Notwithstanding pockets of political uncertainties across the globe, cash remittances in 2019 remained strong,” the central bank noted. This was evident in remittances from Asia, the Americas and Africa, where inflows grew annually by 12.3 percent, 10.6 percent and 4.8 percent, respectively, it added. “The growth of inflows in these regions more than made up for the 9.8-percent decline in remittances from the Middle East,” it said. During the year, remittances from the United States were the highest at 37.6 percent, followed by Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Japan, United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, Canada, Hong Kong, Germany and Kuwait. “Remittances from these countries accounted for 78.4 percent of total cash remittances during the period,” the Bangko Sentral said. Security Bank Corp. Assistant Vice President and economist Robert Dan Roces said “the latest data shows resilience of remittance inflow as a key contributor to the Philippine economy.” But he warned that remittance growth hinges on the duration and containment of the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak. “The coronavirus is particularly worrisome as nearly a quarter of remittances come from Asia, with around one in six of total remittances coming from Macau and mainland China alone,” he said.

The Philippine Embassy in Tokyo said the number increased after 16 new cases were confirmed last Saturday. Diamond Princess cruise ship, with people quarantined onboard due to fears of the new COVID-19 coronavirus, is docked at the Daikaku Pier Cruise Terminal in Yokohama port on February 16, 2020.

A total of 131 groups of workers, scholars, migrants and other sectors signed the urgent appeal to lift the ban, which was imposed to prevent the spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) to the country. Dr. Maria Rosario Vergeire gives a briefing on the coronavirus disease 2019. PHOTO BY JOAN ARELLANO An estimated 25,000 overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) were not allowed to depart for Hong Kong. The joint appeal was announced during a press conference hosted by Migrante
International and attended by Filipino workers who were stranded in the country because of the travel ban. “We all feel that the travel ban, which was imposed without a warning or consultation, is unjustified and oppressive,” the appeal read. “It was decided upon without a comprehensive understanding of how it would affect us and was not even in line with health protocols set by the World Health Organization,” it added. The groups also warned that Filipino workers based in Hong Kong, could lose their jobs. Filipino students studying in Hong Kong said the ban could prevent them from complying with their academic requirements, while Filipino permanent residents said they could get separated from their families. The groups noted that in terms of health, they would feel safe if they stayed in Hong Kong, given the assurance of improved public health care “at little or no cost to us.” They also said they had been provided with private medical insurance. “The government’s response so far to the crisis brought about by the travel ban leaves much to be desired,” they noted. The groups said the Overseas Workers Welfare Administration offered them P10,000 as compensation, which “would not even pay for the expenses [we]had to bear after being stranded at the airport.” They also said non-OFWs “were given no help at all, when many of them don’t even have houses in the Philippines and have to pay for food and lodging while waiting for the ban to be lifted.” At the news conference in Migrante’s office in Quezon City, domestic helper Eleveneth Baldero feared losing her job because of the ban. “My contract is set to expire on March 6, that is why I’m really worried. Financially, I am running out of money to sustain my stay here in the Philippines. This is why I really need to return back to Hong Kong,” she said. One Hong Kong-based Filipino, Rowena Lee, said her ailing mother in Hong Kong, who was recently discharged from a hospital, still needs medical attention. “She is all by herself. I was only allowed by our manager to spend my leave up to February 28. We hope that the government will lift the ban because we have needs to address and bills to pay like rent. Our family needs us,” she added. As of Monday, the number of patients under investigation (PUIs) who tested negative from Covid-2019 jumped to 453 from 386 last Friday, the Department of Health (DoH) said. “The decrease in our admitted PUIs reflects the department’s strengthened surveillance, assessment and management interventions for Covid-19,” Health Assistant Secretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said in a press briefing in Manila. A total of 453 out of the 591 PUIs have tested negative. Vergeire said 350 patients had been discharged, leaving 171 patients under medical watch. She added that the test results of 22 PUIs are being awaited, while the rest of the patients have yet to submit specimens for testing. Despite the drop in the number of suspected Covid-19 carriers, Vergeire said the DoH was not letting its guard down. “There are still gaps in information about the Covid-19 — the source of the disease, its incubation period and all,” she said. The country is currently free of the Covid-19 after the first and third cases in the country — two women from Wuhan, China — tested negative twice for the disease. Both of them have since been discharged. The second confirmed case — a 44-year-old Chinese man — was the first fatality of the disease outside China. The Health department’s Epidemiology Bureau reported that 221 or 78 percent of the 281 patients who had contact with the first and second cases had completed home quarantine. The bureau also said 45 were considered PUIs, but 31 were discharged, two were currently admitted, six were under strict monitoring and six had left the country. On the third confirmed case, 255 or 34 percent of the 740 contacts were traced, with 155 having completed home quarantine. Seventeen of the contacts who had shown symptoms and were initially deemed to be PUIs had all been discharged, the bureau said. "

The post caused panic among netizens. PNP spokesman Brig. Gen. Bernard Banac identified the suspect as Josephil Brian Consuelo. He was arrested last Thursday. With the PNP Anti-Cybercrime Group’s (PNP-ACG) doing the investigation and verification, Consuelo was traced to be behind the said Facebook post. The fake news was validated by the Regional Anti-Cybercrime Unit of Central Visayas.
UCMed’s Human Resource and Legal Office attested that there was no person in their hospital who died of the virus. PNP-ACG Director Brig. Gen. Dennis Agustin said a case was filed against Consuelo for violation of Article 154 of the Revised Penal Code in relation to Section 6 and Section 4 (c) 4 (Online Libel) of Republic Act 10175 or the “Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012.” If found guilty, Consuelo could be penalized with arresto mayor and fined ranging from P40,000 to P200,000. The court may order imprisonment for a minimum period of four years and one day to a maximum of eight years “per offense”. Meanwhile, PNP chief Gen. Archie Francisco Gamboa denied the fake news on social media that he ordered the donation of the Combat Duty Pay and Combat Incentive Pay of PNP personnel for the Covid-19 response operations of government. “There is no truth to this lie being peddled by certain quarters to serve their own purpose,” he told a press briefing. But the PNP is extending support to the Covid-19 response operations, Gamboa said. The said amount he was referring to, Gamboa clarified, was the remaining balance of funds collected and donated by the PNP last January for Taal Volcano eruption relief operations. Gamboa ordered intensified cyber patrol operations and monitoring against fake news.

This time-tested proverb that means if someone is determined to do something, he will find a way to accomplish it regardless of obstacles is what the Philippine Amateur Track and Field Association is using to make up for lost chances for its athletes to make it to this year’s Olympic Games. With the doors on the two Olympic qualifiers for the 2020 Tokyo Summer Games closed with the outbreak of the coronavirus , PATAFA is throwing its all-out support to four athletes in their bids to earn their tickets to the Japanese Capital through various competitions in the US athletic season. Eric Shauwn Cray FILE PHOTO The four are sprinter Katrina Knott, shot putter William Morrison, pole vaulter Nathalie Uy and hurdler Eric Gray – all members of the national team that won a gold medal each of the 11 the country collected in hosting the 30th Southeast Asian Games. The four are among the five athletes the PATAFA board had certified as having the strongest chances of pursuing their bids for an Olympic slot each. The fifth, marathoner Christine Hallasgo, had already fallen short of the Olympic standard time in her last race in the recent Milo Marathon. Their campaign to make it to Tokyo had been hampered, though, due to the International Olympic Committee’s recent ruling putting on hold both the Asian and World Indoor Championships. “The Olympics is a dream. Competing in the Olympics is every athlete’s ultimate goal to accomplish in their sporting career,” thus, PATAFA training director Renato Unso, himself a Filipino athletic great, declared during the SCOOP Forum aired on Saturday over The Manila Times Television. “We in PATAFA will not allow the cancellation of the Asian Indoor Championships and the World Indoor Championships, which are both Olympic qualifying meets, serve as hindrance to our athletes’ ambition,” Unso asserted. “All four had served our country’s cause in the SEA Games, dapat naman ma-reciprocate natin ang dinanas nilang hirap at sakripisyo in terms of supporting them now,” Unso reasoned out. “After all, our country is to be benefitted, too, if they qualify. National team members pa rin sila at makikinabang din tayo if they make it to the Olympics carrying the Philippine flag,” he said. National head coach Dario de Rosas, who accompanied Unso to last week’s SCOOP Forum, agreed assuring that at least two of the four, if not all, are capable of meeting the Olympic standard. “Their SEA Games performance may be shy of the Olympic criteria even as of now, but that’s understandable,” de Rosas said. “Noon, and pinaghandaan nila SEA Games lang.

,"February 18, 2020",nCov,New Covid-19 cases fall; China buys the world time,Yen Makabenta,"YEN MAKABENTA First word
NEWS and developments regarding the viral crisis have been lately encouraging. The prospects of stopping the virus are improving. Having reported already that President Xi Jinping and the Communist Party of China are being severely tested by the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), I owe it also to readers to report on the new developments. I’ll start with the most significant news, as reported by the Associated Press (AP) and other news organizations. “Reports one day suggest the respiratory outbreak in China might be slowing, the next brings word of thousands more cases. Even the experts have whiplash in trying to determine if the epidemic is getting worse, or if a backlog of the sick is finally getting counted,” the AP wrote in an analysis. “Continuing questions about the new virus are complicating health authorities’ efforts to curtail its spread around the world. And the United States is taking the first steps to check that cases masquerading as the flu won’t be missed, another safeguard on top of travel restrictions and quarantines,” it said. Dip in new cases
On Saturday, February 15, China reported 143 virus deaths and a dip in new cases. China reported 2,641 new cases in the 24 hours through midnight Friday, raising its total to 66,492. Mainland China’s death toll rose to 1,523. The number of new cases was down from the 5,090 in the previous 24-hour period after authorities changed the basis for counting patients. Numbers of new cases have fluctuated, fueling both optimism the disease might be under control and warnings that such hopes are premature. World Health Organization (WHO) Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus urged governments to step up their efforts to prepare for the virus, saying “it’s impossible to predict which direction this epidemic will take.” Tedros told a gathering of international security policy leaders in Germany on Saturday that WHO was encouraged that there has not yet been widespread transmission outside China and that “the steps China has taken to contain the outbreak at its source appear to have bought the world time.” “We’re encouraged that an international team of experts is now on the ground working closely with Chinese counterparts to understand the outbreak,” Tedros told the Munich Security Conference. But he said the agency is “concerned by the continued increase in the number of cases in China,” and by reports about the number of health workers who have been infected or died. Window of opportunity
“We must use the window of opportunity we have to intensify our preparedness,” he added. “China has bought the world time. We don’t know how much time.” China’s government suspended most access to Wuhan, the city at the center of the outbreak, on January 23. Restrictions have expanded to cities with a total of 60 million people in the broadest anti-disease measures ever imposed. Restaurants, shops and other businesses nationwide were ordered to close. The Lunar New Year holiday was extended to keep factories and offices closed, but now officials have been ordered to revive business activity as economic losses mount. Business losses are so severe that forecasters have cut their outlooks for China’s economic growth. Authorities have announced measures to try to curb new infections as millions of workers crowd into planes, trains and buses to return to densely populated cities. Nine more temporary hospitals have opened in gymnasiums and other public buildings, with 6,960 beds in Hubei, the National Health Commission announced. It said 5,606 patients with mild symptoms were being treated. Covid-19, a disease stemming from a new form of coronavirus, has spread to more than two dozen countries. In Japan, passengers have been quarantined aboard the cruise ship Diamond Princess in Yokohama near Tokyo since February 5. So far, 285 people, including 27 Filipinos, from the cruise ship have tested positive for the virus. Japan’s Health Ministry allowed 11 passengers to disembark Friday. Restoring public confidence
The ruling Chinese Communist Party is trying to restore public confidence following complaints leaders in Wuhan suppressed information about the disease. The party faced similar criticism after the 2002-03 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS. The party should “strengthen areas of weakness and close up loopholes” after the epidemic exposed “shortcomings and deficiencies,” President Xi Jinping said at a meeting of party leaders Friday, according to state media. During the weekend, a team of WHO experts were due to begin a mission in China. A WHO official, speaking at the conference in Munich, defended China’s handling of the outbreak. “Some of the rhetoric for me have not been helpful at all. China has a strong public health system,” said Dr. Michael Ryan, WHO’s chief of emergencies. “I think we as the global community need to change our narrative if we’re going to work successfully with China and other countries to stop this disease.” What the public should know
Here’s what AP believes the world should know about Covid-19: 1. What is the new virus?
It’s a never-before-seen type of coronavirus, a large family of viruses that affect both animals and people. Some types cause the common cold. But two other types have caused severe disease outbreaks before: SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, in late 2002, and the Middle East respiratory syndrome, or MERS, which first appeared in 2012. The WHO officially named the new illness Covid-19, reflecting that it’s a new coronavirus that emerged late last year. Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath. While serious cases can turn into pneumonia, most patients appear to have a fairly mild illness. 2. How fast is the outbreak growing?
There’s some confusion about this. China’s tally reached more than 66,000 cases Saturday, a huge increase from earlier in the week. Why? Chinese health authorities say they changed how they are counting. Instead of waiting for a virus test to confirm someone’s diagnosis — there’s a huge testing backlog — they’re now counting patients on the basis of their symptoms and lung X-rays. WHO isn’t sure that’s a good idea, and wants to make sure people with flu or some other respiratory infection aren’t caught in the mix. 3. Is quarantine working?
China has put 60 million people in its hardest-hit cities under lockdown, an unprecedented response. Without a good count of how many people are sick, and when they got sick, it’s hard to tell if it’s working. That’s different from typical quarantine measures, which try to target people who may be at risk. That’s a way to buy time for health authorities to prepare if the virus starts to spread more widely. How to quarantine large numbers of people is a difficult question. The Diamond Princess cruise ship, which has the largest cluster of infections outside China, was quarantined in Japan with more than 3,500 passengers and crew. Experts have questioned if the close quarters have contributed to the spread. 4. Could virus be spreading silently in other places?
In the US, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is starting a new effort to spot this if it happens — by adding coronavirus testing to the network that normally tracks influenza. When a patient sample tests negative for flu, lab workers next will check it for the new virus. 5. How does the infection spread?
Like typical respiratory viruses, Covid-19 spreads mostly through droplets from coughs and sneezes. What about surfaces like doorknobs touched by that person blowing his nose? If the next person touches their own mouth, nose or eyes, infection is possible, like with the flu, but specialists don’t think the virus can survive on surfaces for very long. Regular hand washing is a good way to avoid getting sick from any virus. 6. What about treatments and vaccines?
The hunt is on for both. Currently, people who are seriously ill get standard pneumonia care including fluids and oxygen. In China, scientists are testing some medicines developed for other viruses to see if they might tamp down this one. Several research groups are on the trail of possible vaccines, and one being developed by the US National Institutes of Health might begin first-step safety tests in people as early as spring. But specialists stress it would take far longer — best case scenario a year — to ready a vaccine for widespread use. yenobserver@gmail.com "
,"February 18, 2020",nCov,Armed gang steals toilet rolls in Hong Kong,Agence France-Presse,"HONG KONG: Armed robbers who stole hundreds of toilet rolls were being hunted by Hong Kong police on Monday, in a city wracked by shortages caused by coronavirus panic-buying. Toilet rolls have become hot property in the densely packed business hub, despite government assurances that supplies remain unaffected by the virus outbreak. Supermarkets have found themselves unable to restock quickly enough, leading to sometimes lengthy queues and shelves wiped clean within moments of opening. Alongside toilet rolls, there has been a run on staples like rice and pasta as well as hand sanitizer and other cleaning items. Police said a truck driver was held up early Monday by three men outside a supermarket in Mong Kok, a working class district with a history of “triad” organized crime gangs. “A delivery man was threatened by three knife-wielding men who took toilet paper worth more than HK$1,000 ($130),” a police spokesman told Agence France-Presse. Footage from Now TV showed police investigators standing around multiple crates of toilet roll outside a Wellcome supermarket. One of the crates was only half stacked. Hong Kongers reacted with a mixture of bafflement and merriment to the heist. One lady passing by the scene of the crime who was interviewed by local TV station iCable quipped: “I’d steal face masks, but not toilet roll.” The city, which has 57 confirmed coronavirus cases, is currently experiencing a genuine shortage of face masks. The hysteria that has swept through Hong Kong since the coronavirus outbreak exploded on mainland China is partly fueled by the city’s tragic recent history of confronting a deadly disease. In 2003, 299 Hong Kongers died of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), an outbreak that began on the mainland but was initially covered up by Beijing, a decision that left a lasting legacy of distrust towards the authorities on public health issues. The new coronavirus outbreak also comes at a time when the city’s pro-Beijing leadership has historic low approval ratings after refusing to bow to months of angry pro-democracy protests last year.

NEA Administrator Edgardo Masongsong said one-hour power interruptions might be experienced between April and May. NEA Administrator Edgardo Masongsong. PHOTO BY JOHN ORVEN VERDOTE He added that brownouts are expected because power consumption spikes during the hot months. But the projected power shortage may ease if big events will be canceled because of the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). “Pero kung by summer, April or May, ma-mitigate na ‘yung krisis na hinaharap tungkol sa Covid-19, baka kailangan talaga na maghanda sa possible na shortage ng power (If by April or May the crisis has been mitigated, then we will have to prepare for a power shortage),” Masongsong told reporters. Citing estimates from the Department of Energy, the NEA administrator said red alerts might be raised from April 18 to 21 and May 20 to 22. He noted that an additional capacity of 256 to 821 megawatts would be needed in Luzon to avoid the declaration of Red and Yellow Alerts in the region. A Red Alert is hoisted when there is zero ancillary service or a generation deficiency exists, while Yellow Alert is declared when the reserve power is lower than the capacity of the biggest plant. In a move to alleviate this situation, the NEA advised all 121 electric cooperatives in Luzon and the Visayas to prepare their contingency plans to mitigate the impact of potential power supply deficits in their respective areas. The Manila Electric Co. (Meralco) said it contracted supply deals to meet the energy requirements of its customers. “Meralco has multi-pronged preparations for this summer. In terms of supply, Meralco has ensured adequate PSAs (Power Supply Agreements) for its customers, including the new PSAs that were signed following successful CSPs (competitive selection processes),” Meralco spokesman Joe Zaldarriaga said.

,"February 18, 2020",nCov,Pneumonia forces Elton John to cut short Auckland gig,Agence France-Presse,"WELLINGTON, NEW ZEALAND: Elton John has tearfully apologized to fans after cutting short a concert in New Zealand due to illness, with the British superstar saying he was suffering from “walking pneumonia.” The 72-year-old, who is in the midst of a gruelling world tour, struggled to sing while seated at a grand piano during a performance at Mount Smart Stadium on Sunday night. Elton John After being checked by a medic with a stethoscope, he battled on through two more songs before calling a halt to proceedings barely halfway through his setlist. “I can’t sing, I’ve just completely lost my voice,” he told concert-goers in a croaky rasp. “I’ve got to go. I’m so sorry.” Elton John’s illness comes as health authorities worldwide are on high alert for signs of the novel coronavirus (renamed Covid-19), which has infected more than 70,000 and killed 1,770 in Mainland China. New Zealand has no reported cases of the virus. Video footage showed Elton John, dressed in a powder-blue suit and wearing his trademark oversized glasses, standing at the piano and shrugging his shoulders at the crowd in a gesture of helplessness. He then shuffled off the stage with his head bowed, helped by members of his road crew as the crowd cheered their support. A photo circulating on Facebook shows the 72-year-old British superstar being led offstage. “I was diagnosed with walking pneumonia earlier today, but I was determined to give you the best show humanly possible,” he later tweeted. “I played and sang my heart out, until my voice could sing no more. I’m disappointed, deeply upset and sorry. I gave it all I had.” Walking pneumonia is an informal term for atypical pneumonia, which causes mild infections of the respiratory system, according to the US Centers for Disease Control. It said symptoms include tiredness, sore throat, fever and coughing, and the illness can sometimes lead to full pneumonia, a serious lung infection. Elton John is in New Zealand as part of his “Farewell Yellow Brick Road” world tour, which began in 2018 and is scheduled to end in late 2020 in London. Featuring hundreds of concerts across the globe, it is billed as the last chance to see the star before he retires. The septuagenarian has followed a punishing schedule in New Zealand, not only performing concerts but also slotting in a side trip to sing at the Academy Awards in Los Angeles. At the Oscars, he took home the award for Best Original Song for “(I’m Gonna) Love Me Again” from the musical biopic about his life, “Rocketman.” Elton John has shows scheduled in Auckland on Tuesday and Thursday before heading to Australia for a further seven gigs. The promoter of the Australia and New Zealand legs of the tour, Chugg Entertainment, said the star was resting and the events would proceed. “Doctors are confident he will recover,” a spokeswoman said. “At this stage, all remaining shows will go ahead as planned.” AFP/FACEBOOK PHOTOS "

,"February 18, 2020",nCov,Hong Kong: Aborted relaunch raises questions about the future,Frank Ching,"Frank Ching LAST month, Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam led a large delegation to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland in an attempt to relaunch the island-state, where the economy had slipped into recession after months of violent protests. The timing was unfortunate because the coronavirus threat increased the city’s isolation, with canceled flights. On January 23, the chief executive held a cocktail reception to reassure 200 business and political leaders that Hong Kong was back. But that was also the day that China locked down Wuhan, a city of 11 million people. That act sent a much louder message: The virus wasn’t under control and Hong Kong wasn’t a safe place to invest or even visit. Actually, the disease also presented an opportunity to Chief Executive Lam. She was lambasted for inaction and stubbornness during the 2019 demonstrations over a widely detested extradition bill that she withdrew only after 11 weeks of increasing violence. The health crisis gave her a chance to demonstrate leadership and imagination. For quite a while, the Hong Kong administration didn’t appear overly concerned about the coronavirus, perhaps because the mainland hadn’t taken it seriously. Upon Lam’s return, after a slew of high-level meetings, including with health experts, she raised that same day Hong Kong’s response to the health threat to “emergency,” the highest level. It was a dazzling display of decisiveness. But this, it subsequently transpired, was what Shanghai and Beijing had done the previous day. The chief executive also announced the suspension of flights and high-speed train services to and from Wuhan. This was effectively meaningless since Wuhan was in lockdown and there were no flights or train service from there. It is striking that so much of what she did was a reflection of what was happening in the mainland. Instead of sealing the border, as some of her advisers proposed, the chief executive opted for only restricting entry by residents of Hubei province, of which Wuhan is the capital, a move she called “a very stringent measure.” That move was taken with the consent of mainland authorities. The day after the Hong Kong announcment, the official Xinhua News Agency reported that Hubei had issued an order forbidding its residents to travel to Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan. Many of the mainlanders crossing the busy Hong Kong-mainland border were tourists. the chief executive announced January 28 that Beijing had agreed to cease issuing permits for individual visits, which accounted for 50 percent of mainland visitors, as well as group tours, which accounted for “20-plus percentage points,” thus removing “a large chunk of the source of mainland visitors coming to Hong Kong.” But the democratic camp still demanded the shutdown of all border crossings to prevent further infections. Lam said keeping mainland Chinese out of Hong Kong would be discriminatory and cited the World Health Organization, which had cautioned against travel restrictions that promote stigma or discrimination. On January 28, Lam announced the closure of six of 14 border checkpoints, including all rail and ferry links with the mainland, and argued that the move could be seen as a “partial” border shutdown. To pressure the government into a total shutdown, a union of hospital workers announced February 1 a five-day strike the following week. On February 3, the first day of the strike, the government announced closure of more border crossings. Two days later, it announced that beginning February 8, anyone arriving from the mainland would be quarantined for 14 days, effectively closing the border without saying so. The chief executive, it seems, takes care to align her position with that of Beijing. Perhaps, in her mind, this is what needs to be done in order to safeguard Hong Kong’s interests. But inevitably, to some analysts, she appears to follow Beijing’s lead and to put the central government’s interests ahead of those of Hong Kong. But from her standpoint, this may be the best strategy to get what Hong Kong needs, without unduly provoking Beijing. Thus, the mainland may consider closing the border unacceptable since Hong Kong is part of China. But it may understand Hong Kong’s desire to minimize its exposure and so agree to a14-day quarantine. In due course, the health crisis will end. But relaunching Hong Kong won’t be easy. Internal political differences, left unresolved, will hobble its desire to again become an international hub. Besides, how will United States-China relations affect Hong Kong? As for mainland relations, is Lam’s the right model? These are not easy questions to resolve. Frank.ching@gmail.com "
,"February 18, 2020",nCov,The General Office of National Health Commission Office of National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine,The Manila Times,"Medical Letter (2020) No. 66 Diagnosis and Treatment Plan for Pneumonia Patients Infected by the New-Type Coronavirus
(Trial Version 3) (Part 3 of 3) VI Treatment
1. Treatment venue determined according to the severity of the disease Suspected and confirmed cases should be isolated and treated at designated hospitals with effective isolation, protection and prevention conditions in place. A suspected case should be treated in isolation in a single room. Confirmed cases can be treated in the same room. Critical cases should be admitted to ICU as soon as possible. 2. General treatment
(1) Letting patients rest in bed and strengthening support therapy; ensuring sufficient caloric intake for patients; heeding to their water and electrolyte balance to maintain internal environment stability; closely monitoring vital signs and oxygen saturation. (2) Monitoring blood routine result, urine routine result, c-reactive protein (CRP), biochemical indicators (liver enzyme, myocardial enzyme, renal function etc.), coagulation function according to patients’ conditions, and performing arterial blood gas analysis if necessary, and re-examining chest imaging. (3) Timely providing effective oxygen therapy, including nasal catheter and mask oxygenation, and if necessary, nasal high-flow oxygen therapy, non-invasive or invasive mechanical ventilation etc., according to changes in oxygen saturation. (4) Antiviral therapy: There are currently no effective antiviral drugs. Hospitals can try aerosols of interferon alpha (5 million U each time for an adult, add 2 ml of sterilized water for injection twice daily); giving patients lopinavir/ ritonavir, 2 capsules a time and 2 times a day. (5) Antibiotic drug treatment: Blind or inappropriate use of antibiotic drugs should be avoided, especially in combination with broad-spectrum antibiotics. Bacteriological monitoring should be strengthened, and antibiotic drugs should be applied timely when there is evidence of secondary bacterial infection. (6) Others: Glucocorticoids should be used for a short period (3 to 5 days) as appropriate, depending on the patient’s severity of dyspnea and chest imaging progress. The recommended dose is not to exceed the equivalent to 1-2 mg/ kg/d of methylprednisolone. 3. Treatment of severe and critical cases
(1) Treatment principle: On the basis of symptomatic treatment, hospitals should proactively prevent complications, treat underlying medical conditions, prevent secondary infections, and timely provide organ function support. (2) Respiratory support: non-invasive mechanical ventilation for 2 hours. If that brings no improvement in condition, or the patient cannot tolerate non-invasive ventilation, or airway secretions increase, or if there is severe cough or hemodynamic instability, then non-invasive mechanical ventilation should timely transition to invasive mechanical ventilation. Invasive mechanical ventilation adopts the low tidal volume “pulmonary protective ventilation strategy” to reduce ventilator-related lung injury. When necessary, prone position ventilation, lung recruitment or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), among others, can be used. (3) Circulatory support: On the basis of adequate fluid resuscitation, hospitals should improve microcirculation, use vasoactive drugs, and perform hemodynamic monitoring when necessary. VII Criteria for Removal of Isolation and Discharge
Patients meeting the following criteria can be removed from medical isolation and discharged or be transferred to other departments to treat other medical conditions, if any: body temperature is back to normal for more than 3 days; respiratory symptoms improve obviously; pulmonary imaging shows obvious absorption of inflammation, and nuclei acid tests negative for respiratory tract pathogen twice consecutively (sampling interval being at least one day). VIII Transportation Principles
Patients should be transported in special vehicles, transportation personnel should have proper personal protection and vehicles should be disinfected. IX Nosocomial Infection Control
Nosocomial infection control should be executed in accordance with the requirements of Guidelines for the Prevention and Control of Infection by the New-Type Coronavirus in Medical Institutions (First Edition) formulated by the National Health Commission.

The city’s Botkin hospital filed a highly unusual request for a court order to hospitalize 33-year-old Alla Ilyina after she posted on social media about breaking out of her isolation room, complaining of inedible food and a lack of necessities such as shampoo. The court ruled in favour of her “forced hospitalization” which it said must be carried out immediately. Court bailiffs escorted her to an ambulance after the hearing, local television showed. Ilyina had visited the Chinese resort island of Hainan, returning by plane on February 1. A few days after returning she developed a slight temperature and sore throat. Doctors diagnosed her with “acute virus illness” that they suspected could be the new coronavirus. She was placed in 14-day quarantine on February 6 but fled a day later, according to the local health watchdog. She posted Instagram videos giving details of her escape method and detailing complaints over bland food and lack of fresh air. The hospital’s chief doctor responded by filing legal action to return Ilyina. She has to stay in hospital until at least February 19 and must receive two negative test results before leaving. Her lawyer Vitaly Cherkasov from rights group Agora said she would appeal against the ruling. She told journalists that test results had taken a long time and complained she would be kept in hospital “for as long as they want”. Ilyina has already been back in Russia longer than the presumed incubation period of the virus of 14 days. Court officials did not wear face masks during the hearing, journalists reported. On Monday the same hospital also filed legal action against another woman, 32-year-old Anna Rybakova, who fled quarantine after Ilyina. Two others reportedly also broke out of the hospital but later returned. Russia has reported two cases of coronavirus, both Chinese citizens who have since recovered. On Monday, the Russian embassy in Japan said that a Russian woman has tested positive for the virus on the Diamond Princess cruise ship off the Japanese coast. The death toll from China’s new coronavirus epidemic jumped to 1,770 on Monday. Russia and China share a border more than 4,000 kilometers (2,500 miles) long and Moscow has suspended rail links and restricted flights as well as halting visa-free entry for Chinese tour groups. AFP AFP/CC    "

The 2,048 new cases followed three days of declines but was up by just 39 cases from the previous day’s figure. Another 10,844 people have recovered from Covid-19, a disease caused by the new coronavirus, and have been discharged from hospitals, according to Monday’s figures. The update followed the publication late Saturday in China’s official media of a recent speech by President Xi Jinping in which he indicated for the first time that he had led the response to the outbreak from early in the crisis. While the reports were an apparent attempt to demonstrate the Communist Party leadership acted decisively from the start, it also opened Xi up to criticism over why the public was not alerted sooner. In his speech, Xi said he gave instructions on fighting the virus on Jan. 7 and ordered the shutdown of the most-affected cities that began on Jan. 23. The disclosure of his speech indicates top leaders knew about the outbreak’s potential severity at least two weeks before such dangers were made known to the public. It was not until late January that officials said the virus can spread between humans and public alarm began to rise. People wearing face mask stand at a downtown street in Hong Kong Monday, Feb. 17, 2020. COVID-19 viral illness has sickened tens of thousands of people in China since December. (AP Photo/Vincent Yu) New cases in other countries are raising growing concerns about containment of the virus. Taiwan on Sunday reported its first death from COVID-19, the fifth fatality outside of mainland China. Taiwan’s Central News Agency, citing health minister Chen Shih-chung, said the man who died was in his 60s and had not traveled overseas recently and had no known contact with virus patients. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe convened an experts meeting to discuss containment measures in his country, where more than a dozen cases have emerged in the past few days without any obvious link to China. “The situation surrounding this virus is changing by the minute,” Abe said. Japanese Health Minister Katsunobu Kato said the country is “entering into a phase that is different from before,” requiring new steps to stop the spread of the virus. Japan now has 413 confirmed cases, including 355 from a quarantined cruise ship, and one death from the virus. Its total is the highest number of cases among about two dozen countries outside of China where the illness has spread. Hundreds of Americans from the cruise ship took charter flights home, as Japan announced another 70 infections had been confirmed on the Diamond Princess. Canada, Hong Kong and Italy were planning similar flights. The 300 or so Americans flying on US-government chartered aircraft back to the US will face another 14-day quarantine at Travis Air Force Base in California and Lackland Air Force Base in Texas. The US Embassy said the departure was offered because people on the ship were at a high risk of exposure to the virus. People with symptoms were banned from the flights. About 255 Canadians and 330 Hong Kong residents are on board the ship or undergoing treatment in Japanese hospitals. There are also 35 Italians, of which 25 are crew members, including the captain. In China’s Hubei province, where the outbreak began in December, all vehicle traffic will be banned in another containment measure. It expands a vehicle ban in the provincial capital, Wuhan, where public transportation, trains and planes have been halted for weeks. Exceptions were being made for vehicles involved in epidemic prevention and transporting daily necessities. Hubei has built new hospitals with thousands of patient beds and China has sent thousands of military medical personnel to staff the new facilities and help the overburdened health care system. Last Thursday, Hubei changed how it recognized COVID-19 cases, accepting a doctor’s diagnosis rather than waiting for confirmed laboratory test results, in order to treat patients faster. The tally spiked by more than 15,000 cases under the new method. "
,"February 17, 2020",nCov,Billions lost as tourism industry reels from virus,Agence France-Presse,"Laos: Elephant parks unvisited, curios at markets unsold as tuk-tuks (rickshaws) sit idle: Southeast Asia is facing billions of dollars in losses from a collapse in Chinese tourism since the outbreak of a deadly new coronavirus. From Luang Prabang in northern Laos to Pattaya in Thailand, Hoi An in Vietnam and the Cambodian casino town of Sihanoukville, takings have plummeted as Chinese travelers find themselves subject to a host of restrictions at home and abroad. “We haven’t had any Chinese for 10 days since they closed the road from Yunnan,” says Ong Tau, 47, from behind her stall of fruit shakes in the temple-studded Laotian colonial town of Luang Prabang. “Business is down 20 to 30 percent… It will get worse.” Tour guides, mall workers and restaurant staff are all feeling the burn as Chinese — the world’s biggest travelers — stay at home in the middle of a global health crisis. “My friend has lost four or five big tour groups… they would have paid for his low season,” said Tee, a guide in Luang Prabang, a mass of tuk-tuks standing idle behind him. But in one of Southeast Asia’s least well-resourced countries, there may be one bright side to the sudden economic pain. “We don’t know how to protect ourselves,” he added. “The government doesn’t tell people anything… so maybe less Chinese is a good thing for now.” Loans and job losses
The slump is being felt sharply in Thailand, where tourism authorities say arrivals from China — usually close to 1 million a month — have plunged by 90 percent so far this February. At the Chang Siam Elephant Park in Pattaya, a few hours south of Bangkok, owner Nantakorn Phatnamrob fears he will soon be pressed into debt to float a business, which has lost nearly $65,000 since the outbreak. “People are afraid to visit,” he said. “If it stays like this, I will have to get a loan from the bank.” Crocodile farms and tiger sanctuaries — controversial tourist beacons where visitors can pet the animals — are also deserted, leaving owners to feed expensive star attractions. The outbreak has also spooked western tourists at the height of peak season in what has already been a tough period for Thai tourism thanks to a strong baht. Thailand anticipates shedding 5 million tourists this year, taking with them “250 billion baht (over $8 billion) in revenue,” according to Don Nakornthab, director of economic policy at Bank of Thailand. Things can only get better
With so much riding on the seasonal influx, some Mekong countries are desperate not to deter those Chinese still traveling. Thailand offers visa on arrival for Chinese tourists despite having one of the highest numbers of confirmed infections — 34 — outside of the mainland. In Cambodia, where only one case of the virus has been confirmed so far, strongman leader Hun Sen has repeatedly played down the risk to his country. Still, Cambodian tourism is taking a hammering. Ticket sales at the famed Angkor temple complex in Siem Reap have fallen between 30 and 40 percent this year, while in Sihanoukville, a southern beach resort notorious for its casinos, the tourist take has shriveled. “I used to make $100 a day,” said Chantha Reak, a ride-hailing driver. “Now it’s $10.” AFP "

Buddhist temples, Christian churches and Muslim mosques have been ordered closed since January 29 in mainland China, where the new coronavirus strain was first detected in the central city of Wuhan. Mosques have canceled weekly Friday prayers since January under an order to avoid “collective religious activities.” The restrictions and dwindling crowds in religiously diverse places of worship underscore the extent of the scare over the outbreak that has permeated many aspects of life in the hard-hit Asian region. The death toll jumped to 1,665 in mainland China on Sunday after 142 more people died from the virus. More than 68,000 people have now been infected — but the number of new cases of the coronavirus disease 2019 strain continued to decline. In Japan, where Buddhist temples and Shinto shrines are tourist destinations, a sharp decline in the number of foreign visitors has been a palpable setback. “We assimilate with parishioners and many other people. We know that the talk of the town is really this virus and it’s obvious that many are scared,” said the Rev. Siegfred Arellano, a priest at the Minor Basilica of St. Lorenzo Ruiz or Binondo Church in Manila. Attendance at Masses, Arellano added, “has really dropped.” After consulting health experts, the Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines announced steps late last month to fight the virus. Churchgoers were advised to avoid hand contact and receive the Eucharist, which symbolizes the body of Jesus Christ, in the hand instead of the mouth. In Hong Kong, Tong initially approved precautions that included a choice for churchgoers to watch Sunday Mass online. Those who opted to go to churches were asked to wear masks and told that “singing is suspended,” except for short hymns like “Allelulia.” The new virus is spread through respiratory droplets, according to health officials. Tong later announced the two-week suspension of Masses, saying the move was crucial to suppressing the outbreak, and asked Hong Kong’s 400,000-strong Catholic community not to panic. Masses in Singapore’s Catholic churches have also been suspended indefinitely starting Saturday to contain the spread of the virus. The city-state has reported that 67 people have been infected, including a senior pastor and several members of the Grace Assembly of God church, which has shut down two premises and quarantined all staff. Crowds also have thinned at Bangkok’s popular Wat Pho, a centuries-old Buddhist temple complex known for its giant reclining Buddha. A Protestant church in Seoul shut its doors and switched entirely to online worship services after one of its followers tested positive for the virus on January 30. Other Protestant churches in South Korea have sprayed their halls and rooms with disinfectant, canceled children’s Bible school programs and asked followers to minimize socializing. Hundreds of Catholic churches in the country have halted the use of holy water stoups, allowed churchgoers to wear masks during Masses and discouraged those with flu-like symptoms or those who came from countries with confirmed cases of infection from attending. “The virus can’t dampen my faith,” said Rey Gilber, a 55-year-old father of two, who went to Mass at the Binondo Church with his family. “God is always there and won’t abandon us.” Without a cure in sight, many Asians have turned to faith. Religious leaders across Asia have issued public prayers for the sick to recover, the contagion to stop and governments and international health agencies to find a cure. AFP "
,"February 17, 2020",nCov,Several Covid-19 drugs show promise,Global Times,"SEVERAL antiviral drugs have been applied in clinical trials against the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), and some have shown fairly good clinical efficacy, according to an official on Saturday. Chinese researchers have narrowed down their focus to a few existing drugs, including Chloroquine Phosphate, Favipiravir and Remdesivir, after multiple rounds of screening, said Zhang Xinmin, director of the China National Center for Biotechnology Development under the Ministry of Science and Technology, at a press conference on the new virus. RACE CONTINUES A researcher of Stermirna Therapeutics Co. Ltd. shows the experiment to develop a vaccine targeting the 2019 novel coronavirus in east China’s Shanghai on Jan. 29, 2020. XINHUA PHOTO In vitro experiments have shown that Chloroquine Phosphate, an antimalarial drug which has been widely used for many years, can effectively inhibit the novel coronavirus infection. It is now under clinical trials in more than 10 hospitals in Beijing and Guangdong, which enrolled a total of over 100 patients. Clinical trials on the drug will also be launched in central China’s Hunan Province soon, Zhang said. The preliminary clinical results show that Chloroquine Phosphate is quite effective in treating novel coronavirus pneumonia, he said. Favipiravir, an influenza drug available on overseas markets, has been put in a clinical trial in Shenzhen, south China’s Guangdong Province, with 70 patients enlisted, he said. The initial outcome of the trial shows the drug has relatively obvious efficacy and low adverse reactions. “Three to four days after treatment, the group that takes the drug has a significantly higher turning-negative rate in the viral nucleic acid than the parallel group,” he said. Remdesivir is developed against Ebola infections by Gilead Sciences, an American pharmaceutical company. It has shown fairly good antiviral activity against the novel coronavirus at the cellular level. The China-Japan Friendship Hospital and the Institute of Materia Medica under the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences have been authorized to conduct a clinical trial on the drug in over 10 hospitals in Wuhan, the center of the epidemic in central China’s Hubei Province. “Next, we will make timely recommendations on the Covid-19 treatment according to the results of these clinical trials,” Zhang said. According to him, the researchers scanned more than 70,000 drugs or compounds through computer simulations and in vitro enzyme activity tests, and selected 5,000 potentially effective drug candidates. Then they were tested at the cellular level against the common coronavirus infection, and about 100 drugs were chosen for further experiments, which helped to select the final drugs for clinical trials, Zhang said. The most urgent scientific research task is to improve the cure rate and reduce the mortality, which rely on effective clinical treatments, he noted. New products and technologies have been adopted to treat severe and critically ill patients, a key approach to reduce mortality, and some have achieved good clinical effects, he said. One of the recent progresses is the development of convalescent plasma. It is processed from the plasma collected from recovered patients, which contains a large amount of protective antibodies. So far, a total of 11 severe patients from several hospitals in Wuhan have received the convalescent plasma therapy, with all their clinical indicators getting better and no obvious adverse reactions. Clinical studies on the stem cell therapy, which can inhibit the overreaction of the body’s immune system, have also been carried out to treat severe patients, he added. A cause of death for severe and critically ill patients infected with the Covid-19 is “cytokine storm”, which is an overreaction of the immune system, according to Zhou Qi, an academician with the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). “We are also searching for existing drugs that can curb the appearance of cytokine storm, including drugs against rheumatism. Some of the drugs that are proven effective at the cellular level have been applied in clinical trials,” Zhou said at the press conference. A trial has been conducted on 14 severe or critically ill patients aged up to 82 in an affiliated hospital of the University of the CAS, and the results appeared encouraging, Zhou said. “Now, a multicenter, randomized, parallel-group clinical trial is underway. If the initial results show a drug is effective, we may speed up the process and provide severe patients with effective treatments as soon as possible,” he added. GLOBAL TIMES "

The plane, departing from central Vietnam’s Da Nang, stopping over at Hanoi and arriving at the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou, was one of the three special planes arranged to bring stranded Chinese residents back home with joint efforts of the two countries. Passengers prepare to board the train K4051 to Nantong City in east China’s Jiangsu Province, at the Beijing Railway Station in Beijing, capital of China, Jan. 21, 2019, the first day of the 2019 Spring Festival travel rush. Hundreds of millions of Chinese return to their hometowns every year for the Lunar New Year, or Spring Festival, family reunions, thus forming the Spring Festival travel rush. The Spring Festival, or the Year of the Pig in the Chinese lunar calendar, will begin on Feb. 5 this year. The 40-day 2019 Spring Festival travel rush started on Jan. 21, with 3 billion trips expected to be made.

She and her son came to Hanoi in January for a family reunion but were stranded by a suspension of flights that started on Feb. 1 in the wake of the novel coronavirus outbreak in China. The other two of the three planes flew from Vietnam’s southern Ho Chi Minh City and the central city of Nha Trang to Guangzhou and southwest China’s Chengdu, taking about 400 stranded Chinese travelers like Chi back to their homeland. “The difficulties facing Chinese citizens overseas are of great concern to the party and the Chinese government, and also a priority to the Chinese Embassy,” said Chinese Ambassador to Vietnam Xiong Bo, who went to the airport to see off the Chinese passengers. China has made various efforts and coordinated with Vietnam to bring its citizens back home. With assistance from the Chinese Embassy in Vietnam, 131 residents from Hubei Province, the center of the virus outbreak, took a plane back home on February 3, and a number of other Chinese travelers went back to China through land ports. All the three flights were run by Vietnam Airlines, whose another plane on February 9 carried donations of medical supplies worth nearly $520,000 and 11 Chinese citizens from Hanoi to Wuhan, the provincial capital of Hubei. “We empathize with the difficulties that the Chinese people, especially Wuhan people, are going through, and believe that China will win the fight against the epidemic,” said Nguyen Manh Hung, a representative of Vietnam Airlines.

PUENTEVELLA Felicisimo Ampon, Raymundo Deyro, Johnny Jose, Dungo Brothers, Dominguez, Rafols, and Felix Barrientos were among the last of the Mohicans. Ever since I was a young boy in short pants until I got married, and became a commissioner of the Philippine Sports Commission, I had the fortune to watch all these guys bring pride and glory to our Filipino flag. Davies Cup Games were a must for me, as my late father Jesus Puentevella, who was a national tennis Juniors champion in his younger days, taught me the beauty of the game at the age of nine. Until Cecile Mamiit, who was actually a Fil-Am came around, nothing much happened till now while we agonize watching the Taiwanese, Japanese, and Koreans prominently playing and bringing honor to their respective countries in the Wimbledon, Australian Open, French Open, and the US Open. And all this time, every tennis-loving Pinoy has been asking what happened to us? But now, a star is born. Fourteen year old Alexandra Eala is the granddaughter of Frank Eala, a friend of mine in the sugar industry in Negros some years back, is showing signs now of finally making a breakthrough in the big league. Last week, I finally found time to watch all her games in the Juniors category of the recent Aussie Open and I finally saw a Filipina making waves at last in the international arena. Salute to her father and mother, who was also a former national swimmer, for supporting this jewel stepping up to this long elusive challenge. It is about time. To God Be the Glory. I’ve been blessed to personally watch all the Grand Slams, except for the Aussie Open, (due to the humid weather) and I have dreamt all these years to cheer for a Filipino one day and couldn’t understand why we couldn’t make it especially since everyone remembers fast and shortie Michael Chang, an American Chinese, who won the French Open at the young age of seventeen. And now, the young, unheralded and hungry Chinese youngsters from Mainland China, have also invaded the tennis world. Or even from smaller Taiwan. What happened to us? We used to be at par or even better than Korea and Japan. And they started the renaissance with Nishikori. Luckily, Alex is gifted with the help, too, of Rafa Nadal’s tennis academy in Spain, where I understand Alex has been training. This is where the big difference lie. International exposure and training are essential, not only in tennis, but other sports as well, especially swimming. Dreaming and aspiring for international success in sports are much different now. I can’t wait to see Alex grow and join the top ranks now. And by the way, the Aussie Open women’s crown was also won by a 21 year old girl (Sofia Kenin) from USA succeeding multi-awarded Serena Williams. Next stop is the French Open. Good luck Alex.

,"February 17, 2020",nCov,BIR expects lower collections in March,"Mayvelin U. Caraballo, TMT","The Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) is expecting lower tax collections from large taxpayers next month as the Taal Volcano eruption and coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) outbreak hurt businesses. In an interview late last week, BIR Deputy Commissioner Arnel Guballa told reporters that most of the large taxpayers are informing the agency that their voluntary payments for this month will not be as a good as what they remitted in the previous months. He said these companies are experiencing low order demand, which means that their businesses are affected by the impact of the volcanic eruption and the Covid-19 outbreak. For instance, Guballa added even hotels are complaining that their occupancy rate already declined to only 12 percent. “This will have an effect (on our collections) by next month since tax dues for the month of February will be remitted by March,” he pointed out. As for individual taxpayers, Guballa said the BIR’s tax relief to those people affected by Taal Volcano eruption remains in effect as the agency is taking into consideration that they are still recovering from the impact of the natural disaster to their livelihood. To recall, the agency suspended the deadline in the acceptance of tax returns and payments in Batangas through a revenue memorandum signed by Commissioner Caesar Dulay last January 14. The relief is limited to taxpayers under the jurisdiction of Revenue District Offices 58 (Batangas City, West Batangas, and (Lipa City, East Batangas) that are directly affected by the volcanic eruption. “Of course, these individuals need to recover first. So far as tax compliance, we are trying to be of service for them,” Guballa said. To offset the expected lower collections in March, he added the tax agency is already looking for alternative ways to raise revenues while staying vigilant of latest developments. This year, the BIR is tasked to collect a total of P2.5 trillion in taxes, 7.29-percent higher than the P2.33 trillion it collected in 2019. Of the total 2020 collection target , P1.6 trillion is expected to be collected from large taxpayers. Earlier, the National Economic and Development Authority said its preliminary estimates show that foregone income in Region 4-A (Calabarzon) due to the Taal Volcano eruption reached P4.3 billion. Meanwhile, the agency warned that the impact of Covid-19 outbreak could shave as much as 0.7 percent of the country’s gross domestic product if it lasts the entire year. The government and analysts share view that the virus outbreak could impact the tourism and export sectors. "
,"February 17, 2020",nCov,Conflicting messages on Covid-19 more confusing than reassuring,The Manila Times,"ODDLY, the government was very communicative and talkative about the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid 2019) last Saturday. Three executive departments issued separate and different statements on the virus outbreak. And President Rodrigo Duterte and Tourism Secretary Bernadette Romulo Puyat issued their respective assurances to the public that it is safe and still fun to travel in the country and that tourism activities and mass gatherings can proceed as planned. FILE PHOTO We fear, however, that the effect of all the talking may be more confusing than reassuring because the messages fundamentally conflict with one another. Puyat started the talkfest when she issued a bold declaration that it is still safe and more fun to travel in the Philippines. The secretary gave the assurances after the Department of Health (DoH) recommended the cancellation of big events and other mass gatherings in order to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus. Speaking to reporters, Puyat said that a joint memorandum circular from the Department of Tourism, DoH and the Department of the Interior and Local Government would be released to encourage local government units (LGUs) to pursue events despite public fears over Covid-19. “We also agreed among ourselves regarding the fiestas, events, celebrations. We agreed we’ll be implementing a joint circular among the three agencies that [it is still possible to hold such activities] as long as precautionary measures are implemented,” she said. “We want to assure you that all our stakeholders in the tourism industry have already implemented all these precautionary measures even before the temporary ban [took effect], so it’s safe,” Puyat added. Several LGUs and other groups have decided to forgo activities with large crowds to reduce the risk of virus transmission. The DoH earlier advised the public to avoid crowded places to prevent risk of health concerns caused by the virus. Then President Duterte weighed in with his own message: he encouraged the people to travel with him around the Philippines. In a taped video message uploaded on Friday, the President said: “To my fellow Filipinos, I encourage you to travel with me around the Philippines. I assure you that everything is safe in our country, be it an issue of health, be it an issue of law and order, and be it an issue of accessibility.” The problem with all the talk of safety and fun, is that it looks premature and smug when viewed against the reality of the viral outbreak worldwide and in the country. Based on its latest data, the Health department said 455 people were still under monitoring for possible Covid-19 infection. Three-hundred-eighty-six patients, or 85 percent, however, have tested negative. Filipinos have expressed fears over a possible Covid-19 epidemic in the country after the government confirmed three cases of the new coronavirus. Three Chinese from Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the virus outbreak, who traveled to the Philippines had tested positive for Covid-19. One died while the other two have already recovered. As of Saturday, the death toll from the epidemic had jumped to 1,526. More than 66,000 people have now been infected with Covid-19 in China. Several countries have banned arrivals from China and major airlines have cut services with the country. But the epidemic has continued to spread across China and hundreds of cases have emerged in more than two dozen countries The hardest reality of all is that all Covid-19 fatalities up to now are Chinese, most of them traveling inside China, and only one was non-Chinese. This reality conflicts with Secretary Puyat’s evident desire to resume full-speed tourism from China in order to sustain the pace of tourism arrivals. There is still not a single fatality among non-Chinese, it was noted. The secretary should not tempt the fates with her smug reasoning. "

,"February 17, 2020",nCov,"Quakes, viruses, eruptions and retribution",Fr. Ranhilio Callangan Aquino,"FR. RANHILIO CALLANGAN AQUINO FIRST there was a frightening succession of strong temblors in Southern Philippines sending scared folk out of their homes into what they thought were safety zones, where they continued to be harried by aftershocks. Till today, no sufficiently satisfactory (and intelligible) explanation has been offered for what seemed to a frightened many to be the dreadful prelude to the end of times. This was followed by Taal’s almost unexpected tantrums and its awesome if destructive display of light, sound and a more than generous sprinkling of ashes. There ensued the usual problems of evacuating especially those who refused to be evacuated, and of keeping healthy those who had heeded the government’s advice to move to refugee centers. The embers of the problem remain, for many have returned to what used to be their homes to find only unsalvageable remnants and irreparable loss. Closely following in the heels of this disaster was a new strain of an epidemic — aptly labeled “novel coronavirus.” And while blame was once more heaped on one unable to defend itself — the bat, or some other exotic creature — the more vexing question for me is why we, so abundantly blessed by God in his munificence, with so much to eat, should still conduct culinary excursions into caves, lairs, webs and burrows for humble creatures who cause and mean us no harm! Now, anyone who sneezes or whizzes aboard public transport, or worse, blows his nose, is met with the angry stares of fellow passengers and possibly marked out for liquidation at a propitious time! The history of religion has ample lessons about the development and cultivation of devotion — novenas to saints, pilgrimages, the construction of churches and shrines, the conjuring of rites — and the debilitating misfortunes that afflict humankind. It is that helplessness so very movingly captured by A. Camus in The Plague that drives the devout to seek assurance elsewhere against whatever may lie in hiding, waiting to spring its death-dealing and ugly surprise on an unsuspecting population. But it is also what persons do with their faith and with religion in times of plague and pestilence and anguish that can give devotion and belief a bad name. There is, first of all, the rather primitive belief that an angry God must be placated. With this brand of superstition, I have no sympathy and little patience, because its image of God is that of a petulant autocrat, scourge in hand, waiting to wield it on the bare backs of prostrate slaves when he is not sufficiently pleased with their flattery. We do not need any such God. We have enough authors and perpetrators of misery and cruelty as it is. The more popularly peddled superstition these days has a holy God exacting retribution on an unholy and sinful people. Once more the concept of deity that this belief supposes is infantile and ridiculous. What will the sight of his suffering people, their moans and the gnashing of their teeth, add to the glory of this God? And can his holiness not be left in tatters after having delighted in punishing his erring people? One version of this peddled stupidity blames apparently undiminished support for Digong as the national sin that has invited divine retribution. Digong or no Digong, what has to mature is our concept of God and his relation to the universe. Einstein is often quoted as having said that “God does not play dice with the universe.” God’s name, in the tradition of the great religions, is associated with creation, redemption and final fulfillment. What all too often has happened is that we have fashioned our own idols — images of God in our petty likeness: petty, vengeful, forever awaiting flattery and favor. Unless we are willing to be iconoclasts in this respect, we may still be guilty of that sin for which God constantly blamed his people: idolatry. And given its often deleterious, very practical concomitants, religion of this kind may yet be a terrible scourge on humanity’s back! rannie_aquino@csu.edu.ph

,"February 17, 2020",nCov,The odd war with WHO’s battle against Covid-19,Dan Steinbock,"DAN STEINBOCK In the past few weeks, countries outside China did not send adequate case reports to the World Health Organization (WHO) in time, while media suffered an ‘infodemic’ (PH was no exception). Instead of battling the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), WHO and its chief were targeted. IN the Philippines as elsewhere outside China, the greatest current public-health concern is to avoid any possible emergence of secondary virus clusters. Recently, this critical task has been complicated by misguided media coverage and attacks against the WHO, China and people of Chinese descent rather than the virus. Initially, the Philippines was not immune to these headwinds, as evidenced by a set of debacles, particularly in the country’s foreign-owned media and social media. However, the country’s leadership quickly condemned such coverage. Infodemic vs epidemic
Last Saturday, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus urged global leaders to stop stigma and hate amid the virus outbreak. His comments in Munich followed reports that people of Asian descent have faced discrimination amid virus fears. “We will all learn lessons from this outbreak,” he added, “but now is not the time for reclamations or politicization.” At the end of January, the WHO declared the ongoing virus outbreak a “public health emergency of international concern” (Pheic). As WHO made clear, the Pheic was not motivated by China, but the possible effects of the virus, if it would spread to countries with weaker healthcare systems. At WHO, the concern was compounded when terms, such as “virus outbreak”, “epidemic” and “pandemic,” got blurred even in reputable international media. Tabloid hysteria contributed to ugly instances of xenophobia, even racism against people of Chinese and Asian descent, while leading to bullying in schools, colleges, even universities. The misinformation on a global scale compelled the WHO to declare the Covid-19 an ‘infodemic” on February 2. Since international media seemed to be shunning its responsibility to correct myths and rumors, WHO had to allocate some of its scarce resources to do the job. Stunningly, it took until mid-February for some of the world’s largest technology companies — including Google, Amazon and YouTube — to get together, when WHO hosted a Silicon Valley meeting to discuss how to tamp down on misinformation about the virus. In the concurrent weeks, the struggle against Covid-19 has gone hand in hand with a battle against the WHO and its executives. WHO and its chief targeted
Since late January, almost 380,000 people have signed an online petition to the United Nations for the WHO chief to resign because he allegedly “solely believes” Chinese outbreak data. In contrast to allegations, WHO chief Dr. Tedros Ghebreyesus has initiated a review process to study the causes of the virus, while stressing adherence to WHO guidelines regarding pandemics. The smear campaign is an ugly déjà vu. In 2017, Dr Tedros, a high-level Ethiopian health executive, succeeded Margaret Chan as the WHO chief. While he was considered highly qualified for the job and an innovative reformer in Ethiopia, his candidacy was attacked at the eve of the WHO election, when odd stories surfaced about an alleged cover-up of cholera epidemics in Ethiopia. Reportedly, the allegations came from Lawrence Gostin, a US law professor who advised the rival UK candidate (and has recently resurfaced as a critic of China’s virus struggle). In the UN, the African Union dismissed the allegations as an “unfounded and unverified defamation campaign.” Yet, once again, the old smear campaign stories have been recycled in media. When attacks against Dr. Tedros went nowhere, international spotlight focused on WHO Infections Hazards Director Dr. Sylvia Briand when she stated in early February that “we are not in a pandemic.” Then she became a target for criticism. To avoid political intrigues, WHO’s pandemic declaration requires strong evidence and relies on a tested six-stage classification. The last pandemic was the 2009 H1N1 flu outbreak (swine flu), which is estimated to have killed around 150,000 to 300,000 people around the world. In contrast, Covid-19 has so far resulted in four deaths outside China, despite weeks of diffusion. Slow to provide reports
In the early 2000s, China’s efforts to control the severe acute respiratory syndrome were criticized as the disease spread internationally before the global outbreak was subdued. A decade later, Chinese response to the avian influenza (H7N9) was significantly faster, broadly praised and the disease did not spread widely. With Covid-19, as Dr Tedros has stated, China should be credited with identifying the virus in “record time,” sharing its genetic sequence quickly, and flagging potential international spread. Yet, there is a strange discrepancy in the international coverage of the Covid-19. This coverage has systematically focused on China’s alleged conduct, while ignoring the actual conduct of many other influential WHO member states. This discrepancy prevails even today, despite the news bomb of February 4, when WHO chief Tedros said that it was not China, but countries outside China that had proved slow in sharing complete information about cases. WHO was particularly concerned about the fact that, even after almost a month of international crisis and global alert, it had received complete case reports for only 38 percent of the cases. In other words, a whopping three of five member countries had failed to provide adequate information to WHO in a timely manner. Those reports were vital to the global organization so that it could assess the true international scope of the outbreak, while broadening and deepening containment efforts. “I don’t think it’s because they lack capacity,” Tedros stated pointedly about these WHO members. It would be ideal, he added, if WHO would receive the most up-to-date information not just from China, but the rest of the world. It was only after Tedros’s public statement that some member states began to share data with WHO. Meanwhile, precious time had been lost. Politicization of outbreak
Even though these lost opportunities could result in potential secondary Covid-19 outbreaks outside China, international media has not yet asked the tough questions about the belated international cooperation outside China. Instead of focusing on the need for international cooperation, international coverage has produced a series of headlines against the WHO. On February 5, a day after Tedros had urged countries to provide complete case reports, the Financial Times (FT) reported that the influential WHO emergency committee member and veteran professor John Mackenzie “hit out at Beijing’s ‘reprehensible’ response,” and “accused China of not reporting coronavirus cases fast enough.” The charge was not publicly supported by other committee members, nor by WHO executives. Moreover, the FT neglected to mention that the highly qualified Mackenzie also serves in Australian government’s Indo-Pacific Centre for Health Security, which plays a role in the US-led Indo-Pacific initiative aiming to contain China’s rise, and is the co-chair of a major nongovernment organization, whose key partners include the Pentagon’s Defense Threat Reduction Agency, which compete “against Chinese influence.” The tone of international coverage, even in the reputable media, still hasn’t changed. On February 13, the Wall Street Journal released a new front-page story, “WHO criticized for virus response,” that broadened the WHO criticism. It relied in part on critical quotes by both Mackenzie and Lawrence Gostin, the China critic who had tried to undermine Tedros’ candidacy at WHO. Free media has a right to critical views, but not to the lack of relevant context. Like other interviewees, both were portrayed as independent, disinterested, neutral observers. Furthermore, all interviewees represented experts from the US or its allies. Not a single major Chinese health expert was interviewed. Recently, the pattern has been typical to even reputable international dailies. Such purposeful selectivity fosters an impression that legitimate expertise is limited mainly to the critics of WHO. Throughout the ongoing virus outbreak, Dr Tedros has admirably sought to foster an international battle against Covid-19, while garnering funds against future epidemics. “The virus is a common enemy,” he says. “Let’s not play politics here.” As the Covid-19 cases could exceed 100,000 in a week or two and global resources should be focused on avoiding secondary outbreak clusters outside China, it is the virus that international cooperation and coverage should attack — not the WHO.

,"February 17, 2020",nCov,A letter from Macau,Emeterio SD. Perez,"The common shares issued by ABS-CBN Holdings Corp. are publicly traded, meaning the general public buy and sell its shares, either preferred or common, listed on the Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE). The suggestion here is for the readers of The Manila Times to differentiate between ABS-CBN Holdings and ABS-CBN Corp. The former, which is ABS-CBN Holdings, holds Philippine Depositary Receipts, which, in turn, are converted into common shares of ABS-CBN Corp. The conversion, though, may be a complicated process that Solicitor-General Jose Calida may want to engage himself in arguing what this process is all about. The public should be the judge if President Rodrigo Duterte does not know about his filing of the case against ABS-CBN, the stock corporation, with the Supreme Court. According to PSE’s website, ABS-CBN Holdings has 324,841,900 outstanding common shares out, which are all listed, which, again, means they are among the listed stocks that are being traded by the general public. In a public ownership report (POR) as of Dec. 31, 2019 but posted on the PSE on Jan. 15, 2020, ABS-CBN Holdings attributed to its public stockholders their ownership of 305,153,812 common shares, or 99.46 percent of 306,806,300 outstanding common shares. Of the outstanding, three directors directly owned 1,652,488 common shares, or 0.53 percent. They were Oscar M. Lopez, direct owner of 371,607 common shares, or 0.12 percent; and Manuel M. Lopez, 1,280,881 common shares. Eugenio Lopez 3rd, Jose C. Vitug and Antonio Jose U. Periquet did not own either directly or indirectly any of ABS-CBN Holdings’ common shares. ABS-CBN Holdings, according to the POR, did not have principal stockholders because of the public stockholders’ ownership of common shares equivalent to 99.46 percent. On Feb. 14, 2020, ABS-CBN Holdings’ common shares opened trading at P14.86, hit a high of P15.60, dropped to a low of P14.84 and closed the day’s session at P15.60. The stock peaked at a 30-day high of P18.60 and fell to a 30-day low of P14.54. * * * As of Dec. 31, 2019, the public stockholders of Universal Robina Corp. (URC) owned 2,204,161,868 common shares, or 44.69 percent of 2,294,161,868 outstanding common shares, according to the company’s POR. The POR credited two of URC’s eight directors with direct ownership of 545,547 URC common shares, or 0.025 percent. These were Lance Y. Gokongwei, 500,001 common shares, or 0.02 percent; and Patrick Henry C. Go, 45,540 or 0.0021 percent. The other six members of URC’s eight-person board were credited with a nominal URC common share each while eight of 18 executives were direct stockholders, who combined for ownership of 807,820 URC common shares, or 0.03 percent. JG Summit Holdings Inc. is the lone principal stockholder of Universal Robina. It directly owned 1,215,223,061 common shares, or 55.13 percent, according to the POR. Two of JG Summit’s affiliates directly owned 2,618,199 common shares, or 0.12 percent. These were Litton Mills Inc., 2,237,434 URC common shares, or 0.1 percent; and JG Summit Capital Services Corp., 380,765 URC common shares, or 0.02 percent. Asiatrust Bank is also a URC stockholder with direct ownership of 10,373 common shares, or 0.005 percent of outstanding. On Feb. 14, 2020, URC common shares opened trading at P150, which were also their high, dropped to a session’s low of P148.40 and closed the day at P149. The stock peaked at a 30-day high of P163.40 and fell to a 30-day low of P139.10. * * * As of Jan. 31, 2020, Philippine Savings Bank (PSB) reported having 383,109,416 outstanding common shares. It had no treasury shares, according to the bank’s POR. It credited the public with owning 40,496,757 common shares, or 10.57 percent of outstanding. The other PSB stockholders were as follows: one of nine directors directly held 4,002,569 common shares, or 1 percent, which when computed equals 1.045 percent of outstanding. As a subsidiary of Metropolitan Bank and Trust Co. (MBTC), PSB reported MBTC as direct holder of 338.610 million common shares, or 88.38 percent. The POR filing also said its nine-person board are direct holders of 4,002,569 PSB common shares, or 1.04 percent. As of Jan. 31, 2020, PSB said MBTC’s affiliates, the government and banks did not own common shares, according to the bank’s POR.

I received an email from one Jafet Michael Dela Cruz. The contents of his email are self-explanatory. “Sana matulungan ninyo po kaming maipaabot ang aming hinaing sa Pangulo (I wish you can help us in informing President Rodrigo Duterte of our plight). “More than hundred people po OFW [overseas Filipino worker]/tourist Filipino ang stranded po dito sa Macau.

PHOTO BY JOHN ORVEN VERDOTE Makati Mayor Abby Binay has placed all city health and rescue personnel on high alert as the city rolled out protective measures in response to the global health emergency caused by the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Health personnel are using infrared thermometers to scan city employees and visitors entering City Hall as well as barangay health centers. Rescue, engineering and health personnel have started work to convert the city’s Friendship Suites, initially used as a hostel, into an isolation facility for those found positive with nCov. The City Administrator, acting on the mayor’s orders, has directed all business and commercial establishments, including POGOs, to immediately submit to the city the list of all employees who have recently visited mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau. The business permits of those who fail to comply will be revoked. These are among the initial measures undertaken by a Task Force created by virtue of an executive order signed by the mayor. “This global health emergency compels us to institute long-term solutions that will strengthen our capability to effectively respond to similar crises in the future. Our immediate concern now is to put in place needed systems, protocols and resources to ensure we are covering all the bases in preventing the transmission and spread of the novel coronavirus in the city,” Mayor Abby said.

,"February 17, 2020",nCov,‘nCoV-20’ for OFWs,Crispin R. Aranda,"CRISPIN R. ARANDA LAST week, the novel coronavirus that started from China in the Year of the Rat had already claimed 1,383 lives and infected at least 64,000 people. At home, three confirmed cases and a death have been reported. To blunt the stigma of the previous tag of novel coronavirus disease (19-nCoV), the World Health Organization (WHO) reclassified the disease as Covid-19. The epidemic has brought China almost to a standstill as the country undergoes a structural slowdown. The spillover effects are sending financial shivers to the First World countries relying on China for materials and reliable product output. In addition, the repatriation of workers from China as well as Filipino crew members in the unwanted cruise ship Diamond Princess are seen as potential contributory factors to reduced remittances for 2020. Manufacturing recovery is not expected soon. Even as the Chinese Communist Party declared a return to workday, Beijing’s malls and other outlets in Hubei province see only a few shoppers. The Washington Post quoted a convenience store owner as saying, “we’re lucky to see more than 20 people in an hour.” Alternative migration destinations
When a health specter or political conflict occurs in regions where there are significant numbers of overseas Filipino workers (OFWs), the search for alternative migration destinations resurfaces. Unless an OFW has a pending immigrant visa petition in the US or the potential of being sponsored by a qualified family member or a recognized employer, the OFWs cast their collective gaze towards Canada, Australia or New Zealand. The United Kingdom is also being considered since the UK and Ireland are English-speaking countries. But the stigma of Brexit, the uncertainty of qualifying for settlement even after working for five years (the mandatory minimum before an OFW may qualify for indefinite leave to remain status) puts the UK at the bottom end of the migration totem pole. Skilled workers overseas — including OFWS — may opt to enter the immigrant selection system of Canada (Express Entry), Australia (SkillSelect) and New Zealand (Expression of Interest). Most OFWs may meet the minimum criteria and earn sufficient points to be part of the candidate selection pool: 67 for Canada; 65 for Australia and 100 for New Zealand. To be invited to apply for permanent residency, however, an OFW candidate in the pool must score at least 90 to be taken out of the SkillSelect pool; 160 from NZ’s EOI and 471 from Canada’s Express Entry. Taking up further studies in these countries improve the chances of being selected since international students are allowed to work part-time while studying. Full-time work is allowed during school breaks. Such an exposure to employers enhance the probability of getting a job offer (which boosts a candidate’s ranking in the pool) Most OFWs would rather work than study again. The key is getting a job offer. Since international students are readily available, an employer in Canada, Australia or New Zealand would give candidates in the pool the first shot at residency or employment. Never fear or lose hope
Hope resides in the approved job orders of licensed recruitment agencies in the POEA website. The official websites of Australia and New Zealand for example shows which trade or occupations are in short supply and therefore, a job offer in such an occupation is more likely available. Australia has the Medium and Long-term Strategic Skills Shortage List (MLTSSL) as well as the Short-term Skilled Occupation List (STSOL), the Regional Occupation List (ROL) or the Regional Sponsored Migration Scheme (RSMS) ROL List. Employer-sponsored visas such as the Temporary Skill Shortage visa, Skilled Regional (Provisional), Skilled Work Regional and the Skilled Employer Sponsored Regional (Provisional) visas allow an OFW to say in Australia for from three to five years then become eligible to apply for permanent residency. To get a job offer, an OFW may apply directly with an Australian employer’s website. As stated earlier though, employers have the luxury of getting prequalified candidates in the SkillSelect pool or offer international students part-time jobs preparatory to hiring them full-time after course completion. Then, there’s the list of approved job orders with the POEA. If permanent residency is being contemplated later, then the OFW must check whether his or her occupation is on any of the aforementioned Australia’s lists. Since Australia and New Zealand share the same occupational classification, NZ may be considered first because NZ’s Long Term and Skills Shortage List (LTSSL) has a specific and shorter list of occupations for skilled OFWs who may have completed a degree or diploma a notch below the bachelor’s degree. NZ points indicator for skilled migrants
An OFW who gets a job offer and completes a one- to two-year contract may then apply for permanent residency through New Zealand’s Expression of Interest in the skilled migrant category. The points computation below is a guide only. NZIS emphasizes that “only an immigration officer can award the claimed points during their assessment of a skilled worker’s visa application” The points earned for the specific criteria are the ones in effect on and after Aug. 28, 2017. – 30 points for 30 years of age (age range 20 to 39 years old) – 50 points for having 2 years of work in New Zealand after being sponsored by an accredited NZ employer – 10 points if the occupation is on NZ’s Long Term Skills Shortage List (LTSSL) and worker meets the requirements for that occupation – 30 points if the job is outside of Auckland – 40 points for a recognized qualification (worker’s academic qualifications in the Philippines is Level 3-6) To get the points for this criterion, a New Zealand registration authority’s assessment is needed. – 20 points for 4 years of skilled work experience (obtained in or outside New Zealand) – 10 points for work experience gained in New Zealand – 10 points if the work experience in New Zealand (2-5 years) is in an occupation that is on the LTSSL The total points potential for this OFW would be 200, over and above the threshold point required (160) to be invited to apply for permanent residency. At the time of writing, the following trade occupations are on NZ’s LTSSL (note the ANZCO code following the occupation and the NZQF level required): – Automotive electrician (321111) A certificate at NZQF Level 4, or a higher qualification, which includes the credit and knowledge requirements of one of the strands of the New Zealand Certificate in Automotive Electrical Engineering (NZQF Level 4). – Diesel motor mechanic (including heavy vehicle inspector) (321212) A certificate at NZQF Level 4, or a higher qualification, which includes the credit and knowledge requirements of the New Zealand Certificate in Heavy Automotive Engineering (NZQF Level 4) and a minimum of three years’ relevant post-qualification work experience. – Electrician (general) (341111) NZ registration as an electrician or a limited certificate as an electrician from the Electrical Workers Registration and – Electric line mechanic (342211) NZ registration as a line mechanic or a limited certificate as a line mechanic from the Electrical Workers Registration Board. An OFW may simply want to work — without considering permanent migration later — so the POEA website for approved job orders maybe consulted other than an Australian employer’s website. The POEA list of approved job orders through licensed agencies which is the closest occupation (as described in the LTSSL and at time this column was written are (the number of approved job orders and when the job order was approved are also shown): – Assistant electrical – 50, 1/31/2020; – Auto mechanic (general) – 1, 1/30/2020; – Automotive technician – 10, 1/23/2020; – Auto electrician – 25, 1/16/2020 and – Automotive mechanic – 14, 1/6/2020. Be aware that when deployed through a POEA-licensed agency, an OFW usually would have to sign a contract. An important part of that contract is the agreement for the OFW to complete the employment period and return to the Philippines instead of staying in the country to pursue a permanent residency application. Non-compliance with this provision could subject the OFW to stiff penalties and potential charges of contract violation. If filed in court, the OFW could have a red flag when he or she applies for an NBI clearance. Without an NBI clearance, the residency application could be refused. So, what is the nCoV-20 that could affect the OFW? Is it the virus that scared the world in this year of the Rat (the dreaded rodent disease carrier)? Non-Compliance of Visa requirements in 2020, that is. "
,"February 17, 2020",nCov,Dealing with the Covid-19 threat in the workplace,Neil Martin Pilapil,"One of the primary responsibilities of a company is to ensure the well-being of its employees. With the outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), this has become more challenging as business leaders also grapple with the paranoia that has gripped the public, caused partly by disinformation regarding the illness. The World Health Organization released an advisory to the public that the transmission of this new virus might be similar to the previous coronavirus outbreaks, namely the Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome and the severe acute respiratory syndrome. The human-to-human transmission through respiratory droplets, direct contact, and fomites are the possible transmission modes of Covid-19. Employees and employers in general
The Department of Labor and Employment (DoLE) has issued guidelines on workplace preparedness and response to Covid-19. Under the labor advisory, employers are directed to provide information to their employees on how the virus can be transmitted and what are the treatment options. Employers are to maintain the cleanliness of the workplace, especially common areas, such as washrooms, toilets, reception areas, meeting rooms, and canteen, and to advise employees to avoid or minimize direct contact with animals, objects and environments that are potential carriers of the virus. Employers are also expected to emphasize to employees the importance of staying healthy and maintaining proper hygiene, especially when coughing or sneezing. It is also important to monitor the health of employees, particularly those who have fever or flu-like symptoms and those employees who have travelled and worked in affected countries. Employees and employers in the health-care services
Employees in the health-care sector and other frontline services are more exposed to the virus. Thus, employers have to take preventive actions to minimize the risk of exposing their employees to the virus. As per the Department of Health (DoH), there will be a screening program in place. Employees in these fields are expected to exercise the highest form of hygiene at all times and to comply strictly with the proper use of personal protective equipment (PPE), such as N95 mask, laboratory gowns, gloves, eye goggles, and the like. If there are suspected cases, the employer shall isolate the employee to avoid transmission, monitor the condition of the employee, and report such case through the DoH Hotline 8-711-1001 and 8-711-1002. The employer will have to sanitize the workplace properly. If an employee is sick but is not a suspected carrier of the virus, the employer will have to advice the employee to stay at home. If, however, an employee shows symptoms of Covid-19 infection, the employee must seek medical attention. Precautionary measures and action
Generally, no one can identify instantly a possible carrier of Covid-19 as the symptoms can be very generic and similar to the symptoms of a common fever and cough. If an employee could have been exposed to a possible carrier of Covid-19, the employee is advised to stay home or to self-quarantine for 14 days. Below are some points to consider during the period of absence: • The employee will charge the absence from his entitled annual leave credits; • The employee will be granted a leave without pay by his employer (the same if he used up all his leave entitlements); or • The employee and employer will agree to a work arrangement. “Work from home” will be permissible for the period of the self-quarantine. The same options apply to: employees who need to take a leave to attend to the immediate care of their family, especially employees with children; and employees who opted not to work because of direct contact to a confirmed or suspected carrier of Covid-19. Hospitalization and sickness benefits
Most employees receive health benefits, sometimes called health maintenance organization benefits. Aside from this, employees and their dependents may avail of the hospitalization benefits under the Philippine Health Insurance Corp. In addition, employees infected with Covid-19 are entitled to sickness benefits under Social Security System and employees’ compensation benefits under the Employees’ Compensation Commission. According to DoLE, if an employee cannot avail of the benefits from these agencies due to the employer’s fault, the employer will be liable for the employee’s medical expenses and other claims. DoLE and its sub-departments, in collaboration with the DoH, will be responsible for making progress reports related to Covid-19. The agency will provide technical assistance support in making risk assessments, in the proper use of the PPE and in setting guidelines. These departments will also be responsible for conducting pre-departure seminars for overseas Filipino workers about Covid-19. It is not surprising that the fear over this outbreak is affecting the usual everyday lives of employees. Employers, no doubt, are also concerned as this might affect normal business operations. This makes it all the more important for concerned parties to cooperate, exercise caution, and disseminate only information and data from reliable sources. We are all in this together, and it will take our collective effort to overcome Covid-19.

,"February 16, 2020",nCov,"China toll leaps past 1,600 as new cases slow",THE MANILA TIMES,"BEIJING: The number of new cases from China’s coronavirus epidemic dropped for a third consecutive day on Sunday, as the World Health Organisation chief warned it was “impossible” to predict how the outbreak would develop. Global concern remains high about the spread of the virus, which first emerged in China’s central Hubei province in December, with the first death outside Asia reported in France this weekend. The death toll jumped to 1,665 in mainland China on Sunday after 142 more people died from the virus. More than 68,000 people have now been infected — but the number of new cases of the COVID-19 strain continued to decline. In hardest-hit Hubei, the number of new cases slowed for a third consecutive day and at 139, the number of deaths was level with Saturday’s toll. The number of new cases in other parts of the country has dropped for twelve straight days. The WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned however that it was “impossible to predict which direction this epidemic will take”. “We ask all governments, companies, and news organisations to work with us to sound the appropriate level of alarm without fanning the flames of hysteria,” he said, speaking at the Munich Security Conference. “China has bought the world time. We don’t know how much time.” The UN health body has asked China for more details on how diagnoses are being made. Quarantined cruise ship The scale of the epidemic ballooned on Thursday after authorities in Hubei changed their criteria for counting cases, retroactively adding thousands of new patients to their tally. Hubei added more than 14,000 cases in a single day after officials there started counting people clinically diagnosed through lung imaging, in addition to those with a positive lab test result. Chinese authorities have placed some 56 million people in Hubei and its capital Wuhan under quarantine, virtually sealing off the province from the rest of the country in an unprecedented effort to contain the virus. Local authorities around the country have introduced measures to try and stop the virus spreading. Beijing’s municipal government has enacted a rule requiring all people coming to the capital to quarantine themselves for 14 days, warning that violators would be punished, according to official media. Outside mainland China, an 80-year-old Chinese tourist in France was the fourth person to die from the new coronavirus, with the other deaths in the Philippines, Hong Kong and Japan. The biggest cluster outside China is on a quarantined cruise ship off Japan, with 335 infections now as dozens more cases were confirmed. A US State Department spokesperson said Americans stranded on the vessel would be evacuated, and would face a further quarantine of two weeks in the United States. Hong Kong authorities also announced it would charter a flight for city residents on the ship, who would stay at a quarantine centre for 14 days on their return. Several countries have banned arrivals from China and major airlines have cut services to the country. Social stability The virus spread last month as millions travelled across the country for the Lunar New Year holiday, which was extended to try and prevent more infections. People have slowly started to return to work in the past two weeks, though many are doing their jobs from home and schools remain closed. With the government facing criticism over its handling of the crisis, Chinese President Xi Jinping called for tighter policing to protect social stability. The government must “increase use of police force and strengthen the visible use of police”, to ensure stability during the crisis, Xi said in a February 3 speech published by state media on Saturday. China’s central bank said it will also disinfect banknotes with ultraviolet light or high temperatures and store them for up to 14 days before they are put back into circulation. AFP "
,"February 16, 2020",nCov,France announces 1st death of virus patient outside Asia,THE MANILA TIMES,"PARIS: France on Saturday reported the first death outside Asia of a person infected with the new virus from China, an 80-year-old Chinese tourist who two French hospitals initially turned away, and also reported a new confirmed case that brought the country’s total to 12. Health Minister Agnes Buzyn said she learned Friday night about the death of the patient, a man who tested positive for the virus in late January and had been in isolated in intensive care at a Paris hospital. The patient, who was from the province in central China that’s been hardest-hit by the virus, had a serious lung infection. All the previous deaths outside mainland China due to COVID-19, the disease the virus causes, were in Asia: one each in Japan, the Philippines and Hong Kong. The Health Ministry announced Saturday night that France’s latest case is a British person who, like five other infected Britons, had stayed in an Alpine chalet with a businessman from England who had attended a conference in Singapore. The ministry said the new patient been tested daily while in isolation at a Lyon hospital before testing positive Saturday. There were contradicting reports about the timing of when the Chinese tourist who died in France became ill and started to receive treatment. the tourist’s illness. Buzyn said he arrived in France on Jan. 16 and was hospitalized on Jan. 25 under strict isolation measures but his condition deteriorated rapidly. Other French medical officials had said previously that the patient arrived in France on Jan. 23 and quickly fell ill. Dr. Yazdan Yazdanpanah, head of Bichat’s infectious diseases unit, said the man visited two French hospitals. Because he “didn’t fulfill the definition” of someone considered at risk of infection with the virus, the hospitals decided it was unnecessary to test him, Yazdanpanah said. The man did not live in Wuhan, the Chinese city that was the epicenter of the outbreak, but was from Hubei province, which includes Wuhan. He later tested positive and was put in isolation at Bichat Hospital on Jan. 28, Yazdanpanah said. The man’s daughter also tested positive for the virus and admitted to Bichat Hospital for treatment, but is doing well and should be able to leave soon, the French health minister said. As of Saturday, four of France’s 12 confirmed virus cases were in people since declared “cured” and released from the hospital, including a French doctor who was allowed to go home Friday, Buzyn said. A total of seven others remained hospitalized. Buzyn said she had no news about a French person who was among the 285 people from a cruise ship near Tokyo who tested positive for the virus and was hospitalized in Japan. Three other French are on the ship, which is in quarantine in Yokohama. Germany’s dpa news agency reported Saturday that two infected passengers on the quarantined Diamond Princess are German citizens, according to the German Embassy in Tokyo. Nine European countries collectively have 46 cases of the virus that first emerged in central China in December, with Germany having the most at 16. The virus has infected more than 67,000 people globally and has killed at least 1,526 patients, the vast majority in China. The World Health Organization has called the virus a threat to global health. Chinese authorities have placed some 60 million people under a strict lockdown, built emergency hospitals and instituted controls across the country to fight the spread of the virus. Restaurants, cinemas and other businesses have been closed nationwide and sports and cultural events have been canceled to prevent crowds from gathering. In Munich on Saturday, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told a gathering of the world’s top defense officials and diplomats that his country was “determined to fight and win this battle” against the virus, and suggested that its efforts were paying off.

,"February 16, 2020",nCov,Love hurts when Cupid gets stupid,Rolly G. Reyes,"ROLLY G. REYES To take our attention away from current worrisome topic like the coronavirus disease 2019, let me share with you my post-Valentine musings. Love and Valentine’s Day have always been associated with romance, relationship and marriage since ancient times. The dictionary definition of “love” includes affection, attachment, devotion, fondness and passion. Valentine’s Day is still being celebrated today as a well-liked tradition, a proclamation of sorts that love is huge and eternal. Love is best immortalized by “Romeo and Juliet,” a tragedy written by William Shakespeare about two young lovers, Romeo Montague and Juliet Capulet, whose deaths ultimately reconcile their feuding families. It is common knowledge that February 14 is the day when it is traditional to send a card, often anonymously, to a person one is romantically involved with or attracted to. The day is now widely celebrated even among married couples and singles in love. This day is big business for florists, bakeshops, jewellers, restaurants, hotels and even airlines. History says it is connected with St. Valentine. Pope Gelatius 1 was said to have established the Feast of St. Valentine in 496 AD to be celebrated every February 14 in honor of the martyr St. Valentine of Rome, who died on that date in 269 AD. That day first became associated with romantic love within the circle of Geoffrey Chaucer in the 14th century, when the tradition of courtly love flourished. In 18th century England, it grew into an occasion in which couples expressed mutual love by giving flowers and confectionery. Symbols such as the heart-shaped outline, doves and the figure of the winged Cupid with an arrow are associated with this day. In Europe, St. Valentine’s keys are given to lovers as a romantic symbol as an invitation to unlock the giver’s heart. Nostalgic names and places that I remember during my time when celebrating Valentine’s Day: halo-halo at Little Quiapo, Bechaves flower shop, Valentine cards from Alemar’s and Goodwill bookstore, a stroll in Luneta Park, a candle-lit dinner at D&E, cake from Rolling Pin bakeshop, or a snack of bibingka from Nina’s Papagayo. Creative couples chatted with coffee and wine at Gray November, Ambos Mundos or Black Angel Discotheque. Moneyed couples flocked to Au Bon Vivant Makati and walk to nearby Where Else disco joint in Hotel Intercontinental. Munching pizzas at prestigious Italian Village was always an option. Many friends asked me why Valentine’s Day is always represented by a heart. I told them that a kidney, liver or intestine the effect would not be as romantic. Valentine’s Day is always spoiled when your male date offers to settle the bill “Dutch Treat” style. Another is when the guy offers to pay for the meal but somehow tells you that he has forgotten his wallet at home. You will discover that your husband or your boyfriend is a cheating miser if he purchased a Valentines card and forgets to remove the tag “Buy one, take one.” The moment you insert that ring on your bride’s finger, it marks the time that your credit card will need a higher credit limit. Valentine’s Day is the day your wife wonders why you bought again another refrigerator when you just gifted her a brand new one the other day. Married couple dates on February 14. On complicated relationships, this is the time the calendar gets erratic. Like buying fireworks and firecrackers on January 2, better pricing of flowers and chocolates are surely available the next day, which is February 15. It is nice to hear and say “Happy Valentines,” but was it not sweeter and more kilig before when we were younger sheepishly saying, “Will you be my Valentine?” Husbands please be careful. Wives on V-Day may possess “actionable intelligence.” It just started with a Valentine card. It ended with an extension card and a joint account. The only time I enjoyed being called a “fool” is when I fell in love. One lady told me that sex is always on my mind. Don’t you think that she should appreciate and feel safe that “it’s only in my mind?” Impotence is Nature’s way saying “No hard feelings.” During my time, the most popular songs immortalized by the word “love” are as follows: – “Love is a Many Splendored Thing” by Andy Williams
– “Can’t Buy Me Love” by The Beatles
– “Love Hurts” by The Everly Brothers
– “Can’t Help Falling in Love” by Elvis Presley
– “True Love Ways” by Buddy Holly
– “Love to Love you Baby” by Donna Summer
– “Never My Love” by The Association
– “A World Without Love” by Peter and Gordon
– “Love will Keep us Together” by Captain and Tennille
– “Endless Love” by Lionel Richie and Diana Ross
– “All You Need is Love” by The Beatles
– “Love Me Tender” by Elvis Presley
– “I Will Always Love You” by Whitney Houston. My favorite quotes on Valentine’s Day: “A pair of powerful spectacles has sometimes sufficed to cure a person in love.” — Friedrich Nietzsche “Gravitation can’t be held responsible for people falling in love.” — Albert Einstein
“You don’t marry someone you can live with — you marry the person who you cannot live without.” — Anonymous *** Good work, good deeds and good faith to all. "

Valente, TMT","It’s still fun and safe in the Philippines despite the threat of the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), the Department of Tourism (DoT) has assured the public. Tourism Secretary Bernadette Romulo Puyat Tourism Secretary Bernadette Romulo Puyat made the assurance after the Department of Health (DoH) recommended the cancellation of big events and other mass gatherings in order to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus. Speaking to reporters, Puyat said a joint memorandum circular from the DoT, DoH and the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) would be released to encourage local government units (LGUs) to pursue events despite public fears over Covid-19. “We also agreed among the DoH and the DILG regarding the fiestas, events, celebrations. We agreed we’ll be implementing a joint circular among the three agencies that [it is still possible to hold such activities] as long as precautionary measures are implemented,” she also said in a media interview after a meeting with the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases on Friday. “We want to assure you that all our stakeholders in the tourism industry have already implemented all these precautionary measures even before the temporary ban [took effect], so it’s safe,” she added. Several LGUs and other groups have decided to forgo activities with large crowds to reduce the risk of virus transmission. The DoH earlier advised the public to avoid crowded places to prevent risk of health concerns caused by the virus. Based on its latest data, the Health department said 455 people were still under monitoring for possible Covid-19 infection. Three-hundred-eighty-six patients or 85 percent, however, have tested negative.
Earlier, Puyat said the country was seen to lose over P16.80 billion in February, P14.11 billion in March and P11.98 billion in April as a result of the Covid-19 scare. Data from DoT showed that 1.63 million of the total 7.4 million international tourist arrivals from January to November of 2019 were Chinese. Further, the Chinese are also considered the second biggest tourist spenders in the Philippines next to the South Koreans, spending $979.4 million or around P51 billion in the country in the first half of 2019. Filipinos have expressed fear over a possible Covid-19 epidemic in the country after the government earlier confirmed three cases of the new coronavirus. Three Chinese from Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the virus outbreak, who traveled to the Philippines had tested positive for Covid-19. One died while the other two have already recovered. Despite this, President Rodrigo Duterte has encouraged his fellow Filipinos to travel with him around the Philippines. In a taped video message uploaded on Friday morning, Duterte assured the public that it was still “safe” to visit the country’s beautiful places. “To my fellow Filipinos, I encourage you to travel with me around the Philippines. I assure you that everything is safe in our country, be it an issue of health, be it an issue of law and order, and be it an issue of accessibility,” he said. Puyat recently disclosed that Duterte plans to visit Boracay, Cebu and Bohol. ‘Airline promo’ Meanwhile, Deputy House Speaker and 1 Pacman party-list Rep. Mikee Romero on Saturday bared that airline companies would launch their respective local promotion campaigns to give Filipinos the chance to “see the world in the Philippines” despite the Covid-19 threat. Air Asia, majority-owned by Romero, is one of the companies that support the call of Duterte to boost local tourism, which may face adverse effects of the viral disease from China. According to Romero, Air Asia has unveiled its fare promotions for the summer. “We want Filipinos to enjoy and see the world right here in the Philippines. It’s the safest and healthiest way to go places,” he said in a statement. For the next three to six months, big airfare discounts would be offered to passengers, he added. Air Asia has offered 22-percent discount during a booking period that will cover February 17 to 23. Also, the travel period for the promotion will be from Feb. 24 to Sept. 30, 2020. Aside from airline firms, Romero said all stakeholders in the tourism industry would launch promotional campaigns to encourage local tourists to visit and enjoy local scenery. “Filipinos could help keep the tourism industry vibrant by patronizing local tourism rather than going abroad, particularly now that Covid-19 has been spreading to different countries,” Romero added. The new coronavirus has spread to many cities in China and 26 other countries and territories after it was first detected in China’s Wuhan city in December 2019. The World Health Organization has warned that the virus posed a “very grave threat” but that there was a “realistic chance” of curbing the outbreak. Death toll soars As of Saturday, the death toll from China’s coronavirus epidemic had jumped to 1,526 as Beijing ordered people returning to the capital from holiday to self-quarantine for 14 days in another drastic effort to contain the outbreak. More than 66,000 people have now been infected in China with Covid-19 as millions of people traveled for the Lunar New Year holiday last month. The holiday was extended by several days to prevent further contagion but people have slowly started to return to work in the past two weeks, though many are doing their jobs from home and schools remain closed. Beijing’s municipal government enacted a rule on Friday requiring all people coming to the capital to quarantine themselves for 14 days, warning that violators would be punished, according to official media. Some 283 million trips were made within the country between January 25 and Friday, Vice Transport Minister Liu Xiaoming said. Several countries have banned arrivals from China and major airlines have cut services with the country. But the epidemic has continued to spread across China and hundreds of cases have emerged in more than 2 dozen countries. WITH REPORTS FROM DARWIN PESCO AND AFP "
,"February 16, 2020",nCov,Will the XXXII Games of the OIympiad push through?,Eddie G. Alinea,"EDDIE G. ALINEA After racing for 25 miles over rugged ravines and twisting mountains for hours, Spiridon Loues crossed the finish line at the Panathenaic Stadium in Athens, Greece seven minutes ahead of his closest pursuers before the thunderous cheers of 14,000 spectators. On that April day 124 years ago, Loues, a 25-year-old Greek shepherd, became the first Olympic champion, the winner of first marathon in the very first of modern Olympic Games held in 1896. He had raced the same long route taken in 490 B.C., according to legend by the Olympian Pheidippides, who died after running a marathon to Athens with news of Greek victory in battle. Loues, though, wasn’t only the firs winner of those first modern Olympics, the place in history also belongs to American James Brendan Connolly, an undergraduate who dropped out of Harvard to compete, paid his own travel expense to the Games and captured the first Olympic title in triple jump. Athletes from Germany were strong contenders in gymnastics, while Paul Masson pedaled to victory in three cycling events. The USA’s pick-up team in athletics dominated with shot-putter Robert Garret, competing for the first time in discus throw, winning his new event. Overall, the first Olympics were a roaring success that Greece lobbied hard to remain the exclusive host of the of all subsequent Games. But Baron Pierre de Courbertin, the Frenchman, who almost singlehandedly willed the Modern Olympics, opposed the idea and succeeded in bringing the Second Olympiad to Paris in 1900. From there, the Summer Spectacle was held without interruption except when the 1940 and 1944 editions were forced canceled due to World War II. This year, the Olympics are back in Asia where they were first played in 1964 and they are threatened to again face hibernation, not anymore because of political issues but of health amid the outbreak of coronavirus disease that has spread from China to many countries off the mainland. As of Friday, the Tokyo Olympic organizers president Yoshiro Mori and the International Olympic Committee vowed there’s no way the Games wouldn’t push through but, at the same time offered no “Plan B” for the Games to proceed with barely a little over five months before the opening ceremonies on July 24, The epidemic has so far infected almost 64,000 people globally with almost 1,400 deaths only in in China, though. Only one died has so far perished in Japan. “Certainly the advice we’re received externally from the World Health Organization is that there’s no case for any contingency plans or canceling the games or moving the games (somewhere else),” John Coates, the head of an IOC inspection team, told the media during a press conference at the end of his two-day visit at the Games’ site. Mori, Coates and CEO Toshiro Muto remained mum whether to reaffirm earlier statements by organizers that confirm that “Tokyo 2020 (preparations) remains on track.” Besides whether the virus can be contained before the Games, discussions were centered on Chinese athletes’ eventual presence or absence in Tokyo. China is reportedly fielding a 600-athlete strong delegation to Tokyo, one of the largest, most of whom, probably, “are coming outside of the country,” The dynamic that the Games have grown the past 100 years, was another reason why making any schedule changes very difficult. Moving the Olympics back, say in two months, would conflict with big sporting events in North America like the NFL, NBA, MLB and college football. A top White House official has even accused China of not being “honest” and has”’motives” in the coronavirus fight, as Beijing faces suspicion over how it records infection. Ass of now, despite assurances coming from the organizers, the Games of the XXXII Olympiad still hang in the air and depending on whether the spread of the coronavirus disease can be contained on time for the July 24 to August 9 schedule.

Watched by security and police, the torch-bearers, sporting the official white Olympic uniform with diagonal red stripe, passed a fake flame to one another followed by onlookers, local residents and city officials as traffic was diverted for the event. “It’s thrilling to think this will take place across Japan over 121 days,” said actress Satomi Ishihara, who ran the third leg of the relay rehearsal. “I’m sure it will leave behind a lot of good memories.” However, concerns over the fast-spreading coronavirus — which has killed more than 1,500 people and infected over 66,000 in China — have triggered calls for Tokyo organizers to reveal whether they have contingency plans, despite their assertions the Olympics will go ahead as planned.

Gov. Carlos Padilla said the task force is a multi-sectoral effort of the province to prevent the entry of Covid-19. Padilla added that the information education and communication (IEC) component under an executive order forming the task force will raise awareness on the prevention of Covid-19 among the people of Nueva Vizcaya. “The task force calls for an interagency effort and collaboration to guard our province on the possible entry of the dreaded virus. Let us practice proper hygiene and sanitation to ensure our safety from the virus infection,” the governor said. Padilla added that the task force would also craft and formulate precautionary measures and contingency plans to address public issues and concerns when the disease enters the province. “We already ordered the IEC team to conduct activities that will raise proper awareness on the disease in order to prevent panic because of fake news over social media,”he said. Recently, task force creation among local government units (LGUs) was one of the concerns raised by the Department of Health during its meeting with President Rodrigo Duterte. Padilla said Health Secretary Francisco Duque 3rd told LGU officials not to encourage constituents to wear surgical masks because it was illogical. “However, we have formed this task force for eventualities,” he added. The task force is headed by Dr. Edwin Galapon, provincial health officer, with Dr. Napoleon Obaña of Region 2 (Cagayan Valley) Trauma and Medical Center chief as the vice chairman. In Lanao del Sur, the provincial government has linked up with barangay (village) officials in the province to intensify the IEC on the Covid-19.

Dr. Alinader Minalang, IPHO chief, said the orientation aims to share with village officials what they need to know about the virus to stay safe. He noted the importance of educating village officials so that they can also help in the dissemination of proper and complete information about the infection.

Wang Junsheng, a research fellow of East Asian studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said the US’ offer actually didn’t address the core issue of the current deadlock between the two countries — removing sanctions, but Washington’s proposal may gain a favorable impression among North Korean people, but it won’t turn into an opportunity to break their diplomatic deadlock. The US Department of State said in a press statement released on its website Thursday that the United States is “deeply concerned about the vulnerability of the North Korean people to a coronavirus outbreak.” “We strongly support and encourage the work of US and international aid and health organizations to counter and contain the spread of coronavirus in the DPRK (North Korea).

The BSP chief also assured the central bank would remain vigilant as the outbreak unfolds and assess its potential impact on the inflation outlook and the entire economy. “Going forward, the BSP stands prepared to calibrate its monetary instruments and implement regulatory relief, as needed, to ensure that monetary and financial policy settings remain appropriate in supporting sustained non-inflationary growth over the medium term,” he said. Diokno also said the BSP emphasized the need for timely and appropriate non-monetary measures that would further mitigate the macroeconomic impact of the outbreak. “This will entail close coordination among the various agencies and branches of the national government,” he added.

House Speaker Alan Peter Cayetano. PHOTO BY J. GERARD SEGUIA “When the time comes, but definitely before March 2022. Possibly in May, if we have enough time and we have cooler heads and with all the issues. Worst case, after SONA [in July],” Cayetano told reporters after a mass wedding ceremony in Parañaque City on Friday.
The SONA is President Rodrigo Duterte’s State of the Nation Address. ABS-CBN’s 25-year franchise expires on March 30. Eleven bills, regarding its renewal, are pending at the House Committee on Legislative Franchises. Congress will have a break on March 11 for the Holy Week and will resume in May. While he considered the issue as important, Cayetano said the House was attending to more urgent matters such as the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak. He said the issue is not urgent since the giant media entity would still be allowed to operate until the end of the 18th Congress. “Don’t get me wrong. The franchise of ABS-CBN is important not just to the 11,000 employees. It is important to the whole country, to our democracy. But, it is not that urgent. Why? Because it can still operate until 2022,” the speaker added. Cayetano said the point of having franchise hearings was to reassess the network if it merits a renewal. He, however, assured that Congress would be fair in reviewing the ABS-CBN franchise. “The only pressure is to do what is right. I am not pressured on what the President wants. I am not pressured with the media or the supporters of ABS-CBN. I am pressured that history will judge us. It will be a defining moment, not only for the 18th Congress, but also for ABS-CBN,” Cayetano said. The speaker admitted that the network’s franchise is an issue of press freedom, but that accountability must also be sought after. He said the House would look at all allegations against the network, including the points raised by Solicitor General Jose Calida in the quo warranto petition he filed before the Supreme Court. One of the personalities supporting the franchise’s renewal is Quezon City Mayor Josefina Belmonte. “By tradition, Quezon City is also known as a bastion of freedom, knowledge and diversity, and the presence of multiple media networks in QC embodies these values,” she said in a statement. ABS-CBN is one of the top taxpayers in Quezon City and had supported many of the city’s significant programs and projects, Belmonte said. The city also entered into several partnerships with the late Gina Lopez, former Environment secretary, in various projects such as the cleaning of esteros. ABS-CBN’s Bantay Kalikasan is also city’s partner in protecting and preserving the La Mesa Ecopark. Meanwhile, Sen. Christopher Lawrence “Bong” Go assured that ABS-CBN would be treated fairly if measures seeking to renew its franchise would be approved in the House and transmitted to the Senate. “We will give a fair hearing once it reaches the Senate. Our concern here is the welfare of every Filipino, welfare of the employees, and rest assured that the interest of every Filipino is the priority consideration of whatever decision I will make,” he said. Because the bills have been filed, Senate President Vicente Sotto 3rd and Isabela First
District Rep. Antonio Albano stated in interviews that the existing franchise is deemed extended until the end of the 18th Congress in March 2022, unless Congress decides earlier to deny it. “There are several legal issues being tackled now. Let’s wait for the legal opinion of the DoJ (Department of Justice) or our NTC (National Telecommunications Commission),” Go said. Calida filed the quo warranto petition before the Supreme Court to revoke the franchise of ABS-CBN allegedly because of, among others, allowing foreign ownership. Last February 12, Senator Mary Grace Poe filed a Senate resolution directing the Committee on Public Services to investigate the compliance of the network to its franchise.

,"February 15, 2020",nCov,"1,700 medics infected with virus in China",Associated Press,"Ning Zhu, a nurse in Wuhan, the central Chinese city at the heart of a deadly coronavirus outbreak, is restless. Instead of helping on the frontlines, she has been under self-quarantine at home for weeks, after a chest scan on January 26 revealed that she had a suspected case of the 2019 novel coronavirus. Zhu was told to wait for a nucleic acid test that would provide the final verdict, but it never came. “Right now, it’s really a problem. Our hospital already has more than 100 people who are quarantined at home,” she told CNN over the phone. An additional 30 medical workers had been confirmed to have the virus, she said. “If the tests are fine, we can go back to work. I actually don’t have any symptoms, there’s just a slight problem with my CT scan, it seems there’s a bit of infection,” she said. Zhu estimates that of the 500 medical staff at the hospital, more than 130 may have been stricken by the virus, which has so far infected more than 60,000 globally. She declined to publicize the name of her hospital and asked to use a pseudonym as she was not authorized to speak to the media. The situation at her hospital is not unique. A nurse from the Wuhan Central Hospital said on Weibo, China’s Twitter-like platform, that around 150 colleagues at her hospital had been confirmed or suspected to be infected — including herself. The nurse, who had been under self-quarantine at home since being infected last month, was finally admitted into the hospital she works at for treatment on Tuesday. “The [in-patient] floor I live on is basically filled with colleagues from my hospital,” she wrote in a post on Wednesday. “These are mostly double or triple rooms, with my colleagues’ names and bed numbers clearly written in black and white on the doors.’’ ‘’Every time fellow medics came to check on her, she said, she would hold her breath. “I’m afraid the virus inside my body will come out and infect these colleagues who are still standing fast on the frontline,” she wrote. On Friday, it was revealed that 1,716 health care workers nationwide had been infected by the virus, six of whom had died, according to China’s National Health Commission. Nearly 90 percent (87.5 percent) of those medics came from in Hubei province, of which Wuhan is the capital. Health care workers have long faced a high risk of infection during major outbreaks, including the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic that swept China from late 2002 to 2003. In Wuhan, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak, however, that risk is now exacerbated by a dire shortage of medical resources to cope with the influx of patients, as well as the government’s belated warning of the high-infection rate. In Wuhan alone, 1,102 medical workers have been infected, accounting for 73 percent of infections in the province and 64 percent nationwide. The city of 11 million people has 398 hospitals and nearly 6,000 community clinics. But the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission has designated nine hospitals to treat coronavirus cases, as well as an additional 61 hospitals whose outpatient clinics will receive patients with fever — believed to be a common symptom of the pneumonia-like illness.

Foreign wedding companies in Indonesia’s Bali, Japan’s Okinawa, and the Maldives that cater to Chinese couples have reported massive losses, according to industry analysts and business insiders on Thursday. “We just put off our wedding ceremony, which was scheduled in early March in Bali to avoid populated gatherings during this special period. What we care about now is the health condition,” said a bride-to-be surnamed Zhou in Beijing to the Global Times. “My clients that planned to hold their wedding ceremonies in February in Bali have postponed them to the second half of this year due to concerns of the viral epidemic,” Lisa Wang, an employee with a Beijing-based wedding planning firm, told the Global Times on Thursday. “We held several ceremonies in Bali in January, as it was still normal. But starting from February, since the local government tried to bar arrivals from the Chinese mainland, our business has been halted,” Wang said, noting that her company, which handles wedding ceremony services in 54 countries and regions, overtook the business in Bali more than 10 years ago. Last week, Indonesia banned flights to and from the Chinese mainland to prevent the spread of Covid-19. Wang said she did not have any new contracts inked with local wedding businesses and photography studios in Bali and other foreign destinations like Okinawa and Jeju Island in South Korea from late January to mid-February. “In previous years we would receive over 20 orders in January from Chinese couples for wedding photos in our studio, but this year, we haven’t received any,” said an employee, who preferred to remain anonymous, in Seoul, capital of South Korea, to the Global Times. The South Korean employee also said Chinese clients had increased the studio’s revenue in recent years. “But we lost that at the beginning of this year.” Global Times "
,"February 15, 2020",nCov,386 patients under virus watch cleared,John Eric Mendoza,"The Department of Health (DoH) on Friday said 84 percent of patients under medical watch for possible coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) infection had been cleared. Health Assistant Secretary Maria Rosario Vergeire As of Friday noon, 386 patients of the 455 patients under investigation (PUIs) had tested negative for the illness, Health Assistant Secretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said in a briefing.
She noted that 191 PUIs were still in hospitals while 260 had been discharged. Among those discharged were two of the three confirmed Covid-19 cases reported in the Philippines — a Chinese woman from Wuhan City in China, the epicenter of the disease outbreak and the partner of the sole Covid-19 death in the country so far; and 51 people who were in the same hospital, flights and hotels as the three confirmed cases. The third confirmed case in the country, a 44-year-old Chinese man, was the first fatality from the disease outside China. The Health department’s Epidemiology Bureau reported that 255 or 34 percent of the 740 persons who came in contact with Covid-19 carriers had been reached. Vergeire said tracing the remaining persons proved to be a challenge because some of them had given “erroneous and incomplete information.” She added that 172 or 67 percent of traced contacts had been interviewed, and 93 of them had completed their two-week home quarantine. Among 172 contacts, the 17 who were found to have symptoms of the respiratory virus are now considered as PUI currently confined in DoH-accredited hospitals. Health Secretary Francisco Duque 3rd on Friday said the Inter-Agency Task Force on Covid-19 was scheduled to meet to discuss the condition of Filipinos aboard a cruise ship cordoned off in Japan. “I would like to know the private sector’s role in this because if there is an agency or there is an entity that should take care of them, I would like to propose that the responsibility, should quarantine be required, be shared with that private entity,” he said, when asked about the possible repatriation of more than 500 Filipinos on the Diamond Princess docked in Yokohama, Japan. The Department of Foreign Affairs has confirmed that, as of Thursday, 112 of Filipino’s and all crew members of the Diamond Princess had tested positive for Covid-2019. They were taken to various hospitals in Tokyo and were “responding well to treatment,” the Philippine Embassy in Tokyo reported. Also on Friday, Malacañang expressed confidence that the Philippine economy would recover from the fallout from Covid-19. During a Palace press briefing, Cabinet Secretary Karlo Alexei Nograles claimed that the government was taking a “hands-on approach” and acting proactively to detect and contain the virus. “While Covid-19 is expected to impact the global economy, we believe that achieving our 2020 growth target of 6.5 percent is possible, as the effects are usually short-lived and generally affect only the first quarter,” he said. President Rodrigo Duterte himself has urged Filipinos to travel around the country, assuring them that “everything is safe” amid growing concerns over the coronavirus outbreak. Duterte promoted the country’s tourism after the Department of Tourism reported an estimated P42.9 billion worth of loss due to the virus outbreak. “To my fellow Filipinos, I encourage you to travel with me around the Philippines. I assure you that everything is safe in our country, be it an issue of health, be it an issue of law and order, and be it an issue of accessibility,” he said. The President added that airlines, hotels and resorts had agreed to lower their rates so more people could travel to some of the best places in the country. The Department of Education (DepEd) also assured that the welfare of the students would remain its top priority, as the country braces for the possible local transmission Covid-19. Speaking before the students of a public school in Quezon City, DepEd Undersecretary Alain Pascua said the DepEd Task Force Covid-19 is “strengthening its measures against the coronavirus disease.” “You are important to DepEd. We know that your dreams cannot wait, that is why building your capacities must continue,” Pascua told the students of Don Alejandro Roces Sr. Science-Technology High School. WITH CATHERINE S.

Hopefully, no more locals will be afflicted,” he added. Health Undersecretary Eric Domingo has said all three confirmed Covid-19 cases in the Philippines were foreigners. Go urged the public to follow advisories issued by Health authorities to deter the spread of any virus. “Sundin natin ang payo nila. Maghugas tayo ng kamay. Pa-check up tayo agad kung may nararamdaman tayo (Let’s follow their advice. Wash your hands. Immediately get checked up if you’re feeling ill),” he said. Go said that he was closely monitoring the developments in the global health concern. “Just follow what is right, the advice of our Health officials,” he said, adding that this is the time Filipinos should exhibit their bayanihan (camaraderie) spirit. To prevent the possible spread of diseases and as preparation for similar situations that may occur in the future, Go is also pushing for the establishment of more quarantine facilities all around the country. He said he was planning to file a bill seeking to establish separate quarantine facilities in preparation for the possible spread of virus. “In case a similar situation occurs, we are ready and we no longer point to another place… and for us to have peace of mind in our respective localities,” Go added, referring to the difficulty of the government in finding quarantine facilities for the Filipinos from Hubei province in China who decided to return home. The Filipinos from Hubei are staying at the Athletes’ Village in New Clark City in Capas, Tarlac for a 14-day quarantine. "
,"February 15, 2020",nCov,Covid-19 may be only the second worst outbreak this year,The Manila Times,"THE news has gone largely unnoticed by the public because of the attention paid to the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), but the Philippines may very soon face an even worse threat in the form of H5N1 avian influenza, or bird flu, which was detected in China at the beginning of the month. Authorities in China reported that the H5N1 virus and its associated illness were discovered around February 1 in Hunan province. Hunan shares a border with Hubei province, the epicenter of the Covid-19 epidemic. That, however, is just a coincidence; the two viruses are similar in some ways and cause similar illnesses, but are otherwise completely unrelated. The presence of H5N1 came to light when China’s Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs reported that almost 18,000 chickens were culled in Hunan after H5N1 was detected. AFP PHOTO The H5N1 virus is far more dangerous than Covid-19. It has approximately 190 subtypes that can cause bird flu and can be transmitted from birds to humans, although not easily. According to the World Organization for Animal Health, 455 people have died from bird flu since 2003; that is not a high number, but what should be noted is that an avian influenza infection is far more serious, about 30 times more likely to be fatal than Covid-19. H5N1 is not the only virus that causes avian influenza. In 2017, a bird flu outbreak caused by the H5N6 virus killed about 37,000 birds in Pampanga, with more than 600,000 birds culled to stop the disease from spreading. At the end of January, Poland reported an outbreak of H5N8 avian influenza, prompting the Department of Agriculture here to impose a temporary ban on the importation of birds and bird products from that country. The last serious bird flu scare for the Philippines occurred in 2005, when Vietnam was heavily hit by an outbreak that killed millions of birds and at least 74 people worldwide as it moved westward. In the end, there were virtually no bird flu cases in the Philippines and certainly no human deaths, but the reaction of the public to the possibility was much the same then as it is now to Covid-19. As of now, the Department of Agriculture’s Bureau of Animal Industry is monitoring the Philippines’ well-known migratory bird areas to try to stop H5N1 from entering the country. That seems an impossible task; there are 117 “Important Bird Areas” and at least 150 species of migratory birds in the Philippines, and the chances that infected birds will find their way here are good. China is taking steps to try to prevent the spread of H5N1, but those efforts are likely compromised by the attention on the Covid-19 epidemic. Even if the current strain of H5N1 does not cross the species boundary and result in human infections, a serious outbreak here among poultry farms would be disastrous, both for farmers themselves and for the economy. Since it is impossible to create an effective vaccine for H5N1 because of its many variants, the only way to stop the spread of the bird flu is to cull at-risk bird populations. Based on past outbreaks of bird flu, the ratio of birds that must be culled to birds that actually get sick is between 14 and 20 to one. That reduction in food supply for people would be aggravated by the necessity of keeping an import ban in place to further guard against the spread of the disease. All these would be happening against the backdrop of the diminished but not yet eliminated African swine fever, which has caused some mild supply constraints and driven up pork prices. Are our authorities ready for the possibility of a bird flu outbreak? Undoubtedly, they would assure us that they are. Because of the public anxiety already caused by the Covid-19 outbreak, in spite of there only being a handful of known cases in the Philippines, it might not be enough for the government to simply say they are ready to take on the bird flu. The plan, if there is one, should be presented now, in the interest of boosting public confidence and cooperation. "
,"February 15, 2020",nCov,Covid-19 a stress test for Xi Jinping,Yen Makabenta,"YEN MAKABENTA First word
IF you wonder as I do how the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) epidemic is impacting on Xi Jinping and his lifetime presidency, look up and read online an article in the current issue of Foreign Affairs: “The coronavirus is a stress test for Xi Jinping” by Elizabeth Economy (Foreign Affairs, Feb. 20, 2020). It is by far the most informative and comprehensive report on the viral crisis that I have read, topping others that I earlier studied. Yesterday (February 14), the Associated Press said China had reported another sharp rise in the number of people infected with the new virus, as the death toll neared 1,400. The National Health Commission said 121 more people had died and there were 5,090 new confirmed cases. It’s troubling to just keep score of the toll of the virus, as though it were a sports game. People are dying and tens of thousands are stricken. I therefore search online for articles that do more than the routinary, and strive to provide a full perspective on the situation, particularly on the struggle between government and disease. The article in Foreign Affairs is, in my estimate, a must-read. You come away looking at Xi Jinping and the emergency in a new light. I reproduce below key excerpts from Ms. Economy’s Foreign Affairs article. Worst crisis for Xi regime
“On February 4, Cui Tiankai, China’s ambassador to the United States, prepared to address an audience of students, scholars and business people in San Diego, California. Before the ambassador could speak, a young Chinese man stood up and yelled, ‘Xi Jinping, step down!’ Security quickly whisked the man away, and the event went on. “A handful of similar calls for the resignation of Chinese President Xi Jinping have popped up on the Chinese Web in recent weeks, from citizens who accuse the country’s leadership of bungling the state’s response to the deadly coronavirus that has spread throughout the country. Like the protester in San Diego these critical posts have disappeared almost immediately. “The coronavirus outbreak is on track to become the worst humanitarian and economic crisis of Xi’s tenure, but the Chinese president is certainly not likely to resign. In fact, Xi has spent seven years in power building a political system designed to withstand just such a crisis. He has centralized authority in his own hands, enhanced top-down state control, limited the free flow of information within and across the country’s borders, and adopted an assertive foreign policy designed to cajole and coerce other countries into doing as China says…. Contain and control
“After initially dragging its feet, Beijing has undertaken a herculean effort to contain the coronavirus. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has effectively quarantined entire provinces with a total population exceeding 100 million. It has ordered factories that manufacture face masks into overdrive. Perhaps most impressive, it has constructed massive makeshift hospitals and quarantine centers in a few short weeks. The scale and speed of these measures are a testament to the highly centralized system and top-down approach to policy design and implementation that the CCP has perfected under Xi…. Gaping contradictions
“The very existence of the crisis points to gaping contradictions at the heart of Xi’s regime. “All the while, Chinese officials have taken care to muzzle critics and control public narratives about the outbreak. These measures, too, are a hallmark of Xi’s China: long before the current crisis, the president built a mighty censorship apparatus to control the flow of information in the country. Now, seasoned censors with years of practice swiftly delete any online posts about the virus that they deem too critical or otherwise objectionable. In some cases, local security forces track down and detain the posts’ authors. “Beijing has also worked hard to bring the international community into line. Concerned lest the epidemic damage China’s international standing, Beijing has responded to global anxieties with its trademark mix of diplomatic confidence and coercion. Chinese diplomats insist that the country is rising to the challenge in a transparent manner, sharing information with other governments, and fighting the virus as much for the sake of the international community as in its own interest. Yet they are quick to condemn any steps foreign governments take that might signal a lack of confidence in Beijing. “When Indonesia announced plans to restrict food imports from China, for instance, Beijing’s ambassador in Jakarta issued a subtle threat, warning of a ‘negative impact.’ For the most part, Chinese displeasure has not kept countries from canceling flights or closing their borders. Some, however, have placed their political fates in Xi’s hands. Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen, for example, refused to evacuate his citizens from Wuhan, and even traveled to China to meet with Xi, who lauded him for being ‘a friend in need.’ “Even the World Health Organization (WHO) has been fulsome in its praise of Beijing’s handling of the crisis. The WHO’s leadership refused to declare a Public Health Emergency of International Concern until the last possible moment…. Public health with Chinese characteristics
“Xi’s system of governance has protected him from significant political fallout from the epidemic, but has also created the very conditions that allowed the virus to spread so fast in the first place. Because the Chinese state apparatus is so centralized, information pools around bottlenecks and often fails to reach those who need it most. The mayor of Wuhan noted in a televised interview in late January that he passed information regarding the coronavirus to the relevant authorities early on, but he was not authorized to release that information to the public…. “When 34-year-old Dr. Li Wenliang first raised the alarm about the virus in a small online chat group in late December, he was detained and forced to sign a statement disavowing his comments. His death from the virus on February 7 provoked an outpouring of grief and anger, as well as calls for freedom of speech across the Chinese Web… “The state’s attempt to silence Li and other doctors also drew criticism from a high-ranking judge, who, in a rare public rebuke, said that citizens would have benefited from early warnings about the virus. But Beijing remains as committed to stemming the free flow of information as it is determined to fight the actual virus, even when those priorities are in clear conflict. Officials have repeatedly threatened those who spread unauthorized information, leaving the media, nongovernmental organizations, and individual citizens little space to provide real-time feedback and on-the-ground updates…. “The distribution of medical supplies and financial support, too, has suffered as a result of Beijing’s control complex. Officials have designated only a few central government–supported charity organizations to receive and distribute public donations…. Equally troubling, Beijing’s determination to control the flow of information between China and the rest of the world led it to reject several offers by the international community to send infectious disease experts to help fight the virus’s spread.… Blame game
“Beijing has already decided whom to blame officially for the epidemic: inept local authorities in the city of Wuhan — the epicenter of the outbreak — whose inaction allowed the virus to spread. Whether such scapegoating will be enough to prevent the Chinese people from turning their anger toward Xi Jinping and other top leaders will depend in large part on how long the crisis lasts. For now, the CCP can point to the new hospitals and quarantine centers it has built and extol doctors and nurses while using local government officials as the fall guys. “But as the death toll rises and costs mount, the government may struggle to deflect blame that may damage Xi’s credibility and that of the party. That the president has kept a relatively low profile throughout the crisis is telling. One would have expected that ‘Xi Dada,’ who has assumed the Mao-era appellation of ‘People’s Leader,’ would take center stage in Beijing’s public response to the virus. Yet despite state media reports emphasizing the president’s role as an authoritative commander in chief, Xi has largely sought to lead from behind, leaving it to Premier Li Keqiang and Vice Premier Sun Chunlan to inspect hospitals and comfort patients in Wuhan… “Likewise, Xi appears keen on preempting a deeper crisis of public confidence. In a speech last week, he called for initial policy reforms, including an improved crisis management system and the closure of wet markets, the open-air stalls for wildlife trade that were the original source of the current outbreak. But such actions are limited in scope and imagination…What most Chinese will desire instead is what citizens anywhere would want: an honest accounting for what transpired, changes that will ensure it never happens again, and a leader with the integrity to say, ‘The buck stops here.’” yenobserver@gmail.com "
,"February 15, 2020",nCov,The Asean Way vis-à-vis Covid-19 and ASF,"Amado S. Tolentino, JR.","AMADO S. TOLENTINO, JR. IN the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean), cooperation to build stable relations among member states came to be known as the “Asean Way.” Asean’s regional cooperation emphasizes three norms: 1) non-intervention or non-interference in each other’s domestic affairs; 2) the use of consensus planning and cooperative programs; and 3) dispute settlement conciliation and consultation rather than by formal judicial types. To realize Asean’s objective of economic growth and promotion of common interests, including cooperation on environmental concerns, Asean leaders adopted a road map for an Asean Community by 2015 consisting of three community blueprints — political-security, sociocultural and economic security. The institutional framework or pillars will hopefully enable Asean to deal more effectively with, among others, environmental issues. The Asean Charter establishes a different regime for global environmental issues on the one hand and transboundary challenges on the other. The former falls under the sociocultural community pillar while trans-boundary environmental challenges are generally dealt with under the political-security community pillar. Non-traditional security approach applies to transboundary environmental challenges. It is based on the idea of comprehensive security, which refers to those security threats that fall outside the traditional definition of security involving military intervention. It includes such issues as drug trafficking, transnational crimes (e.g. terrorism), and transboundary challenges such as pandemics and climate change disasters that spill over national boundaries. In the light of the World Health Organization (WHO) declaration of the outbreak of a “public health emergency of international concern” in connection with the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) originating in the city of Wuhan in Hubei, China; the concern in the Philippines about African swine fever (ASF), particularly in Mindanao; and H5N1, described as a highly pathogenic subtype of avian influenza in Hunan, China (which can be transmitted to humans), the strength and weaknesses of countries, international, regional and national health care systems are being revealed once more under the stress of highly contagious yet mysterious diseases threatening the safety of people to live, trade and travel, and challenge animal/species health protection as well. In that connection, it is worth looking back at how Asean responded to the threat posed by zoonotic diseases, e.g., severe acute respiratory syndrome or SARS (2002-2003), bird flu (2004) and swine flu (H1N1, 2009), which raised issues of human health security, animal health protection extending to the sustainability of the chain of animal food production. The threat of a pandemic drove Asean to act with prompt response using no fewer than 25 Asean soft law instruments. The Asean response to the zoonotic diseases was possibly most successful as a result of the threat of pandemic not only in the region but also in many parts of the world. The inclusion of communicable diseases under the socio-cultural community blueprint or pillar may also have given Asean more freedom to act than in the political-security community pillar. Under the sociocultural blueprint, Asean can promote multisectoral coordination and planning on pandemic preparedness and response at the regional level, including development of a regional multisectoral pandemic preparedness and response plan. Be that as it may, if the pandemic worsens further, the issue can be elevated to the non-traditional security approach under the Asean political-security blueprint mentioned above. Actually, an issue can move from one blueprint or pillar to another. It remains to be seen how political considerations will evolve to permit such an approach. For one, under the sociocultural pillar, the application of the principle of sovereignty and non-interference in the “Asean Way” would be sidestepped considering the global environmental health issues associated with zoonotic diseases compared to regional transboundary health issues. Furthermore, the traditional Asean approach at consensus building the Asean way, is much more achievable under the sociocultural community pillar. Indeed, resort to the sociocultural blueprint or pillar offers the cooperation of governments not just across Asean but the rest of the world especially when humanitarian management assistance is required. A “whole-of-the-world” approach or an “Asean-and-the-world” integrated approach in response to the health issues brought about by Covid-19 and H5N1 would strengthen not only the enforcement of health and safety laws but also lead to gradual harmonization of some aspects of the laws relating to pandemics or at least lead to enhanced cooperation with international organizations and others playing an active role in the environmental health challenges posed by Covid-19, ASF and the like.

Diagnosis and Treatment Plan for Pneumonia Patients Infected by the New-Type Coronavirus
(Trial Version 3) (Part 2 of 3) II Clinical Characteristics of the Outbreak
1. Clinical manifestations
Main manifestations are fever, fatigue, and dry cough. Nasal congestion, runny nose and other upper respiratory symptoms are rare. About half of the patients develop dyspnea after one week. In severe cases, patients progress rapidly to acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis difficult to correct, and coagulopathy. It is worth noting that for severe and critically ill patients, their fever can be moderate to low, or even barely noticeable. Some patients have mild onset symptoms and maybe no fever, and they usually recover after one week. Most patients have good prognosis; and a small number of patients are critically ill and even die. 2. Laboratory tests
In the early stages of the disease, the total number of peripheral white blood cells is normal or decreases, the lymphocyte count decreases, and some patients see an increase in liver enzymes, muscle enzymes, and myoglobin. Most patients have elevated C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate and normal procalcitonin. In severe cases, D-dimer increases and peripheral blood lymphocytes progressively decrease. 3. Chest imaging
In the early stage, imaging shows multiple small patchy shadows and interstitial changes, apparent in the outer lateral zone of lungs. As the disease progresses, imaging then shows multiple ground glass opacities and infiltration in both lungs. In severe cases, pulmonary consolidation may occur, and pleural effusion is rare. III. Case Definition
1 Suspected cases (cases originally placed under observation)
Cases meeting both of the following two criteria: (1) Epidemiological history
History of travel to or residence in Wuhan within two weeks before the onset of the disease; or in contact with patients with fever and concomitant respiratory symptoms from Wuhan within 14 days before the onset of the disease; or a cluster.
(2) Clinical manifestations
(2.1) Fever;
(2.2) The aforementioned imaging characteristics of pneumonia;
(2.3) Normal or decreased total number of white blood cells or decreased lymphocyte count in the early stage of onset. 2. Confirmed cases
On the basis of meeting the criteria for suspected cases, sputum, throat swabs, lower respiratory tract secretions and other specimens are shown by real-time fluorescent RT-PCR tests to be nuclei acid positive for the new-type coronavirus; or viral gene sequencing is highly homologous to the already known new coronavirus. 3. Severe cases
Cases meeting any of the following criteria:
(1) Increased respiratory rate (30 breaths/ min), difficulty in breathing, and cyanosis of lips; (2) When inhaling air, oxygen saturation is 93% (3) Arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2)/ fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) 300mmHg (l mmHg=O. 133kPa); (4) Pulmonary imaging shows multilobular lesions or lesion progression exceeding 50% within 48 hours; (5) With other concomitant clinical conditions that require hospitalization. 4. Critical cases
Cases meeting any of the following criteria:
(1) Respiratory failure and requiring mechanical ventilation; (2) Shock; (3) With other concomitant organ failure that requires ICU monitoring and treatment. IV. Differential Diagnosis
Main candidate diseases to be distinguished from include known viral pneumonia, for example, pneumonia caused by influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus, SARS coronavirus; and mycoplasma pneumoniae and chlamydia pneumonia, and bacterial pneumonia. In addition, non-infectious diseases such as vasculitis, dermatomyositis and organizing pneumonia are also candidate diseases to be distinguished from. V Case Discovery and Reporting
Health professionals in medical institutions of all types and at all levels, upon discovering suspected cases that meet the definition, should immediately isolate and treat them and report to the competent departments of the medical institution and the disease control center in the locality. The medical institution involved should organize its own experts or those in the district (county) for consultation; if the suspected case is not diagnosed as viral pneumonia caused by common respiratory pathogens, specimens should be collected in time for pathogen detection. Suspected cases can be released only after they test nuclei acid negative for respiratory pathogen twice consecutively (sampling interval being at least one day).

It does, however, find fake news a challenge. During a press briefing recently, Interior and Local Government Undersecretary Jonathan Malaya warned that they will go after the fabricators of misinformation and propagators of disinformation. “We are warning those people, that Sec. Año has already directed CIDG to investigate,” he noted. According to Malaya, none of the first batches of repatriated OFWs from China have shown any symptoms of Covid-19. Though they are now quarantined at the Athletes’ Village in New Clark City in Tarlac as a precautionary measure, Capas residents have nothing to worry about. Meanwhile, Presidential Communications Operations Office (PCOO) Secretary Martin Andanar assured that the government media and its attached offices will continue to give on-time and regular updates to ensure Filipinos stay safe and informed. Secretary Silvestre Bello 3rd said that the Department of Labor and Employment is ready with its reintegration program for OFWs who will come home from China, Hong Kong, Macau and probably Japan. This includes immediate financial assistance and livelihood assistance. “Minimum financial assistance namin ay ₱20,000. Hindi ‘yan pautang, bigay ‘yan. (Our minimum financial assistance is ₱20,000. That is not a loan, we will give it to them.),” Secretary Bello said. "

Caraballo, TMT","PHILIPPINE economic growth could decelerate to a nine-year low of 5.8 percent this year if the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) outbreak lasts for six months, according to economists from the Union Bank of the Philippines (UnionBank). Attendees to the 2020 Philippine Travel Agencies Association at the SMX in Pasay City are screened by medical personnel for fever before entering the venue.  Photo by: J. Gerard Seguia In a report on Thursday, UnionBank chief economist Ruben Carlo Asuncion and research officer Katrina Joy Javier said they had an initial baseline forecast of 6.6 percent for 2020 gross domestic product (GDP) growth, but if the outbreak would linger for three months, growth would ease to 6.3 percent. “If, [for] some reason, the spread lasts to about six months, annual GDP growth for 2020 will be at 5.8 percent,” they added. Their outlooks compare to the eight-year-low 5.9-percent GDP growth in 2019, and fall below the government’s growth target range of 6.5 to 7.5 percent this year. “The sharp decline [in] Chinese tourists due to the temporary travel bans is an immediate hit on the Philippine tourism industry,” the economists said. “The supply chain disruptions brought about by the Covid-19 spread will have a negative impact on Philippine exports,” they warned. As factories and other manufacturing firms suspend operations to control the spread of the coronavirus, even imports from China may also be particularly affected, according to the economists. Preliminary estimates by the National Economic and Development Authority show that the outbreak of the coronavirus — which originated in the city of Wuhan in China’s central Hubei province last December and has claimed more than 1,355 lives worldwide, including one in the Philippines, as of Thursday — could shave as much as 0.7 percent of the country’s economic growth if it lasts the entire year. In a separate report also on Thursday, ANZ Research chief economist Sanjay Mathur and economist Mustafa Arif said the “spillover effects” of the outbreak on the economy could hit expansion in the first quarter. “As things stand, first quarter GDP could be dented by as much as 0.42 percentage point from our current forecast of 6.8 percent year-on-year,” Mathur and Arif projected.
Their estimate is faster than the 6.4 percent registered in the fourth quarter of 2019 and the 5.6 percent posted a year earlier. “Tourist arrivals from China will be negatively impacted, the magnitude of which could be larger than that during the 2003 SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) epidemic, given the surge in [the] numbers of Chinese tourists since then,” the ANZ Research economists said. “Slower economic activity in China and other affected countries will have spillover effects into the Philippine economy via potentially lower inward remittances and decreased import demand in China.” Despite this, Mathur and Arif maintained their 2020 full-year growth projection of 6.2 percent for the economy. “In our base case scenario, we assumed that the bulk of the negative impact will occur in first quarter followed by a recovery in growth in second half, supported by both monetary and fiscal stimulus. In this scenario, the impact of the Covid-19 on full year growth should be relatively modest,” they said. "

AFP PHOTO “The timeline… is for 20 days.” Son Loi is a farming region made up of several villages. The Health Ministry previously said five people in Son Loi had been infected with the virus, and on Thursday reported a sixth case. On Thursday, checkpoints were set up around the commune, according to Agence France-Presse (AFP) reporters in Binh Xuyen, a district on the outskirts of Son Loi. Health officials wearing protective suits sprayed disinfectant on vehicles by the checkpoints. Villager Tran Van Minh told AFP that authorities had already advised residents to avoid large gatherings. “Life has been badly affected,” he told AFP by phone, adding that much of the labor force is reliant on jobs in construction and house painting. “Now we cannot get out and even if we do, clients don’t welcome us that much as before.” More than 1,350 people have died in China from the virus, and nearly 60,000 others have been infected, since it was first detected in the Hubei province in early January. China has imposed unprecedented quarantines across Hubei, locking in about 56 million people, in a bid to stop it spreading. Tens of millions of others cities far from the epicenter are also enduring travel restrictions. The virus has also had massive ramifications globally, with many countries banning travelers from China in a bid to stop people spreading the disease. Vietnam, which shares a porous border with China, has 1 6 confirmed cases of the coronavirus disease 2019, including those in Son Loi. Vietnam had banned all flights to and from mainland China in a bid to stop the virus from spreading.

Health Minister Katsunobu Kato said the 44 new cases were from another 221 new tests. They raise the number of infections detected on the Diamond Princess to 218, in addition to a quarantine officer who also tested positive for the virus. Kato said authorities now want to move elderly people off the ship if they test negative for the virus, offering to put them in government-designated lodging. “On the ship, there are those of advanced age and with pre-existing conditions,” he told reporters. “There are also those who are having to stay in rooms with no windows until the incubation period finishes” on February 19, he added. “We will conduct… tests for those who are high-risk and if they test negative, those who wish to disembark can go and live in a lodging facility that the government will prepare.” “We wish to start the operation from tomorrow or later,” Kai said. Of the newly diagnosed cases, 43 are passengers, and one a member of the crew. Kato said five people from the ship are currently in serious condition in hospital, four of whom have tested positive for the virus. Test results for the fifth are still being processed. The Diamond Princess has been moored off Japan since February 3, after it emerged that a former passenger who disembarked in Hong Kong last month had tested positive for the virus now named coronavirus disease 2019. The ship was placed into quarantine shortly afterwards and authorities have asked passengers and crew to remain on board until February 19. Those who have tested positive for the new virus have been taken off the ship to medical facilities, but questions have been raised about whether the quarantine on the ship is working, with dozens of new cases diagnosed almost daily. Passengers are confined to cabins and required to wear masks and keep their distance from each other when they are allowed out for brief periods on open decks. Japan initially tested around 300 people on the ship who had close contact with the former passenger or displayed symptoms, but they have gradually expanded the testing pool as new cases have been detected. So far, 713 people have been tested, with officials saying they are currently limited by capacity. AFP "

Let me make that clear,” Yoshiro Mori, the president of the organizing committee, said, speaking through an interpreter to dozens of top IOC officials who are gathered in Tokyo. In this Jan. 29, 2020, file photo, a tourist wearing a mask poses for a photo with the Olympic rings in the background, at Tokyo’s Odaiba district. AP PHOTO The Olympics open in just over five months, and the torch relay begins next month in Japan — a clear signal the games are almost here. Although there have been no deaths in Japan attributed to the virus, Tokyo and IOC officials are clearly jittery. Sitting among the officials this time was Dr. Richard Budgett, the IOC’s medical and scientific director. Last week Toshiro Muto, the CEO of the Tokyo organizing committee, said he was “seriously worried that the spread of the infectious disease could throw cold water on the momentum toward the games.” He backed down a day later and said he was confident the games would go forward, which is the message this time. The virus on Wednesday forced the cancellation of a popular Formula One race set for April in Shanghai, which draws more than 100,000 over a race weekend. It has wiped the indoor world track and field championships in Nanjing, golf tournaments, soccer matches, and almost all sports in China including Olympic qualifying events. It is also keeping Chinese athletes from traveling to qualify, which could put their presence in Tokyo in jeopardy. Saburo Kawabuchi, a former Olympian and the so-called mayor of the Olympic Village that will house 11,000 athletes and thousands more staff members, suggested Tokyo’s hot and humid summer would stop the virus. “The biggest concern is the coronavirus and the infection,” he said, speaking in Japanese. “Currently we don’t have any clue when this issue will be resolved. Based on various pieces of information we receive, it seems that this virus is not as strong as the influenza virus. The virus is susceptible to humidity and heat. In Japan, we have the rainy season which could defeat the virus.” John Coates, an IOC member who heads the regular inspection visits to Tokyo, said he expected to receive reports on the virus from the Japanese government, the Tokyo city government, and local organizers in order to see the “necessary precautions that are being taken.” AP "

The number of deaths and new cases from China’s COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak spiked dramatically on February 13 after authorities changed the way they count infections in a move that will likely fuel speculation that the severity of the outbreak has been under-reported. / AFP / NOEL CELIS As the figures soared in China, a troubling new front opened abroad as neighboring Vietnam placed 10,000 people under quarantine after six coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) cases were discovered in a cluster of villages — the first such lockdown overseas. Under criticism at home over the handling of the crisis, China’s Communist Party sacked two top-ranking officials in Hubei province, the epicenter of the outbreak. The developments came hours after President Xi Jinping claimed “positive results” from efforts to contain an epidemic that has now officially killed 1,369 people and infected more than 60,000. But the World Health Organization (WHO) warned it was too soon to declare victory. “I think it’s way too early to try to predict the beginning, the middle or the end of this epidemic right now,” said Michael Ryan, head of the WHO’s Health Emergencies Program. In Hubei and its capital Wuhan, where tens of millions of people are trapped as part of an unprecedented quarantine effort, 242 new deaths were reported on Thursday. Another 14,840 people were confirmed to be infected in Hubei alone, with the new cases and deaths by far the biggest one-day increases since the crisis began. Outside Hubei, there were 12 more deaths, but the number of new cases fell for the ninth day in a row, with 312 extra patients. Hubei authorities said the increases were because they had broadened their definition for infection to include people “clinically diagnosed” via lung imaging. Up until now, they had been documenting cases using a more sophisticated laboratory test.
Health officials said they looked into past suspected cases and revised their diagnoses, suggesting older cases were also included in Thursday’s numbers. In Manila, President Rodrigo Duterte called on the public “to be calm and vigilant.” “I also ask your trust and cooperation, support as we face the challenge. Tayo ay magkaisa (Let us unite) as one nation, this challenge can be overcome,” he said in a television address. “The government, together with the World Health Organization, medical societies and partners in private sector, is addressing the challenge and preparing for any eventuality,” the President added. He assured Filipinos in China that the government was ready to repatriate them. “To our kababayan (countrymen) who remain in locked down areas in China, I assure you that the government is ready to bring you home if you want. Hindi naman kayo pababayaan (You will not be abandoned),” he said. The Philippines has only three confirmed cases of Covid-19, but the number of Filipinos being monitored for the disease has risen to over 400. Labor Secretary Silvestre Bello 3rd sought the lifting of the travel ban imposed against Taiwan amid fears of its detrimental effect on thousands of overseas Filipino workers (OFWs). Taiwan has threatened to retaliate after the Philippines included the region in its travel ban.
Bello, however, allayed fears that the ban would lead to negative repercussions. “For those who are affected by the travel ban in Taiwan, we ask for your patience and in a few days, there will be a review. While waiting for the lifting of the ban, we are providing financial assistance,” the Labor chief said. “We are seeking understanding from our OFWs because the implementation of a temporary ban is for your own safety. We hope for a possible lifting of the ban in a few days,” he added. WITH WILLIAM DEPASUPIL "
,"February 14, 2020",nCov,‘Travel restrictions on China overreaction’,Global Times,"BEIJING: Chinese authorities on Wednesday urged certain countries and regions to remove administrative restrictions on international flights and travelers from China amid the novel coronavirus disease (covid-19) outbreak, as the World Health Organization (WHO) and other international institutions have recommended. Some countries and regions had overreacted in their measures with regard to the epidemic such as suspension of international flights to and from China or imposing immigration controls, even though the WHO opposes any restriction of international travel and trade, Liang Nan, director of the Department of International Affairs at the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC), said at a press conference. A staff member checks passengers’ body temperature before their departure for Wuhan at the airport counter of Spring Airlines at Tokyo International Airport in Tokyo, Japan, Jan. 31, 2020. China organized three charter flights and brought back 310 Hubei residents on Friday, following the novel coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan, capital of China’s Hubei Province, the Foreign Ministry said on Saturday. According to the ministry, these Hubei residents were respectively brought back from Thailand’s Bangkok, Malaysia’s state of Sabah and Japan’s Tokyo. XINHUA PHOTO These administrative orders and restrictions have had a negative impact on the international aviation market, and caused significant inconvenience to travelers, including both Chinese nationals stranded overseas and foreign citizens unable to return home, Liang added The CAAC has been reporting epidemic prevention measures taken by China to the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) in a timely way, and enhanced communication with other countries and regions, Liang said. He stressed that certain countries and regions should comply with recommendations of not restricting flights to and from China by international organizations and carefully consider adopting restrictive measures. “In particular, airlines should not be ordered to suspend flights by government administrative orders, to minimize the negative impact of the epidemic on the international air transport market,” Liang said. While it is understandable that some countries imposed certain restrictions in the early phase of the outbreak, the restrictions should be reduced since epidemic prevention in China has achieved progress and the world has acquired more knowledge about the virus, Qi Qi, a Guangdong-based industry expert, told the Global Times on Wednesday. The spread of the virus is not determined by race and it has no national boundaries, so simply banning the entry of Chinese travelers will not isolate the virus, Qi noted. The ICAO on February 4 said in a statement that it supported the WHO’s recommendation that all countries not impose restrictions inconsistent with the International Health Regulations. “Exceeding [the WHO’s] recommendations without having conducted an appropriate risk assessment could lead to unnecessary and negative impacts, especially for the many vulnerable or isolated populations which rely so importantly on their global aviation connections,” the statement said. The aviation authorities of more than 40 countries have responded positively as of Tuesday, and expressed appreciation and support for China’s epidemic prevention measures, Liang told the conference. According to information from China’s National Immigration Administration on Tuesday, all travelers from or those who transfer from the Chinese mainland are not allowed to enter Australia within 14 days after leaving the Chinese mainland, except for Australian citizens, permanent residents and their direct relatives, who need 14 days of quarantine after landing in the country. Kyrghyzstan has suspended all flight services to and from China, as well as visa grants to Chinese citizens. Global Times "
,"February 14, 2020",nCov,Nimby and ‘Tantrum Ego’,Rene Saguisag,"RENE SAGUISAG IN a meeting of confirmed Dilawans the other evening — meeting in honor of former president Corazon Aquino — the attendee who surprised me the most, having come the farthest, was Tomas “Buddy” Gomez. He now resides in Texas. He has previously written anecdotes about World War 2, but I cannot really say I can go back that far. The Waray should now be in Calbayog (for his numerous Valentines?). Seventy-five years ago, we are told, more than 100,000 lives were lost in the Liberation of Manila that lasted roughly from Feb. 3, 1945 to a month or so later. Manila was supposed to have been the second most devastated city after Warsaw in World War 2. Gen. Tomoyuki Yamashita had left Manila in 1945, reportedly as an open city (as it was so declared by Gen. Douglas MacArthur on Dec. 26, 1941, to spare civilians and cultural landmarks from harm and destruction; Japan bombed it anyway). Command passed on to Adm. Sanjo Iwabuchi with his supposedly relatively undisciplined sadistic sailors. Yamashita Standard
Yet, Yamashita was hanged on the theory of command responsibility. A justice who dissented in the United States Supreme Court was Frank Murphy, the last American governor general here after whom Camp Aguinaldo was called in my youth. He decried that, no doubt, the vindictive high feelings of the moment would be satisfied, but in the sober afterglow would come the realization of the dangerous and boundless implications of what the court did that day to a fallen enemy commander. The Yamashita, or Medina, Standard remains today, though, as victor’s justice. Georges Clemenceau supposedly said military justice is to justice what military music is to music (personally, I don’t find anything wrong with military music, but a lot wrong with its justice given my experience with Ferdinand Marcos’ military commissions administering military injustice). Perhaps it wasn’t necessary to destroy Manila in 1945 in order to save it. History is said to be written by the victors. It was in James M. Scott’s 2018 book where I read that the redoubtable Carmen “Chitang” Guerrero Nakpil spat on the first American soldier she met in 1945, for making her a widow and daughter Gemma, an orphan, and, equally compelling, victimizing countless others and laying waste charming and genteel Manila, a city she had loved, and lost, to feckless American bombardment. “Damn you,” she later wrote, addressing the GI, “You did your best to kill us.” (Rampage: MacArthur, Yamashita and the Battle of Manila, p. 428, 2018) In the current administration’s bewildering World War 3 against local critics, I found hope last Monday when the Department of Justice threw out various Kenkoy, ooops, Bikoy, cases filed against Sen. Ana Theresia “Risa” Hontiveros, Veep Maria Leonor “Leni” Robredo and many others, including the Otso Diretso Senate candidates, patriots all. I had assisted Risa’s excellent legal team in fending off charges of sedition, inciting to sedition, cyberlibel, estafa and obstruction of justice. Our adversary was remarkable Solicitor General Jose Calida, who I characterized as preferring to be a thoughtless tuta ni Digong rather than the usual thoughtful people’s tribune, echoing Compañero Arno Sanidad’s earlier refined observation (he, President Rodrigo Duterte and I share a common background in having attended San Beda University). Hindi po ako likas na bastos, napapagaya lang po and I don’t even use fentanyl. Voices, not echoes
It seems we may have in the Justice Department voices, not echoes. Justice Secretary Menardo Guevarra says the water concession review may take six months. He may have to kiss his dream of being named a Supreme Court justice goodbye, but life would go on. (I myself turned down a signed high court appointment in January 1987, when I was 47, and the world did not end for me. To me, public service is its own reward and so many seniors bypassed by Marcos, far more deserving anyway, than I, were still around then.) I did help magistrate Abdulhawid Bidin get there and it is time for another Muslim to go up and help promote national harmony. The Prez himself is reported to be one-fourth Muslim, but has shown no sympathy for the civilian Muslim victims when the brave Mamasapano 44 went to Muslim-held territory and got a rude welcome; they met typically fierce Muslim resistance, as shown by their elders of all denominations in Bataan in World War 2. Poor Capas, the site of another possible Death March of sorts (?). Fort Magsaysay could have been a less controversial site for the patients under investigation for the coronavirus disease 2019. (Capas also has to contend reportedly with African swine fever.) Not in My Back Yard, Baby, (Nimby) is also a battle cry in resisting a nuke plant site, once we discard our pwede na mentality and approximate the technological competence, devotion to, and obsession with, perfection of the Japanese. Japan is said to be most generous in its dealings with us and may find it puzzling that the administration can unilaterally declare a contract as onerous. That should be a task for an independent judiciary or arbiter to say, for fairness, stability and predictability, in our backyard, or wherever. Not a biased party. Too self-serving. Government by tantrum
What we seem to have is a government by tantrum, headed by hizzoner, the meyor. Once he declares contracts entered into by former presidents Fidel Ramos and Gloria Macapagal Arroyo as containing onerous provisions, is there a government lawyer or judge who’d dare contradict him and risk a Taal Volcano eruption? Not ash falling, but peeing in pants we may detect as a rampaging bull in a china shop we seem to see in the Palace. Maybe the silence of certain high officials is because of their belief that at times, silence is the unbearable repartee? Or is it the silence of the lambs? It reassures that the lambs are now apparently emitting sounds of democracy on the Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA) and ABS-CBN issues. Pleasant welcome bleating, given that the right thing is being done (let’s assume that abrogating the VFA is the right thing, a huge debatable assumption), it is not being done in the right away (Fire!Aim!Ready! when it should be Ready!Aim!Fire), at the wrong time (given the specter of terrorism and China’s irredentism) and for the wrong reason at that (Sen. Ronald “Bato” dela Rosa’s visa cancellation), a totally disproportionate response. The Prez should have convened the National Security Council and coordinated with the Senate, for legitimacy and acceptability. Such a gesture matters. Was it National Collegiate Athletic Association super-cheerleader Buddy Gomez who suggested that maybe in Digong’s time in our common alma mater in Mendiola, what Buddy and I had sung as Thomasian “Tantum Ergo” was transmogrified, oh no, into Benedictine Tantrum Ego? Basta!? "

Gov.

Travel restriction regulating the movement of persons has been deemed to be effective in curbing the spread of the said infection,” the governor explained. The temporary ban applies to any person, regardless of nationality, directly coming from China and its administrative regions of Macau and Hong Kong, and other countries and territories affected by Covid-19. Exempted from the ban are Filipino citizens and holder of a permanent resident visa issued by the Philippine government. EO 5A also mandates Camiguin residents who have traveled to these areas to undergo 14 days of quarantine. Meanwhile, tourism establishments, such as hotels and resorts, are required to cancel and refund advanced payment of visitors affected by the temporary ban. Carriers are also expected to waive rebooking fees and charges. The tourism establishments are mandated to ask their tourists to present entry cards issued by the government of Camiguin and to present a list of their guests to the Provincial Tourism Office weekly. “This executive order shall take effect immediately and be imposed until the novel coronavirus has been declared by the Health Authority as cleared,” the order furthered.

WHERE TO BEGIN? A spread of books awaits book enthusiasts at the Big Bad Wolf that opens to the public on Friday, Valentine’s Day. PHOTO BY RENE H. DILAN Oquiñena said books are building blocks for children and could “change the narrative,” especially for the less privileged. He expressed hopes that from young readers would come good leaders. “I believe that great leaders should be great readers,” he said. Big Bad Wolf co-founder Jacqueline Ng urged book enthusiasts to buy books for themselves and others. In her speech, Ng said the book sale is not just about pocketing readers, but also about converting a nonreader to a reader. “It’s about how to bring books to someone [who] cannot afford them,” she added. The Big Bad Wolf book sale will run from February 14 to February 24. It will be open 24 hours and will feature over 2 million English books that can be bought at 50 to 90 percent off. Ng said they pushed through with the event despite the coronavirus disease 2019 scare because they wanted to provide affordable books to Filipinos. “Many of us are not raised with the habit of reading, but I believe that it’s never too late to start. It is just our third visit in Manila, but we have started to witness the power of books being able to transform lives,” she added. She said books that would be donated to Gawad Kalinga would be distributed in communities and public schools in Mindoro and areas affected by the eruption of the Taal Volcano in Batangas City. "

(Trial Version 3) (Part 1 0f 3) Since December 2019, some hospitals in Wuhan City, Hubei Province have successively discovered multiple cases of unexplained pneumonia with a history of exposure to Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market. The disease has now been confirmed as an acute respiratory infection caused by a new type of coronavirus. The cases collected so far show that the number of cases without a history of exposure to Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market is increasing, and there are confirmed clusters and confirmed cases without a history of travel to Wuhan. And there are confirmed cases in many countries and regions overseas from Wuhan and with no clear history of exposure to the wholesale market. Given that the source of the virus, the time of detoxification after infection and the pathogenesis are not clear, in order to better control the outbreak and reduce the probability of the disease’s domestic and international transmission, further strengthening the early detection, isolation and treatment of cases and reducing nosocomial infections as much as possible are currently the key to control the source of infections and reducing morbidity. To improve the ability to treat the disease and reduce nosocomial infections as much as possible at the same time, we revised the Diagnosis and Treatment Plan for Pneumonia Patients Infected by the New-Type Coronavirus (Trial Version 2). I Coronavirus Etiological Characteristics Coronavirus is a non-segmented, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus, belonging to the Orthocoronavirinae subfamily in the Coronaviridae family within the Nidovirales order. According to serotype and genomic characteristics, the coronavirus subfamily is classified into four genera, α, β, γ and δ. There are currently six recognized types of coronavirus that can infect humans, including 229E and NL63 (α coronavirus), OC43 and HKU1 (β coronavirus), MERS-related coronaviruses (MERSr-CoV) and SARS-related coronaviruses (SARSr-CoV). The coronavirus isolated from the lower respiratory tract of patients with unexplained pneumonia in Wuhan this time is a new type of coronavirus belonging to the genus β. Coronaviruses have an envelope, and the particles are round or oval, often polymorphic, with diameter being 50 to 200 nm. The S protein, located on the surface of the virus to form a rod-like structure, is one of the virus’ major antigen proteins and the main gene used for typing. The N protein encapsulates the viral genome and can be used as a diagnostic antigen. Most of the know-how about the physical and chemical properties of coronavirus comes from the research on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. The virus is sensitive to heat. Exposure to 56°C for 30 minutes and lipid solvents such as ethyl acetate, 75% ethanol, chlorine-containing disinfectant, peracetic acid, and chloroform can effectively inactivate the virus. Chlorhexidine has not been effective in inactivating the virus. "

,"February 13, 2020",nCov,Businesses struggle to fix supply chains disrupted by Covid-19,Associated Press,"WASHINGTON, D.C.: Chinese authorities are struggling to strike a delicate balance between containing a viral outbreak and restarting the world’s second-biggest economy after weeks of paralysis. As the death toll from the illness now officially known as coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), topped 1,000, global supply chains remain widely disrupted for businesses across the world that have built deep connections to China. In this Feb. 10, 2020 file photo, a cleaner walks through a deserted compound of a commercial office building in Beijing. AP PHOTO Mail service has been delayed after airlines suspended flights between China and the rest of the world. US chip maker Intel and Chinese smartphone maker Vivo joined other tech giants in withdrawing from a major European technology fair over virus concerns. Prices for oil, copper and other basic building-block commodities have tumbled on dwindling demand from China, often called the world’s factory. China alone accounted for half the growth in the world’s oil demand last year, according to IHS Markit. It buys more than 40 percent of the world’s iron ore, coal, nickel, aluminum, copper and finished steel, UBS says. Shuttered factories and travel restrictions in China have contributed to a 20-percent drop in oil prices since January 7, when Chinese authorities identified the new virus. Prices for copper, soybeans and even lean hogs have all fallen more than 6 percent over the same time. Much of China remains on lockdown. Even factories that are open must contend with logistical bottlenecks and labor shortages as travel restrictions prevent employees from returning to work after the Lunar New Year. That’s all worrisome news for multinational companies that have grown to depend on China for everything from automobile parts to toys. “This is the worst supply chain problem I’ve seen in 40 years,’’ said Isaac Larian, founder and chief executive officer (CEO) of toymaker MGA Entertainment, which produces the popular LOL dolls. “There is no contingency plan.’’ Retailers are increasingly concerned that shipments will not arrive in time for Easter and Mother’s Day, which would force them to mark down the price of merchandise that missed its sell-by date. “No one wants women’s bonnets after Easter Sunday,’’ said consultant Rick Helfenbein, former president and CEO of the American Apparel & Footwear Association. Executives at athletic gear maker Under Armour warned that the outbreak is delaying shipments of fabric, packaging and other raw materials from China and will reduce first-quarter revenue by up to $60 million. The consequences are severe, in part because so many companies depend on “just-in-time’’ deliveries to limit the cost of stockpiling supplies. David Closs, an auto industry expert at Michigan State University, noted that many auto parts coming out of China — especially electronics — are flown to the US. And American plants don’t have inventory on hand. “It’s much cheaper to air freight them than it is to have two months of inventory sitting in a container (on a cargo ship) on the water, so there’s not much in the pipeline,” Closs said. “Once they shut the factories (in China) down, the US industry starts feeling it pretty quickly,” he added. Still, some shuttered companies with operations in China are showing tentative signs that they are beginning to stir back to life. Toyota spokesman Eric Booth said the company’s plants there are preparing to resume operations as early as next week. And General Motors said its joint-venture partners in China plan to restart production on February15. “Things are at least stabilizing,” GM spokesman Jim Cain said. Beijing is trying to limit the economic damage from the coronavirus, which is expected to savage economic growth in the January-March quarter and leave 2020 growth well below the 6 percent — already the lowest figure since 1990 — that economists had expected. Chinese authorities face “a difficult balancing act between containing the virus and resuming business,’’ Kaho Yu, a senior Asia analyst at the consulting firm Verisk Maplecroft, said in a research report. “The return of workers to crowded environments, such as mines and factories, could push the outbreak to another peak, resulting in rising discontent and political pressure for failing to control the crisis,” he added. China’s economy, hobbled by a 19-month trade war with the United States and a deliberate government campaign to rein in runaway debts, was decelerating well before the viral outbreak. The health crisis is giving multinational companies another reason to rethink their dependence on China, which has been at the center of repeated outbreaks — bird flu in 1997, SARS in 2003 and now the coronavirus. Koray Köse, senior director of supply chain research at the Gartner consultancy, said companies need to better assess the risks involved in manufacturing in China and other developing countries. “It’s a wake-up call,’’ he said. “Companies will have to think about their manufacturing footprint and their appetite for risk.’’ Those companies already had reason to consider moving some production out of China. Costs there are rising. And robotics and other technologies are reducing labor costs and making it more feasible to manufacture in high-wage locations such as the US and Europe. "
,"February 13, 2020",nCov,Japan ship virus patients jump to 174,Agence France-Presse,"YOKOHAMA: Another 39 people aboard the Diamond Princess Cruise ship in Japan have tested positive for the new coronavirus, authorities said Wednesday, as thousands more steel themselves for a second week in quarantine. With 174 confirmed cases, the ship that arrived with over 3,700 passengers and crew has become the largest single cluster of the newly named Covid-19, acronym for coronavirus disease 2019, virus outside its origin in China, where it has killed more than 1,100. VALENTINE’S THREAT An employee talks to a woman wearing a protective face mask behind Saint Valentine’s decorations in a shopping mall in Bangkok. The death toll from the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak surged past 1,000 in China on February 11 as the World Health Organization warned that the epidemic poses a ‘very grave’ global threat. AFP PHOTO Passengers and crew are now halfway through a 14-day quarantine that is due to end on February 19 and have been mostly confined to their quarters, aside from being allowed brief periods on deck while wearing face masks. “You sit out on the balcony and you hear people coughing all the way along,” British passenger Sally Abel said in a video streamed on Facebook. “It is nothing like a holiday, but it is complete relaxation,” she added. Fellow passenger Yardley Wong tweeted: “Anxiety uprisen” on news of the new cases, saying she didn’t know whether she or her family might be next. On board the ship, the captain told passengers the situation was changing all the time. “We are following the latest and best public health guidelines from the authorities,” he said in a broadcast that passengers relayed on social media. He apologized for the “periodic service disruptions” to the internet, adding: “Diamond Princess has more bandwidth than any ship in the world, and at the same time, more mobile devices than ever before connected on a ship.” Passengers have been active on social media throughout their quarantine and have been trying to stave off boredom and anxiety with on-demand movies, quizzes and games of Sudoku. Japanese Health Minister Katsunobu Kato told reporters early Wednesday that the 39 new positive cases came from 53 additional test results. He said a quarantine officer was among those diagnosed, with the Yomiuri Shimbun daily reporting he had not been wearing a full protective suit while carrying out tests before the quarantine period began on February 5. Kato also revealed there were four people in hospital in serious condition, either on a ventilator or in intensive care. The Diamond Princess has been in quarantine since arriving off the Japanese coast early last week after the virus was detected in a former passenger who got off the ship in Hong Kong. Passengers have been asked to keep a distance from each other when out of their cabins, and given thermometers to regularly monitor their own temperatures. When the boat arrived off Japan, authorities initially tested nearly 300 people of the 3,711 aboard for the virus, gradually evacuating dozens who were infected to local medical facilities. In recent days, testing has expanded to 492 people, mostly those showing symptoms or who have had close contact with a confirmed positive case. “Currently we have the capacity to conduct up to 300 tests per day, but we are working… so that by the last day of the incubation period, February 18, we will be able to test up to 1,000,” government spokesman Yoshihide Suga told reporters at a regular briefing. The ship is expected to remain in quarantine until February 19 — two weeks after the isolation period began. Officials do not expect new cases to affect this schedule. Aside from the cruise ship, Japan has identified 28 cases — including at least nine from evacuation flights that brought Japanese citizens out of the Chinese city of Wuhan, where the virus originated. Some of the passengers evacuated from Wuhan are expected to be released from quarantine soon — possibly by Wednesday evening. AFP "

,"February 13, 2020",nCov,Prepare now for economic fallout from Covid-19,The Manila Times,"WHEN economic analysts have been asked about the possible effects of the 2019 novel coronavirus acute respiratory disease (2019-nCoV ARD) on the global and national economies, they invariably provide two answers. The first is, “It will have a negative effect,” and the second is, “We don’t know what that is yet.” That uncertainty is more than enough reason for our own economic managers to begin steps to mitigate damage to the economy, even if that damage never happens. On a side note, yesterday (Wednesday), the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that it had officially named the illness Covid-19, acronym for coronavirus disease 2019; so, we will refer to it as such. Back to the topic at hand. In trying to predict the potential economic impact of Covid-19 on the Philippines, we must first understand what the epidemic is doing to China’s economy even if only in a qualitative sense. Fear of the disease as well as strict Chinese controls on the movement of people has profoundly slowed China’s domestic economy. Industrial output has slowed down and so has consumer spending, and both will continue to slow for as long as the epidemic persists. For countries like the Philippines, in the absence of any serious issues of their own with Covid-19, China’s troubles have three implications. First, China is a major export market; it is, in fact, the Philippines’ biggest trading partner. Any slowdown in the Chinese economy will reduce exports, which will, in turn, have negative follow-on effects throughout our own economy if the slowdown persists. Second, China is also a major source of imports; reduced supplies of consumer goods and manufacturing inputs will impose constraints here on consumption, which will eventually be reflected in slower gross domestic product or growth. And finally, restrictions on travel, both those self-imposed by China and imposed on travelers from China by the Philippines and other countries, will significantly reduce tourism. Tourism accounts for more than 12 percent of annual GDP; so, any significant drop will have a negative effect on the broader economy. All of these circumstances might be relatively short-lived, or they may persist for an extended period of time. Although there is an understandable tendency among policymakers to downplay the seriousness of the risks to the economy — after all, pessimism tends to aggravate a risky situation — they should already be implementing measures to address the worst-case scenario of an extended Chinese downturn lasting through several quarters. First, without diminishing the value of the trade relationship between the Philippines and China, the Philippines should seek trade agreements with alternative large markets. Both Russia and India have recently expressed interest in closer trade and economic ties with the Philippines; now would be a good time to pursue those possibilities with more energy. To compensate for the downturn in foreign tourism, the government should explore ways to reduce economic reliance on it. One rather simple step is to encourage more domestic tourism. That, however, requires a change in mindset, in both the tourism industry and tourism policymakers, away from a perspective that considers domestic tourists a poor substitute for overseas visitors. Apart from boosting tourism from within, so to speak, the government should intensify its efforts to improve in the Philippines the ease of doing business, which applies to all kinds of businesses. Some progress has been made in this area under the Duterte administration, but there are large implementation gaps in rules and guidelines intended to make business startups easier, particularly at the local level. All of these initiatives would help cushion the Philippine economy from the probably unavoidable side effects of China’s epidemic-induced slowdown. The value of there is that if those side effects do not strongly manifest themselves, the initiatives would still have beneficial effects on the economy. In the same vein, they would help to better prepare the country for similar circumstances in the next big outbreak, something that, unfortunately, seems to be inevitable at some time in the future. "
,"February 13, 2020",nCov,"Add slapping to PH arsenal vs Covid-19; death toll tops 1,100",Yen Makabenta,"YEN MAKABENTA First word
IS mankind too hospitable and accepting of the depredation that the 2019 novel coronavirus acute respiratory disease (2019-nCoV ARD) has heaped across the planet? President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines has added another weapon to his policy arsenal against the virus, now called Covid-19 — for coronavirus disease 2019. He vows to slap the thing if they ever meet face to face. Apparently believing that his threat to piss down Taal Volcano’s throat caused the volcano to refrain from erupting, Duterte thinks slapping could cause the virus to relent. Duterte made the remarks at a meeting with local executives in Pasay City, where he lauded the country’s health officials for their “prompt and efficient response” to the virus threat, for coordinating the smooth repatriation of Filipinos to the Clark City quarantine zone and for quelling public fears. In his speech, the President downplayed the virus threat, joke-coughing several times during his nearly one-hour speech. Duterte contends that Filipinos will have to “rely on the strong antibodies of the Philippines: Filipinos do not get sick easily.” He added that “we can defeat the virus,” and that “the national government remains to be on top of the threat” and is “prepared to handle this public health emergency in case that scenario happens.” Duterte declared that he trusts the country’s health chief’s experience and expertise; he believes actively engaging schools and private and public offices to adopt better health practices will contribute to thwarting the virus. He then turned on his signature macho style: “You know, if we can’t handle this f**king coronavirus, I’ve been looking for it, because I want to slap the idiot.” If slapping would not work, Duterte declared that no matter how bad the virus gets outside of the Philippines, he would continue bringing home Filipinos abroad. He disclosed that the 32 repatriated Filipinos now being housed at Clark have not shown symptoms of the virus. On Tuesday, the Department of Health announced that the 38-year-old Chinese woman, the Philippines’ first novel coronavirus patient who was also the partner of the first fatality outside of China, has recovered from the disease and was discharged from a Manila hospital after testing negative for the coronavirus twice. Her partner, a 44-year-old Chinese man, was buried on Saturday after his cremation. The country is still monitoring 261 potential cases across 15 regions. So far only three cases of infection have been confirmed. With Duterte’s threat of slapping it, will the virus get added motivation to infect President Duterte? Who do you think will survive this epic encounter — the deadly virus or our tough-talking President? Virus death toll tops 1,100
Meanwhile, the outbreak continues to take its toll. On Wednesday, the death toll from the epidemic climbed past 1,100, even as the number of new cases fell for a second straight day, As Beijing scrambled to contain the virus, the number of people infected on a cruise ship off Japan’s coast rose to 174 — the biggest cluster outside the Chinese mainland. Another 97 people died in China, raising the national toll to 1,113, while more than 44,600 people have now been infected by the newly named Covid-19. The WHO decided to name the virus Covid-19 in keeping with guidelines aimed to avoid linking a disease to an animal or a geographic location. Addressing scientists at the first international conference on combating the virus in Geneva on Tuesday, World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned that the virus was a “very grave threat.” But he said there was a “window of opportunity to hit hard and stand in unison to fight this virus in every corner.” “We are not defenseless,” Tedros said, adding: “If we invest now… we have a realistic chance of stopping this outbreak.” “Viruses can have more powerful consequences than any terrorist action,” he told reporters later on the sidelines of the meeting. Chinese authorities have locked down tens of millions of people in Wuhan and other cities in Hubei province, the epicenter of the crisis, and restricted movements in several other cities in other parts of the country in an unprecedented effort to contain the virus. Several countries have banned arrivals from China, while major airlines have halted flights to and from the country, as hundreds of people have now been infected in some 2 dozen countries. Most of the deaths have been in Hubei and its capital, Wuhan. But in a positive development, the number of new cases has fallen in Hubei for two straight days. Outside the province, the number of new patients declined for the past week. “In general, the number of new cases is now slowly decreasing,” Zhong Nanshan, a renowned scientist at China’s National Health Commission, said in a video conference with medical staff in Wuhan. “When does the turning point occur? I can’t say. But I think it will be at its peak in mid- to late-February,” he said. Zhong previously predicted in late January that the epidemic would peak by the first week of this month. The biggest cluster of cases outside China is on a cruise ship quarantined off Japan’s coast. An additional 39 people on board the Diamond Princess have tested positive for Covid-19, raising the total of cases to 174, while thousands of passengers and crew face a second week in quarantine. Live and learn
The case of a British man who passed on the virus to at least 11 other people — without having been in China — has raised fears of a new phase of contagion abroad. The man caught the virus while attending a conference in Singapore and then passed it on to several compatriots while on holiday in the French Alps. He claimed on Tuesday that he had fully recovered, but he remains in isolation in a central London hospital. This is the life story of Covid-19 so far. Will the picture dramatically change if it is slapped around? Will a vaccine be found before health officials turn to abuse? “Live and learn” is the immortal advice of the literary genius and medical doctor Anton Chekhov, who witnessed and treated epidemics in his Russian homeland. yenobserver@gmail.com "
,"February 13, 2020",nCov,All the President’s men,Ramon T. Tulfo,"Ramon T. Tulfo I CAUGHT Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong’s television address to his compatriots on Channel News Asia on what their government was doing to contain the newly named coronavirus disease 2019, or Covid-19, threat. The nine-minute extemporaneous speech was reassuring to the 5.8 million Singaporeans. Lee apparently assuaged the fear over the coronavirus epidemic among his constituents because a Singaporean friend of mine called me Sunday night saying he felt secure after listening to their leader’s message. What Lee did was a coup, courtesy of his media handlers. Here at home, nobody at the Presidential Communications Operations Office (PCOO), formerly the Malacañang Press Office, has thought of having President Rodrigo Duterte go on national television to address the nation to reassure the Filipino people that everything is all right. That despite incurring the first death from the coronavirus outside China, the Philippines is still safe from the coronavirus epidemic. The government-owned PTV4 television network and the Voice of the Philippines (dzRP) radio, which are aired nationwide, could have done a good job of putting the President on air to reassure the nation. Talk about competence in making the President interact with the people in these critical times. The PCOO was caught sleeping on the job. As they say in Tagalog, natutulog sa pancitan. * * * From 1933 to 1944, United States President Franklin Delano Roosevelt made a regular evening address to the American people about current issues. Called the “Fireside Chat,” Roosevelt would go on radio every night — television was not yet in vogue at the time — to reassure the Americans that their government was on top of the national crisis of the 1930s, called Great Depression, and later in the years when the US was fighting World War 2. Roosevelt’s famous quote — “There is nothing to fear but fear itself” — was made during his inaugural address and repeated in his Fireside Chat. President Digong, who enjoys a very high popularity rating among the masses, would do well to reassure the people that the government is on top of the coronavirus crisis. * * * Why can’t all the President’s men put their act together? The more Palace spokesman Salvador Panelo denies there is a division in the Cabinet over the termination of the Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA), the more the public is confused. The following is Panelo’s public statement on the President’s order terminating the VFA, with my parenthetical comments: “It is amusing to observe a recent surge of news reports narrating that members of the President’s official family are contradicting one another anent his order to issue a notice of termination for the Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA).” (Not amusing, Mr. Panelo, it’s worrisome that members of the President’s official family are indeed contradicting one another. It would seem to show that there is infighting in the Cabinet, which does not speak well of what’s happening inside the Palace. – RTT) “There is neither contradiction nor inconsistency among the statements made by this representation, Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea and Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana.” (But why did Medialdea tell the media that he had not yet received instructions from the President after you already told reporters the President wanted the VFA terminated? You, as the Palace spokesman, and Medialdea, the little [big boy] president, are supposed to coordinate with each other on the President’s statements of national significance, but apparently you don’t. Kanya-kanyang pataasan ng ihi, as they say in Tagalog. – RTT) “This representation was merely quoting the President when he said that he would instruct the executive secretary to tell the Department of Foreign Affairs to send a notice of termination to the United States on the VFA. To be clear, this representation did not say that the directive of the President to executive secretary had already been issued or given. The said instruction from the tenor of the President using the future tense is just forthcoming. The President may even directly instruct Foreign Affairs Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr. on the matter. It is much ado over nothing.” (Mr. Panelo, you’re fooling the people by quibbling. – RTT) “Secretary Lorenzana said that the President has not given any instructions to Secretary Locsin to undertake steps on the termination yet. Meanwhile, Executive Secretary Medialdea confirmed he has not received any instructions to relay the message to anyone yet.” (Protocol dictates that before or after the President issues an order, the executive secretary relays the order to government agencies that will implement it. In the case of terminating the VFA, the Foreign Affairs secretary should have been the first to know since it’s a diplomatic matter. Now, why was Locsin not informed about the order? – RTT) “Secretary Lorenzana said that the President has not given any instruction to Secretary Locsin to undertake steps on the termination yet. Meanwhile, Executive Secretary Medialdea confirmed that he has not received any instruction to relay the message to anyone yet.” (Oh, boy!

,"February 13, 2020",nCov,Political madness and impunity,Antonio Contreras,"ANTONIO CONTRERAS THERE is an air of political madness that infects, one that is as deadly as a coronavirus. It kills, not human lives but political reason and sanity; although in the end it will jeopardize human lives and freedoms. And it is global, spreading like wildfire, threatening the very foundations of political communities. Alan Dershowitz, that otherwise brilliant Harvard Law professor, speaking in defense of impeached United States President Donald Trump, practically spelled out what we can now consider as a justifying doctrine for political impunity. In defending Trump, he propounded the idea that every politician could not be held accountable simply because they believe that what they do, regardless of its morals and ethics, and its consequences, is always in the public interest. This is a leveling up of the Machiavellian precept that the end would always justify the means, except that Machiavelli did not dare to generalize that every single end of the Prince can be justified by every means. Dershowitz made every end of every politician, because he or she believes that it is in the public interest, a desirable end, which can therefore justify every means necessary to achieve it. In the universe of Dershowitz, the impeached Trump could not be convicted when he pressured the president of Ukraine to dig dirt on a political enemy to aid in his reelection, simply because in Trump’s mind, his reelection is in the country’s best interest. Following the same warped logic, politicians could not be punished for committing a crime, murdering their opponents and annihilating the supporters of the political opposition in a genocidal campaign if only to win an election simply because for them it is in the best interest of the Republic. Dershowitz did not even lay down a critical premise to enable a reasonable judgment on the sanity of politicians when they make the claim that whatever they do is always in the public interest. It doesn’t matter to him if such conclusion is a product of an evil mind, or one blinded by ambition or by a messianic complex, or clouded by delusion, or even dementia or madness. What is horrifying is that this Dershowitzian pact with the devil was taken hook, line and sinker by many Republicans who agreed that while what Trump did was wrong, he couldn’t be held accountable for it and be removed as president. Even more terrifying is that a similar kind of reasoning is now held sacrosanct by Palace spokesman Salvador Panelo when he scoffed at those who insist that President Rodrigo Duterte should consult with his Cabinet in making any decision on the Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA). Using Panelo’s logic, one can argue that since the President is the chief architect of foreign policy in the country, he can do what he pleases, and abrogate any treaty he wants to terminate even on the flimsiest of reasons simply because he can, as president of the Republic. This thinking is fed by the idolatry of blind supporters who treat the President like an infallible, omnipotent and omniscient demigod who can do no wrong, always knows what he is doing and is wisest beyond reproach, ergo, whatever he does, it is for the best interest of the Republic. Indeed, the abrogation of the VFA is not the first time the President unilaterally acted on a treaty. He earlier caused the withdrawal of the Philippines from the Rome Statute. What is appalling is that both cases appear to be embodiments of the President’s belief that the public interest equated his own interest, or the interest of his allies. Panelo can easily rationalize the President’s actions as emanating from his being a president who was legitimately voted into office. Applying the Dershowitzian doctrine would further justify such actions as beyond reproach simply because they are done ostensibly in pursuit of the public interest. President Duterte and his defenders readily appropriate as justification the fact that withdrawing from the International Criminal Court (ICC) and abrogating the VFA protects our sovereignty from meddlesome human rights bodies and arrogant US politicians and bureaucrats who dare investigate the President and deny him and his allies the privilege of a US visa. Thus, these acts are all done with the best interest of every Filipino in mind. The Philippines being out of the ICC, however, undermines citizens’ interests by denying us our rights to call out the human rights violations of the state and its agents. Similarly, abrogating the VFA works against our national interest as it weakens an existing mechanism that has been proven to be effective in helping us secure ourselves from natural calamities and acts of terrorism. Besides, we live in a democratic Republic, and not in an absolute monarchy where the sovereign is the king. We do not have a king. The President is not a monarch, and his supporters work hard to insist that he is not a tyrant. We no longer live in a Hobbesian world where citizens give up all their rights to a benevolent monarch who would be wise enough not to become tyrannical to avoid depleting their vigor so that he would not deplete his. Sovereignty in a democratic republic resides with the people. As such, it is the people who are the sources of the public interest and politicians are not its authors. They, the political parties they belong to, the platforms they sell to the people and the rituals of political representation they engage in, are mere mechanisms by which those interests are given voice, aggregated and transformed into courses of actions in concrete policies, laws and programs. And these processes require dialogue, debate, dissent and consultation. It is absolutely wrong to think that politicians cannot be held accountable just because in their minds they always serve the public interest. And it is not a democracy, but a dictatorship when a president is granted the absolute power to decide without the benefit of dissent or discussion. "

Christopher Lawrence “Bong” Go again called for the establishment of the Department of Overseas Filipinos, saying an agency is needed to look after the welfare of Filipinos working and living abroad. Sen. Christopher Lawrence ‘Bong’ Go “I’m pushing for the creation of Department of Overseas Filipinos para po mayroon na tayong departamentong nakatutok sa kanila na tuwing may mga ganitong pangyayari, kita ninyo tuwing mayroong mga krisis, kung may mga sakit, iba-iba ang in charge, DoLE, DFA, DoH (I am pushing for the creation of the Department of Overseas Filipinos, a department that will solely focus on the concerns and needs of OFWs. As of now, when there is a crisis, various agencies are in charge, the Department of Labor, Department of Foreign Affairs, Department of Health),” Go said. He was referring to the 30 Filipinos from Wuhan, China who were repatriated through the efforts of an emergency team composed of officials of the Foreign Affairs and Health departments. Wuhan is the epicenter of the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak. Under Go’s Senate Bill 202 or the “Department of Overseas Filipinos Act of 2019,” all government agencies concerned about overseas Filipino affairs will be consolidated under one roof. The senator emphasized the need for a unified department solely dedicated for overseas Filipinos to eliminate confusion on which department or agency will take charge of the concerns of overseas Filipinos, especially in times of crisis. Go called on his colleagues to support the early passage of the bill. "

Christopher Lawrence “Bong” Go, approved on Wednesday measures that seek to upgrade some provincial hospitals and establish new ones. During the hearing, Go said he saw the need to improve the country’s health facilities during his frequent visits to government hospitals. He also cited data from the Department of Health reflecting the dire need of government hospitals to increase bed capacity. “The country has a 1-is-to 1,083 bed-to-population ratio. This is beyond the recommended ideal target ratio of 1 is to 1,000,” Go said, adding that the government needs 131,250 beds to reach its target. “Currently, we have 88,394 beds or 67 percent of the target. In 2018, almost 65 percent of public hospitals were overcrowded,” he added. “In light of the outbreak of the novel coronavirus, the readiness of our government hospitals to provide quality, available and efficient health services was highlighted,” the senator said. The bills taken up and approved by the Senate’s health panel for plenary deliberations include House Bill (HB) 1799 that aims to rename the Talisay District Hospital in Talisay City to The Cebu South Medical Center; HB 1477, which seeks to upgrade the Caraga Regional Hospital in Surigao City into a tertiary hospital and increase its beds from 150 to 500; HB 831 and Senate Bill 640, which aim to hike the bed capacity of the Bicol Medical Center in Naga City from 500 to 1000; HB 2444, which seeks to establish the Bicol Women’s and Children’s Hospital; HB 5871, which seeks to upgrade the Maria L. Eleazar District Hospital in the Municipality of Tagkawayan in Quezon province; and HB 5870, which seeks to establish the Senate President Neptali A. Gonzales General Hospital in Mandaluyong City.
Go said the government should improve health facilities. “Indeed, we need to improve the capacity and capability of our health facilities. At times like this, we are reminded that the government should always ensure that our hospitals receive much needed upgrade and modernization,” he said. "
,"February 12, 2020",nCov,Japan cruise ship virus cases climb to 174,THE MANILA TIMES,"YOKOHAMA, Japan: Another 39 people aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan have tested positive for the new coronavirus, authorities said Wednesday, as thousands more steel themselves for a second week in quarantine. With 174 confirmed cases, the ship that arrived with over 3,700 passengers and crew has become the largest single cluster of the newly named COVID-19 virus outside its origin in China, where it has killed more than 1,100. Passengers and crew are now halfway through a 14-day quarantine that is due to end on February 19 and have been mostly confined to their quarters, aside from being allowed brief periods on deck while wearing face masks. “You sit out on the balcony and you hear people coughing all the way along,” British passenger Sally Abel said in a video streamed on Facebook. “It is nothing like a holiday, but it is complete relaxation,” she added. Fellow passenger Yardley Wong tweeted: “Anxiety uprisen” on news of the new cases, saying she didn’t know whether she or her family might be next. On board the ship, the captain told passengers the situation was changing all the time. “We are following the latest and best public health guidelines from the authorities,” he said in a broadcast that passengers relayed on social media. He apologized for the “periodic service disruptions” to the internet, adding: “Diamond Princess has more bandwidth than any ship in the world, and at the same time, more mobile devices than ever before connected on a ship.” Passengers have been active on social media throughout their quarantine and have been trying to stave off boredom and anxiety with on-demand movies, quizzes and games of Sudoku. ‘Captain’s leadership’ Japanese Health Minister Katsunobu Kato told reporters early Wednesday that the 39 new positive cases came from 53 additional test results. He said a quarantine officer was among those diagnosed, with the Yomiuri Shimbun daily reporting he had not been wearing a full protective suit while carrying out tests before the quarantine period began on February 5. Kato also revealed there were four people in hospital in serious condition, either on a ventilator or in intensive care. The Diamond Princess has been in quarantine since arriving off the Japanese coast early last week after the virus was detected in a former passenger who got off the ship in Hong Kong. Passengers have been asked to keep a distance from each other when out of their cabins, and given thermometers to regularly monitor their own temperatures. When the boat arrived off Japan, authorities initially tested nearly 300 people of the 3,711 aboard for the virus, gradually evacuating dozens who were infected to local medical facilities. In recent days, testing has expanded to 492 people, mostly those showing symptoms or who have had close contact with a confirmed positive case. “Currently we have the capacity to conduct up to 300 tests per day, but we are working… so that by the last day of the incubation period, February 18, we will be able to test up to 1,000,” government spokesman Yoshihide Suga told reporters at a regular briefing. The ship is expected to remain in quarantine until February 19 — two weeks days after the isolation period began. Officials do not expect new cases to affect this schedule. Aside from the cruise ship, Japan has identified 28 cases — including at least nine from evacuation flights that brought Japanese citizens out of the Chinese city of Wuhan, where the virus originated. Some of the passengers evacuated from Wuhan are expected to be released from quarantine soon — possibly by Wednesday evening. Separately, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe announced that Japan was expanding its ban on travelers to Zhejiang province. Previously, a ban was imposed only on passengers from Hubei region, the disease’s epicenter. Despite the anxiety on board, one passenger praised the Italian captain for keeping stress levels manageable aboard the ship. “One reason why a panic has not occurred among passengers is the captain’s leadership. Regular announcements of information, answering passengers’ requests by consulting quarantine officers, walking on the deck, apologizing for delayed medicine distribution,” the passenger tweeted. “I want this kind of man to be our country’s leader.” AFP   "

(Photo by NOEL CELIS / AFP) BEIJING: The death toll from China’s new coronavirus epidemic climbed past 1,100 on Wednesday but the number of new cases fell for a second straight day, as the World Health Organization urged global unity to combat the “grave threat.” As Beijing scrambles to contain the virus, the number of people infected on a cruise ship off Japan’s coast rose to 174 — the biggest cluster outside the Chinese mainland.  Another 97 people died in China, raising the national toll to 1,113, while more than 44,600 people have now been infected by the newly named COVID-19. The WHO decided to name the virus COVID-19 in keeping with guidelines aimed to avoid linking a disease to an animal or a geographic location. Addressing scientists at the first international conference on combating the virus in Geneva on Tuesday, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned that the virus was a “very grave threat.” But he said there was a “window of opportunity to hit hard and stand in unison to fight this virus in every corner.”  “We are not defenseless,” Tedros said, adding: “If we invest now… we have a realistic chance of stopping this outbreak.” “Viruses can have more powerful consequences than any terrorist action,” he told reporters later on the sidelines of the meeting, which will resume Wednesday. Chinese authorities have locked down tens of millions of people in central Hubei province, the epicentre of the crisis, and restricted movements in several other cities in other parts of the country in an unprecedented effort to contain the virus. Several countries have banned arrivals from China, while major airlines have halted flights to and from the country, as hundreds of people have now been infected in some two-dozen countries.  Most of the deaths have been in Hubei and its capital, Wuhan, the epicentre of the crisis. But in a positive development, the number of new cases has fallen in Hubei for two straight days. Outside the province, the number of new patients has declined for the past week. “In general, the number of new cases is now slowly decreasing,” Zhong Nanshan, a renowned scientist at China’s National Health Commission, said in a video conference with medical staff in Wuhan.

Zhong, however, had previously predicted in late January that the epidemic would peak by the first week of this month. The biggest cluster of cases outside China is on a cruise ship quarantined off Japan’s coast.  An additional 39 people on board the Diamond Princess have tested positive for COVID-19, raising the total of cases to 174, while thousands of passengers and crew face a second week in quarantine. The case of a British man who passed on the virus to at least 11 other people — without having been in China — has raised fears of a new phase of contagion abroad. The 53-year-old man caught the virus while attending a conference in Singapore and then passed it on to several compatriots while on holiday in the French Alps, before finally being diagnosed back in Britain. He said Tuesday he had fully recovered, but remained in isolation in a central London hospital. AFP related stories: DoH: Number of PUIs for nCoV rises to 382 Vaccine against nCoV in the works     "

The new phone can unfold from a small square upward into a traditional smartphone form, and will go on sale Feb. 14 starting at $1,380. The company announced the phone at a product event in San Francisco. A woman holds a Samsung Galaxy Z Flip Phone displayed at the Unpacked 2020 event in San Francisco, Tuesday, Feb. 11, 2020. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu) Samsung’s first foldable phone, the Galaxy Fold, finally went on sale last September after delays and reports of screens breaking. The Fold, which carries a price tag of nearly $2,000, folds at a vertical crease rather than horizontally as a flip-phone design would. Motorola has also taken the flip-phone approach with its new $1,500 Razr phone. The foldable phones represent manufacturers’ attempt to energize a market where sales have slowed. Many consumers are holding onto old phones longer, in part because new phone features offer increasingly marginal benefits. But these foldable models come with higher price tags and are likely to appeal for now mostly to tech enthusiasts and others at the forefront of technology. “While there’s a lot of excitement around this new category, it is still early days and they will evolve significantly.” said Paolo Pescatore, an analyst at PP Foresight. “While these innovative new designs are nice to have, they’re not must-have, sought-after features among users.” A Samsung worker gives a demonstration of the Galaxy Z Flip Phone at the Unpacked 2020 event in San Francisco, Tuesday, Feb. 11, 2020. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu) The Z Flip can stay open at different angles for use watching videos or taking photos. When the phone is closed, it will take selfies and display notifications in a small window on the cover. Unfolded, its screen measures 6.7 inches diagonally. Samsung says it added fibers to the gap between the hinge and the phone to keep out dust and improve hinge function, likely to address shortcomings of the Galaxy Fold. On the more traditional front, Samsung offers its S series. In a nod to the start of the 2020s, the South Korean company showed off the Galaxy S20, S20 Plus and S20 Ultra, skipping directly to the S20 from its previous S10 series.

(AP Photo/Kelvin Chan) The S20 phones are designed to take high-quality pictures in dark settings, Samsung product manager Mark Holloway said. The phones can take both video and photos at the same time, using artificial intelligence to zero in on the best moments to capture the still images. Samsung’s renewed focus on the camera follows other smartphone makers. Apple last fall announced the iPhone 11, which offers an additional lens for wider-angle shots and combined multiple shots with software to improve low-light images. Google’s Pixel phones also offer a similar low-light feature. Samsung’s S phones already offer the wider angle and some features for low-lighting. But the company says the new phones will focus on high-resolution photos and the ability to zoom in 30 to 100 times, depending on the model. Samsung Galaxy S20 phones are displayed at the Unpacked 2020 event in San Francisco, Tuesday, Feb. 11, 2020. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu) The camera on the S20 series is “a giant leap,” said Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insights & Strategy, who argued that people might gravitate toward the more expensive models even as the sales of smartphones slow. Gartner analyst Tuong Nguyen called the S20 “astounding,” but worried that the crowd at the event had a muted response.

(AP Photo/Jeff Chiu) “I think we’ve reached the point in the technology timeline that all of us have technology that’s so good, better than we can even grasp or take advantage of, that anything new that’s introduced is not greeted with the same enthusiasm,” he said. The S20 phones go on sale in the US on March 6, and will range in price from $1,000 to $1,400. All S20 models will be compatible with next-generation cellular networks known as 5G, although it’s still an early technology that consumers typically won’t need yet. The Z Flip will not work with 5G networks. As people packed into San Francisco’s Palace of Fine Arts for Samsung’s launch event, they passed a team taking remote temperatures in the security line, likely a precaution to check for the coronavirus. Samsung also offered hand sanitizer stations and face masks inside the event lobby. AP "
,"February 12, 2020",nCov,Fitch Ratings: PH’s outlook now positive,"Mayvelin U. Caraballo, TMT","FITCH Ratings raised its outlook for the Philippines from stable to positive, indicating that the country’s “BBB” investment-grade credit rating is one step closer to being upgraded.  In a statement on Tuesday, the international credit ratings agency said the upward revision reflected its “expectations of [the country’s] continued adherence to a sound macroeconomic policy framework that will support high growth rates with moderate inflation, progress on fiscal reforms that should keep government debt within manageable levels and continued resilience in its external finances.” Fitch Ratings also projected the country’s gross domestic product (GDP) growth to accelerate to 6.4 percent and 6.5 percent in 2020 and 2021, respectively, supported by strong private consumption and rising public infrastructure investment. Its forecast is higher than the eight-year low of 5.9 percent the Philippine economy recorded last year; and comparable to the 6.5 to 7.5-percent GDP growth the government aims to hit this year and the next. A man counts dollar remittances at a money changer in United Nations Avenue in Manila. PHOTO BY RUSSELL PALMA “Overseas remittance inflows and favorable job prospects, evident from a falling unemployment rate, alongside accommodative monetary policy, should support continued private consumption demand,” Fitch Ratings said. On current projections, the Philippines will remain among the fastest-growing economies in the Asia-Pacific in 2020 and 2021, well above the current “BBB” median, it added. Despite this, the credit rater stressed its projections were subject to downside risks amid the 2019 novel coronavirus acute respiratory disease (2019-nCoV ARD) outbreak. “It is still early to evaluate the effects of the outbreak, but the economy appears somewhat less vulnerable than [its] regional peers, as tourism accounts for less than 3 percent of GDP,” it said. Preliminary estimates by the National Economic and Development Authority show that the outbreak of the coronavirus — which originated in the city of Wuhan in China’s central Hubei province last December and has claimed more than 1,000 lives worldwide, including one in the Philippines, as of Tuesday — could shave as much as 0.7 percent of the country’s economic growth if it lasts the entire year. First emerging in the city of Wuhan in China’s central Hubei province last month, the 2019-nCoV ARD has claimed the lives of more than 900 people — including one in the Philippines — infected at more than 40,000 others and spread to more than two dozen countries as of February 10, according to the World Health Organization. Fitch Ratings also said the Philippines was vulnerable to natural disasters that could disrupt economic activity from time to time. Nevertheless, it believes the country has room for monetary and fiscal easing to offset the potential short-term impact on growth. Recent reforms to strengthen institutional effectiveness, human capital and the business environment should also lead to the continued improvement in the Philippines’ structural metrics over time, it said.

,"February 12, 2020",nCov,‘Termination to have serious implications’,Bernadette Tamayo,"The US Embassy in Manila on Tuesday said the termination of the Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA) between the Philippines and the United States will have “significant” implications. The termination of the agreement may also end joint military exercises such as that held in Zambales in April 2019 where American and Filipino troops held amphibious training. THE MANILA TIMES FILE PHOTO “This is a serious step with significant implications for the US-Philippines alliance. We will carefully consider how best to move forward to advance our shared interests,” the embassy said in a statement. “Our two countries enjoy a warm relationship, deeply rooted in history. We remain committed to the friendship between our two peoples,” it added. The VFA promotes interoperability between the Philippine forces and US law enforcement agencies. Through the agreement, the US helps the Philippines combat security threats such as trafficking in persons, cyberattacks and terrorism, and illegal narcotics through trainings, joint exercises and exchange visits. With the termination of the VFA, the 1951 Mutual Defense Treaty (MDT) between Manila and Washington will be reduced to a “mere paper treaty,” according to Sen. Panfilo Lacson. Majority of the senators adopted on Monday Senate Resolution 312 — introduced by Senate President Vicente Sotto 3rd, Senate Minority Leader Franklin Drilon and Lacson urging the President to reconsider his plan to rescind the VFA. “Like it or not, bad or good, nothing much can be done now but do a 180-day countdown upon receipt of the notice by Washington,” said Lacson, chairman of the Senate Committee on National Security and Defense. “There’s no more intelligence information sharing in our fight against domestic and foreign terrorist acts, no more US military aid and financing accounting for a good 52 percent of what they extend to the whole Asia-Pacific region. That may not include other intangible economic benefits and security from external threats in the West Philippine Sea,” he added. Sotto said the presidency and the Senate have their roles in foreign affairs. “We represent the same nation but we can differ in perspectives. We believe in maintaining cordial relations with friends and allies.” “If the VFA is terminated, the EDCA (Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement) cannot stand alone, because the basis of the EDCA is the VFA, and if the VFA is terminated, the EDCA cannot be effective,” Drilon said. “If the VFA and EDCA are no longer effective, then the MDT would be inutile and would serve no purpose,” he added. Sen. Francis Pangilinan the VFA termination “favors China.” Pangilinan said Duterte’s move “no longer comes as a surprise given how meek and subservient the administration has been toward China on matters not only of sovereignty but even on matters of public health and safety, as in the [2019 novel] coronavirus epidemic.” “In addition, we believe such a notice is only valid with the concurrence of the Senate. The Senate therefore must assert its constitutional role in concurring with such a termination before it can take effect,” he said. "
,"February 12, 2020",nCov,Vaccine against nCoV in the works,Bernadette Tamayo," RUSSIAN Ambassador to the Philippines Igor Khovaev on Tuesday said Russian scientists have developed a vaccine against the 2019 novel coronavirus acute respiratory disease (2019-nCoV ARD). “It’s now being tested. We are on the right track. I believe quite soon [there will be cure for
nCoV],” Khovaev said during The Manila Times roundtable discussion. He said Russian scientists were working with other foreign colleagues to come up with a vaccine for the deadly virus. “I believe that an effective vaccine against the coronavirus will be created soon. So it (virus) will be defeated. Mankind will survive,” the envoy said. Khovaev said all nations must help in defeating the nCoV, and it was not right to “isolate China.” “It’s ridiculous [to blame China for the epidemic],” Khovaev said. The World Health Organization warned on Tuesday that the novel coronavirus was a “very grave threat” for the planet as it hosted the first major conference on fighting the epidemic. About 400 scientists were taking part in the two-day international meeting in Geneva, which will review how the virus is transmitted and possible vaccines against it. “With 99 percent of cases in China, this remains very much an emergency for that country, but one that holds a very grave threat for the rest of the world,” WHO head Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said. “What matters most is stopping the outbreak and saving lives. With your support, that’s what we can do.” The virus, first identified in the city of Wuhan in central China on December 31, has killed more than 1,000 people, infected over 42,000 and reached some 25 countries. WHO has declared it a global health emergency. Participants at the scientific conference will discuss the source of the virus, which is thought to have originated in bats and reached humans via another “intermediary” species such as snakes or pangolins. WHO sent an advance team to China this week for an international mission to examine the epidemic. It was unclear, however, whether the team would be able to visit Wuhan, which has been under lockdown after the outbreak was registered in a food and live animal market in the city. Ambassador Igor Khovaev. PHOTO BY ENRIQUE AGCAOILI ‘Roadmap for research’ There is no specific treatment or vaccine against the virus and WHO has repeatedly urged countries to share data in order to further research into the disease. “To defeat this outbreak, we need open and equitable sharing, according to the principles of fairness and equity,” Tedros said. The WHO said it was applying a so-called R&D Blueprint, which allows the rapid rollout of research and development activities during epidemics. Several teams of experts in Australia, Britain, China, France, Germany and the United States are racing to develop a vaccine — a process that normally takes years. This week, a team of scientists at Imperial College London said they believed they had become the first to start animal testing of a possible vaccine in mice. Efforts to come up with a vaccine are being led by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, a body established in 2017 to finance costly biotechnology research in the wake of an Ebola outbreak in West Africa that killed more than 11,000 people. Ultimately, however, scientists may end up in the same situation they were during the 2002-2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) — it died out before a vaccine could be fully developed. A close cousin of the new coronavirus, SARS spread around the world and killed nearly 800. "

AFP Photo One of them is Wilfredo Ortega, who opted to wait out the virus storm in Wuhan, where the virus originated. Ortega, 42, has worked in China for more than 10 years as a musician. He had stayed in Wuhan for two years. While waiting for the virus spread to subside, Ortega entertains guests at the hotel where he works. Although the city is under lockdown, he continues to work because guests and employees at the hotel where he plays are not allowed to leave. “Hati talaga ang opinion namin kung sasama sa repatriation or not (We were divided on the repatriation),” he told The Manila Times. “Pinili kong mag-stay at hihintayin na lang humupa ang virus. Natatakot akong sumama sa repatriation kasi masyadong delikado. Paano kung merong isa infected baka magkahawaan sa eroplano?

Ortega said Wuhan turned into a ghost town during the celebration of the Lunar New Year but this was not new. “Para din naman talagang ghost town [in Wuhan] every Chinese New Year; they all go home to their families in different provinces to celebrate (Wuhan is like a ghost town every Chinese New Year because everyone goes home to their families in different provinces to celebrate),” he explained. He admitted that Wuhan residents were scared of the virus. “Mangilan-ngilan lang ang nakikita naming sasakyan at mga tao sa labas at sarado pa rin ang public transportation dahil sa lockdown (There are very few cars outside and people remain inside.

Although he is in the epicenter of the virus, Ortega said he was more worried of his family in the Philippines because the deadly virus could be too much for the government to handle. “Mas sobra akong nag- alala sa pamilya ko sa Pilipinas (I am really worried about my family in the Philippines).

Caraballo, TMT","PHILIPPINE economic growth could still pick up in the first three months of 2020 despite the expected negative impact of the 2019 novel coronavirus acute respiratory disease (2019-nCoV ARD), according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). IMF Resident Representative Yongzheng Yang. PHOTO BY RUSSELL PALMA In a briefing on Tuesday, IMF Resident Representative Yongzheng Yang told reporters that the multilateral lender’s “annual growth rate forecast [for the Philippines] is 6.3 percent, so we expect [first] quarter growth to be around that [rate and] taking [into] account what impact we may expect from the outbreak of the virus…” His projection is lower that the 6.4 percent registered in the fourth quarter of 2019, but higher than the 5.6 percent posted a year earlier. Echoing the government, Yang said the country’s tourism sector was among those that would be immediately affected by the outbreak. “The coronavirus, as you know, has caused a lot of anxieties and restrictions on travel. The Philippine economy, as you know, is not immune to that,” he noted. “China is the epicenter of this outbreak; and [flights] from [that country to the Philippines have mostly stopped],” Yang said. “China is one of the largest sources of tourism for the Philippines, so that…will certainly have negative impact on the economy,” Yang added. Another area of concern, he said, is the outbreak’s impact on the global value chain, which could also affect the Philippines. It could also influence investor sentiment or confidence in certain sectors like tourism, he added. Last, the IMF official said the government’s preliminary estima te on the coronavirus’ impact on economic growth was “very reasonable.” Earlier, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) and the National Economic and Development Authority said the outbreak could slash 0.3 percent of 2020 GDP growth if it lasted until June. First emerging in the city of Wuhan in China’s central Hubei province last month, the virus has claimed the lives of more than 1,000 people, including one in the Philippines, and infected more than 43,000 worldwide as of Tuesday. Yang, nevertheless, pointed out these risks would be offset by the central bank’s preemptive monetary policy. “As far as economic policies are concerned, we can see the central bank here has taken action by reducing the interest rate by 25 basis points last week, and that is a good response,” he said. The BSP’s overnight borrowing, lending and deposit rates were reduced by 25 basis points to 3.75 percent, 4.25 percent and 3.25 percent, respectively, after its policy-making Monetary Board held its first rate-setting meeting for 2020 on February 6.

,"February 12, 2020",nCov,Trade gap shrinks to 2-yr low in 2019,"Mayvelin U. Caraballo, TMT","THE Philippines’ trade deficit narrowed to a two-year low in 2019 after the gap in December alone fell to its lowest in six months, according to the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA). Data from the statistics agency showed on Tuesday that the country’s trade balance last year resulted in a $37.04-billion shortfall, down 14.89 percent from the $43.53 billion posted in 2018. The latest figure was also the lowest full-year deficit since 2017’s $27.38 billion. In December alone, the trade gap dropped to its lowest in four months at $2.47 billion, a 40.58-percent decrease from $4.17 billion a year earlier. It was the lowest monthly shortfall since last June’s $2.36 billion. Inbound shipments slid by 7.6 percent year-on-year to $8.21 billion, outpacing outbound ones, which expanded by 21.4 percent to $5.74 billion. In a comment, ING Bank Manila senior economist Nicholas Antonio Mapa said exports surged last December as new orders picked up ahead of the signing of the phase one trade agreement between the United States and China that month. Imports contracted for the ninth straight month as inbound shipments of raw materials and capital goods remained subdued —contracting 19.9 percent and 2.2 percent, respectively — reflecting poor investment momentum reflected in the gross domestic product accounts, he added. Going forward, Mapa and other analysts projected slower external trade activity this year amid the 2019 novel coronavirus acute respiratory disease outbreak (2019-nCoV ARD). MUFB Bank analyst Sophia Ng warned that the Philippines’ import of consumer goods and intermediate products from China might be reduced, given that many factories there stopped operations between late January and early February because of the Lunar New Year holiday and the coronavirus outbreak. “Export growth may also take a hit due to lower Chinese demand. On balance, the Philippines’ trade deficit in at least January and February is likely to be lower than that during the same period last year, which amounted $6.7 billion,” she said. Security Bank Corp. chief economist Robert Dan Roces said the trade gap was expected to be substantially smaller in the first quarter, as net trade would fall on the back of supply chain disruptions from the outbreak to reflect a general slowdown in activity. “However, recovery should take place faster as the fiscal budget for 2020 and 2019 operate simultaneously. Raw materials linked to construction activities will nudge the import side, while the electronics sector should see increased orders for exports on catch up activities,” he added. Step up, govt told For its part, the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) urged the government to step up its efforts against downside risks brought by health- and climate-related hazards that can affect the trade sector. In a statement, the agency said the government needed to remain vigilant of the risks brought by the onslaught of disasters in the Philippines and the coronavirus outbreak. Starting last month, relief efforts for people affected by the Taal Volcano eruption on January 12 and the containment of the virus have become the focus of government efforts, it added. “The impact of the novel coronavirus could escalate if plant closures related to the production of automotive and electronic parts negatively affect the country’s exports receipts as this accounts for about a third of the country’s outward shipments to China,” Socioeconomic Planning Secretary Ernesto Pernia said. “While the spread of the virus is a national and global concern, there are still areas of opportunity that the country could optimize to offset possible fallout from the spread of the virus,” he added. In the near term, the NEDA believes the production of health and hygiene products could expand both in the domestic and global markets. Moreover, Pernia said the government must encourage foreign firms to increase their investments in or relocate to the Philippines to further strengthen its position in the value chain. "

Health Secretary Francisco Duque 3rd. Photo by: J. Gerard Seguia According to a Department of Health (DoH) situation report posted on its website, the confirmed cases remained at three. The report said two PUIs have died. The DoH earlier said the second PUI fatality died of pneumonia, not nCoV. The first PUI death was that of a Chinese man who died of severe pneumonia and human immunodeficiency virus on January 29. The situation report said 266 PUIs had been admitted to hospitals and 111 had been discharged. Of the 266, Metro Manila has the highest number of PUIs, with 86 still confined at hospitals. Central Visayas comes second with 49 suspected cases admitted at medical facilities, and Central Luzon follows with 31. According to the Health department, most of the PUIs in the country are Filipinos. “These are Filipinos who have come in contact with the known cases. Either [in] planes, hotels or [in] hospitals where they were admitted and who have shown signs and symptoms of fever, cough and respiratory illness,” DoH Undersecretary Eric Domingo told reporters on Monday. A Chinese couple was the first and second confirmed cases in the Philippines. The 38-year-old Chinese woman has already been discharged from the San Lazaro Hospital in Manila while her partner, a 44-year-old Chinese man, died of severe pneumonia caused by the novel coronavirus. “The first case has already tested negative twice and has in fact been discharged,” Domingo said. The third case involved a 60-year-old Chinese woman who returned to China after her second set of samples tested negative for nCoV. Her first sample was found positive for the deadly virus after she traveled to China.

DILAN “I am filing a bill which seeks the establishment of separate quarantine facilities in all the DoH-run hospitals or in separate structure within the hospital compound,” Go told reporters in an interview in Caloocan City, where he distributed financial and relief assistance to victims of a fire. “This is in preparation for the possible spread of nCoV. In the event a similar situation occurs, we are prepared and we can avoid the situation wherein patients are being refused in some areas. This is also for the peace of mind of every citizen in every locality,” he said, referring to the difficulty of the government in finding quarantine facilities for the Filipinos from Hubei province in China who decided to return home. Go, the chairman of the Senate Committee on Health, added that he would seek the help of President Rodrigo Duterte to ensure the passage of the measure. The Filipinos from Hubei are now staying temporarily at the Athletes’ Village in New Clark City in Capas, Tarlac for a 14-day quarantine. The senator said he would file the bill as soon as possible and would urge his colleagues in the Senate and concerned agencies to support the measure. He called for immediate identification of quarantine facilities in the DoH-run and provincial hospitals, saying the government should always be proactive in dealing with crisis situations. Go extended financial and relief assistance to Caloocan City residents who lost their homes on February 6 in a fire that started at No. 151 on 9th Avenue, Barangay 63, eventually spreading to Barangay 59 and affecting 75 families in both villages. He also offered to provide for the fare of those who want to relocate to the provinces and for uniforms and school supplies of the affected children. The senator also offered to assist in the medical needs of the residents, even those who are not affected by the fire. He explained that patients can now easily ask for help at the Malasakit Center, a one-stop shop for medical and financial assistance assisted by the DoH, Philippine Health Insurance Corporation, Department of Social Welfare and Development and Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office. Go said Malasakit Centers had been opened at the Philippine General Hospital in Manila, Philippine Heart Center in Quezon City, and in the cities of Valenzuela and Novaliches in Metro Manila. Sixty-two Malasakit Centers have been inaugurated in different parts of the country, and the Malasakit Center Act of 2019, which was based on the bill that Go filed in the Senate, mandates the establishment of a Malasakit Center in each of the DoH-run hospitals in the country. Local government-run hospitals may also have their own Malasakit Centers provided they meet the minimum standards and set criteria. "

Reina Leanne Tolentino, TMT","Malacañang on Tuesday said a government ban on travelers arriving from Taiwan would remain until an announcement from the World Health Organization (WHO) lifts it, and a recommendation from the Philippines’ Department of Health is made. President Rodrigo Duterte had approved the temporary ban on travelers arriving from China and its special administrative regions Hong Kong and Macao for the management of the 2019 novel coronavirus acute respiratory disease (2019-nCoV ARD). The ban did not cover Filipino citizens and permanent resident visa holders, but they must be quarantined on arrival.

,"February 12, 2020",nCov,"Long live ‘sungka,’ ‘sumpit’ and other indigenous games",Romy P. Mariñas,"ROMY P. MARIÑAS GMRC (Good Manners and Right Conduct) is now a mandatory subject — by legislation — under the country’s K to 12 curriculum at present. That it took and act of Congress to force Filipinos to behave better even while no else is looking is a reflection of how we may have been acting inappropriately in polite or otherwise civilized society. Filipinos spit anywhere they want, throw garbage from moving jeepneys, kick stray kittens, spread fake news about the coronavirus — name it and they do stuff that is anything but good and right. They don’t get punished even if what is coming from their mouth in this time of dreaded diseases lands on other people’s body parts. At least in Manila, these thoughtless citizens’ days are numbered, or so we wish, what with a mayor at war with everything dugyot. We suppose that this word for “dirty” applies to Manilenos who are not above defecating or urinating in the city’s plazas and other public places. Now comes another proposal from the House of Representatives seeking to preserve indigenous games like sungka, sumpit and kadang-kadang, among others. House Bill 6192 or the Philippine Indigenous Games Preservation Act calls for the holding of yearly competitions with native sports on the calendar. The measure states, “It is incumbent upon the State to lay down specific policy directives to promote the interest of our indigenous people, and strengthen our cultural heritage and historical roots.” How the bill, if enacted into law, would “preserve” sungka, sumpit and kadang-kadang, not to mention maybe patintero and tumbang preso, by arm-twisting Filipinos is beyond us. What if I, for example, simply refuse to play any of those native sports? Would they become extinct because of my preference for games that originated from outside the Philippines, like football or lacrosse, which supposedly was of Native American roots? Perhaps, they would, unless of course the preservation measure made it a crime not to play patintero or tumbang preso, and send offenders to jail or fine them, or both. These indigenous games will be played by fewer and fewer Filipinos, who we believe would rather push buttons on their computers for relaxation and enjoyment. Love for tradition faces a tough foe in electronic gadgets. But then, native sports could also be played on ipads and, voila, the Philippine Indigenous Games Preservation Act was not a no-brainer that it appeared to be after all, at least to this corner. "
,"February 12, 2020",nCov,DTI should let market determine prices,The Manila Times,"A SMALL news item earlier this week revealed that the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) is studying whether it should raise the “suggested retail price,” or SRP, of face masks, which have become scarce because of public concern over the spread of the 2019 novel coronavirus acute respiratory disease 2019-nCoV ARD). The DTI should instead reassess the entire concept of mandated prices. TMT FILE PHOTO The issue of the price of face masks arose because it has become clear that a large volume of them will have to be imported to meet public demand; the inventories of retailers and distributors here in the Philippines have been exhausted, and local manufacturers, although capable of producing enough under normal circumstances, will take some time to catch up. Currently, the DTI’s SRP for face masks is between P1 and P8. Imported masks sourced from India or elsewhere will cost more, and so the DTI is considering raising the SRP to reflect that. By law, the DTI has the authority to establish SRP for virtually any goods sold at retail and can impose penalties on retailers who are found to be selling goods at prices higher than the SRP. In connection with the face masks, even though the DTI is reviewing the current price level, the department is preparing complaints against 18 retailers along Manila’s Bambang Street (an area where medical supplies stores are concentrated) for overpricing face masks. It should be pointed out that many medical professionals have clarified that the only real value of the common surgical face masks that are now in short supply is psychological comfort; they are neither necessary nor effective in preventing infection by the nCoV virus. That scientific fact casts DTI’s management of consumer prices in a different and somewhat unfavorable light. The rationale behind SRP is that basic commodities needed by consumers should be as affordable as possible. Thus, common items such as milk, bread, rice, noodles, disposable diapers, canned sardines and so on are assigned an SRP by the DTI. The intentions are good, but in practice this presents a couple of unavoidable problems. First, the SRP policy can encourage smuggling; if the SRP is too low from the vendors’ point of view, they will often try to source cheaper versions of the goods, which are often smuggled. Second, the SRP can lead to even more severe shortages. If the SRP is too low, and vendors are unable to obtain the product at a lower price or are unwilling to source it from smugglers, they may simply allow their supplies to run out entirely. Third, SRP can encourage growth of a black market, which is what has happened in the case of face masks. If there is sufficient demand and vendors can still obtain the product, albeit at a higher price, they can evade the SRP by selling it informally. The drug store or medical supply store may not have face masks, but consumers can still buy them — at higher prices — from street vendors. Although the consumer demand is met, there is no oversight of product quality, the price is usually higher, and the government loses a bit of revenue with each sale because the value-added tax or other applicable taxes are not paid. These difficulties are not a result of poor regulation on the DTI’s part, but rather a flawed framework that tries to be a hybrid between a command economy and a free-market economy, and produces results that are unsatisfying to either perspective. A much more effective way to protect consumers from unreasonably high prices yet limit unnatural interference in the marketplace would be to focus on the supply side of the equation, rather than the demand side represented by retail prices, and to limit that effort to goods that are legitimately vital to consumers — which, public sentiment notwithstanding, is a list that does not include surgical face masks. If the DTI were to reorient its focus in this way, the natural action of the consumer market would stabilize prices on its own and much of the department’s energy could be redirected to more substantive activities.

Cargos at the South Harbor PHOTO FROM ASIAN TERMINALS INC. “Hindi po pwedeng makuha sa cargoes. As we all know, cargoes travel more than 36 hours from point of origin to our country. So imposibleng maipasa ito sa mga tao. Fully mechanized na rin naman ang ating mga port equipment sa Port of Manila and Manila International Container Terminal during discharge of cargoes so minimal na ang human intervention,” Santiago explained, besides disinfecting measures being done by their port personnel. Santiago pointed this out after some speculations proliferated that the virus can be transmitted thru cargoes that originate from hub ports located primarily in China and its special administrative regions like Hong Kong and Macau, and Taiwan, since Philippine ports are predominantly considered as feeder ports. Meanwhile, Santiago furthered that the disease might cause negative effects to the movement of cargoes from China and its special administrative regions. “There will be negative impact and slowdown since people there are all busy containing the disease. Galing pa sa Chinese New Year ang China. Its normally like that if its. Movement are slower now though due to the 2019 nCoV,” Santiago added. He maintained that cargo ships from China and its special administrative regions delivering goods into the country are still welcomed, as long as their crew will not disembark and no visitors will be allowed while, cargo ships are docked in any PPA controlled ports. He said the move is not to disrupt the international cargo supply chain in the midst of the 2019 Novel coronavirus scare.

At least 61 people onboard a cruise ship off Japan have tested positive for 2019 nCoV, while an additional 41 passengers were found to have contracted the virus. Latest development from Robespierre Bolivar, deputy head of mission of the Philippine Embassy in Japan, said over DZMM 630 that the lone Filipino crew positive for 2019 nCoV seems to respond in his treatment and now doing well, while the rest of the 538 Filipino crew members and passengers are still undergoing a 14-day quarantine. The quarantine process will end on February 19, 2020, according to authorities. Manning agent Magsaysay Manning Agency, who hire the Filipino crew on board Diamond Princess, on the other hand, said they are on top of the situation and continues to work closely with the Japanese Ministry of Health to care for the guests and crew members quarantined on board the Diamond Princess due to a Coronavirus outbreak. “Princess has implemented measures to ensure the safety and well-being of everyone on board including limited movement inside the vessel, minimum interaction between people, new safety procedures, provision of protective equipment as well as unlimited internet access to allow guests and crew to communicate with their family and loved ones,” the statement reads.

Puyat admitted that the tourism industry had been hit hard by the spread of the deadly virus and the temporary travel ban imposed by the government. She, however, gave assurances that the country remains a safe place for travel. “We would like to assure the public, especially our foreign and domestic tourists that the Philippines remains a safe destination for travel,” Puyat said. Tourism Congress of the Philippines President Jose “Jojo” Clemente said the agency held talks with airlines, hotels and resorts stakeholders on the rollout of discounts by as much as 50 percent of their published rates. “Hopefully, before the end of the week, we will be able to roll out very good rates for hotels and air fares,” Clemente said. He added that most of the stakeholders are willing to give promo fares and discounted rates for at least six months. During a public hearing by the Senate tourism committee chaired by Sen. Maria Lourdes
Nancy Binay, Tourism Undersecretary Arturo Boncato Jr. said if the travel ban continues, the monthly revenue loss would increase to P15 billion. This prompted the Department of Tourism to promote domestic tourism. Boncato said the department also urged local government units to conduct seminars to spur tourism. "

Feng Luzhao, a researcher with the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said that at a press conference that aerosol transmission refers to the mixing of the virus with droplets in the air to form aerosols, which can float for long distance and cause infection after inhalation. Medical workers gesture to each other through the window in Zhangzhou Municipal Hospital in Zhangzhou, Southeast China’s Fujian province, on Feb 2, 2020. [Photo/Xinhua]But there is no need for the public to panic since no evidence showed that the new virus could be contracted by aerosols, he said, adding that the most common transmission routes of the novel coronavirus are found during direct transmission, which is caused by inhalation of air close to a patient who sneezes and coughs. He suggested the public to open windows to help with ventilation at least twice a day, which is effective to lower the risks of getting infected. Feng also said that the possibility of getting infected by consuming fruits and vegetable contaminated by the virus via direct transmission or contact transmission is relatively low. "

,"February 12, 2020",nCov,Alli sorry on viral nCoV post,Agence France-Presse,"LONDON: Dele Alli has apologized for posting a social media video which has prompted a Football Association probe after the Tottenham star appeared to joke about the coronavirus. Alli’s Snapchat video showed him wearing a face mask in an airport departure lounge with the message ‘Corona whattt, please listen with volume’. The 23-year-old moved the camera towards an Asian man before showing a bottle of antiseptic hand wash captioned ‘This virus gonna have to be quicker than that to catch me’. The video, apparently taken while Alli was on holiday during the Premier League’s current winter break, was subsequently deleted after several complaints were made. With the coronavirus having claimed the lives of over 900 people in mainland China, the FA are reported to have written to Alli to ask him to explain his post. The England midfielder could face a ban or fine and he tried to limit the damage by apologising in a video on the Chinese social media platform Weibo. “Hi guys, it’s Dele; I just wanted to apologise on my behalf for the video I posted on Snapchat yesterday,” he said. “It wasn’t funny and I realised that immediately and took it down. I let myself down and the club.” The FA’s guidelines around media comments and social media posts remind participants that it will consider charges under Rule E3 if it is felt that someone has acted in an improper manner or brings the game into disrepute. Manchester City’s Bernardo Silva was banned for one game and fined £50,000 earlier this season after what was deemed an inappropriate tweet to team-mate Benjamin Mendy. AFP "
,"February 11, 2020",nCov,Tsinoy business group urges more tourism investments,Tyrone Jasper C. Piad,"THE government and private sector should increase their investment in local tourism as tforeign tourist arrivals fall on account of the outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus acute respiratory disease (2019 nCoV ARD), the Federation of Filipino Chinese Chambers of Commerce and Industry Inc. (FFCCCII) said on Tuesday.  “The FFCCCII urges government and all sectors to invest and upgrade Philippine tourism facilities during [the] slowdown in arrivals….” FFCCCII President Henry Lim Bon Liong said in a statement. The statement comes after several airlines have canceled flights to and from China and its nearby territories as a safety precaution. First breaking out in the city of Wuhan in China’s central Hubei province last December, the virus claimed more than 1,000 lives, including one in the Philippines; infected more than 42,000; and spread to more than two dozen countries as of Tuesday. The group said it maintained its gross domestic product (GDP) growth forecast of 6.5 percent for this year despite the outbreak affecting tourism and trade. Prior to the outbreak, FFCCCII pegged GDP growth at between 6.5 and 7.5 percent. “We are still at the start of the new year. There are still hopes of the whole world coming together cooperating with our major trading partner, China, in winning this war against nCoV,” Lim said. “We also believe that the economic and demographic fundamentals of the Philippines are very strong. Also we have faith in the government’s enlightened macroeconomic and fiscal reforms, which support resilient and inclusive economic growth,” he added. Lim also said his group was also optimistic that the Asian economy would be able to recover quickly from the setback caused by the coronavirus. The Chinese-Filipino business community remains keen on investing in the Philippines, noting that sentiment is still upbeat because of the government’s massive infrastructure drive, according to him. “We [Chinese-Filipino] entrepreneurs are long-term investors and are patient. Our community has weathered centuries of [the] tumultuous past ups and downs of the Philippines,” the FFCCCII chief said. Lim also urged the public to refrain from spreading false information about the virus, as this could cause unnecessary panic. “We call upon the public to remain calm and vigilant, cooperate with government authorities, promote daily health and good hygiene practices, uphold social peace and political stability, refrain from spreading unverified information or fake news and any racist defamations harmful to society,” he said.

,"February 11, 2020",nCov,FDI net inflows at 2-month low,"Mayvelin U. Caraballo, TMT","Foreign direct investment (FDI) net inflows dropped to a two-month low of $623 million in November 2019 despite rising from a year ago, central bank data showed on Monday. The amount was the lowest since September’s $566 million, but up 14.6 percent from the $543 million in November 2018. In a statement, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) attributed the year-on-year rise to the increase in all FDI components. In particular, it said net investments in debt instruments recorded net inflows of $380 million, 11.4-percent higher than the $341 million in November 2018. Similarly, net investments in equity capital grew by 12.9 percent as equity capital placements of $174 million more than offset equity capital withdrawals of $19 million, the BSP added. Placements during the month mostly came from the United States, Thailand, Japan and South Korea. These were largely invested in the financial and insurance, and real estate industries. Reinvestment of earnings also increased by 35.1 percent to $88 million during the month. In a comment, Union Bank of the Philippines chief economist Ruben Carlo Asuncion said the marked consecutive improvements in FDI net inflows may be attributed to better investment prospects beginning October 2019, such as the first phase of the trade deal between the US and China, which was signed last month. “It is significant that the potential of a trade deal between the two biggest world economies began in October and most likely affecting the general atmosphere of global trade including world markets,” he explained. With improved global trade prospects, Asuncion added the likelihood of the BSP reaching its target of $6.8 billion for FDI net inflows is very high. Moreover, he also highlighted that higher FDI net inflows can translate to more job opportunities for Filipinos. “More opportunities means more opportunities to augment personal incomes,” the economist said. The higher November net inflows, however, failed to boost the year-to-date tally, which dropped by 29.9 percent to $6.41 billion from $9.15 billion in the first 11 months of 2018. “Concerns over the global economic outlook continued to curb FDI as investor confidence remained muted,” the BSP said. For instance, it noted non-residents’ net investments in debt instruments declined by 25.2 percent to $4.65 billion from $6.22 billion. Also, net equity capital investments contracted by 60.4 percent to $845 million from $2.13 billion. Equity capital infusions in the 11-month period came mainly from the US, Japan, Singapore, China and South Korea, and were for the financial and insurance, real estate, and manufacturing industries. Reinvestment of earnings, meanwhile, reached $913 million, up by 14.4 percent from the
$798 million registered in the first 11 months of 2018. Looking ahead, Asuncion said many significant events have hampered the prospects for improved FDI this year. “Although China is only 2.0 percent of total FDI in 2018, the novel coronavirus outbreak may impact investment flows not just from China, but also from other sources,” he pointed out. As China is already four times bigger in terms of its economy compared to the time when the severe acute respiratory disease-coronavirus broke out in 2003, Asuncion added “the way that China is more intertwined with the global economy may spell softer FDI growth this year but may become in higher compared to 2019.” "
,"February 11, 2020",nCov,The nCoV epidemic: Dress rehearsal for the real thing,The Manila Times,"NUMEROUS commentators, myself included, have written that the world reaction to the 2019 novel coronavirus (nCoV) is more than a bit overwrought, given the relatively benign nature of the infection when compared with other, more common ailments such as influenza or tuberculosis. That is still a valid judgment; “hysteria” is still the appropriate word to describe how the media, the public, governments and the world economy are responding to the situation. We should not, however, simply dismiss the response, because it is actually turning out to be quite instructional. Unfortunately, the lesson seems to be that unless 21st-century humanity makes some fundamental changes in its nature, we’re all doomed. The nCoV is, as various health authorities have explained it, a type of influenza virus, a strain of a fairly common family of viruses that includes the viruses that cause sudden acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome. They are called coronaviruses because somebody thought they look like little crowns under a microscope. These kinds of viruses are dangerous because they are durable, which makes them capable of spreading in a variety of conditions; they can mutate fairly rapidly; and they can easily mutate into a form that makes cross-species contagion possible. A form of coronavirus will most likely cause the next true pandemic – most scientists consider it a when, not if scenario — on the same scale (or worse) of the Spanish Flu in the aftermath of World War I. In that sense, the nCoV epidemic is a dress rehearsal for “the real thing.” Except for not being particularly lethal (the mortality rate since the beginning of the outbreak has remained steady at about 2.2 percent), nCoV has all the characteristics of a virus that could cause a pandemic: It began with an animal-to-human cross-infection; is transferred fairly easily from person to person; and is spreading faster than new cases can be contained, at least near its source. Thus, how the affected countries and the global public health infrastructure handle the nCoV outbreak is a good illustration of how it would handle the inevitable real pandemic. And that is not a pretty picture, at least so far. China has been aggressive in trying to stop the spread of the virus, and that has actually gone pretty well; the virus is still spreading rapidly, but at a far slower rate than it would be had China not acted quickly to isolate badly affected areas and prevent the movement of people. On the other hand, China has handled public information poorly, and from the very start of the crisis has been playing catch-up in terms of marshaling the resources and facilities to treat large numbers of infected patients. Beyond China, the response of most governments has been inept, and profoundly so in some cases, such as the Philippines. The World Health Organization (WHO) about a week ago complimented the Philippine government on its response to the nCoV outbreak, which was so unjustified one has to wonder if the WHO was confused about which country they were talking about. The government initially tried to downplay the seriousness of the outbreak; was slow to act, for completely irrelevant reasons, on restricting travel from China; and its public messaging has been uncoordinated, with too many self-important officials issuing contradictory and sometimes completely wrong statements. Public anxiety would be very hard to control under any circumstances in a pandemic scenario, but what the government has and has not done has only aggravated it in the current situation. The media, for its part, has also only added fuel to the fire, primarily by uncritically reporting everything every official says and repeating dimensionless statistics, like so many stenographers, rather than trying to develop a contextual, factual narrative. Financial markets, being sensitive to current events, have behaved as one might expect, retreating in the face of a perceived global threat. It has not helped, however, that economic policymakers have, instead of trying to calm markets, only added to uncertainties by unnecessary and untimely estimates of the outbreak’s impact. Most stock markets have made up for much of their initial losses ― after all, if someone is selling off stocks, it means someone else is buying them ― but volatility is the real problem; consumer and business confidence is encouraged by stability, but falls off when markets fluctuate rapidly.
If none of these things change before the real pandemic strikes, the prospects for orderly human survival will suddenly look very grim. Obviously, anyone with anything to do with managing an epidemic should take lessons from what is happening now, and make appropriate changes. However, as has been pointed out by many observers already, the current experience shows this country seems to have not learned anything from its experience with SARS two decades ago, nor from the more recent non-human African swine flu epidemic, and so there is little reason to believe that it will learn anything from nCoV. ben.kritz@manilatimes.net

The EU ministers discuss ways to prevent the virus’ spread and “adopt conclusions in relation to the EU response to the novel coronavirus outbreak.” Last week, German Health Minister Jens Spahn suggested at a meeting with his French counterpart Agnes Buzyn that Europe impose restrictions on travelers from China. In Japan, another 65 people aboard the quarantined Diamond Princess cruise ship have been diagnosed with novel coronavirus, the Health Ministry said. The Diamond Princess has been in quarantine since arriving off the Japanese coast early last week after the virus was detected in a former passenger who got off the ship last month in Hong Kong. “Test results from 103 people have now come out and 65 of them are confirmed positive for the new coronavirus,” the ministry said in a statement without giving further details such as their nationalities. Authorities have continued to test people for the virus where “necessary,” the statement added. The cruise ship operator said 66 people had been newly diagnosed, mostly Japanese, but there were also Australians, Filipinos, a Canadian, a Briton and a Ukrainian. In the Philippines, the number of patients under watched rose to 313, according to the Department of Health (DoH). Health Undersecretary Eric Domingo said among the 313 patients under investigation (PUIs) for the new coronavirus were 183 Filipinos and 99 Chinese. “Majority of the PUIs are Filipinos who have come in contact [with carriers of the 2019-nCoV],” Domingo said in a news briefing in Manila.

THE chief of the World Health Organization (WHO) was somewhat infelicitous when he used the image of an iceberg in his latest update on the coronavirus outbreak. “Iceberg” will induce people to remember the ill-starred Titanic. Instead of preventing panic or calming emotions, the image could drive people up the wall. Specifically, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned on Sunday that confirmed cases of the 2019 novel coronavirus acute respiratory disease (2019-nCoV ARD) being transmitted by people who have never traveled to China could be “the tip of the iceberg.” “Tip of the iceberg,” according to the Cambridge English dictionary, means “the small part that can be seen of something which is really much larger than it seems.” Mr. Ghebreyesus reports that there are confirmed cases of nCoV being transmitted by people who have never traveled to China. And this, he says ominously, could be just the “tip of the iceberg.” The WHO chief’s remarks came as members of a WHO-led “international expert mission” flew to China on Monday to help coordinate a response to the outbreak that has so far infected more than 40,000 people and killed 908 in the country. “There’ve been some concerning instances of onward #2019nCoV spread from people with no travel history to [China],” Ghebreyesus tweeted Sunday, using the virus’ provisional scientific name. “The detection of a small number of cases may indicate more widespread transmission in other countries; in short, we may only be seeing the tip of the iceberg,” he said. While the virus’ spread outside China appears to be slow, Ghebreyesus warned it could accelerate. “Containment remains our objective, but all countries must use the window of opportunity created by the containment strategy to prepare for the virus’ possible arrival,” he said. Outside mainland China, there have been more than 350 infections reported in nearly 30 places. There have been two deaths, one in the Philippines and the other in Hong Kong. The WHO-led mission to China is being headed up by Bruce Aylward, a veteran of previous health emergencies, Ghebreyesus said. Aylward oversaw the WHO’s 2014-2016 response to the Ebola epidemic in West Africa. WHO said in recent days there had been “some stabilizing” in the numbers of new cases of the coronavirus in China. But the UN agency cautioned it was too early to say if the virus had peaked. China virus cases rise again
The news from china, according to the Associated Press, is troubling. China reported a rise in new virus cases on Monday, possibly denting optimism that disease control measures, including isolating major cities, might be working, while Japan reported dozens of new cases aboard a quarantined cruise ship. The mainland death toll rose by 97 to 908 in the 24 hours through midnight Sunday and 3,062 new cases were reported. That was up 15 percent from Saturday and broke a string of daily declines. A government spokesman had said Sunday those declines showed containment measures were successful. The operator of a cruise ship quarantined in Yokohama, near Tokyo, said an additional 66 cases were found aboard. That is in addition to the 70 reported earlier. Japan Health Minister Katsunobu Kato said the Japanese government was considering testing all 3,711 passengers and crew on the Diamond Princess, which would require them to remain aboard until results are available. Health authorities are scrambling to deliver medicine requested by more than 600 passengers. “We are doing the utmost to keep everyone in good health,” Kato said. The fatality toll from the new virus has passed the 774 people believed to have died in the 2002-2003 epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), another viral outbreak that originated in China. The total of 40,171 cases on the mainland of the new virus vastly exceeds the 8,098 sickened by SARS. Businesses are gradually reopening following the Lunar New Year holiday, which was extended to discourage travel in an attempt to contain the virus, but they face heavy losses. At the Sanyuanli market in Beijing, the Chinese capital, shoppers in face masks mixed with delivery drivers who were collecting orders of meat, fruit and vegetables. Stalls were stocked with pork, mutton, seafood and vegetables. “The number of customers here is down a lot, maybe by more than half,” said Liu Ying, who sells walnuts, cashews and other specialties. “But you can see a lot of people calling in orders, so we’re slowly getting busy again.” Asian stock markets slid Monday following warnings that investor optimism the disease and its economic impact were being brought under control might be premature. China’s central bank announced a 300-billion-yuan ($43-billion) fund to make low-interest loans to producers of medicine and medical supplies or other companies involved in fighting the virus. Over the weekend, the government promised tax cuts and subsidies to farmers, supermarkets, producers of medical supplies and companies that contribute to anti-disease work. China’s leaders are trying to keep food flowing to crowded cities despite the anti-disease controls and to quell fears of possible shortages and price spikes following panic buying after most access to Wuhan and nearby cities was cut off. Consumer inflation spiked to an eight-year high of 5.4 percent over a year earlier in January, driven by a 4.4-percent rise in food costs, the government reported Monday. Food prices rose 1.4 percent from the previous month. “It appears that supply disruptions and hoarding due to the coronavirus outbreak helped to keep food prices elevated during the week after Chinese New Year, when they would normally drop back,” Julian Evans Pritchard of Capital Economics said in a report. Death of whistleblower ignites calls for reform
The death of a whistleblowing doctor who was reprimanded for warning about the 2019-nCoV has sparked rare calls for political reform and free speech in China. Li Wenliang, an ophthalmologist in Wuhan, the epicenter of the coronavirus epidemic, died from the disease last Friday over a month after he first raised the alarm about the SARS-like virus. He was one of eight physicians punished by Wuhan police for “rumor-mongering.” But after his death struck a collective nerve, a number of academics have spoken up to demand more freedoms in China. At least two open letters demanding free speech have circulated on social media since the 34-year-old’s death — one signed by 10 professors in Wuhan. Li’s efforts “vigorously maintained the interests of the country and society,” read that letter, which has since been censored on Weibo, China’s Twitter-like social media site. “Put an end to the restrictions on freedom of speech,” it demanded, and “openly apologize” to Li and the seven other doctors punished for discussing the emergence of the virus in December. The other letter — signed on Friday by an anonymous group of alumni from the prestigious Tsinghua University in Beijing — called on authorities to “guarantee the constitutional rights of citizens.” “Resolutely oppose making political security the top priority — that is an extremely selfish goal of a small organization!” it said. The letters are a rare call for political reform in China, a country where dissidents are often jailed and criticism of the government is quickly scrubbed. Many references to the two letters had been removed from Weibo by Sunday. Li — diagnosed with the virus on February 1 — said in a Weibo post in late January that local police had forced him to sign a statement agreeing not to commit any more “law-breaking actions.” He said police had summoned him after he saw test results from some patients suggesting a SARS-like virus and reminded colleagues in a group chat to take stronger precautions. Since his death, Beijing has sought to quell public anger by positioning the doctor as a hero. Criticism is being deflected toward local authorities in Hubei province, who are taking the bulk of public anger over the handling of the epidemic. China’s anti-graft watchdog announced Friday it was sending a team to Wuhan where it would investigate “issues involving Dr Li Wenliang reported by the masses.” There’s more news to report, some on how the Chinese leadership is being criticized, but this should wait for another column. yenobserver@gmail.com "

,"February 11, 2020",nCov,Duterte vs Trump over VFA: An epic battle in the making,Antonio Contreras,"ANTONIO CONTRERAS DESPITE pleas from senators, and the public disclosure made by Foreign Affairs Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr. about the benefits that the Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA) with the United States brings to the country, the President is hell-bent on abrogating it. But, unlike his war on drugs, it would appear that the President might not have popular support on this issue. Many people perceive that this move is nothing but his personal vendetta. His dislike for the US is seen by many less as emanating from nationalist outrage or from policy disagreements than from personal pique, like his rift with the ABS-CBN television network. Many suspect that his pivot towards China is a move to spite the US. But these are biased speculations. What is certain is that most people are against his move to cancel the VFA. Even his diehard supporters, many of whom are still pro-US at heart, could no longer cheer him. His haters from the left who also hate the US could not find it in their hearts to cheer him. Only the truly blindly loyal Duterte diehard supporters (DDS) or rabidly anti-US, and Sen. Ronald “Bato” dela Rosa, whose US visa cancellation triggered the President’s latest tantrum, support the move. And many in the military are reportedly angry. And while the military may not be as vocal, the public anger is more palpable. What heightens the anger and resentment is the fact that the President chooses to spend time on the VFA in the face of the threat from the 2019 novel coronavirus acute respiratory disease. Added to this is the horror, even disgust, that many people felt at the initial reaction of the Duterte government toward the outbreak, where it appeared to be more concerned about not offending China than in protecting the health and safety of the people. The President is valorizing China’s kindness by ignoring its attacks on our sovereignty, but is willing to abandon the VFA’s benefits because he considered the US’ cancellation of dela Rosa’s visa as an attack on our sovereignty. When the President issued a threat to cancel the VFA, it appeared that the US ignored him, seen in the glaring absence of a formal statement from Washington D.C., or even from the US Embassy in Manila. It would not be totally unreasonable to speculate that either he was ignored because the US saw it as another tantrum fit that will just pass, or that US President Donald Trump was busy and preoccupied with his impeachment. And now, despite opposition from the Senate, and disclosures from Locsin about the value of the VFA, the President gave a firm order that the US be formally notified that he will cancel the agreement. Some DDS are scoffing at people critical of the move, and in their usual idolatrous optimism argue that their “Tatay Digong” is just raising our leverage to negotiate a new deal. The risk of this, however, is if Trump calls his bluff and decide to let the VFA go and move to Indonesia or Malaysia, or even Vietnam, to seek new defense alliances with corresponding VFA-like arrangements. What is interesting is that Trump and Duterte may in fact be both children of their own brands of populism, political idolatry and bullying. Both are able to exact blind loyalty from their political base, and both are enabled by and are riding on the backs of political institutions that they have emasculated. Donald Trump committed acts that even Republican senators who voted to acquit him conceded as patently wrong. The US House of Representatives impeached him, but the US Senate, dominated by Republicans and without the benefit of calling witnesses, acquitted him. The vote to impeach was partisan, but the vote to convict, which failed, was nevertheless bipartisan with Utah Sen. Mitt Romney breaking away from his Republican colleagues and joining the 45 Democrat and two independent senators. However, while Trump was acquitted, almost everyone except the Trump Republicans believe that he was not exonerated. What is certain is the prevailing horror by a public whose trust has been betrayed first by Trump who undermined US interests by pressuring the leader of a foreign country at war with Russia to pursue his personal agenda, and then second by Senate Republicans, who except for Romney, ceded their power to check presidential abuse of authority to Trump. Had we been in a less idolatrous situation, President Duterte canceling the VFA against the good advice of the Senate would be a clear case of grave abuse of authority and betrayal of public trust. The case would even be made more compelling if it is proven that the main beef of the President against the US is merely personal. But like the Republicans in the US Senate, one can safely say that our Congress, at least as it stands on its relationship with President Duterte, has become spineless and has practically ceded its power as a co-equal branch of government. At least in the US, the House has the Democrats, and Speaker Nancy Pelosi who had the boldness to literally shred Trump’s State of the Union Address for all the public to see. Unfortunately, we do not have a Pelosi. All we have is Speaker Alan Peter Cayetano and his pro-Duterte supermajority. And now, Trump has just been acquitted, and has since been cocky and reckless with his newfound feeling of invincibility. This is not a man who will easily cave to threats, even if they emanate from the Philippine President. What we may be witnessing is an epic battle between Trump and Duterte over the VFA. If that happens, it will be a classic duel between an arrogant one fresh from winning an impeachment trial and an angry one throwing a tantrum and symbolically shredding the VFA the same way Pelosi literally shredded her copy of Trump’s state of the union address.

,"February 11, 2020",nCov,China in crisis: The death of a young doctor,Frank Ching,"Frank Ching THE death of a Wuhan doctor who was reprimanded for sounding the alarm last December over a looming health threat created a firestorm, and the Chinese government quickly moved to control the narrative by announcing that it would investigate “issues raised by the people in connection with Dr. Li Wenliang.” The emotional outpouring was immense. The official China Daily reported that “hundreds of millions” of people had voiced their views on social media platforms after the 34-year-old ophthalmologist succumbed to the virus that he had warned others about. The stakes are high and by no means limited to health issues. The Communist Party’s seven-man Politburo Standing Committee, at a meeting on February 3, asserted that the outbreak posed “a major test of China’s system and capacity for governance.” That is to say, the party’s future hung in the balance. Hours after the doctor’s death was disclosed, the State Supervisory Commission, the top anti-corruption body, announced that with the approval of the central government it was sending a team to Wuhan. No details were provided. Many social media postings proclaimed Li a martyr and denounced Wuhan authorities for having silenced him and seven other physicians for daring to alert others to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like disease, now officially dubbed the 2019 novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory disease by the World Health Organization. Others called for freedom of speech, as guaranteed in the Chinese constitution. Before such postings were censored, they were viewed by millions of people. The Chinese government and local authorities have been pointing fingers at each other for covering up the deadly disease in the early weeks, when the virus conceivably could have been contained if the government had acted and the public alerted. Clearly, one task of the supervisory commission will be to pinpoint responsibility for the actions taken against Dr. Li. The Wuhan Central Hospital where Li worked, the Wuhan Health Commission and the police will probably all be investigated. After all, even before the doctor was summoned by the police to be reprimanded on January 3, he was hauled in at 1:30 a.m. on New Year’s Eve by the Health authority. Then, when he went to work a few hours later, he was questioned by the hospital’s Inspection Section, which asked him if he acknowledged his mistake. And all because he sent a message, “7 confirmed cases of SARS,” to a medical school alumni WeChat group on December 30. To placate the public and to make the point that local authorities, not the central government, had covered up the initial outbreak, some Hubei officials are likely to be punished, including possible prison sentences. But free speech and other systemic changes are unlikely. Hopefully, the party will realize that rigid centralization, with provincial officials fearful of reporting bad news, is in the long run not in its own interest. In the immediate aftermath of Dr. Li’s death, the Chinese government sounded tolerant, even to the point of acknowledging that it may not be perfect. The national broadcaster, China Central Television, adopted a conciliatory tone in its commentary the day of the doctor’s death. “Some of Li Wenliang’s experiences reflect our shortcomings in epidemic control and response,” it said. “We should learn from our mistakes, further improve the national emergency management system, and improve our ability to handle urgent, difficult, dangerous and heavy tasks.” That hardly sounded like a recipe for wide-ranging reform. However, a commentary in the Global Times went to the heart of the issue. It said Chinese society should “reflect on why the doctor’s alert was not appreciated in the beginning” and why the whistleblower “was reprimanded instead.” That is a question that deserves an answer. Was what happened to Dr. Li and the seven other doctors in Wuhan an aberration? It would appear not. Last Friday (February 7), the Health Times, a newspaper under the People’s Daily, disclosed that police in Wenshan, in Yunnan province, had detained five medical workers on a vague charge relating to spreading information on the coronavirus outbreak. No details were provided as to what information was disclosed. What is going on? It would be good if the supervisory commission team’s remit allows it to go beyond what happened in Wuhan to what the country as a whole can learn from that experience. After all, the Chinese people are paying a high price for the lesson: The death toll as of Monday morning was higher than 900, far greater than the toll taken by SARS in 2002 to 2003.

,"February 11, 2020",nCov,Small businesses in China affected by virus,Agence France-Presse,"BEIJING: Wang Li’s guesthouse sits a stone’s throw from the Great Wall, an idyllic setting for a weekend getaway. But in these uncertain times of the new coronavirus, Wang and her family are the only occupants. The 35-year-old woman now spends her days disinfecting Yingfangyuan Farmhouse and its empty restaurant near Beijing, as millions of people across the country stay home, either under government orders or out of caution. As the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) claims more lives and infects thousands of people every day, it is also taking a toll on the country’s small businesses that rely on spending from China’s growing middle-class. “We used to be able to have up to 10 tables of guests a day during this period,” she told Agence France-Presse. “There is no one now.” While she usually earns around 10,000 yuan ($1,400) during the Lunar New Year holiday, her business was closed this year. “We rely on this for our livelihood. We can only wait for the epidemic to pass,” she said, noting that she will face problems if the situation persists for more than two months.
“I don’t have other (backup) plans,” she added. Fewer buyers Across Beijing’s rural outskirts, guesthouses, restaurants and tourist attractions have been deserted for almost two weeks. The Great Wall and Ming dynasty tombs remain closed and people are urged to stay home — with many working remotely even after the Spring Festival break ended. Many bus and train services have been suspended across the country, and central Hubei province, the epicenter of the outbreak, has effectively been locked down. Supermarkets are struggling to sell their food as families have enough after stocking up for holiday gatherings that have not been held — in line with officials’ advice. At the Shijihualian Supermarket in Heishanzhai village, boxes of Lunar New Year goods, including food items such as persimmons, remain stacked and unsold. “They are bought as gifts, but people have not been visiting their relatives this year,” said its shopkeeper surnamed Yang. “With no relatives to host this year, it will take time for them to deplete their supplies,” the shopkeeper said. With analysts warning that the virus could cut into the country’s already slowing economy, China’s central bank has urged financial institutions to continue stepping up support for small and micro enterprises. But this has not stopped business owners from fretting over an uncertain future. Adding to the isolation of rural communities, villages have closed themselves off from “outsiders” in a bid to ensure the 2019-nCoV, which has claimed more than 900 lives, stays out.

,"February 11, 2020",nCov,Virus transforms daily life on Hong Kong’s fearful streets,Agence France-Presse,"HONG KONG: Hunkering down in cramped apartments and raiding supermarket shelves for food and masks, Hong Kongers are fretting about the future, as the coronavirus sweeps one of the world’s most densely populated cities. Many in the Asian financial hub of 7 million — where the 2002 to 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak killed 299 people — are weighing up their options against an unseen danger. “I feel like I’m in a washing machine with other pregnant women trying to figure out what to do,” says Natalie Belbin, 35, who is expecting her first child and frantically considering her choices. Her baby is due in early April, a period some experts warn could be the peak of the outbreak. Hong Kong’s already under-pressure public hospitals have asked partners and family not to attend births to reduce pressure on wards. Some expectant mothers in WhatsApp groups are scraping together cash to go private, while others have traveled overseas or are considering it. Belbin is leaning towards staying the course, despite knowing her partner may not be able to be there. “I’ve accepted that,” she said. “But my main concern now is whether the baby will be safe in the hospital.” Many of Hong Kong’s inhabitants are having similar discussions about life in a city that has firsthand experience of a deadly outbreak. In 2002 and 2003. SARS swept through hospitals and homes. The epidemic left profound psychological scars and saddled locals with a deep distrust of authorities in Beijing, who initially covered up the outbreak. Panic buying and protests
With 36 cases of the 2019 novel coronavirus acute respiratory disease confirmed so far, one of whom died, everyone fears a repeat. At the most extreme end, fear and distrust of authorities have sparked extraordinary, and at times unnecessary, scenes of panic. Supermarket shelves in many districts have been stripped of hand sanitizers, toilet paper, rice and pasta, spurred by false rumors of shortages that the government has condemned. An acute paucity of surgical masks is real however, with long queues whenever a consignment comes in. At one pharmacy last week a crowd of 10,000 people turned up, some camping out overnight. Kris Choi, a new mother, said trying to find masks is all her neighbors talk about these days. One 70-year-old neighbor was looking for ways to make her dwindling stock last longer. “I wanted to stop her from washing the surgical masks, but I don’t have more to share with her as I have elderly parents and a child to look after,” Choi told the Agence France-Presse (AFP). Attitudes have hardened compared to the citywide solidarity that permeated Hong Kong during the SARS outbreak. Police have clashed with protesters opposed to arrivals from mainland China or quarantine facilities in their neighborhoods. One planned quarantine block was even firebombed. Thousands of medics, including frontline doctors and nurses, went on strike last week calling for the border to be sealed. Ghost town
Hong Kong’s unelected pro-Beijing leaders eventually closed most land border crossings and began quarantining anyone coming from the mainland from Saturday. But even before the current health crisis, anti-government sentiment was at an all-time high after seven months of seething and often violent pro-democracy protests. The perceived slow response — and failure to stockpile enough masks despite the city’s previous experience with SARS — has only added to public anger. And the outbreak is also changing daily life in more mundane ways. With schools closed, children are cooped up in a city of notoriously small apartments. Teachers are trying to roll out online classes, playgrounds are empty. University students already had months of classes disrupted by the protests. Final-year students now fret about whether they’ll even graduate. Many Hong Kongers are avoiding the office and working from home. While the streets are far from deserted, they are eerily quiet in a city where a casual walk to the shops can often feel like a rugby match. For those that venture out, the pavements are uncharacteristically walkable, the subway commute refreshingly quiet and the traffic jams unusually absent. But for business owners — especially those in the tourist and entertainment sectors — the virus has only compounded their woes after the political unrest. Ila Ng has owned a bar in Lan Kwai Fong, the city’s most famous nightclub street, for 15 years. “It’s like a ghost town, it’s really depressing,” she told AFP, with takings since the outbreak down 50 percent. In the last few months, she has laid off three part-time staff and cut four live music nights to just one. Only a sympathetic landlord and a host of regular customers have kept her bar afloat. “We’re just hoping by summer it (the virus) will be contained,” she said. AFP "
,"February 10, 2020",nCov,nCoV toll surges past SARS deaths,Agence France-Presse,"BEIJING: The death toll from the novel coronavirus surged past 800 in mainland China on Sunday, overtaking global fatalities in the 2002 to 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic, even as the World Health Organization (WHO) said the outbreak appeared to be stabilizing. With 89 more people dying — mostly in Hubei, the province at the center of the outbreak — the toll is now higher than the 774 killed worldwide by SARS, according to official figures. The latest data came after the WHO said the last four days had seen “some stabilizing” in Hubei, but warned the figures could still “shoot up.” THEY’RE BACK Health personnel in protective suits meet the Filipinos who were flown from Wuhan in China to Clark City in Tarlac, where they will be quarantined for two weeks. CONTRIBUTED PHOTO Almost 37,200 people in China have now been infected by the virus, believed to have emerged late last year in Hubei’s capital Wuhan, where residents are struggling to get daily supplies because of sweeping transport restrictions and instructions to stay inside. The epidemic has prompted the government to lock down whole cities, as anger mounts over its handling of the crisis — especially after a whistleblowing doctor fell victim to the virus. With much of the country still not back at work after an extended Lunar New Year holiday, cities, including financial hub Shanghai, ordered residents to wear masks in public. Michael Ryan, head of the WHO’s Health Emergencies Program, said the “stable period” of the outbreak “may reflect the impact of the control measures.” While the death toll has climbed steadily, new cases have declined since Wednesday’s single-day peak of nearly 3,900 people nationwide. On Sunday, the number of new cases was just over 2,600. Public anger
Millions of people are under lockdown in Hubei in a bid to stop the virus from spreading. “The local government asked people to stay at home as much as possible, but there is not enough goods in shops each time we get there, so we have to go out frequently,” said a woman surnamed Wei, whose husband was infected. Wang Bin, from the Ministry of Commerce, said challenges included poor logistics, price increases and labor shortages. “It is difficult for the market supply to reach normal levels,” he admitted on Sunday. In Hubei province, there are five days of guaranteed pork and egg supplies, and three days of vegetables, he added. Melissa Santos, a student from the Dominican Republic living in Wuhan, said she planned to go out to buy food for the first time in a week Sunday. “I am a bit worried,” she bared. “I have read that the virus can be transmitted very fast, in a few seconds.” China drew international condemnation for covering up cases during the SARS outbreak, whereas the measures it has taken this time have been praised by the WHO. Ian Lipkin — a professor at Columbia University who worked with China on the SARS outbreak — said earlier intervention could have made a key difference. “This virus was percolating along without anyone realizing it was there,” he added. If the quarantine measures have been effective, the epidemic should peak within the next fortnight, Lipkin added — but he warned there is also the risk of a “bump” in numbers when people return to work. “If, in fact, the methods for containment have been adequate or effective at all… I think we will start to see some dramatic reduction in China around the third week of February,” he said. Lipkin added that warmer weather would help to slow the number of cases. Global fears
Wuhan has converted public buildings into makeshift medical centers, and built two new field hospitals. But Wuhan resident Chen Yiping said her 61-year-old mother has severe symptoms and is still waiting for a hospital bed because “there are too many people in need of treatment.” The first foreign victim in China was confirmed this week when an American diagnosed with the virus died in Wuhan. The only fatalities outside the mainland have been a Chinese man in the Philippines and a 39-year-old man in Hong Kong. Air China announced Saturday it would cancel some of its flights to the United States, including from Beijing to New York and Washington. Sixty-four people on board the Diamond Princess cruise ship off Japan’s coast have tested positive, with all passengers told to stay inside their cabins to prevent further infection. AFP "
,"February 10, 2020",nCov,Scientists race to develop vaccine,Agence France-Presse,"SINGAPORE: Scientists from the United States to Australia are using new technology in an ambitious, multimillion-dollar drive to develop a vaccine in record time to tackle China’s 2019 coronavirus outbreak. The new virus has spread rapidly since emerging late last year in China, killing more than 800 people in the mainland and infecting over 37,000. Cases have been reported in two dozen other countries. Coming up with any vaccine typically takes years and involves a lengthy process of testing on animals, clinical trials on humans and regulatory approvals. But several teams of experts are racing to develop one quicker, backed by an international coalition that aims to combat emerging diseases, and Australian scientists hope theirs could be ready in six months. “It is a high-pressure situation and there is a lot of weight on us,” said senior researcher Keith Chappell, part of the group from Australia’s University of Queensland. But the scientist added that he took “some solace” knowing several teams around the world were engaged in the same mission. “The hope is that one of these will be successful and can contain this outbreak,” he said. But even a timeframe of six months looks agonizingly slow with the virus, believed to have emerged from a market selling wild animals, killing close to 100 people every day in mainland China. Efforts are being led by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), a body established in 2017 to finance costly biotechnology research in the wake of an Ebola outbreak in West Africa that killed more than 11,000 people. With a mission to speed up the development of vaccines, CEPI is pouring millions of dollars into four projects around the world and has put out a call for more proposals. Attack the virus
The projects hope to use new technology to develop vaccines that can be tested in the near future. The body’s Chief Executive Officer Richard Hatchett said the aim was to start clinical testing in just 16 weeks. German biopharmaceutical company CureVac and United States-based Moderna Therapeutics are developing vaccines based on “messenger RNA” — instructions that tell the body to produce proteins — while Inovio, another American firm, is using DNA-based technology. DNA- and RNA-based vaccines use the genetic coding of the virus to trick the body’s cells into producing proteins identical to those on the surface of the pathogen, explained Ooi Eng Eong, deputy director of the emerging infectious diseases program at the Duke-NUS Medical School in Singapore. The immune system learns to recognize the proteins so that it is ready to find and attack the virus when it enters the body. The Australian researchers are using “molecular clamp” technology invented by the university’s scientists that allows them to rapidly develop new vaccines based solely on a virus DNA sequence. French scientists at the Pasteur Institute are modifying the measles vaccine to work against the coronavirus, but do not expect it to be ready for about 20 months. Meanwhile, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention has also started developing vaccines, according to the state-run Xinhua news agency. Risks versus benefits
Health authorities weigh the risks and benefits in vaccine approvals and if there is a public health emergency, the process could be shortened, said Ooi. But he added that “paradoxically, if the situation improves, then actually the pathway for vaccines would be longer.” “If there’s a lot of these new coronavirus cases around, then you accept some risk, because of the tremendous amount of benefit you can derive, whereas if there are not many cases, the tolerance for risk would be very low.” While there is no vaccine for the coronavirus, some doctors are trying out a potent brew of anti-retroviral and flu drugs to treat those infected, but the science is inconclusive as to whether they are effective. Ultimately, scientists may end up in the same situation they were during the 2002 and 2003 outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) — it died out before a vaccine could be fully developed. A close cousin of the new coronavirus, SARS spread around the world and killed nearly 800. But Ong Siew Hwa, the director of Acumen Research Laboratories, a biotech company in Singapore, said efforts to develop a vaccine for the new virus should continue even if the outbreak ends. “I think a vaccine will definitely be important,” she said. “If it’s not in time for this round, it is important for the next time.” AFP "

Health authorities in the Asian financial hub said the crew and a similar number of passengers had been released from a quarantine imposed due to fears that some staff could have contracted the deadly virus on a previous voyage and passed it on. FINALLY Passengers queue up to finally disembark from the World Dream cruise ship at the Kai Tak cruise terminal in Hong Kong on Sunday, where 3,600 people had remained confined aboard for days as authorities conducted health checks due to the outbreak of the new coronavirus in mainland China. AFP PHOTO The World Dream carried three Chinese passengers to Vietnam between January 19 and 24 who were later found to be infected with the SARS-like coronavirus, which has killed more than 800 people in China since it emerged in December. The government grounded the ship on its arrival in Hong Kong Wednesday while tests were carried out on the crew, but said the passengers need not undergo examination as they had no contact with the three sick holidaymakers on the January trip. First found in the city of Wuhan in central China last December, the virus has infected more than 36,000 people on the Chinese mainland and at least 26 in Hong Kong. The passengers and crew isolated on the vessel had been expecting to stay aboard until Tuesday after Hong Kong authorities said testing would take at least four days. But chief port health officer Leung Yiu-hong said Sunday “all tests have results this afternoon and are all negative.” He added that passenger testing was deemed unnecessary because they were at relatively low risk. All 3,600 onboard will not be required to self-quarantine after leaving. Hong Kong on Saturday began enforcing a 14-day quarantine period on all people arriving from mainland China in a fresh bid to curb the spread of the virus. The city’s health minister Sunday morning said 468 people had so far been ordered to stay at home, in hotel rooms or at a government quarantine camp since the policy took effect. AFP "

Cpt. Sherwin Joseph Sarmiento, spokesman for the Armed Forces of the Philippines’ (AFP) Health Service Command, on Sunday admitted that a number of soldiers and their family members were confined at the infectious ward of the V Luna Memorial Medical Center in Quezon City. The soldiers or their kin recently traveled to China and its special administrative regions — Hong Kong and Macau. The Philippines has banned travelers from China following the nCoV outbreak. Sarmiento refused to say how many patients under investigation (PUIs) or persons under monitoring (PUMs) are at V Luna, invoking the Data Privacy Act and confidentiality for hospital patients. There are no provisions, however, in the Data Privacy Act that forbid the disclosure of number of patients and even in the confidentiality principles. He later admitted it was the AFP’s Public Affairs Office (PAO) that instructed him to withhold the figures. “The AFP-PAO told us not to disclose the figure, at the same time, [the patients’] classification whether they are a military man or a dependent,” Sarmiento said. Asked about the number of PUIs at V Luna, Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana said the first patient to be screened was the wife of a Marine colonel. “[The wife came back] on January 20 and five days later, [she] developed coughing and her one-year-old baby had a fever,” he added. The entire family, including the colonel whom he did not identify, was brought to V Luna, he said. Specimens from the wife and the child that were brought to the Department of Health (DoH) for testing turned out to be negative, prompting attending doctors to discharge them. Sarmiento said a system was formed by the military’s health services for evaluating the patients to be screened. Doctors were sent to quarantine sites, which he said were isolated wards inside the military hospital. “We have an isolation ward, which is the infectious ward of V Luna Medical Center. This is a separate building from the hospital’s main building,” Sarmiento pointed out. The ward was originally built to house soldiers or their dependents who have measles. Home
On Sunday, 30 Filipinos from Wuhan City in China — ground zero of the nCoV, arrived on a chartered flight at the Haribon Hangar in Clark Air Base, Pampanga. The arrivals were 29 adults and one infant. A 10-man team from the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) and DoH fetched the Filipinos from Wuhan’s Tianhe International Airport. Accompanying the repatriates were two members from the Philippine Consulate General in Shanghai, three members from the DFA Office of the Undersecretary for Migrant Workers’ Affairs and five DoH personnel. Buses brought the arrivals to the Athletes’ Village in New Clark City in Capas, Tarlac, their home during the 14-day quarantine period. Foreign Affairs Undersecretary Brigido Dulay on Saturday said 56 persons, including seven spouses and four infants, had confirmed their intent to join the repatriation flight. But only 30 Filipinos took the flight. The DFA did not reply to The Manila Times’ query about what happened to the 26 other Filipinos. The DFA repatriation team hired a vehicle to visit neighborhoods with Filipino residents in Wuhan and handed out grocery items and basic necessities. Even before the arrival of the Wuhan repatriates, local officials of Capas had protested their being kept at New Clark City, saying they pose a health threat to residents. On Sunday, Interior Secretary Eduardo Año said the Capas officials should instead open the village for help. He admitted that the decision to use the Athletes’ Village in New Clark City as a quarantine was a “sudden” one because the first choice, the Mega Rehabilitation Drug Center in Fort Magsaysay, Nueva Ecija, lacked amenities. The Athletes Village is isolated and would not affect the daily lives of people residing in the area, Año said. “They (Capas officials) should just help instead of complain,” he added.

,"February 10, 2020",nCov,Whistleblower’s death ignites calls for political reform,Agence France-Presse,"BEIJING: The death of a whistleblowing doctor who was reprimanded for warning about the new coronavirus has sparked rare calls for political reform and free speech in China. Li Wenliang, an ophthalmologist in Wuhan — ground zero of China’s virus epidemic which has killed more than 800 — succumbed to the disease on Friday over a month after he first raised alarm about the SARS-like virus. He was among eight physicians punished by Wuhan police for “rumor-mongering.” Li Wenliang AFP PHOTO But after his death struck a collective nerve, a number of academics have spoken up to demand more freedoms in China. At least two open letters demanding free speech have circulated on social media since the 34-year-old’s death — one signed by 10 professors in Wuhan. Li’s efforts “vigorously maintained the interests of the country and society,” read that letter, which has since been censored on Weibo, China’s Twitter-like social media site. “Put an end to the restrictions on freedom of speech,” it demanded, and “openly apologize” to Li and the seven other doctors punished for discussing the emergence of the virus in December. The other letter — signed on Friday by an anonymous group of alumni from the prestigious Tsinghua University in Beijing — called on authorities to “guarantee the constitutional rights of citizens.” “Resolutely oppose making political security the top priority — that is an extremely selfish goal of a small organization!” it said. The letters are a rare call for political reform in China, a country where dissidents are often jailed and criticism of the government is quickly scrubbed. Many references to the two letters had been removed from Weibo by Sunday. ‘Law-breaking actions’
While the World Health Organization and other experts have heaped praise on China, saying it took decisive steps to try to contain the virus, critics say precious time was lost by early inaction from the local government. Li — diagnosed with the virus on February 1 — said in a Weibo post in late January that local police had forced him to sign a statement agreeing not to commit any more “law-breaking actions.” He said police had summoned him after he saw test results from some patients suggesting a SARS-like virus and reminded colleagues in a group chat to take stronger precautions. Since his death, Beijing has sought to quell public anger by positioning the doctor as a hero. Criticism is being deflected towards local authorities in Hubei province who are taking the bulk of public anger over the handling of the epidemic. China’s anti-graft watchdog announced Friday it was sending a team to Wuhan where it would investigate “issues involving Dr Li Wenliang reported by the masses.” “It sends a clear message that the central authorities are determined to get to the truth and hold those responsible accountable,” said the state-run China Daily newspaper in an editorial on Friday. Meanwhile Cui Tiankai, China’s ambassador in the United States, said he was “really saddened” by the doctor’s death. “We are so grateful to him for what he has done in our joint efforts” fighting the virus, Cui tweeted.

,"February 10, 2020",nCov,nCoV impact on PH could be bigger than SARS,"Mayvelin U. Caraballo, TMT","While it is too early to compare the impact of 2019 novel coronavirus acute respiratory disease (2019-nCoV ARD) on the Philippine economy from what it experienced during the similar epidemic in 2003, analysts reiterated that the country’s tourism and export sectors will definitely take a big hit from the outbreak’s effect on China. Looking first into the case of China, Maybank Kim Eng economists Chua Hak Bin and Lee Yu Je said China’s economy of about $14 trillion at present is much larger than its size of $1.5 trillion during the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2003. They added the Wuhan coronavirus is more infectious than SARS although early signs indicate that the fatality rate is lower at 3 percent than the 10 percent of SARS. The numbers of infected will also likely exceed the 8,422 during SARS, but the number of deaths will likely be lower than 774. People crossing a street in Hong Kong on Sunday wear protective face masks as a preventative measure after a coronavirus outbreak that began in the Chinese city of Wuhan. The previously unknown virus has caused alarm because of its similarity to the severe acute respiratory syndrome, which killed hundreds across China and Hong Kong in 2002 to 2003. AFP PHOTO Nomura analysts, for their part, stressed the outbreak could deal a more severe blow to China’s economy than SARS in 2003, likely shaving China’s real gross domestic product (GDP) growth by more than 2 percentage points in the first quarter of 2020 from 6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2019. S&P Global Ratings, in the meantime, believes the outbreak “is hitting China’s people and economy hard,” It estimated China’s full-year GDP growth to fall to 5 percent in 2020. As China accounts for one-third of global growth, the credit rating agency said a 1-percentage-point slowdown in the country’s growth rate is likely to have a material effect on global growth. In particular, Capital Economic’s Edward Glossop emphasized that Chinese tourist spending abroad has risen 15-fold from around $17 billion per year around the time of SARS to around $260 billion, or 0.3 percent of global GDP. In the case of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean), Maybank Kim Eng analysts said the region is now more dependent on China’s growth. They added China’s market share of Asean exports was at 14 percent in 2018 against the 6.5 percent in 2003, while tourism share was at 22 percent in 2018 from 7 percent in 2003. Minimal
Locally, Rizal Commercial Banking Corp. (RCBC) economist Michael Ricafort said the impact of SARS on the Philippine economy in 2002 to 2003 was minimal as the country’s GDP still grew at a faster pace of 5 percent in 2003 from 3.6 percent in 2002. However, he said the impact of the 2019-nCoV ARD to the Philippine tourism sector could be larger compared to the SARS outbreak that lasted from February 2003 to July 2003, as some foreigners coming from China, Hong Kong and Macau are now temporarily not allowed to enter the country. To recall, Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez 3rd mentioned earlier that according to the Philippine Statistical Yearbook, tourist arrivals to the Philippines dropped by 1.3 percent from 1.93 million in 2002 to 1.90 million in 2003. Latest data from the Department of Tourism showed the number of foreign tourists in the country reached 7.48 million in the first 11 months of 2019, up 15.58 percent from the year-ago figure. Tourists from China were the second-highest in the period, with 1.62 million. “Foreign tourists into the Philippines could be reduced, especially from China, which is the second biggest source of foreign tourists after South Korea, as well as some reduction of foreign tourist arrivals from other countries amid recent concerns and measures on nCoV,” RCBC’s Ricafort said, going forward. Nevertheless, he noted the Philippine economy, compared to other countries in the Asian region, is less dependent on foreign tourism as a source of economic growth, in terms of the lower number of foreign tourist arrivals and lower US dollar revenues from foreign tourism compared to other countries in recent years. “Thus, the adverse effects of any slowdown in tourism business due to the coronavirus, especially if temporary and eventually contained, could have relatively less impact on the local economy/GDP growth compared to other Asean/Asian countries that are more dependent on tourism and exports as major contributors to their respective economies/GDP,” Ricafort added. For his part, Union Bank of the Philippines chief economist Ruben Carlo Asuncion pointed out the economic impact of the outbreak to the local economy is significant but temporary. He said: “the direct impact would be the movement of people, and tourism will be the immediate one,” adding the sector is connected to retail and other service-related businesses as well, and is a significant part of the Philippine economy. Asuncion also reiterated that Chinese-related businesses, such as Philippine offshore gaming operators, may also be affected because of the temporary travel ban from China and its related provinces. “Aside from tourism, trade, both export and import performance may also be affected momentarily because of the significance now of China as a trading partner. We may see a delay in the improvement of both export and import performances in the first quarter of 2020,” he added. Sharing this view, IHS Markit APAC chief economist Rajiv Biswas, remarked the Philippines will suffer a direct economic shock from the Wuhan virus due to the complete collapse of Chinese tourism to the rest of the world since the beginning of February. “Therefore, the Philippine tourism industry and associated sectors such as hotels and commercial aviation will suffer from the impact of virtually zero tourist visits from China in the coming weeks ahead,” he forecasted. Biswas added the Philippine economy will also be negatively impacted by weaker Chinese GDP growth in the first quarter of 2020, since the shutdown of industrial production for the first half of February will significantly reduce Chinese new orders for imports from other Asian countries, including the Philippines, at least in the near term until the pandemic is brought under control. Security Bank chief economist Robert Dan Roces, meantime, stressed that China has become a principal element of the global economy, making the epidemic substantially more potent for companies reliant on trade with China, and especially the supply chain. But he said contrasting probable losses with those from SARS could be an apples versus oranges comparison, and relative to trade exposure. “We do think that estimated Philippine losses as of now will not be much of a substantial economic loss, but the brunt will be felt by the tourism sector in the near term,” Roces added. Capital Economics analysts, meanwhile, are keeping their 6-percent growth forecast for the Philippine economy as they believe the country “should be relatively insulated from the crisis.” Lastly, global think tank ODI said the Philippines is among the Asian countries that are most exposed to the coronavirus through economic channels. “These countries export more than a sixth of their total exports to China and in some cases 90 percent,” it added.

,"February 10, 2020",nCov,Japan baseball bans balloons over virus fears,Agence France-Presse,"TOKYO: Japanese baseball clubs are banning fans from releasing balloons into the air — to protect people from the fast-spreading novel coronavirus. The Hanshin Tigers, whose supporters have for decades launched the screeching, sausage-shaped balloons while their team limbers up to bat in the seventh inning, put a pin in the tradition earlier this week. Rivals the DeNA BayStars, another club whose fans have adopted the custom, followed suit on Saturday, meaning that the ban will remain for the seven games at their spring training base in Ginowan, on the southern Japanese island of Okinawa, local media reported. The Tigers, one of Japan’s oldest professional clubs, posted on their website that visitors to games should “refrain from releasing jet balloons as part of precautionary measures against the spread of the new coronavirus” at this month’s warm-up games in Okinawa and Kochi prefecture. The club adopted a similar ban during the 2009 outbreak of swine flu. Fans of several other of the country’s 12 professional clubs have emulated the seventh-inning tradition, one of the most colourful sights in Japanese sport. The coronavirus epidemic has killed more than 700 people in mainland China and infected over 34,000. A Japanese man being treated for pneumonia in the Chinese city of Wuhan —where the disease originated — has died from flu-like symptoms consistent with the coronavirus, Japan’s foreign ministry said in a statement on Saturday. Japan had hitherto reported no deaths from the virus, although 64 people aboard a cruise ship carrying more than 3,700 passengers and crew quarantined off Yokohama have tested positive. More than 20 countries have confirmed cases of the coronavirus, and Japan has warned citizens against non-essential travel to China, fast-tracking new rules including limits on entering the country as it tries to contain the spread. The outbreak has hit sport across the region with fears being raised about this summer’s Tokyo Olympics, which begin on July 24. The health scare has led to the cancellation of Olympic qualifying events in China such as boxing and badminton. But Tokyo 2020 organizers and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe have insisted preparations for the Olympics will proceed as planned. AFP "

PUENTEVELLA What happens now if this coronavirus continues to haunt, kill, intimidate, and hurt us yet takes time to heal? Latest speculation I heard this week it might take a year for specialists to produce a cure. The economic catastrophe will be immeasurable. Not only for China, including our beloved country, but worldwide. Even the forthcoming Tokyo Olympics will be affected. Japan is strongly insisting that the Big Games shall continue and everything is set to welcome the world. What happens then to China’s Olympic teams? Speculation? Why not? If China’s athletes cannot or are not allowed to compete in the Games, this will become a totally different story. As if China boycotted the Games. I’m not sure if the International Olympic Committee (IOC) or the Japan Olympic Committee will agree to postponing the Games to another time or month. Japan, unlike our recent SEA Games, has been prepared for sometime now, even the end part of last year. That’s how efficient the Japanese organizers are, since they also hosted the Games successfully in 1964. That became the Renaissance for the Land of the Rising Sun. When everyone around the world, started to love eating sushi and sashimi. And Kobe steak. Absence of Chinese athletes in the forthcoming Olympics will mean a great loss to China yet boost the gains of other countries. For example, in weightlifting, they are targeting seven to eight golds, out of twelve at stake, for both men and women, being the powerhouse every four years. But now, they might not even be allowed to join the Big Games. For one, other athletes from foreign countries maybe intimidated to compete against them in case this epidemic gets worse. What a problem. Year of the wrath?
First we had the earthquakes in Mindanao. Followed by the eruption of the Taal Volcano, that has displaced thousands of helpless families. Then our sports legend Kobe Bryant met an accident. And now coronavirus threatens to destroy China and the world economically and immeasurably. What gives? What’s happening? What’s next? Careful guys. Maybe Senator Ping Lacson had some reason enough to question the so-called “Legacy Commission” after only three years or half of the term for this present administration? As our friend, the late Kobe once said, “You never know when it’s time.” Nobody, but nobody expected anything like this to happen. Now, everybody is washing their hands. Hehe. While some hide their lovely or ugly faces behind their masks. Come to Bacolod, where many wears a mask. Doble Kara. Especially our city officials. Fr. Suarez died happy
Playing tennis when he died, Fr. Suarez died happy doing what he loves most. Since I also play the game with some of his colleagues who also joined and played in his last sponsored tournament in Alabang last week, he usually overextended himself playing three or four sets when he could be satisfied playing at the most in two.

Analysts said the PSEi could slip below the 7,000 level should the situation worsen, but the local bourse was able to regain some strength and climbed its way back to the 7,500 mark. “Concerns over escalating cases of coronavirus also linger which can still weigh in the market,” Alviar said. On the distaff side, she said signs that foreign investors are regaining interest toward stocks could help buoy the market. “On a lighter note, the comeback of net foreign buying this week at around P736 million can give a hint of another upside as bargain hunters, including foreigners, are taking position into fundamentally good companies ahead of the [full-year] 2019 financial results release,” Alviar added.

The outbreak, which has killed more than 800 people and infected tens of thousands across China, has spread to nearly more than two dozen other countries and sparked global concern. Many nations, including Singapore, have barred the entry of travelers who had been to China recently from entering or transiting through its territory to counter the spread of the virus. Despite that ban, the Chinese air force will take part in the air show for the first time. The acrobatic team will participate in the flight displays — the highlight of the biennial event — but more than 10 Chinese companies have withdrawn.

United Filipino Seafarers (UFS) President Nelson Ramirez said the jobs of Filipino crews in cruise ships could be at risk, once cruise lines downgrade their Asian operations because the spread of the dreaded virus. “Most cruise lines are bringing guests and tourists to Asian foreign destinations such as China, Japan, Hong Kong, Korea, Singapore, among others. So how will they operate if the disease originated in China and has already spread in Asia? And cases of 2019 nCov has spiked to mentioned nations. These cruise lines will not compromise the health of their people and guests to the threat of the disease,” Ramirez said. He said almost half of cruise ships’ crew are Filipinos. “The government should look into the matter, as most jobs of these Filipino maritime professionals will be stashed or put on hold. Mabuti kung magawan sila ng paraan ng foreign principals na mai-assign sa European fleet,” Ramirez said. Last Friday, the Norwegian Cruise Line (NCL) which hires thousands of Filipino seafarers through its local agent CF Sharp Crew Management Inc., cancelled the Asia trips this year of the Norwegian Spirit, citing growing concerns over coronavirus. The Norwegian Spirit will not be sailing in Asia from April 15 to December 7 this year. “Please be advised that a full refund will be processed automatically to the form of payment provided at the time of booking. As a goodwill gesture, we have arranged for a future cruise credit, worth 10% toward your future cruise, to be issued,” the company said. There was no immediate information available on where the ship will be sailing. Princess Cruises, whose ship Diamond Princess has been quarantined while in anchorage in Yokohama Bay, Japan, for 14 days, has adjusted its visits to China, its special administrative regions and other Asian destinations. Several weeks ago, Genting’s World Dream, which operates from Hong Kong, reported a huge drop in passenger bookings, from the usual 4,000 to just 800.

,"February 10, 2020",nCov,"Not a race for laurels, but a race against time",The Manila Times,"PERHAPS the most critical and heart-stopping part of the 2019 novel coronavirus acute respiratory disease (2019-nCoV ARD) crisis is the current frenzied effort of scientists and laboratories across the world to develop a vaccine against the virus. As important as news on how many have died or have been infected with every passing day is news on whether the quest for a vaccine has finally proved successful. This is not a race on which country or which scientist is able to develop first a vaccine against nCoV. This is the world and mankind racing against time. Every day that there is still no discovery means more lives lost and thousands more infected and the danger of a pandemic. AFP PHOTO It’s vital, therefore, to telescope what is happening in the research effort. This is what we have pieced together. Scientists from the United States to France to Australia to Singapore are using new technology in an ambitious, multimillion-dollar drive to develop a vaccine in record time to tackle the coronavirus outbreak. As everyone knows, the new virus spread rapidly since emerging late last year in China, killing more than 800 people in the mainland and infecting over 37,000. Cases have been reported in two dozen other countries. Developing any vaccine typically takes years and involves a lengthy process of testing on animals, clinical trials on humans and regulatory approvals. But several teams of experts are racing to develop one quicker, backed by an international coalition that aims to combat emerging diseases. Australian scientists hope theirs could be ready in six months. “It is a high-pressure situation and there is a lot of weight on us,” said senior researcher Keith Chappell, part of the group from Australia’s University of Queensland. But he took “some solace” knowing several teams around the world were engaged in the same mission. “The hope is that one of these will be successful and can contain this outbreak,” Chappell said. But even a timeframe of six months looks agonizingly slow with the virus killing close to 100 people every day in mainland China. Efforts are being led by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), a body established in 2017 to finance costly biotechnology research in the wake of an Ebola outbreak in West Africa that killed more than 11,000 people. With a mission to speed up the development of vaccines, CEPI is pouring millions of dollars into four projects around the world and has put out a call for more proposals. The project hopes to use new technology to develop vaccines that can be tested in the near future. CEPI’s chief executive officer says the aim is to start clinical testing in just 16 weeks. DNA- and RNA-based vaccines use the genetic coding of the virus to trick the body’s cells into producing proteins identical to those on the surface of the pathogen, explained Ooi Eng Eong, deputy director of the emerging infectious diseases program at the Duke-NUS Medical School in Singapore. The immune system learns to recognize the proteins so that it is ready to find and attack the virus when it enters the body. The Australian researchers are using “molecular clamp” technology invented by the university’s scientists that allows them to rapidly develop new vaccines based solely on a virus DNA sequence. French scientists at the Pasteur Institute are modifying the measles vaccine to work against the coronavirus, but do not expect it to be ready for about 20 months. Meanwhile, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention has also started developing vaccines, according to the state-run Xinhua news agency. While there is no vaccine for the coronavirus, some doctors are trying out a potent brew of anti-retroviral and flu drugs to treat those infected, but the science is inconclusive as to whether they are effective. Sadly, this means that in the race against time, the virus is still winning. "

Six personnel will be deployed to the Dumangas port while the other two will be assigned at the Estancia port, where roll-on/roll-off (RoRo) vessels operate, Iloilo Gov. Arthur Defensor Jr. said on Friday. NCOV SCREENING The Department of Health (DOH) and the General Santos City Health Office have set up a screening station at the city international airport to properly monitor arriving passengers for possible 2019 novel coronavirus acute respiratory disease (2019-nCoV ARD) infection. DoH Region 12 reported on Sunday that a patient is currently under investigation for the disease in a hospital in Region 12. PHOTO GRAB FROM THE GENERAL SANTOS CITY TOURISM COUNCIL’S FACEBOOK PAGE Defensor added that the eight were tasked to man the RoRo stations and facilitate the collection of health declaration cards from passengers of the vessels. The blue-colored health declaration card has been activated by the provincial government to keep track of passengers’ travel history and health conditions, among others. “When they arrive at our RoRo ports, our personnel, along with the personnel of the municipality of Estancia or Dumangas will collect [the health declaration cards]. They will examine [the health declaration card accomplished by passengers] and they will relay to the province if there are passengers [who] need to be monitored,” he said. The health declaration card also reflects the personal information and the address of the passengers. “We are doing everything to reduce the risks [of the spread of the virus],” Defensor added. The governor, through an executive order issued last January 23, directed the inspection, clearing, checking of foreign vessels, including the crew, for the 2019-nCoV in their second or subsequent port of entry in Iloilo province by the Bureau of Quarantine. The inspection and accomplishment of health declaration cards are also being carried out in international and domestic flights at the Iloilo International Airport. Along with guarding the ports of entry, Iloilo province has also been preparing its Dr. Ricardo Ladrido Memorial Hospital in Lambunao town, as an identified hospital to handle cases under investigation for the 2019-nCoV. The hospital is qualified to isolate a person with a history of travel to China and exposure to a positive case, manifest signs and symptoms of fever of more than 38 degrees and a history of cough and colds within the last 14 days after the last travel or exposure.

,"February 10, 2020",nCov,Virus outbreak at crossroads? Impact on PH and Asean,Dan Steinbock,"DAN STEINBOCK The 2019 coronavirus outbreak is showing possible signs of steadying, although the number of accumulated cases will continue to rise. The economic impact on the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) and the Philippines will depend on the outbreak’s duration and severity. WITH the new coronavirus — the 2019 novel coronavirus acute respiratory disease (2019-nCoV ARD) — there are now (as of 1 p.m. Wuhan, China time, February 9) more than 37,500 confirmed cases worldwide. If the current pace prevails, that figure could exceed 50,000 next week. And yet, there is something else going on behind the reported figures. Toward possible turnaround?
On the one hand, the number of confirmed cases outside China has been low, barely 350, and there have been only two deaths, both associated with the virus epicenter of Wuhan. While these numbers are likely to increase in the near future, the low starting point suggests that China’s costly and draconian measures may have saved many lives within and particularly outside China. More importantly, the pace of the contagion may be decelerating in China. In international media, the spotlight is mainly on the absolute numbers of accumulated cases and deaths, which are likely to increase. And yet, the relative increase of these accumulated cases has decreased since mid-January. Even more important, the relative daily increase of new cases, which have critical impact on the longer-term duration and severity of the outbreak, may be at a crossroads. The confirmed new cases increased steadily from mid-January, soaring to almost 3,900 on February 4. Since then the numbers have fallen below 2,700. In relative terms, the change has been almost progressive, having plunged from almost 350 percent to negative (see figure). Is the virus outbreak at a crossroads? Confirmed new cases, Jan. 1 to Feb. 8, 2020 The big question is, will the trend prevail. While the data could indicate a possible turnaround in the virus outbreak, there is no assurance that the deceleration will prevail. It is well known that virus trend lines can zigzag. Consequently, complacency in the struggle against the outbreak is no option. Also, all projections rely on data accuracy and presume the absence of adverse mutations within and outside China. Furthermore, the trend lines are predicated on the idea that there will be no new, major outbreaks as people in China begin to return to their homes after the holiday period. Economic impact on Southeast Asia
Since mid-2018, the Asean countries have suffered collateral damage associated with the United States-Sino trade friction, slowing world trade and eroding global growth. Even before the outbreak, regional growth prospects were downgraded by 0.3 to 0.4 percentage points for 2019 to 2020. Now, Southeast Asian economies may face new downgrades associated with the outbreak’s likely economic impact (on the basic scenarios, see my previous Times column of Feb. 3, 2020). Last December, the Asian Development Bank revised its forecast down to 4.4 percent for 2019, but maintained at 4.7 percent for 2020. The latter was predicated on the anticipated mild recovery in China and the US. It will be downgraded. Prior to the virus outbreak, growth forecasts were downgraded for Singapore and Thailand, but upgraded for Brunei and Vietnam, with the remaining Asean economies on track to meet forecasts, despite export declines and weaker investment weighing on growth prospects. In early 2020, downgrades are likely to deepen in Singapore and Thailand, while positive prospects in Vietnam will not prevail. Growth forecasts in Taiwan and East Asia — South Korea and Taiwan — will be penalized, due to anticipated supply chain disruptions, particularly in electronics, machinery and textiles. Growth prospects in Singapore have eroded significantly and will be compounded by the outbreak. The 2020 real gross domestic product (GDP) forecast could be downgraded to less than 1 percent. In Hong Kong, political volatility coupled with the outbreak will extend the technical recession into the first quarter. The rest of Southeast Asia — Malaysia, Indonesia, Laos, Cambodia, Myanmar and the Philippines — will find it hard to stay on track with forecasts. In the past year, softening domestic investment exacerbated export woes in most larger economies — Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand — but domestic consumption held up to cushion the slowdown. Since household spending is the first victim of the virus outbreak, larger economies will not be immune to it. But in each case, the specific country impact will depend on the duration and severity of the virus spread. PH well positioned but not immune to headwinds
Since the Philippines is exceptionally prone to both extreme climate and geological events, Sen. Christopher Lawrence “Bong” Go’s bill for the creation of a Department of Disaster Resilience should be taken seriously. As the outbreak has shown, new calamities are just a matter of time. Proactive preparation matters. The human costs of the virus have so far been negligible in the Philippines. While the number of patients under investigation has climbed to almost 270, confirmed cases remain at three and deaths at two, both associated with Wuhan. But even if human costs can be kept to the minimum, economic impact will be tangible. In 2020, Philippine growth prospects were initially seen as more favorable, In particular, the ramped-up government spending related to the “Build, Build, Build” program was seen to buttress growth. To a degree, structural growth potential and the Duterte government’s economic policies can offset some of the adverse forces associated with the trade wars, the Taal eruption, even the coronavirus outbreak. Yet, new political policy mistakes, such as the 2019 budget debacle, could change the picture. After the set of rate cuts to support growth, lower borrowing costs and liquidity from reserve-rate-requirement reductions can still support domestic demand. As elsewhere in Southeast Asia, the outbreak has already affected travel and tourism. Since China is the second largest source of tourists for the country, the travel ban from the Chinese mainland coupled with the expected 10-percent reduction in visitors from other countries will penalize economic output. The decline is estimated at $215 million within a month by the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA). If the outbreak persists with its current impact level until June, the GDP reduction is anticipated to climb to 0.3 percent, according to NEDA’s chief Ernesto Pernia. If it will prevail until December, the reduction would more than double to 0.7 percent ($2.6 billion). In view of the current outbreak data, the estimate based on a shorter duration still seems more likely. Yet, its economic impact could prove more significant than anticipated. If, however, the outbreak persists until the end of summer, its adverse impact would prove greater than anticipated (on the basic scenarios, see my previous Times column of Feb. 3, 2020). Before the outbreak, the International Monetary Fund projected Philippine GDP growth to rise to 6.3 percent in 2020, underpinned by government spending acceleration and recent monetary policy easing. Meanwhile, above-consensus forecasts hovered at 6.7 percent. Since the domestic drivers of the Philippine growth remain solid, a benign virus impact scenario might not undermine such horizons. Yet, the critical caveat remains. These scenarios depend on the duration and severity of the outbreak — and how smoothly it can be managed in the Philippines.

,"February 10, 2020",nCov,DTI sees higher face mask SRP,Tyrone Jasper C. Piad,"THE Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) is looking into potentially increasing the suggested retail price (SRP) of face masks imported from other countries amid the 2019 novel coronavirus acute respiratory disease (2019-nCoV ARD) outbreak. Trade Secretary Ramon Lopez, in a mobile message to The Manila Times, said the department was “studying” the current SRP and “getting various costings now.” He attributed the possible higher prices to “higher cost abroad.” Currently, SRP range is set between P1 and P8 each. While the DTI has secured a steady supply from a local manufacturer, Lopez said earlier that a Thai firm could readily provide 2 million surgical masks should the need arise. The said company could supply them in a month upon notice. He shared that Medtecs International Corp. Ltd. has committed to provide 100,000 pieces of surgical masks this week and 400,000 pieces per week thereafter. The Bataan-based manufacturer has been stepping up production capacity to produce 2 million pieces monthly. Apart from this, Lopez was also looking into acquiring a supply from India but said that it might take some time before the surgical masks could be imported in the Philippines. “There is another source — India — but it will take them 30 days also to manufacture,” he said. DTI said it was monitoring the prices of face masks, ensuring that sellers were following prescribed prices. There were 18 establishments along Bambang Street, Manila that were found to be violating price prescriptions, Lopez said, noting that cases had been lodged against the said stores already. "
,"February 10, 2020",nCov,Gainers and losers in the time of nCoV,Tita C. Valderama,"Tita C. Valderama WITH the global death toll surpassing that of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) pandemic of 2002 and 2003, there are no signs that the 2019 novel coronavirus acute respiratory disease (2019-nCoV ARD) will soon go away as President Rodrigo Duterte had predicted. As of Sunday morning, nCoV deaths had soared to more than 800, with China registering 89 more on Saturday. The SARS claimed 774 lives in 2003, while the Middle East respiratory syndrome ended with 858 deaths in 2012. In the Philippines, the nCoV death toll has remained at one and the people who tested positive at three, but the number of those being monitored or under observation for possible signs of infection had risen to 267 on Saturday, from 215 last Friday. All of them are Chinese, mostly with travel history from Wuhan, the epicenter of the virus outbreak. On January 30, nCoV had already overtaken the total case count of SARS (8,096 cases worldwide), according to data from https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/. As of Sunday, total nCoV cases had risen to more than 37,500, of which more than 6,100 are in severe condition, with China having the bulk of 6,188 out of 37,198 infected individuals. While most of the cases involved Chinese, specifically those who were from Wuhan City in Hubei province, the first of the two deaths outside China was recorded in the Philippines. The other was in Hong Kong. A Filipino crew of Japanese cruise ship Diamond Princess was the first Filipino abroad to have tested positive for the nCoV. He was reported to be responding positively to treatment in a hospital in Yokohama, Japan. At least 537 other Filipinos on board the cruise ship have been quarantined. On Saturday, another Filipino was reported to have been diagnosed in the United Arab Emirates. Given these numbers and the continuing fears among Filipinos of possible community transmission, government officials led by the President have tried to downplay the effects of nCoV to the economy as a whole. Community transmission means the source of infection can longer be traced and the virus could be anywhere. Duterte, in a briefing to reporters in Malacañang last week, said there was no reason to be hysterical about nCoV because it would soon “die a natural death,” as he cited that there was only one person who died of the disease so far. He was referring to the 44-year-old tourist from Wuhan who died on February 1. His travel companion, a 38-year-old woman, was the first positive case in the Philippines. She was reported to have been discharged from the hospital. Socioeconomic Planning Secretary Ernesto Pernia also brushed off the potential threat of nCoV to the economy as he cited measures that government agencies have taken to contain the virus from spreading. In a way, Pernia said, the travel ban to China, Hong Kong and Macau could even have positive effects on the Philippine peso because it would mean less spending of foreign exchange. For his part, Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez 3rd said the nCoV would not pose a serious enough threat to force a dramatic reduction in the country’s growth estimates. He told senators in a public hearing last week that the administration maintains a gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate estimate of between 6.5 and 7.5 percent for 2020. In 2019, GDP growth slowed to an eight-year low of 5.9 percent, but Duterte’s economic team expressed optimism for a rebound this year in view of the on-time release of the P4.1-trillion national budget. For sure, nCoV’s impact on the economy will be on the tourism sector, given the travel ban on Chinese visitors and foreign nationals who transited through China. Airline companies, hotels, travel agencies and related businesses are expected to be the biggest losers, considering that the country’s top visitors are from China. Among the gainers, on the other hand, are the makers of face masks, hand sanitizers, alcohol and other hygiene products as the demand for these has risen. The Department of Trade and Industry was reported to have announced over the weekend that it was considering allowing an increase in the retail price of surgical mask from P1-P8 to P12-P16 or by as much as 100 percent, following the increase in the prices of raw materials. Shopping malls and restaurants may also suffer a decline in sales as people are discouraged from going to crowded places but online shopping and food deliveries may benefit from those who prefer to stay home. Because there will be losers and gainers, the impact of the nCoV on the Philippine economy may not be significant. However, this episode should prompt a thorough review of the government’s preparedness and response to problems such as this. In the meantime, what we can do is heed the advice of the experts on personal hygiene and in keeping our surroundings clean to prevent viral and bacterial infection of any kind.\ "
,"February 10, 2020",nCov,Central Visayas police chief relieved as killings continue,Marit Stinus-Cabugon,"MARIT STINUS-CABUGON POLICE Brig. Gen. Valeriano de Leon was suddenly relieved as chief of Police Regional Office 7 (PRO-7) on February 6. He served as police regional director for less than four months. Philippine National Police chief Gen. Archie Gamboa cited de Leon’s failure to deliver the expected results in the campaigns against illegal drugs, illegal gambling and rogue cops as reason for his relief. De Leon had taken over the post last October from Brig. Gen. Debold Sinas, who is now the National Capital Region Police chief. Sinas’ 17 months in the Central Visayas police office will be remembered by some as bloody and violent, with at least 324 extrajudicial killings (EJKs) and 133 casualties in police operations in Cebu alone, not counting the many killed in Negros Oriental. However, Sinas is also remembered for his determination to take charge, to make a difference and to reach out to even remote, New People’s Army-infested barangay (villages) in Negros Oriental. General de Leon, I have been told, is pro-life. While this may have made him uncomfortable with the bloody strategy of his predecessor, it doesn’t mean that killings stopped after the departure of General Sinas. There were at least 48 EJKs, 26 homicide/murder and 18 cases of armed attacks where the target survived (though may later have died at the hospital) in Cebu from mid-October to February 6. Deadly shooting incidents have intensified in Cebu since the New Year. In Negros Oriental, there were at least 44 EJK/homicide/murder cases during de Leon’s less than four months as PRO-7 chief. Obviously, the killing of hundreds of drug personalities by police and “unidentified gunmen” did not stop the proliferation of illegal drugs in Cebu. Even if we blame all other crimes on drugs, on what do we blame drugs? Why do people get into the illegal drugs business? Why do people take drugs that destroy the brain and body? Police operations may remove a part of the supply from the market. Arrest or killing of drug users lead to reduction of demand — but the factors that really drive both drug peddling and drug abuse are not addressed. Drug abuse is tragic and pathetic and the sooner we remove the major factors behind this social ill, the better. Poverty and joblessness alone do not explain the proliferation of illegal drugs, neither are they the excuse or alibi for engaging in the illegal business. However, in the Philippine context they are significant drivers of illegal drugs. Are we winning the war on poverty and joblessness? First the good news: the 8.8-percent hunger rate reported in the Social Weather Stations 2019 fourth quarter survey is the lowest hunger rate since 2004. The likely explanation for this is the government’s cash transfer programs that target the poorest of the poor. The conditional cash transfer program reaches about 4.2 million families, while the unconditional cash transfer program grants modest cash subsidies to more than 5 million families. Sharp declines in joblessness in Metro Manila and Luzon resulted in an overall decline in adult joblessness. Urban joblessness is at its lowest in 15 years at 15.3 percent. Joblessness in the Visayas and Mindanao, however, rose. In Mindanao, joblessness in the last quarter of 2019 stood at 20.7 percent. The Visayas still maintains a relatively lower rate at 15.7 percent, but it’s an increase from 11.8 percent in the previous quarter. Self-rated poverty rose to the highest level since 2014. Two out of three families in the Visayas and Mindanao rate themselves as poor. In short, majority of families, while not experiencing hunger, are struggling to make ends meet. The effects of the 2019-nCoV pandemic on the economy could be severe, resulting in more hardship for already struggling Filipino families. The government must work harder to create gainful employment or income-earning opportunities for more Filipinos, find ways to make life better not harder if gains in fighting illegal drugs are to be permanent. ‘Finding the calm in the chaos’
This could be the title of an inspirational lecture on how to cope with the 2019 novel coronavirus acute respiratory disease outbreak, but it is actually the title of Cebuano visual artist Dennis “Sio” Montera’s exhibition at Qube Gallery in Cebu City. It is also the title of one of his paintings. Montera’s works of art come into being in a reverse way, or “addition by subtraction,” according to curator Ricky Francisco. After applying layers of paint on the canvas, Montera scrapes and scratches and peels off the paint “to reveal what is underneath.” The result is surprising — even to the artist himself. While abstract art is confusing, if not disturbing, to some who like to look at familiar objects, one does find calm in what seems like chaos in Montera’s abstract paintings. Even the titles of the paintings are unexpectedly thought-provoking such as “Enjoy the journey, the destination is just a mirage,” “Trust in your own story” and “I will not say yes when my heart says no.” Check out www.siomontera.com and Qube Gallery, Cebu City.

– The Book of Isaiah, 58:7, 9-10 The passing of basketball superstar Kobe Bryant and Wuhan novel coronavirus whistleblower Dr. Li Wenliang, who first alerted Chinese authorities to the 2019 novel coronavirus acute respiratory disease (2019-nCoV ARD), have spurred widespread outpouring of grief and admiration. Though worlds apart in location and vocation, the American sports idol and the Chinese physician both showed the greatness of the human spirit in striving and sacrificing for ideals, not just fame, fortune and fun. Bryant’s annual visits to Manila inspired Filipino youth toward athletic excellence, just as African Americans sought to emulate his story of a high school kid, who was black, Catholic and raised abroad, climbing to the pinnacle of global sport. Even his flaws and failings, from his rape case to his game injuries and intrigues, only made Bryant’s achievements and advocacies for sport and youth more inspiring. Unlike Bryant, Dr. Li’s fame was neither lifelong nor officially cheered. His December online disclosure of the Wuhan infection was the only time the world knew of him and his integrity, professionalism, concern for public health and self-sacrifice. Both that heroic whistleblowing and his death by the illness he exposed felt the heavy hand of government restriction, with the Wuhan authorities detaining him for supposedly spreading false rumors, and state censors delaying news of his demise till after most Chinese had dozed off. Serving the Lord in the lowly Providentially, however, official disapproval toward Dr. Li has spurred the world, especially netizens, to extol and share the life-giving sacrifice and courage of doctors, nurses and other medical workers battling nCoV at great risk to their health and lives. And that message of serving the needy and uplifting the lowly is precisely what today’s Sunday Mass readings are about. The Prophet Isaiah, quoted above, urges acts of compassion and justice for the poor and oppressed. The Responsorial Psalm 112 declares that righteousness, justice and mercy bring light to the darkness. The Apostle Paul’s First Letter to the Corinthians (2:1-5) speaks of imparting the Spirit and power of God, instead of mere human wisdom, to a fallen world caught in the darkness of sin. And in the Gospel of St. Matthew (5:13-16), our Lord calls on his disciples to season and light the world with their faith, hope, love, and holiness: “You are the salt of the earth. … You are the light of the world. … Just so, your light must shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your heavenly Father.” Calvary in Wuhan Christ’s call rings loudest whenever disaster and distress strike, and hordes of victims in desperate need, if not life-threatening conditions must be succored at grave risk to those giving aid. For what is demanded is nothing less than laying down of one’s life for the salvation of the many, as Jesus did on Calvary. We see such Christ-like sacrifice in the disease-ridden streets of Wuhan and other virus-infested cities in China. One online video recounts how countless medical personnel are risking death and taking on immense hardship to bring care and treatment to nCoV patients. One picture gone viral shows a doctor kissing his wife goodbye, both tearful, before he goes to Wuhan, fearing the deadly illness. Other images depict personnel putting on hazard suits covering them from head to foot. They need to write their names on the white protective garments so they can tell who’s who. Along with the names, they also write “Add oil” in Chinese, a common expression of encouragement. To avoid having to remove the heavy, complicated suits during their daily hours of duty, medical staff also wear adult diapers. Plainly, Dr. Li’s heroism is being repeated by the hundreds of healers and caregivers braving the virus in locked-down cities. The Gospel amid the germs Along with diseased bodies, despondent souls are being ministered to. Amid the deathly contagion, Christians are preaching the Gospel messages of God’s love and salvation. As CBN News Asia reports, believers in afflicted cities are sharing the faith despite the threat not only of viral infection, but also official persecution. In Wuhan, Christians are giving out face masks on the streets, telling people of Christ’s love and redemption. Encouraging sermons are also being broadcast on loudspeakers set up on apartment balconies. One believer biked to a pharmacy where he played a sermon on his portable speaker. What would Christians tell the ill and the dying? One Wuhan pastor prays, translated by Chinese Church Sources (www.chinasource.org): “The situation is so critical, yet [we are] trusting in the Lord’s promises, that his thoughts toward us are of peace, and not evil (Jeremiah 29:110, and that he allows a time of testing, not to destroy us, but to establish us.” The pastor declares further: “Christ has already given us his peace, but his peace is not to remove us from disaster and death, but rather to have peace in the midst of disaster and death, because Christ has already overcome these things (John, 14:27), 16:33).
Otherwise, we have not believed in the gospel of peace (Ephesians 6:15), and, with the world, would be terrified of pestilence, and lose hope in the face of death.” Perhaps just as crucial as care and treatment, the desperate ill in Wuhan and other virus-ridden zones need more than ever the hope that there is a future after death, where the deceased shall meet the God Who Himself suffered and died that we may all have eternal life. Amen. "
,"February 9, 2020",nCov,Clueless critics play politics vs global health & WHO,NEW WORLDS,"MARIO FERDINAND PASION One day it may be retold: another unproductive political stunt by the United States Cold War 2.0 campaign against “peer competitor” China was the call made by Hong Kong riot-organizer Joshua Wong for World Health Organization (WHO) Director General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus to resign amid the Wuhan 2019 novel coronavirus acute respiratory disease (2019-nCoV ARD). The reason for Wong’s resignation demand is the praise given by Director-General Ghebreyesus for the early response of China’s top leadership, who have reportedly declared a “People’s War” on the 2019- nCoV ARD. Plaudits for China China has admitted that Wuhan City did not act as quickly as it should have. Recently, western news programs are hyping the death of whistleblower Dr. Li Wenliang, yet many miss providing the complete story, i.e., China’s Supreme Court has already said it was a mistake to quell early “rumors” about the Wuhan virus, the mayor has already offered to resign, Dr. Li died of over-exhaustion from work and people has already made Dr. Li a hero. (How are whistleblowers treated in other countries? How were the United States and United Kingdom soldiers, who exposed the fake news on weapon of mass destruction that was used to justify the Iraq War that has killed over a million civilians, treated? How is the US treating Edward Snowden and Julian Assange, who exposed the illegal activities of the US not only to the world, but to American citizens themselves. Did the Philippine Daily Inquirer, Philippine Star and Rappler report on these?) By declaring a People’s War on the nCoV, President Xi Jingpin has put the health of his people above all other considerations. According to the Chinese communist party paper People’s Daily, Xi had “demanded resolute opposition against bureaucratism and the practice of formalities for formalities’ sake.” Instead, he is carrying out direct and immediate action to put an end to the disease. As of Feb. 6, 2020, just two weeks after Wuhan city imposed a lockdown, about 34,000 cases of the 2019-nCOV had been confirmed, while a total of 1,153 novel coronavirus patients had already recovered and been discharged from the hospital. Some 700 have died of the disease and the average global mortality rate is now established to be around 2 percent. At his first WHO press conference right after visiting China, Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the level of commitment in China was incredible: “Its (China) actions actually helped in preventing the spread of the novel coronavirus to other countries… we shall tell the truth and that’s the truth.…” This statement, and others that followed, is obviously what triggered Joshua Wong’s resignation call, quite possibly upon the urgent whisperings of his western handlers. US H1N1 response pales When we compare China’s action today to the US behavior when the H1N1 swine flu virus was first detected in America in 2009, China’s dedication to the health of its people and the world becomes obvious. Based on US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2010 documents, the US conducted surveillance, hospitalizations and information campaigns, and studied the virus to come up with a vaccine. But it never took the necessary drastic measure of locking down cities to prevent the spread. The tragic result? The US had two waves of the epidemic that infected 59 million Americans, hospitalized 265,000 and killed 12,000. Worldwide, the US Centers for Disease Control estimates that 151,700 to 575,400 people died from the H1N1 virus. Two hundred and six countries and territories reported confirmed infections and 11 to 21 percent of the global population were estimated to have contracted the illness. If only the US had done what China is doing now, the casualties and victims would have been far fewer. Duterte’s measured approach President Rodrigo Duterte has taken the same measured approach of the WHO, as have most Association of Southeast Asian (Asean) countries.  In taking this careful approach — characterized by oppositionists as “slow” and “delayed” — they have not succumbed to the hysteria being whipped up by politically motivated malefactors, panicky and ignorant gossipers, and some genuinely nervous people. Critics of President Duterte’s measured response to nCoV do not wish the nervous among us to understand what the WHO also knows, that is, that panic causes greater disaster. The novel coronavirus crisis must be put in perspective of the whole gamut of considerations, such as, the national and global economy and social peace and order. Bigger impact The most telling negative impact of the coronavirus hysteria and overreaction has come a little late; but nevertheless, it has presented a shock to those demanding “total travel ban” from and to China.  The overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) in China and Hong Kong and those currently in Manila want to go back to their jobs there. In fact, “25,000 [Hong Kong] maids [are] in danger of losing jobs due to the nCoV travel ban…” Banana growers are telling us that China is cutting back on its banana imports due to the coronavirus crisis in the country, and that is costing the Philippines $ 5.5 million weekly. One week into the lockdown of Wuhan and some other Chinese cities, we have started hearing from the Filipino OFWs in those cities, speaking via social media.  Majority of them share they are safe and would rather stay in China. One Filipino teacher aired her frustration with the critics, crabs and grumblers she encountered over the social media and news who were demanding a “total travel ban,” lambasting China and the Chinese. The OFW was very emotional in expressing her appreciation to her Chinese employer and the Chinese government who took very good care of her and other Filipinos. She then lamented at the Filipino crabs and grumblers back home and rallied her countrymates to avoid the negativity, which helps no one, but to spread more love and understanding. China ‘setting a new standard’ in epidemic response The western media has bashed Asean governments for avoiding any overreaction to the unfolding coronavirus crisis. No doubt, these Southeast Asian states are watching the Chinese government’s progress in containing and finding treatments, monitoring the mortality and recovery rate, while readying responses that may be necessary in the future.
Up to this writing, Thailand has not issued a travel ban on Chinese tourists; it is possible that the Thais are concerned about possible lockdowns in Chinese cities that would prevent Chinese tourists from going to Thailand. For example, a recent Fortune magazine headline maliciously implies that Asean countries would compromise health for trade and business: “Coronavirus forces China’s neighbors to make tough choices over health, fear and trade.” That is patently false. Without exception, Asean governments will always put their people’s health and welfare first, including the livelihood of the millions who depend on trade, travel and tourism. Pepe Escobar, a famous globe-trotting investigative reporter, has called China’s responses to the 2019-nCoV crisis as “breathtaking,” while Ghebreyesus has said China is “setting a new standard” for the World in epidemic responses. WHO: The final health arbiter Because of such pronouncements, the Western elements attempting to discredit China will need to discredit the WHO also.  For this reason, such headlines as “China Silences Critics Over Coronavirus Outbreak” (New York Times) and “China Strains to Stamp Out Coronavirus Criticisms at Home” (Wall Street Journal) and other Western outlets that disparaged Director General Ghebreyesus by saying “WHO director defends Chinese over coronavirus criticism…” But what premier expert, professional, impartial and objective institution will serve as chief arbiter to global health issues if not the WHO with its 194 member states? As President Duterte has said, “They (WHO) have all the information… We cannot act on our own. This is something which would require the discipline by everybody… to follow the governing entity which is the WHO….” Mario Ferdinand Pasion is a political analyst, director of economic alliance Phil-Brics (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) Strategic Studies, and the chairman of the Nationalist Filipinos Against Foreign Intervention.

,"February 9, 2020",nCov,Virus Deaths Hit 722 Worldwide,Agence France-Presse,"BEIJING: The death toll from China’s 2019 novel coronavirus acute respiratory disease (2019-nCoV ARD) outbreak soared to 722 on Saturday, including the first foreign victim, as Hong Kong imposed a mandatory quarantine on mainland arrivals to block the spread of an epidemic that has caused global panic. With 86 more people dying in mainland China — the highest one-day jump so far — the toll was closing in on the 774 killed worldwide during the 2002 to 2003 sever acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic. A 60-year-old United States citizen diagnosed with the virus died on Thursday in Wuhan, the city at the epicenter of the health emergency, according to the US Embassy, which did not provide more details about the person. A Japanese man in his 60s, who was suspected to be infected with 2019-nCoV ARD, also died in a hospital in Wuhan, the Japanese Foreign Ministry said, adding that it was “difficult” to confirm if he had the illness. The only fatalities outside the mainland were a Chinese man in the Philippines and a 39-year-old man in Hong Kong. Nearly 35,000 people have been infected by the new strain, which is believed to have emerged in a market selling wild animals in Wuhan last year before spreading across China. The epidemic has prompted the government to lock down cities home to tens of millions of people, as anger mounts over its handling of the crisis, especially after a whistleblowing doctor fell victim to the virus. Vice Premier Sun Chunlan, on a visit to quarantined Wuhan this week, instructed officials to take a “wartime” approach as they implement drastic measures that include combing the city for feverish residents. With panic spiraling around the globe — more than 320 cases have emerged in nearly 30 other countries — researchers were racing to find treatments and a vaccine to fight the virus. Hong Kong began enforcing a two-week quarantine for anyone arriving from mainland China, under threat of both fines and jail terms. Most people will be able to be quarantined at home or in hotels, but they will face daily phone calls and spot checks. The financial hub has 25 confirmed cases with one patient who died earlier this week. The city has been on edge as the virus has revived memories of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak that killed 299 in the semi-autonomous city. Hong Kong officials hope the new measures will virtually halt the flow of people across the border while allowing the city to remain stocked with food and goods from the mainland.
The SARS epidemic left profound psychological scars and saddled residents with a deep distrust of authorities in Beijing, who initially covered up the outbreak. "
,"February 9, 2020",nCov,Want to protect the environment? Stop promoting tourism,Ben Kritz,"TOURISM is one of the most important and successful parts of the Philippine economy, and it is taken for granted by policymakers and analysts alike that expanding the sector is a critical priority. Unfortunately, the greater good demands that the country either take a radically different approach to tourism or put a stop to it altogether, because tourism is destroying the country’s already at-risk environment, to the extent that most other efforts to mitigate or adapt to climate change are probably rendered moot. The good news… There is no doubt that tourism is vital to the Philippine economy. Since 2009, tourist arrivals in the country have been increasing steadily by an average of about 10.6 percent a year; slightly more than 7.1 million tourist arrivals were recorded in 2018, and they were projected to increase to 8.2 million in 2019. Unforeseen short-term disasters like the 2019 novel coronavirus acute respiratory disease outbreak notwithstanding, there is no reason to assume the upward trend would not continue in the coming years, particularly with the construction of new airports and increasing traffic at cruise ports in the country. Domestic tourism is on the rise, as well. The number of domestic tourists reached 110 million in 2018, a 14.1-percent increase from the year-before figure, and well ahead of the target of 89.2 million domestic tourists by 2022 set in the National Tourism Development Plan. In financial terms, tourism contributed P2.2 trillion to the economy in 2018, or roughly 12.7 percent of gross domestic product, and about 5.4 million jobs, according to figures from the Department of Tourism. …And the bad As big a windfall as all that is for the economy, we already gotten a sense of the unwelcome environmental side effects of tourism in the past couple of years, with the closure of Boracay for six months in 2018; and similar, although not quite as drastic measures having become necessary in places like El Nido in Palawan and Panglao in Bohol. The environmental impact of tourism is much larger than we can see, however. A 2018 study that summarized data from 2009 to 2013 (which means, of course, that the current situation is probably worse than the study described) found that international tourism is increasing by about 3.5 percent a year, and accounts for at least 60 percent of all air travel. Airliners currently contribute about 3.2 percent of total global emissions — a figure that will rise to about 12 percent by 2050 if the current growth trends continue. Cruise ships, which tourism authorities and backers here have become quite enthusiastic about in recent years, are environmental nightmares. An average-sized cruise ship of the sort that are visiting the Philippines with increasing frequency burns between 140 and 150 metric tons of fuel a day. That fuel is the lowest-grade heavy oil, and produces copious amounts of harmful emissions. The maritime industry has made efforts in recent years to mandate the use of “cleaner” fuel, but ships are still relatively the most polluting of any form of motorized transport. An even bigger problem is water pollution. Cruise ships generate between 10,000 and 21,000 gallons of sewage a day, much of which is discharged directly into the ocean. To put that in familiar terms, that is the equivalent of an average-sized apartment complex swimming pool, about six meters by three meters by two meters deep. And of course, none of that includes the normal wear and tear each person imposes on the planet in the form of atmospheric emissions, wastewater and solid waste. The Philippines struggles to manage those for its own population; adding the load of eight million or more additional people over the course of a year, even if each of those only stays for a few days, enormously increases the strain on the environment. No safe solution Tourism boosters are not unaware of the environmental implications of tourism, or the fact that environmental responsibility has a considerable amount of market appeal. Thus, the rapid rise of “sustainable” tourism, which comprises a spectrum from “minimizing one’s impact” on one end to actively participating in “environmental mitigation” such as tree-planting or cleaning beaches on the other. So-called sustainable tourism, however, still accounts for only a fraction of all tourism, and even though there is some room for growth, probably always will. That is just as well,because just like mining, some level of environmental harm is inevitable because the activity is inherently harmful, and the only real solution is to simply not engage in it. And just like mining, the economic benefits of tourism are too good to ignore and have, in fact, become necessary. Forms of sustainable tourism, then, become imperfect half-measures. They are perhaps unsatisfying, but at least allow the country to avoid a complete loss in both tourism’s economic and environmental aspects. ben.kritz@manilatimes.net

,"February 9, 2020",nCov,Go: Filipinos in Hubei to follow protocol,Javier J. Ismael,"SEN. Christopher Lawrence “Bong” Go said protocol would be strictly followed concerning the repatriation of Filipinos from Hubei, China. A chartered plane left at 10:15 p.m. on Saturday, and was expected to arrive in the Philippines today. Go added that the welfare of repatriates and the safety of Filipinos in the country were always being considered. SEN. Christopher Lawrence “Bong” Go Go, in a radio interview, told listeners that the Filipinos from Hubei would be treated with utmost care as it was not their fault to be in the center of the 2019 novel coronavirus acute respiratory disease (2019-nCoV ARD) outbreak in China, adding that the public should not be scared as strict quarantine protocols were in place. “Para sa akin naman po, kawawa naman po ang ating mga kababayan na gustong umuwi na. Sundin lang po ng mga opisyal ang protocol. Meron naman pwedeng gawin para di mahawa ang mga kasama d’yan (I pity our countrymen who want to go home. Just follow the official protocols. Utmost care will be made to ensure that those who will accompany them will not be contaminated),” he said. “Ongoing na po ang preparasyon at bukas ng madaling araw, uuwi na sila at tutuloy sila sa New Clark City. ‘Yun ang napagkasunduan ng inter-agency [and Bases Conversion and Development Authority or BCDA]. ‘Yun po ang inofer ngayon. Let’s cooperate (Preparations have been made and they will be home early morning tomorrow and they will go directly to New Clark City. That was the agreement between the inter-agency and the BCDA. That was offered. Cooperate and help for the sake of our countrymen),” Go added. The senator noted that a strict 14-day quarantine process would be followed, quoting Health Secretary Francisco Duque 3rd. He added that Filipinos should show compassion to repatriated countrymen and women from Hubei, and not make them feel unwelcome in their own country. If no one else will welcome them, Go claimed he was willing to accept the Filipinos from Hubei and find a place in Mindanao that could accommodate them during the 14-day quarantine period. “‘Di nababayaran ang lungkot, kailangan nila magtrabaho doon. Kung wala na tatanggap sa kanila, willing ako tumanggap sa kanila, maghahanap po ako ng lugar…sa Mindanao, sasamahan ko po sila, ‘di ako takot mahawa (No amount of money can replace their loneliness. They need to work there. If no one will welcome them, I am willing to accept them. I’ll find a place in Mindanao, I will stay with them, I am not afraid to be infected),” he said. He added that Local Government Secretary Eduardo Año was coordinating with the Health department regarding the concern of locals in Capas, Tarlac where the repatriated Filipinos from China would be quarantined. Go said he could not blame the residents for fearing for their safety, but also encouraged the public that the repatriates needed support and care. When asked if another hearing was needed to address more concerns regarding the 2019-nCoV ARD in the country, the senator said he was willing to hold another hearing at a later date since health officials and concerned agencies should be given time to focus on their jobs and accomplish the tasks at hand to protect the welfare of Filipinos. “Kailangan hayaan muna natin ang inter-agency task force na magtrabaho muna. Mas marami sila dapat gawin kaysa nakaupo sa Senado (Let’s allow the inter-agency to do their job. They have a lot of things to do instead of sitting in the Senate),” Go said, adding that foremost were the issues surrounding the 2019-nCoV ARD situation in the country, such as the need to clarify who actually needs to wear face masks, had been clarified in the previous Senate committee hearing. The senator has also urged Filipinos to continue to be vigilant and follow protocol and advisories from health officials to prevent the spread of the 2019-nCov ARD in the country. "

NADA A man looks at the empty shelves that have leftovers at a local supermarket in Singapore after panic buying swept through the city as the government raised the alert level for a deadly novelcoronavirus in Singapore. AFP PHOTO Since emerging late last year, the virus has killed over 700 people and infected more than 34,000 in China, and spread to many other countries. Singapore, which has reported 33 cases, raised its alert level Friday to “orange’’ — the same as during the deadly 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak, indicating the virus is severe and passes easily between people. The announcement triggered panic in the city-state of 5.7 million starting late Friday, with shoppers — many wearing masks — rushing to stock up on items including rice, noodles and toilet paper. Pictures circulating on social media showed empty shelves in some stores, carts filled with goods and long lines at counters, which continued into Saturday. “I’m afraid that if they further raise the alert level, we will not be able to go out,” a 50-year-old housewife, who did not want to be named, told the Agence France-Presse after leaving a grocery store. The highest level on Singapore’s four-point scale for dealing with disease outbreaks is “red,” one above “orange.” There were, however, ample stocks of other items such as fruit, meat, fish and alcohol. The government urged calm, with Trade Minister Chan Chun Sing saying there was no need to rush out to buy crucial supplies. “There is no risk of us running a shortage of essential food or household items,” he wrote on Facebook. Singapore raised its alert level amid a growing number of virus cases in citizens with no recent travel history to mainland China and no known links to previous infections. "

In his message during Monday flag raising ceremony, January 3, Olivarez said, the City Health Office is closely monitoring the situation and are now in the process of coordinating measures to all its health workers in 16 barangay health centers and hospitals. Olivarez conveyed that Parañaque is also preparing to form its own task force in coordination with the Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG) and the Department of Health (DoH) to implement rigorous infection control protocol to prevent the possibility of escalation of the said virus in the city should there be one. Meanwhile, City Health Officer Dr. Olga Virtusio said, the disease is transmittable between humans through droplets in the air from sneezing, coughing or close personal contact, the reason why it spread rapidly.

,"February 9, 2020",nCov,Bong Go eyes temporary shelter for 50 OFWs,Javier J. Ismael,"SEN. Christopher Lawrence “Bong” Go on Saturday said he would try to find a suitable area in Mindanao for the more than 50 overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) from Wuhan, China if there were strong objections from the Capas, Tarlac local government on the national government’s plan to temporarily house them at the Athletes’ Village in Clark City for their mandatory 14-day clearance period. SEN. Christopher Lawrence “Bong” Go “If no one wants to accept them, I will receive them. I will try to find a place for them in Mindanao. I will accompany them. I am not afraid of  being infected,” Go said in an interview with a DWIZ radio. Go, chairman of the Senate health committee, did not mention a specific place in Mindanao, but said there were many islands in southern Philippines. The OFWs are reportedly scheduled to arrive on Sunday morning at the Diosdado Macapagal Airport (formerly known as Clark Air Base) from Wuhan, the origin of the deadly 2019 novel coronavirus acute respiratory disease (2019-nCoV ARD). But the Capas local government is set to file a temporary restraining order to block the stay of the OFWs at the Athletes’ Village for fear that Capas residents might be infected. Go said he was informed by Health Secretary Francisco Duque 3rd that Interior Secretary Eduardo Año had already talked to the Capas local officials to reconsider their objections. He pleaded for understanding of the OFWs who are considered modern-day heroes of the Philippines. The OFWs, according to Go, work abroad in order to send financial help to their families and suffer deprivation and loneliness as they are away from their loved ones. The government has set a 14-day observation protocol for returning OFWs or citizens or those suspected to have contracted the virus in the country. Government teams, including those from the Department of Foreign Affairs, went to Wuhan aboard a chartered air flight to fetch the OFWs. They are expected to be back in the country early Sunday. Go’s committee conducted a public hearing on the coronavirus scare and conceded that the Department of Health had difficulty “contact tracing” the passengers seated near two Chinese tourists who came from Hong Kong and visited several cities aboard Philippine Airlines (PAL) and Cebu Pacific. One of the Chinese tourists died of nCOV. Duque had blamed the airlines for refusing to give the personal and travel plans of the plane passenger, but PAL and Cebu Pacific belied his claim. Go said he was not inclined to conduct another public hearing on the 2019-nCoV scare to allow officials and personnel of an inter-agency group to do their work rather than sit and watch during the hours-long Senate public inquiry.

THAI VIBE Visitors of the 27th Philippine Travel Agencies Association Expo at the SMX Convention Center savor the moment to feel the vibe of Thailand’s floating market as their backdrop. The event ends on February 9. PHOTO BY JOAN ARELLANO Puyat added that the Department of Tourism was also tapping the country’s top tourist markets like South Korea and the United States. According to the November 2019 report of the Tourism department, South Koreans remain the country’s top visitors at 176,185, a 37.71-percent increase from the 127,935 in November 2018. The US also maintained its place as the third biggest source of tourists, which increased by 4.46 percent, or 82,617 arrivals, compared to 2018. Meanwhile, Philippine Tour Operators Association Inc. President Cesar Cruz reiterated the industry’s “immediate approach” to tap into the domestic market. Cruz said they were currently creating “packages” for main hubs, like Davao and Iloilo, to encourage Filipino and expat travelers to do inter-traveling in the country. “We have resorted to really intensify the domestic market and not just to market, we’re coming out with new packages,” Cruz told reporters on Thursday. “Second-known” destinations, like the provinces of Abra, Apayao, Batanes and Claveria in Cagayan, are also being promoted more, especially among millennial travelers. “We will try to intensify the marketing, not really discourage, but at least make the Filipinos, the local residences, aware that instead of going out now, [they] might as well spend [their vacations in the Philippines]” he said. Cruz also acknowledged that the emergence of the 2019-nCoV and the temporary ban on China and its special administrative regions had “impacted” the tourism sector of the country. He cited reports of cancellations and postponements encountered by major tourist hubs like Boracay, Bohol, Cebu and Palawan. “We don’t know yet for the succeeding weeks or so, it could be more, it could still increase. But at the moment, we still expect the worst scenario, so we’re doing some tactical moves [now]” he said. Cruz also noted that even if the virus would be contained now, the recovery of the industry could last for months. “We could see the impact to last, we see another six months before we can actually recover,” he said.

MIAA General Manager Ed Monreal MIAA General Manager Ed Monreal on Friday appealed to families and friends of airline passengers not to bring highly vulnerable people to the airport — especially children, the elderly, immuno-compromised individuals and those with underlying medical conditions — to protect them from possible exposure to the deadly disease that has resulted in over 700 deaths as of press time. “This call is being made not to alarm the public. This is our simple way of supporting inter-agency efforts to prevent and contain the spread of the virus,” Monreal said. Monreal added: “Let us say our goodbyes at home and not go to the airport in groups when meeting a passenger. It is very hard to fight tradition, but in times like this, everyone should look out for their own safety.” The MIAA is also limiting the issuance of visitors’ passes for the purpose of sending off or meeting passengers. Exception will be given to cases when a companion may be necessary such as medical patients or other related emergency cases, person with disability, unaccompanied elderly, unaccompanied minor and unaccompanied pregnant woman. Government repatriation efforts and activities in fulfillment of government international commitments are also exempted by the MIAA directive. The issuance of passes to VIP rooms will likewise be limited to airport reception of official guests of the government and of foreign embassies, the MIAA said. The airport chief is also suspending familiarization tours, movie/ad filming and other non-airport related activities. "
,"February 8, 2020",nCov,China virus impact could cut 0.7% of GDP,"Mayvelin U. Caraballo, TMT","Women wearing face masks. (Photo by Rene H. Dilan) THE impact of the 2019 novel coronavirus acute respiratory disease (2019-nCoV ARD) outbreak could shave as much as 0.7 percent of the country’s gross domestic product (GDP) if it lasts the entire year, according to preliminary estimates of the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA).  At the #AskNEDA briefing in Pasig City on Friday, Socioeconomic Planning Secretary Ernesto Pernia said if the outbreak “will last for one month, then the effect would be something like 0.06 percent of GDP. And if…up to June, then it would be about 0.3 percent.”
“And if it is up to December or the whole year, it would be about 0.7 percent [of] GDP growth,” he added. First emerging in the city of Wuhan in China’s central Hubei province last month, the 2019-nCoV has claimed the lives of more than 630 people — including one in the Philippines — infected at least 31,000 others and spread to more than two dozen countries as of Friday.
Echoing other economic managers, the NEDA chief said tourism would be one of the major sectors to be hit by the outbreak. Providing context, the Cabinet official said tourism income or expenditure by travelers constitute about 5 percent of the country’s GDP, or about P450 billion of the total P92-trillion size of the Philippine economy. Latest data from the Department of Tourism (DoT) showed that the number of foreign tourists in the country reached 7.48 million in the first 11 months of 2019, up 15.58 percent from the year-ago figure. Tourists from mainland China were the second-highest in the period, with 1.62 million. NEDA’s preliminary estimates on the disease’s economic impact for the first half of the year mirrors the figure projected by the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) on Thursday.
BSP Governor Benjamin Diokno said estimates showed a reduction of a 0.2 percentage point (ppt) in the first quarter GDP and 0.4 ppt in the second, or an average of 0.3 ppt for full-2020 growth. The government aims to record economic growth of between 6.5 to 7.5 percent for the year. Several analysts also estimated that the virus’ impact on the economy would reach between $300 million and $600 million. "
,"February 8, 2020",nCov,PH forex reserves fall to $86.4B in January,"Mayvelin U. Caraballo, TMT","Photos from Xinhua and the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas Facebook page FOREIGN debt servicing by the national government dragged the country’s gross international reserves (GIR) to a two-month low of $86.42 billion at the end of January.  The figure — the lowest since November 2019’s $86.22 billion — was also 1.61 percent lower than the figure posted the previous month, but was 4.77 percent higher than the year-ago amount, preliminary data released by the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) on Friday showed. In a statement, the central bank said the month-on-month decline reflected “outflows arising from the national government’s foreign exchange withdrawal, which was used mainly to pay its foreign exchange obligations.” These were partially tempered by the Bangko Sentral’s net foreign exchange purchases from its foreign exchange operations and income from its investments abroad. In a comment, Security Bank chief economist Robert Dan Roces said latest data meant the GIR buildup in the past year “is paying off, especially from a risk event,” such as the 2019 novel coronavirus acute respiratory disease (2019-nCoV ARD) scare. “Current reserve level still a potent buffer to protect the country from any possible fallout against the [Philippine peso], and lesser linkage with greater China compared with our regional neighbors means the [peso] is more insulated from [the] negative impact of the [2019-nCoV] epidemic,” he added. The latest reserve level was enough to cover 7.6 months worth of imports, lower than December 2019’s 7.7 months, but higher than the 7.1 months a year earlier, respectively.
It was also equivalent to 5.3 times the country’s short-term external obligations due within one year and four times based on residual maturity. Net international reserves, which refer to the difference between GIR and total short-term liabilities, also decreased to $86.42 billion from $87.84 billion a month earlier. GIR are foreign assets readily available to and controlled by the BSP for the direct financing of payment imbalances, and for managing the magnitude of such imbalances. It consists of holdings of gold, special drawing rights, foreign investments, and foreign exchange, including reserve position in the fund. "
,"February 8, 2020",nCov,"BPOs, POGOs face headwinds",Tyrone Jasper C. Piad,"BUSINESS process outsourcing (BPO) firms and Philippine offshore gaming operators (POGOs) might find it difficult to expand thier operations due to lack of economic zones and the coronavirus travel ban, Colliers International Philippines said. Colliers Senior Research Manager Joey Roi Bondoc, in a briefing on Friday in Makati City, said BPO clients and POGOs were seen to continue driving the office market this year, but warned of the challenges both sectors would face. The outsourcing firms, for example, lack Philippine Economic Zone Authority (PEZA)-approved spaces to occupy, Bondoc said, noting that 490,000 square meters (sqm) out of the 564,600 sqm of available lands in Metro Manila are already pre-leased. The remaining 74,600 sqm “could be taken in a single year,” the researcher said. “The government should take a more aggressive stance in approving projects outside of Metro Manila,” he said, noting that this would also be in line with the administration’s vision of spurring economic activities in the countryside. So far, Cebu, Iloilo, Metro Clark and Bacolod have available PEZA spaces of 95,000 sqm, 96,000 sqm, 77,000 sqm and 18,000 sqm, respectively. BPOs have occupied a total office space of 1.77 million sqm since 2016, or an average of 39 percent of total transactions. For POGOs, Bondoc said that their operations might be hampered as a travel ban for passengers coming from China was imposed as a safety precaution amid the 2019-novel Coronavirus outbreak. He said that this would also hinder Chinese employees, who usually operate POGOs, from working here. The vacancy rate could shoot up as high as 7.6 percent should the outbreak totally prevent POGOs from taking up office space this year, Bondoc said. The Colliers researcher, meanwhile, clarified that it was not an alarming rate because it was still below 10 percent. At the same time, Bondoc said the Makati City government recently ordered a moratorium on POGO license issuance which has also affected the office takeup. Metro Manila office stock rose by 8 percent to 11.9 million sqm year-on-year, the bulk of which are in the Makati Central Business District and Bonifacio Global City, Taguig City. "

PHOTO BY J. GERARD SEGUIA Two PUI have died so far, Health Undersecretary Eric Domingo said on Friday. He added that 184 PUI had been admitted to hospitals, 17 had been discharged and nine refused admission. “We are urging everyone, especially the PUI who refused admission, to cooperate with the DoH (Department of Health), their local government units and the Philippine National Police,” Domingo said at a news briefing in Manila. The Health department said the second PUI fatality died of pneumonia, not nCoV. The first PUI death was that of a Chinese man who died of severe pneumonia and human immunodeficiency virus on January 29. “It is our duty as citizens of this nation to assist in protecting the health of our fellowmen. We owe it to the Filipino people to do our part in preventing the spread of this disease and put everyone’s mind at ease,” Domingo said. The country’s first 2019-nCoV ARD case, a 38-year-old Chinese woman, has tested negative for the 2019-nCoV ARD, but is still being confined at San Lazaro Hospital. “We already sent samples for the second test because we need two consecutive tests to be negative before we could discharge the patient,” the Health undersecretary said. The third reported case of the disease — a 60-year-old Chinese woman who went to Bohol and Cebu last January 24 — has been discharged and returned to China on January 31 after her test results came back negative twice. The Epidemiology Bureau said it was already in touch with 441 people who had contact with the Chinese couple, who visited Cebu and Dumaguete City. It is trying to contact 116 other people. The bureau said 379 of 441 contacts were passengers and crew from flights taken by the Chinese couple, while 62 were from hotels, hospitals and other places visited by the carriers. Domingo also announced that 203 people were on home quarantine, while the 32 contacts exhibiting symptoms were now categorized as PUIs. Four of the 116 people who had encountered the 60-year-old carrier also showed symptoms and are now classified as PUIs. The Philippines has stepped up its border defenses against the coronavirus, including more stringent quaratine procedures. On Friday, Sen. Emmanuel Joel Villanueva said workers of Philippine offshore gaming operations (POGO) companies, who returned from areas where there is an nCoV outbreak must also go under strict quarantine procedures. “All government agencies and regulators should issue related guidelines bearing in mind DoH’s protocol as the bare minimum,” added Villanueva, chairman of the Senate Labor and Employment committee. He said the state gaming regulator, Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corp. (Pagcor), which oversees POGOs, must not merely rely on other agencies like the interior department to monitor such firms. “They issue licenses to POGO workers so they can work legitimately, thus it is Pagcor’s job to ensure workers comply with relevant health regulations. If there is any doubt with regard to health protocols, they can always seek guidance from the DoH,” Villanueva added. “We remind POGO operators that they must operate within the bounds of Philippine laws and statutes. Any regulation enforced as a result of the nCoV outbreak takes into consideration public safety and welfare. If they cannot comply with our laws, regulations, and standards, they have no place to do business in the Philippines,” he said. Earlier, the senator called on everyone to cooperate and implement the ban on travelers from China. “The continuous arrival of tourists from China contradicts the necessary precautions we have to take given the situation. It is irresponsible to disregard the ban for profit,” said Villanueva. Allowing tourists from China, particularly Wuhan, to arrive in Boracay island in Aklan is irresponsible, he said. “It exposes workers, other tourists and residents to risk. It strains our limited resources, particularly our capacity to respond to public health emergency.” Also on Friday, Presidential Communications Operations Secretary Martin Andanar said the government had everyone’s safety in mind when it required visitors and even government workers to disclose their travel history and health status. He added that the health form was a “precautionary measure” to stop the spread of the nCoV in the country. “With the public health emergency declaration due to the 2019 novel coronavirus and the additional confirmed case of nCoV in the country, the health declaration form is an additional precautionary measure to ensure the safety and security not just of President Rodrigo Duterte, but [also of] everyone who is working at or visiting Malacañang,” Andanar said. Andanar’s statement came after a declaration form issued by the Office of the President- Events Management Cluster was distributed to Palace visitors and even government officials. The form requires a person to state his name, sex, age, contact number, email address and home address in the country. The person must also identify the foreign countries and Philippine cities he visited in the past 14 days. The declaration form also asks the person if he had been sick in the past 30 days or has experienced fever, colds, cough, sore throat or breathing difficulties in the past 14 days. Anyone who falsifies the document face imprisonment of up to 12 years and a fine of up to P5,000. The Department of Education (DepEd), meanwhile, assured its officials, teachers, personnel, learners, parents, guardians and other participants who are affected by the suspension of various events they will be assisted in refunding or rebooking their flights. “We are currently gathering information regarding passengers and tickets purchased, and negotiating with the airlines for options,” DepEd said in a statement. Concerns were raised on social media after DepEd announced the postponement of regional and national events this month because of the nCoV threat. DepEd urged those who have purchased nonrefundable or nonrebookable plane tickets with the Philippine Airlines and Cebu Pacific to “please standby for further announcements regarding possible ticket rebooking or refund by the airline.” Among activities postponed are the National School’s Press Conference in Tuguegarao City, Cagayan and the National Festival of Talents in Ilagan, Isabela. The student journalism and talent competitions were originally scheduled from February 17 to 21. Also called off were the National Science and Technology Fair on February 10 to 14 and sports meets like the Central Visayas Regional Athletic Association in Dumaguete City, Negros Oriental. All off-campus activities such as field trips and film showings were also suspended, Briones added. Briones said the postponement does not cover the Palarong Pambansa, which is set to kick off in Marikina City in May. WITH JAVIER JOE ISMAEL, JAN ARCILLA AND CATHERINE S. VALENTE "

An additional 41 passengers were found to have contracted the virus, which has killed hundreds of people, most of them in China, and infected more than 30,000 on the mainland. Japanese authorities have so far tested 273 people aboard the Diamond Princess, which was quarantined after a former passenger, who disembarked in Hong Kong last month, was diagnosed with the virus. “The results of the remaining 171 tests came out and 41 tested positive,” Health Minister Katsunobu Kato told reporters. “Today they will be sent to hospitals in several prefectures, and we are now preparing for that.” The newly diagnosed include 21 Japanese, as well as Americans, Canadians, Australians, an Argentine and a Briton. There were more than 3,700 passengers and crew on the ship when it arrived off Japan’s coast on Monday evening. It docked in Yokohama on Thursday to resupply for a quarantine that could last until February 19. Twenty people who were earlier diagnosed with the virus have already been removed from the vessel, including one in serious condition, a health ministry official said, without providing further details. Testing was initially carried out on those who displayed symptoms or had come into close contact with the former passenger diagnosed with the virus. But Kato suggested testing would now be expanded to those “who are susceptible to illness, including elderly people and those with other ailments, as well as those who had close contact with the people newly diagnosed with the virus.” There were no immediate details on how many people would meet those criteria or when the testing might take place. Japan has already reported at least 25 cases of coronavirus aside from the infections aboard the ship, and evacuated hundreds of citizens from Wuhan, the Chinese city where the virus emerged, including on a fourth flight Friday. Passengers on the ship have been asked to stay inside their cabins to prevent new infections, and have expressed confusion and frustration about a quarantine expected to last until February 19. American lawyer Matt Smith, 57, and his wife Katherine, are among the luckier passengers, in a suite with their own balcony. But he told the Agence France-Presse that the 14-day quarantine was a “hard pill to swallow.” “My thought is, the greater number they diagnose on the ship, the greater chance they’re going to find some reason to extend the quarantine,” he added.

But many also used the occasion to demand more liberties in the Communist Party-ruled country, with phrases “I want freedom of speech” and “we demand freedom of speech” appearing on Twitter-like Weibo before being censored. “Chinese people are only allowed one kind of freedom, and that is the freedom given by the country and the Communist Party,” commented one Weibo user. “But clearly it is us who should be the masters of this country’s laws.” Local authorities in Hubei and its capital Wuhan, the city at the epicenter of the crisis, had already faced rare, uncensored criticism online in recent weeks for initially downplaying the magnitude of the outbreak. While the World Health Organization and some experts have heaped praise on China, saying it took decisive steps to try to contain the virus, critics say precious time was lost by the early inaction of the local government. Hubei and Wuhan officials held key political meetings in the first weeks of January. The death toll and number of cases only began to soar afterward, going from one fatality on January 11 to more than 630 barely four weeks later. Li, who was diagnosed with the virus on February 1, said in a Weibo post in late January that local police had forced him to sign a statement agreeing not to commit any more “law-breaking actions.” AFP "

We are concerned about their situation there. No amount of money can pay for their loneliness ang fear in other country,” he added. Go, who heads the Senate Committee on Health, said Bases Conversion and Development Authority (BCDA) President and Presidential Adviser for Flagship Programs Vince Dizon was coordinationg with the Department of Health (DoH) in preparing the Athletes’ Village in New Clark City, Tarlac as a quarantine area for repatriated Filipinos. “Vince Dizon has offered BCDA with all of its facilities at the Athletes’ Village. They are prepared to accommodate the Filipinos coming from China,” he added. He said New Clark City was an ideal quarantine site because it is near the Clark International Airport. According to the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging and Re-Emerging Infectious Diseases, there are 45 Filipinos who will be repatriated from Wuhan. The required documents for the repatriation are being finalized with help from Foreign Affairs officials and Chinese authorities. The repatriation is tentatively scheduled on February 8 and the repatriates are expected to arrive in the Philippines the following day, according to the Department of Foreign Affairs. Helping process the arriving Filipinos are doctors and nurses from the Health department. Personal protective equipment will be provided to the team. The task force said the repatriates must have Public Health Clearance, as well as Customs, Immigration and Quarantine clearance from China. Briefing and counseling for the repatriates will be conducted by the Philippine Embassy. A chartered commercial plane will fly the Filipinos back home. From Clark International Airport, the repatriates will be transported to the Athletes’ Village. Pre-arranged rooms will be assigned to them, packed food will be served by the DoH Regional Office and routine nursing care will be available for their health care needs. Returning Filipinos with developing cases will be brought to the nearest referral hospital. Five DoH-run hospitals in Region 3 will deploy medical teams for the whole duration of the repatriates’ stay at New Clark City. The Overseas Workers Welfare Administration will be in charge of the send-off after 14 days of quarantine. "
,"February 8, 2020",nCov,"Amid the virus crisis, Duterte’s defend-China policy is cross-eyed",Yen Makabenta,"YEN MAKABENTA First word
WHEN the Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague handed down its ruling on the dispute between the Philippines and China over their conflicting claims in the South China Sea, the newly installed government of President Rodrigo Duterte immediately sought to mute national celebration over the verdict, lest it hurt Chinese feelings. Now, with a full-blown global health emergency over another viral outbreak that originated in China, President Duterte is warning the nation against xenophobia toward China and its nationals, and asks to show some sympathy instead during its current travail. The administration has also asked local media to report the crisis with caution, lest they cause alarm among the people. The current policy in the face of a health crisis is cross-eyed and naïve, in much the same way that the earlier policy on The Hague ruling was cross-eyed. At a time when China’s and the world’s attention should be undivided and focused on finding a cure and ensuring stability, our government’s instinct is to divert the people away from the hard realities of the epidemic and the remaining dangers. Scolding the media for criticism of China and full reporting on the crisis is particularly absurd. The media’s duty is to bring full information on the crisis to its publics. It should not be distracted by political concerns. Latest report on the emergency
The latest word on the emergency, as reported by the Associated Press and Agence France-Presse, is troubling. Here is an update. A Chinese doctor who was punished after raising the alarm about the 2019 novel coronavirus acute respiratory disease (2019-nCoV ARD) died from the pathogen on Friday, sparking an outpouring of grief and anger over a worsening crisis that has now killed more than 630 people. At least 31,000 people have now been infected by a virus that ophthalmologist Li Wenliang and colleagues had first brought to light in late December. The disease has since spread across China, prompting the government to lock down cities of tens of millions of people, while global panic has risen as more than 240 cases have emerged in two dozen countries. A quarantined cruise ship in Japan now has 61 confirmed cases. The doctor, Li Wenliang, 34, died early Friday. The announcement of the death by the Wuhan Central Hospital triggered grief on social media — over a doctor who was hailed a hero — and anger over the government’s handling of the crisis. “He is a hero who warned others with his life,” a fellow Wuhan doctor wrote on Weibo after reports of his death emerged. His death also highlights the enormous risks that frontline doctors have taken to treat patients in overwhelmed and under-equipped hospitals in Wuhan, the quarantined city of 11 million people where the virus emerged in December. Medical staff are overstretched and lack sufficient protective gear. Li sent out a message about the 2019-nCoV to colleagues on December 30 in Wuhan — the central city at the epicenter of the crisis — but was later among eight whistleblowers summoned by police for “rumor-mongering.” He later contracted the disease while treating a patient. Analysts have said local authorities played down the extent of the outbreak in early January because they were holding political meetings at the time and wanted to project an aura of stability. The first fatality was reported on January 11. The death toll has since soared to 636, with 73 more reported on Friday and an additional 3,000 new infections. Some 56 million people in Wuhan and surrounding cities have been ordered to stay home, while several countries have banned arrivals from China and advised their citizens to leave. Major airlines have suspended flights to and from the country. Even so, new cases keep emerging. Two cruise ships carrying thousands of holidaymakers in Hong Kong and Japan have been placed under quarantine as authorities test people for infections. On Friday another 41 people tested positive aboard the Diamond Princess in Japan, bringing the total of infected cases on the ship to 61. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said Thursday another cruise ship, the Westerdam, was heading to the country with one confirmed case, and no foreigners would be allowed to disembark. In Hong Kong, 3,600 people spent a second night confined aboard the World Dream, where eight former passengers have tested positive for the virus. Hong Kong has been particularly nervous because the crisis has revived memories of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) that killed nearly 300 people in the city and another 349 on the Chinese mainland in 2002 and 2003. While the death toll continues to rise, experts have stressed that at 2-percent mortality, 2019-nCoV is far less deadly than SARS, which killed around 10 percent of the people it infected 17 years ago. ‘Xenophobia’ against Chinese must stop
The outbreak has stoked a wave of anti-China feeling around the globe, from shops barring entry to Chinese tourists, online mocking of the country’s exotic meat trade and surprise health checks on foreign workers. Manila’s Adamson University has asked all its Chinese students to observe a 14-day self-quarantine as a precaution. Last Monday, President Duterte urged Filipinos to stop stirring up anti-Chinese xenophobia related to the outbreak of the 2019-nCoV that emerged in China last December. He said at a news conference: “China has been kind to us, we can only also show the same favor to them. Stop this xenophobia thing.” Many wonder whether Duterte’s words will be heeded after the coronavirus claimed its first fatality outside China in the Philippines. “They are blaming the Chinese that [the virus] came from China, but it could always incubate in some other place,” said Duterte. He assured the public there was no reason to panic and that “everything is well” in the country. “It is not the fault of anybody. Not the Chinese, not the Filipino, no one,” he added. Hard times for China
That’s not how it looks to the rest of the world. There’s another perspective on the coronavirus outbreak that appears to have escaped the notice and attention of Philippine policymakers. The crisis is much graver and more costly, especially for China. The finger of blame is being pointed at President Xi Jinping and the Chinese Communist Party. Philippine executive officials should pay particular to several recent media reports that are especially disturbing. In Time magazine’s cover story, Feb 6, 2020: “The coronavirus outbreak could derail Xi Jinping’s dreams of a Chinese century,” the magazine reports that the coronavirus crisis threatens to rattle China’s authoritarian apparatus. “A major test of China’s system and capacity for governance,” senior party chiefs called it on February 3. In a Washington Times article, “The economic consequences of the coronovirus outbreak,” (Feb. 3, 2020), Richard W. Rahm writes of the potential negative economic impact on the world economy of a virus outbreak in the world’s second largest economy as each day brings news of more companies shutting down or reducing activities in China. “Large companies, such as Apple and Walmart, have global supply chains. So, a disruption because of a natural or medical disaster or political instability ripples through the entire chain. This leads to temporary shortages and/or price increases until adjustments can be made…” In his New York Times column of Feb. 3, 2020, “Corononavirus spreads, and the world pays for China’s dictatorship,” Nicholas Kristof writes of the dangers of China’s authoritarian model of governance for China and the world. Instead of acting decisively when the city of Wuhan presented symptoms of the coronavirus inspection on December 1, and signs of alarm in medical circles in Wuhan by the end of December, Chinese officialdom acted not against the virus but against the whistleblowers, Kristof wrote. The doctor who died last Friday, had told his WeChat group about the virus and was disciplined by the Communist Party and forced to admit wrongdoing. Instead of being heeded, seven other doctors were summoned for “rumor-mongering” and given “education” and “criticism” for trying to call attention to the public health threat. All these timely articles contain vital information and insights that ought to be considered in Philippine policy making. yenobserver@gmail.com "
,"February 8, 2020",nCov,This is not kindness,Antonio Contreras,"ANTONIO CONTRERAS WHEN officials of the Duterte administration and political supporters both inside and outside Congress warned people not to spread fake news regarding the 2019 novel coronavirus acute respiratory disease (2019-nCoV ARD), some people advised them to fact-check first what President Rodrigo Duterte said in his press conference held late Monday, February 3. However, it is hard to use the words spoken by the President as the basis for fact-checking. It’s either he is joking, or one cannot divine a ready meaning due to his unique, rambling manner of speaking. Either he is not serious, or that there is no certainty in what he is actually saying. It would be terribly difficult to fact-check a joke, and it is definitely a challenge to fact-check something that is not coherent. What is however easy to fact-check is the conspiracy theory video shown by Senate President Vicente Sotto 3rd at the Senate hearing last Tuesday, February 4, that alleged that the 2019-nCoV outbreak is nothing but biological warfare. If one could be chastised for sharing wild theories about the virus in social media, then Sotto, and Sen. Christopher Lawrence Go, who chaired the hearing, should both be reprimanded by the Presidential Communications Operations Office for being directly responsible in allowing an obvious falsehood to be posted not on social media but entered into the official record of the proceedings of the Senate. If there is something that can easily be fact-checked among the claims made by the President during his press conference, it would be the patent falsehood he uttered that China has been nothing but kind to us. This is factually incorrect. It is not an act of kindness for China to claim as part of its territory not only a large swath of our exclusive economic zone (EEZ) in the West Philippine Sea, but also part of our national territory. It is not also an act of kindness to harass and prevent our fishermen from fishing within our EEZ over which they have sovereign rights as Filipino citizens. It is definitely not an act of kindness to send navy ships, coast guard and armed naval militias to block Filipino fishermen from earning their livelihood. One cannot claim that ramming a stationary fishing boat and leaving its 22 crewmembers to drown in open sea is an act of kindness. Worse, it is not an act of kindness to turn the tables around and accuse the Filipino crew of making the first aggressive move and that the Chinese vessel was simply trying to escape them, and in the process accidentally hit the Filipino fishing vessel. But of course, the President and his supporters can always point to the money that China has poured into his infrastructure programs. But these are mostly loans that we have to pay back with interest, which is even much higher when compared to the rates given by Japan, and whose repayment periods are much shorter than what the latter provides. It is certainly not an act of kindness when a bank or a lender gives a loan to a borrower. It is all purely a business transaction. Certainly, it is not an act of kindness when a 5/6 lender holds the ATM card of a borrower and imposes onerously unreasonable and unjust rates. It is not kindness. In fact, it is a crime. It is called usury. China may have acted with some kindness when in giving us grants and financial assistance, which are not to be repaid. But often, these are humanitarian and not development grants, and not in the same magnitude provided by the United Nations, the United States and the European Union, and even Japan and other countries. No. China’s relationship with us is not about kindness, but about its interests being served on a silver platter by our leaders who make us believe that it is in our best interest to just roll over. The equation of the relationship was even clearly articulated by the President himself. He has made it appear that he has no choice but to own China’s interests as also ours simply because the alternative is war. He has repeatedly painted for us the specter of being helpless against China’s might, that we have to befriend it in order for the Republic to survive. The President and his political lieutenants argue that it is not President Duterte’s fault. He was supposedly dealt a bad hand by his predecessor and was abandoned by the US. He has painted himself as totally helpless in the face of China’s might. To those who criticize his submission to China, he and his loyal defenders raise the war bogey as scare tactic. This is precisely why the President and his supporters defend China, even if it is not trusted by most Filipinos. The President dismissed the boat-ramming incident as a simple accident. Amid the threat of the 2019-nCoV, the government appeared to be initially more concerned about China’s feelings than protecting the health and safety of our own people. And in the face of the accusations that China withheld vital information about the disease, an allegation that even Chinese citizens make against their own government, our Foreign Affairs Secretary boldly defended China. The President pleaded that we should reciprocate what he interprets as the kindness of China. And that is exactly what he and his government have been doing the whole time, almost to the point of being unkind to his own people. The initial reaction of the Duterte government to the 2019-nCoV outbreak has made that perfectly certain: China, above anything else. What is uncertain is how politically and economically costly would the 2019-nCoV outbreak be to China, and what would be the repercussions of this to the President and his legacy of kindness towards it. And more uncertain is until when the kindness of the Filipinos toward those who have been unkind to them will last. "

These, she said, are people who have history of travel to China, Hong Kong or Macau but showing no respiratory symptoms and were advised home quarantine. Santiago also advised the public to practice universal precautions on personal hygiene like handwashing and covering of nose and mouth when coughing or sneezing. Meanwhile, Lucena Mayor Roderick Alcala directed the City Health Office through Dr. Jocelyn Chua to set up a direct hotline that would receive all information concerning the dreaded disease. He encouraged all residents to be vigilant and immediately report to them if they know of anybody who has history of travel to China. "

,"February 8, 2020",nCov,New lab begins testing for virus,The Manila Times,"Facility with latest technology capable of handling 10,000 samples a day
A new lab for testing the novel coronavirus that has been causing an increasing number of deaths in Wuhan was put into use on Wednesday, within seven days of construction, and is expected to greatly facilitate diagnoses of the disease. The lab, named Fire Eye, has a floor area of nearly 2,000 square meters and is capable of handling 10,000 samples a day, according to BGI, a leading Chinese company in life science. Test tube with Corona virus name label is seen in this illustration taken on Jan 29, 2020. [Photo/Agencies]It is equipped with the latest facilities and technology developed by the company for safe and highly efficient testing of the nucleic acid of the virus, the company said. The project began construction on Jan 29, according to the Second Harbor Engineering, which is affiliated with State-owned China Communications Construction. Nearly 300 workers and more than 20 vehicles participated in the construction, it said. Zhang Jin, an engineer in the company who was in charge of water supply and discharge for the lab, said a major challenge was to ensure polluted water produced during virus tests would not contaminate the surrounding environment. “To ensure safety, I repeatedly urged construction workers to follow instructions and carefully inspect all the pipelines during construction,” he said. The lab was built amid a rapidly increasing number of pneumonia patients in Hubei province, including its capital city Wuhan, the heart of the epidemic that has put medical facilities in the city under an immense burden to test and diagnose the virus. The number of institutes certified for nucleic acid tests for the virus in Wuhan has increased to 31. Altogether, they are capable of testing 4,000 virus samples every day, according to the city’s health authority. Many hospitals in the city have recently increased staff and put them on shifts to provide services 24 hours a day to handle the large number of virus samples so suspected patients can get confirmed and diagnosed as soon as possible, the city’s health commission said. Liu Juan, a deputy director of the residential committee of Weiqun community, in Wuhan, said due to the large number of patients, some suspected cases in the community cannot get timely nucleic acid tests, which can confirm whether a person is infected. This has delayed diagnoses and treatment for them, she said. "
,"February 8, 2020",nCov,China up against a horrible kind of US missile,Mauro Gia Samonte,"MAURO GIA SAMONTE Last of 2 parts
AS a starter for this concluding portion of the article begun yesterday, here’s a refresher of the ending question of that first part. In its persistent confrontation with China, what could be the overriding question for the United States is: How to beat China without a fight? Direk, the scenarist filmmaker, could not but shudder at the question. The US, in its many war adventures the world over, has been clinging tight to principles in Sun Tzu’s The Art of War: deception, subterfuge, strict secrecy in war strategies, etc. “Let your plans be as dark as night, and when you move, act like thunder,” goes a Sun Tzu dictum. Nobody else in the world knew America had perfected the atomic bomb until it blasted two in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Direk was rather intrigued when, as pointed out above, top US war officials admitted to the world that America is defenseless against Russian hypersonic missiles. In war, you don’t advertise your weakness; psywar is about pretending to be strong when you are weak. It’s not about the other way around, because when you impart to your enemy an image of weakness on your part, it will invite him to make the first strike, and it is never a good strategy for a general to invite a strike from the enemy. Still, it was Sun Tzu who said a good general is one who wins a war without fighting a battle. That the US admitted inferiority to Russia — hence, likewise to China — in the nuclear arms competition, could only indicate that the US is engaged in a maneuver whereby to make its enemies disclose their real strength. China has not taken the bait at all. While Russia has gone to the extent of engaging the US in a proxy war in Syria since 2011, China has persevered in its Belt and Road Initiative as the only way of realizing its vision of a world community of shared future. No nation with such an aim would like to get enmeshed in a world armed confrontation. This is the kind of approach in which China becomes extremely impossible for the US to defeat. For the US’ sake, China just has to be weakened. If this cannot be done through armed confrontation, then cripple China some other way. The first time Direk learned about the current spread of the 2019 nover coronavirus acute respiratory disease (2019-nCoV ARD) was when he read in news headlines about a boy from Wuhan, China being suspected as a carrier of the dreaded virus. Followed in Direk’s stream of consciousness news accounts of other nCoV cases, most of them with suspected victims still being under observation. All of a sudden there appeared before Direk’s eyes another pandemic of sort, similar to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic of 2003. He distinctly remembered that SARS, as news accounts put it, started in Hong Kong — in China. This time around, it started in Wuhan — again in China. “Why?” Direk found himself wondering, “Why is it that every time there is an epidemic of this kind, the apparent starting point is China?” At a loss for an explanation, Direk reeled in recollections of war events that had something to do with chemicals. The Iraqi War was for punishing the Saddam Hussein regime for alleged stockpiling of chemical weapons of mass destruction; no such weapons were found when the US-led coalition forces deposed Saddam and took over Iraq. In 2017, while President Rodrigo Duterte was visiting Russia, President Donald Trump ordered Tomahawk target missiles to hit camps of the Syrian government suspected to be the source of an alleged chemical weapons attack at a rebel camp. Fifty-nine cruise missiles hit their targets, but none of the targets yielded chemical weapons. The point here is that allegations of chemical weapons of mass destruction have all come from the US. Only the US has advanced the idea, so only the US must have the dynamic for unleashing chemical weapons of mass destruction. This was the case in 1945 when in the face of the Japanese intransigent refusal to abide by the Potsdam Declaration that demanded Japan’s unconditional surrender, President Harry S. Truman issued the threat: “A rain of ruin from the sky.” That “rain of ruin” was dropped in the form of firebombs that turned Tokyo, according to one account, into “a giant bonfire.” “The human carnage,” said the account, “was so great that the blood-red mists and stench of burning flesh that wafted up sickened the bomber pilots, forcing them to grab oxygen masks to keep from vomiting.” In the current crisis over the 2019-nCoV, world health authorities have mobilized resources to stop the carnage. World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus declared the 2019-nCoV outbreak a public health emergency of international concern last January 30, the sixth time WHO has ever done so. The WHO chief lauded China’s policy of lockdown in order to contain the epidemic and said the world should be grateful to China for it. Indeed, as China was able to contain the SARS outbreak in 2003, so it is determined to stop nCoV now. Dr. Ghebreyesus expressed the resolve to extensively investigate the current outbreak. Foremost among the considerations that Direk hopes WHO should look into is the fact that the proliferation of viruses similar to the 2019-nCoV began on a mass scale with the H1N1 that broke out in the US in 2009. That outbreak afflicted 1.632 million, killing 284,500 of them; thanks to China’s quick attention, victims of 2019-nCoV number just 8,149, with deaths registered at 170. (As of February 6, there are 31,524 infected and 638 deaths based on WHO figures. — ed) More than statistical figures, the numbers tell of opposing tales. On the one hand, the virtual non-attention by the US to the huge number of its citizens victimized by H1N1, and on the other hand, the meticulous care with which China handled the comparatively minimal number of victims of the 2019-nCoV. The Chinese lockdown policy has told tremendously on the Chinese economy, crumbling, as one news account puts it, to the tune of several billion dollars of daily losses, and counting. From this comparison, Direk paints the final scenario. The killer element of HINI is allowed to proliferate — as the atomic bomb was first tested by the US for its destructive potential in a desert called Jornada del Muerto in Los Alamos, New Mexico — thus, determining its full potential as a weapon of mass destruction. It is a strain similar to it, much like a clone actually, the SARS that hit Hong Kong in 2003. Now comes 2019-nCoV, not much different from the H1N1 and SARS and quite similar in lethal effect on humans. The virus attack is graver now than before. And fanned by bloated media accounts that tend to blame the virus source, the outbreak has made China the greatest sufferer from the proliferation of 2019-nCoV. Who would benefit from this development is who would wish the maximum devastation of China. Ah, talk of chemical weapons of mass destruction. The US said it first, has said it time and time again since then. "
,"February 7, 2020",nCov,Interest rates trimmed anew by 25 bps,"Mayvelin U. Caraballo, TMT","THE Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) resumed its monetary policy easing by cutting interest rates on Thursday, a widely anticipated move that some analysts expect would continue this year. The central bank’s overnight borrowing, lending and deposit rates were reduced by 25 basis points to 3.75 percent, 4.25 percent and 3.25 percent, respectively, after its policy-making Monetary Board held its first rate-setting meeting for 2020. In a briefing, BSP Governor Benjamin Diokno said “the Monetary Board concluded that the manageable inflation environment allowed room for a preemptive reduction in the policy rate to support market confidence,” given domestic and external considerations. The Bangko Sentral’s latest baseline forecasts indicate a broadly steady path of inflation for 2020 and 2021, with average inflation remaining within the 2 to 4-percent target range, he added.
Also during the briefing, BSP Deputy Governor Francisco Dakila Jr. announced that monetary authorities raised their 2020 inflation forecast to 3.0 percent from 2.9 percent and kept their 2021 projection at 2.9 percent. “When you look at the factors that led to the change in the forecast, they are really very short term,” he said. The main factors considered for the revised 2020 forecast were the higher 2.5-percent and 2.9-percent inflation prints last December and January, respectively; diminishing base effects; impact of the 2019 novel coronavirus acute respiratory disease (2019-nCoV ARD); and adjusted oil price forecast of the central bank. Diokno said risks to the inflation outlook continued to tilt slightly toward the upside in 2020 and the downside in 2021. Upside risks to inflation over the near term come mainly from potential upward pressures on food prices, partly because of the African swine fever outbreak — which hit the country last year and has reached Mindanao — and tighter international supply of rice. The BSP chief also said the Taal Volcano eruption last month and the impact of Typhoon Tisoy (international name: Kammuri) last year continued to be a burden on the economy. However, uncertainty over trade and economic policies in major economies continue to weigh down on global demand, thus mitigating upward pressures on commodity prices, he added. Diokno also said the Monetary Board also observed that prospects for global economic growth had weakened further amid geopolitical tensions. It also noted that the spread of 2019-nCoV could have an adverse impact on economic activity and market sentiment in the coming months. The board, he added, believes that a policy rate cut would provide additional policy support to ward off potential spillovers associated with increased external headwinds, although recent demand indicators still point to a firm outlook for the domestic economy. More easing seen Analysts from Capital Economics, Security Bank Corp. and ING Bank Manila projected more interest rate cuts in the coming months. In a comment, Capital Economics’ Alex Holmes said that “with growth set to disappoint and inflation likely to remain within the BSP’s target range, we expect more easing later in the year.” He also said that even before 2019-nCoV broke out, the research consultancy firm doubted that the 6.4-percent growth seen in the fourth quarter would be sustained. With that, Philippine economic growth looks even more likely to fall short of the government’s 6.5 to 7.5 percent target for this year, Holmes added. Barring a sudden change in sentiment, Holmes said Capital Economics would still stick with its forecast that the central bank would cut rates by 50 basis points in total this year. For his part, Security Bank chief economist Robert Dan Roces said “we think the BSP still has enough policy space left and will not be afraid to inject more stimulus should the need warrant it.” And ING’s senior economist Nicholas Antonio Mapa said “the still-benign inflation outlook affords the central bank proper scope to continue easing monetary policy, with Diokno primed to carry out a second rate cut sometime within the first half of the year.” "

Caraballo, TMT","THE 2019 novel coronavirus acute respiratory disease (2019-nCoV ARD) could drag the country’s gross domestic product (GDP) growth by 0.3 percent this year, Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) Governor Benjamin Diokno said on Thursday. BSP Governor Benjamin Diokno. Photo by Mayvelin U. Caraballo “Preliminary BSP estimates show a 0.3 ppt (percentage point) reduction in 2020 GDP…” Diokno told reporters in a message. This comes after the Bangko Sentral chief said on the sidelines of the Management Association of the Philippines’ (MAP) general membership meeting in Taguig City that the central bank determined that the 2019-nCoV would only affect economic growth in the first half of the year. According to him, estimates show a reduction of 0.2 ppt in first quarter GDP and 0.4 ppt in the second, or an average of 0.3 ppt for full-2020 growth. The government aims to hit GDP of 6.5 to 7.5 percent this year. Diokno said the 2019-nCoV impact would likely hit the tourism sector and the deployment of overseas Filipino workers. In his speech at the MAP meeting, he cited the virus, as well as a synchronized economic slowdown, rising geopolitical tensions, and higher tariff barriers between the United States and its trading partners, as the major external risks to Philippine economic growth this year. “Nonetheless, amid these risks and challenges, I am confident that the Philippine economy will remain one of the bright spots in the region and we expect it to remain so with the support of critical structural reforms,” the BSP governor said. Diokno’s statement echoed Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez 3rd’s recent warning that the virus would likely drag growth in the tourism and export sectors this year. “A significant impact on the economy [would] most likely be centered on the tourism sector,” he told a Senate hearing on Tuesday. Latest data from the Department of Tourism (DoT) showed that the number of foreign tourists in the country reached 7.48 million in the first 11 months of 2019, up 15.58 percent from the year-ago figure. Tourists from mainland China were the second-highest in the period, with 1.62 million. The Finance chief also said the lockdown imposed by Beijing on the city of Wuhan in Hubei province — considered a hub of transport and industry in central China, and where the virus originated — could create some supply-chain problems that would affect trade elsewhere. Since China is the Philippines’ top trading partner, he said this would have an effect on Manila’s outbound shipments. Dominguez’s view was shared by a number of analysts, who estimated that the virus’ impact on the local economy would reach between $300 million and $600 million. "

Piad,"News of a vaccine for the 2019-novel coronavirus acute respiratory disease (2019-nCoV ARD) nearing development lifted investor sentiment on Thursday, propelling the bourse to end in the green for the third consecutive day. The benchmark Philippine Stock Exchange index (PSEi) surged 2.09 percent or 153.66 points to end at 7,506.51, while the wider All Shares climbed 1.57 percent or 68.47 points to finish at 4,422.72. “Philippine shares rose after several sources cited that a vaccine (for the 2019 nCoV) is nearing,” Regina Capital Development Corp. head of sales Luis Limlingan said. Analysts generally have expressed confidence the illness would be largely contained to China and the economic harm will not be lasting. The World Health Organization is enjoining medical experts this month to develop coronavirus drugs and vaccines amid the outbreak. Meanwhile, Philstocks Financial Inc. said the PSEi benefitted from Wall Street spillover and “robust” lending growth. The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas recently reported that loans disbursed by universal and commercial banks rose by 10.9 percent to P9.51 trillion in December 2019 from P8.33 trillion last year. Wall Street registered gains. Dow Jones, S&P 500 and Nasdaq were up 1.68 percent, 1.13 percent and 0.43 percent, respectively. In Asia, most markets were up.

NOW IT’S CLARK Health Secretary Francisco Duque 3rd (left) and Undersecretary Gerardo Bayugo show a photo of the facility in New Clark City, where Filipinos from China will be quarantined. Bello said the Pathology and Genetics Department of Dubai’s Health Authority has yet to determine if the woman was infected with the 2019-nCoV that has killed 563 people in China, Hong Kong and the Philippines. The victim was identified as Amalia Collado Dapronoza, 58. Bello said Dubai authorities are waiting for the result of the test done by Australia. The death of Dapromoza was reported as the Department of Health admitted on Thursday that the number of persons under observation for the 2019-nCoV rose to 178 from 133. Health Secretary Francisco Duque 3rd said out of the 178 patients, 48 tested negative for the 2019-nCoV. Ten of the people under investigation refused to be hospitalized, but Duque said Health officials had coordinated with the Philippine National Police to “force” these patients to go be isolated in a hospital. The Philippines has three confirmed cases of the PNP. The remains of the lone fatality, a Chinese, have yet to be cremated. Meanwhile, 45 Filipinos from Wuhan, China are set to arrive on February 9. They will be quarantined at a building in New Clark City’s athlete’s village, which was used during the 30th Southeast Asian Games last year. The Health secretary said the facility, offered by the Bases Conversion and Development Authority, is better than the Fort Magsaysay drug rehabilitation center in Nueva Ecija. Toll soars China’s coronavirus crisis deepened on Thursday with the death toll soaring to 563, as thousands of people trapped on quarantined cruise ships added to the global panic about the epidemic. More than 28,000 people have now been infected across China as authorities struggle to contain the outbreak despite compelling millions to stay indoors in a growing number of cities. Two dozens of countries have confirmed cases of the respiratory disease, which emerged from a market selling exotic animals in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year. Thousands of people on cruise ships in Hong Kong and Japan now face an agonizing wait to find out if more among them have been infected. At least 20 people on board the Diamond Princess have tested positive so far, while some 3,700 passengers and crew from over 50 countries have been confined to quarters aboard the cruise ship off Yokohama since Monday night. In Hong Kong, 3,600 people were preparing to spend a second night confined aboard the World Dream as authorities conducted health checks after eight former passengers tested positive for the virus. On Thursday, Health officials in the financial hub said they were also asking some 5,000 Hong Kongers who had taken trips on the ship since mid-January to contact them. Hong Kong has been particularly nervous, as the disease has revived memories of another coronavirus, the one that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome, which killed nearly 300 people in the city and another 349 in the Chinese mainland in 2002 and 2003. Panic buyers in the semi-autonomous city left shelves of toilet paper empty at supermarkets following false online claims of shortages, prompting authorities to appeal for calm. One person has died after contracting the virus in Hong Kong so far. WITH JOHN ERIC MENDOZA AND AFP "

Ramos, TMT","The Philippine Sports Commission (PSC) has recommended the postponement of of the 10th Asean Para Games to be hosted by the Philippines on March 20 to 28 citing the threat of the novel Coronavirus (nCov) acute respiratory disease in the Asian region. “We have considered advising the [Philippine] Paralympic Committee to postpone the hosting of the 2020 Asean Paralympics in March to prevent the infection, contamination of the virus,” PSC Chairman William Ramirez told the media in a news conference on Thursday. “Bakit pa tayo maghihintay na maraming ma-infect. Mas mabuti ang prevention. Kung maayos naman ituloy natin (Why should we wait until many were infected? Prevention is better. We will push through with the event if the situation improves). The whole world is affected by this. We are afraid of contamination. It is really our concern right now,”Ramirez added. Ramirez and PSC Commissioners Arnold Agustin and Ramon Fernandez also announced they already postponed the National Sports Summit on February 27 to 28, the Philippine National Games in May and the Children Games because of the nCov threat. The PSC said there is still no Filipino athlete infected with the nCov. The Philippine Paralympic Committee, under its president Michael Barredo is in charge of the 11-nation biennial meet. Barredo is scheduled to fly to Bangkok, Thailand to consult the issue with the Asian Paralympic Sports Federation (APSF). “The bottom line is what is best for our para athletes in the Philippines and Southeast Asia,” said Barredo, who is considering moving the event to April or May. “I don’t want to preempt their (APSF) decision,” said Barredo. The hosting of the 10th Asean Para Games was originally set January 18 to 25 in New Clark City, Subic and Metro Manila but the PSC decided to reschedule it to March 20 to 28 citing lack of funding. The 10th Asean Para Games is an adjacent event of the 30th Southeast Asian Games which the Philippines successfully hosted last November 30 to December 11. "

Chief executive officer Toshiro Muto revealed that organizers have set up a task force to combat the fast-spreading disease that has killed over 560 people and infected at least 28,000 — the vast majority in mainland China — but promised that the Games would be not derailed. “The Olympics will go ahead as planned,” he told reporters after a Paralympic project review. Olympics organizers said Thursday the Games would “go ahead as planned,” slamming misinformation over the new coronavirus. AFP FILE PHOTO “It is important to remain objective and cool-headed. We don’t want to alarm the public. The infection is still limited and there is no problem staging the Olympics based on the current situation.” International Paralympic Committee (IPC) spokesman Craig Spence complained that scaremongering had created an “info-demic” that could skew public perception in the run-up to the Olympics and Paralympics. “Fear is spreading quicker than the virus,” he said. “It’s important we quell that fear. Only 191 of the total cases are outside mainland China, so let’s put things into perspective. “If you compare those rates with the common flu, they are still relatively small numbers,” added Spence. “The World Health Organization (WHO) has not declared this a pandemic. We dealt with the Zika virus in Rio and in these matters we need to rely on the experts. “We will follow the advice of the World Health Organization. Every organizing committee looks into countermeasures, and we have measures in place from previous Olympics and Paralympics here in Tokyo. It is standard practice, it’s business as usual.” More than 20 countries have confirmed cases of the flu-like coronavirus. Global panic
Japan has had no reported deaths so far, but 45 cases have been detected, including at least 20 people on a cruise ship carrying more than 3,700 passengers and crew quarantined off Yokohama. The WHO has declared the outbreak a global health emergency. Japan has warned citizens against non-essential travel to China and fast-tracked new rules including limits on entering the country as it tries to contain the spread of the virus. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Thursday pledged that preparations for the Olympics would proceed as normal. “The coronavirus is beginning to have an impact on tourism,” he said. “But the government will continue to steadily prepare for the Games in close cooperation with the IOC (International Olympic Committee), the local organizing committee and the Tokyo Metropolitan Government.” The Japanese government has chartered three flights to repatriate 565 Japanese nationals from Wuhan, the central Chinese city hardest hit by the virus. Tokyo governor Yuriko Koike promised at the weekend to implement “thorough measures” to protect people from the virus. The health scare has led to the cancellation of Olympic qualifying events in China such as boxing and badminton. The Tokyo Olympics begin on July 24 with the Paralympics starting on August 25. AFP "

The ships in Japan and Hong Kong are caught up in a global health emergency that seems to worsen by the day. In the port city of Yokohama, just outside Tokyo, health workers said 10 more people from the Diamond Princess were confirmed ill with the virus, in addition to 10 others who tested positive on Wednesday. DON’T MOVE An ambulance (second from left) waits for patients who tested positive for the new coronavirus from the Diamond Princess cruise ship at the Daikoku pier Cruise Terminal in Yokohama. Ten more people on a cruise ship off Japan’s coast have tested positive for the new coronavirus, the Health minister said. AFP PHOTO The latest infections included four Japanese, two Americans, two Canadians, one New Zealander and one Taiwanese. Most were in their 60s and 70s. They were dropped off as the ship docked and transferred to nearby hospitals for further test and treatment. The 3,700 people on board faced a two-week quarantine in their cabins. The ship had 2,666 passengers and 1,045 crew members. More tests are pending on 171 others who had symptoms or had contact with a man who was diagnosed with the virus after leaving the ship in Hong Kong, the Health Ministry said. The 3,600 people aboard the Hong Kong ship were also being screened after three passengers on a previous voyage were diagnosed with the virus. The territory’s beleaguered leader, Carrie Lam, announced that two terminals — including one where the cruise ship is currently quarantined — will be shut down. The director-general of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, on Wednesday asked for $675 million to help countries address the expected spread of the virus. He acknowledged that the sum is a lot, but told a news briefing that “it’s much less than the bill we will face if we do not invest in preparedness now.” Tedros said that in the last 24 hours, the United Nations health agency has seen the biggest jump in cases since the start of the epidemic. According to the latest figures early Thursday, the number of confirmed cases jumped by 3,694 to 28,018, and the death toll rose to 563. The number of those “discharged and cured” stood at 1,153. Outside mainland China, at least 240 cases have been confirmed, including two fatalities, one in Hong Kong and another in the Philippines. South Korea reported four more cases for a total of 23. They included a Chinese tourist and South Koreans whose relatives were infected or were in contact with patients. The official Xinhua News Agency said clinical trials for the antiviral drug Remdesivir have been approved and the first group of patients are expected to start taking the drug on Thursday. The stock price of the drug’s maker, American biotechnology company Gilead Sciences Inc., has enjoyed a boost from word of the trials. AP "

Hun Sen flew to Beijing and met Xi to lend support to China’s fight against the coronavirus outbreak. Kao Kim Hourn, minister delegate attached to the Prime Minister, said that Xi advised Cambodia must not fold to EU’s demand in regards to democracy and human rights. ‘’I know that Cambodia is experiencing pressure from the EU over the EBA. Whatever it is Cambodia should not bow its head to the EU,” Kim quoted Xi as saying. “Otherwise, Cambodia will be affected by this [pressure] because some countries are intending to provoke a colour revolution in Cambodia.” Hun Sen requested Xi to support Chinese garment investors in Cambodia if the EBA is suspended. “I would like to ask our Chinese friend to continue supporting Chinese investors who have run business in Cambodia if the Kingdom will lose the EBA,” Hourn quoted Hun Sen as saying. The European Commission last year launched a period of intensive monitoring and engagement that could lead to the suspension of the EBA due to perceived democratic setbacks and human rights violation. The EU will make its final decision this month if its EBA will be suspended. Khmer Times "
,"February 7, 2020",nCov,China to halve tariffs on $75B of US imports,Agence France-Presse,"BEIJING: China on Thursday said it would halve tariffs on $75 billion worth of US imports as part of its trade truce with Washington and as officials look to calm markets unnerved by a deadly virus outbreak. The East Asian country’s State Council Tariff Commission said the reductions would come in a month after Beijing and Washington signed a deal to dial down a long-running trade war that has hit the global economy. It also comes a day after Donald Trump hailed relations between the superpowers as the “best” ever in his State of the Union address, with observers saying Beijing was likely keen to get moving on the next phase of talks toward a wider agreement. Levies of 5 and 10 percent on more than 1,700 items imposed in September will be cut from February 14, the same day Washington is expected to halve tariffs on $120 billion worth of Chinese goods. Products affected include fresh seafood, poultry and soybeans, as well as tungsten lamps for scientific and medical purposes, and some types of aircraft. The move is aimed at “promoting the healthy and stable development of China-US economic and trade relations,” the commission said in a statement. “To alleviate economic and trade friction, and expand cooperation in these areas, China has also made relevant adjustments,” it added, referring to the US cuts. “We hope to work with the US toward the ultimate elimination of all increased tariffs.” The commission also said it “hopes that both parties will be able to abide by their agreement, strive to implement its relevant content, (and) boost market confidence.”
Other retaliatory tariffs, however, remain in place. ‘Minimal impact’ The two in January signed a partial deal that eased tensions in their bruising trade war, with Beijing agreeing to buy an additional $200 billion in US goods over the next two years. As part of the phase one deal, the US said it would halve its tariffs on $120 billion of Chinese goods to 7.5 percent, while Trump called off additional levies that would have taken effect last December. Thursday’s announcement comes as China grapples with a shortage of resources as it struggles to combat the 2019 novel coronavirus acute respiratory disease (2019-nCoV ARD), which has claimed more than 560 lives and infected more than 28,000. On Tuesday, a top US trade official said the nCoV outbreak would delay Beijing’s plans to buy goods from the US under the phase one deal. But Washington expects “minimal impact” from the virus on the US economy. The outbreak has caused Beijing to impose travel restrictions across its cities, with millions of consumers staying home during its otherwise busy Lunar New Year holiday. The crisis is expected to hammer China’s already stuttering economy, as companies and factories delay the resumption of operations. Over the weekend, Beijing announced that US imports that could be used in its fight against the deadly virus would also be exempted from retaliatory tariffs imposed in the trade war. ‘Sweet carrot’ AxiCorp chief market strategist Stephen Innes said the tariffs cut was a “small, but…sweet carrot to dangle.” “In the wake of the coronavirus economic tumult, it’s not much of a stretch to assume China is eager to start the negotiations,” he added. Moody’s Analytics economist Xu Xiaochun told Agence France-Presse a reduction in tariffs “makes sense” as China is expected to import more US goods as part of the phase one deal. But the timing might be more than a coincidence. “Perhaps, it has got to do with market sentiment,” he said, noting that the Shanghai Composite and Shenzhen Composite indexes fell on Monday when markets reopened after the recent holiday and reacted for the first time to the outbreak. “It could be a case of China giving signals that it is working toward easing tensions and improving trade relations, so as to ease financial volatility and risk aversion in the stock markets,” the economist added. Since losing almost 8 percent on Monday, mainland Chinese markets have surged more than 4 percent in the past three days, boosted by central bank support, bargain-buying and the tariffs announcement.| "
,"February 7, 2020",nCov,"Beijing, Cambodia strengthen ties",Xinhua,"BEIJING: Chinese President Xi Jinping met with Cambodian Prime Minister Samdech Techo Hun Sen at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing. Noting that the Chinese government and people are currently doing their utmost to fight the pneumonia epidemic caused by the novel coronavirus, Xi said: “A friend in need is a friend indeed as the Cambodian people stand with the Chinese people at this special moment.” Xi said Cambodian King Norodom Sihamoni and his mother, former Queen Norodom Monineath Sihanouk, had specially extended sympathy and support to the Chinese side. Moreover, the Cambodian prime minister had expressed strong support to China on many occasions and even made a special tour to China on Wednesday, which demonstrated unbreakable friendship and mutual trust between the two sides and showcased the essence of building a community of shared future of the two countries, said Xi, adding China deeply appreciated Cambodia’s such moves. Xi stressed that the Communist Party of China and the Chinese government had adopted the most thorough and strict prevention and control measures in a highly responsible manner toward the Chinese people and the international community in dealing with the epidemic. “At present, the prevention and control work is achieving positive results,” said Xi. The President said the Chinese nation had overcome adversity through its development and therefore it has confidence and capability to win the fight against the outbreak of the epidemic. “We will continue to strengthen cooperation with other countries, including Cambodia, in an open and transparent manner to effectively deal with the epidemic and maintain global and regional public health security,” said Xi. “We will take good care of Cambodian citizens in China, including Cambodian students studying in China, and protect their lives and health as we treat Chinese citizens,” said Xi. Xi said in 2020 China would maintain close high-level exchanges with Cambodia, implement the action plan on building a community of shared future of the two countries and uplift China-Cambodia relations to new heights. Hun Sen said when China was in a difficult time, the Cambodian people stood firmly with the Chinese people to undergo and overcome common difficulties, and the two countries are truly “steadfast friends.” Hun Sen said that he decided to make a special visit to China with an aim to showcase Cambodia’s support to China in fighting the outbreak of the epidemic. The prime minister expressed gratitude for China’s care of Cambodian citizens in China, expecting this tour to reinforce their confidence. In the face of the epidemic, some countries have adopted some extreme restrictive measures, which are not desirable. What is more terrible than the epidemic is the panic itself, he said. Hun Sen said Cambodia will continue to carry out normal cooperation and exchanges with China and is committed to working with China to build a community with a shared future of the two countries.

,"February 7, 2020",nCov,Yellows’ disgusting anti-Chinese racism in the midst of a global health crisis,Rigoberto D. Tiglao,"RIGOBERTO D. TIGLAO IT is so disgusting that at this time when we humans feel a sense of solidarity in the face of a serious threat to all of our species, the Yellows have demonstrated such anti-China racism at its most sickening level. Exhibit A here is a column published the other day in the Philippine Daily Inquirer, or PDI, by somebody I was told is a frustrated ex-nun, who has been a personification of the Yellow mind: rabidly anti-Duterte and anti-Marcos, a self-styled defender of the Roman Catholic Church who reeks of religiosity, self-appointed guardian of human rights and, of course, pro-American. Her column’s title, which I never thought a decent broadsheet would ever publish: “7 ‘deadly plagues’ from China.” What did she want to tell her readers? That the 2019 novel coronavirus is one of seven plagues China has deliberately brought on the Philippines, and soon on all mankind? Worried that her readers might not get the gravity of her assessment, she herself wrote: “‘Seven plagues’ has a biblical, apocalyptic ring to it. I am not being whimsical or facetious. The words also serve as a wake-up call.” It is certainly shocking — or maybe not — how a supposedly religious person, purportedly an activist for noble causes would condemn a nation of 1.4 billion souls, whose nearly 30,000 people are afflicted, with and over 500 killed by the disease and about 61 million of banned from going out of their homes. Has racism and opposition to President Rodrigo Duterte steeled her heart so much, she cannot even write a sympathetic word for her fellow human beings? Blood-curdling
It is not an exaggeration to say that her message is a blood-curdling cry: “China is the source of the plagues we read of in the Bible, and the kind that have killed millions of Christians in Europe in the Middle Ages. To hell with China.” It didn’t occur to her that the plagues “from China” she lists are hardly of biblical proportions, nor have they been the creations of the Chinese. She writes: “Here, the ‘seven deadly plagues’ from and by China that are bedeviling the Philippines: diseases (the 2019 novel coronavirus acute respiratory disease or nCoV that is spreading across nations, SARS etc.), gambling, prostitution, crime, drugs, kabastusan (rude behavior) and grabbing of Philippine territory. You can add more based on your own personal knowledge.” All these originated from China? This is patently a racist rant. Racism does not have any place in a modern society. I’ve scoured a lot of opinion pieces here and in Western newspapers. I’ve not come across any piece remotely close to the PDI writer’s shameless racism. The Yellow author’s virulent racism is because of the mix of two things. First, it represents the embers of the anti-Chinese bias prevalent among a certain class of our society, originating when we were under the Spanish who, from time to time, burned the Parian (Chinatown then), and killed or drove off the Chinese, blaming them mainly either for disease outbreaks (mainly cholera) or a downturn in the economy. Second, they see President Duterte as pro-Chinese. Therefore, the Chinese are bad. That is the simple flawed logic of the Yellows. Academic
It is just as disgusting how another PDI columnist, a retired academic, while straining to claim that he is not anti-Chinese and that there is no place for sinophobia in these times, couldn’t resist justifying in the same column such racism: “It seems counterintuitive to entertain thoughts about propriety and compassion at a time when China has done nothing but bully its way into the West Philippine Sea, or when some of its people behave as though they could do anything while they are here as guests because they happen to be under the express protection of our own government. It is hard to resist schadenfreude when one is dealing with a country that has tended to brandish its newfound economic power like a weapon.” From the priest’s Facebook post What this writer is really saying is that all this anti-Chinese sentiment is merely the very human sentiment of schadenfreude, or pleasure derived from somebody else’s misfortune, especially when that somebody has been a bully. “If there is sinophobia, the Chinese deserve it,” this writer is saying. Indeed, behind the fear-of-God façade of many of the religious in this country is xenophobia, perhaps the side effect of the Catholic Church’s anti-Jewish basis and its “we-are-the-chosen-by God” narrative. A prime example — and a demonstration that such bigots are usually anti-Duterte — would be a Facebook post by one Erik Salamat, who appears to be a priest since he posed a photo of himself in a soutane carrying a crucifix. His post reads: “May 2 places lang sana na pwedeng i-confine ang mga Instsik na nasa Pinas na positive sa coronavirus: 1) sa kwarto ni Pres. Digong; 2) sa kwafrto ni Sen. Bong Go. Tapos magkwentuhan sila d’un ng mga chekwang fairy tales.” Atheists
This priest and that PDI religious columnist should learn compassion from Japan, a nation of non-Christians, of atheists really. According to reports, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hua Chunying said since the outbreak began last month, “the Japanese government and its people from all walks of life have expressed sympathy, understanding and support to us,” adding that she was “deeply touched.” She cited donations of masks, goggles and protective gear — which are in short supply in China — and lighting up the Tokyo Skytree broadcasting and observation tower in red and blue to pray for the country. Hua continued: “In response to the extreme and discriminatory words uttered by some countries, officials from the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare countered…that what is at fault here is the virus, definitely not people.” “I believe many Chinese netizens have also noticed these heartwarming details,” she said. “We thank people from any country who have shown sympathy, understanding and support during this difficult time. We will keep this in our hearts.” One thing this coronavirus breakout has reminded us is how lucky we are for having rid the country of the Yellow regime, with the Yellow worldview slowly vanishing from our society.

,"February 7, 2020",nCov,Asia economies reduce rates amid nCoV impact,Associated Press,"BANGKOK: Central banks in the Philippines and Thailand have cut their benchmark interest rates as China’s neighbors seek ways to soften the impact of measures to contain a virus outbreak that has killed more than 560 people. Scientists are at work in the VirPath university laboratory, classified as “P3” level of safety, on February 5, 2020 as they try to find an effective treatment against the new SARS-like coronavirus, which has already caused more than 560 deaths. When most are busy developing vaccines or testing the few anti-virals available, VirPath will go after drugs used for diseases that have nothing to do with a respiratory infection such as 2019-nCoV. / AFP / JEFF PACHOUD The Philippine central bank cut its main policy rate on Thursday by 0.25 percentage point to 3.75 percent on Thursday. That followed a rate cut by the Bank of Thailand a day earlier, to a new low of 1 percent from 1.25 percent. “The board noted the spread of the 2019 novel coronavirus [acute respiratory disease (2019-nCoV ARD)] could have an adverse impact on economic activity and market sentiment in coming months,” Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas Governor Benjamin Diokno, said in remarks livestreamed on Facebook. Thailand’s Board of Investment also announced fresh measures to boost the economy, including increased corporate tax exemptions for both small businesses and large-scale projects. Thai authorities have taken various steps to ease conditions for businesses, including tax cuts, easing loan repayment terms and extending the deadline for filing personal income tax from March to June. Many of China’s neighbors are reeling from plunging tourist arrivals and other adverse impacts from the outbreak that has spread from the central Chinese city of Wuhan to more than 20 countries. The Bank of Thailand said the softer credit policy would help businesses and households cope as risks rise from mounting debt, severe drought and uncertainties brought on by the trade war between China and the United States. Analysts are predicting that the Thai central bank will cut the benchmark rate by another 0.25 percentage point, perhaps as early as March. The Monetary Authority of Singapore said Wednesday that it had “sufficient room” to ease the exchange rate “in line with the weakening of economic conditions as a result of the outbreak.” About 10 percent of Thailand’s economy hinges on exports to China. The share of such exports is even higher for Vietnam, Taiwan, South Korea and Malaysia. Exporters of major commodities like oil, coal and iron ore also are vulnerable to shocks from a further slowdown in China’s economy. The trend toward easing credit began last year as relations between China and the US dipped to their worst in decades and is expected to continue. Analysts at Fitch Solutions Macro Research said on Wednesday they estimated regional growth could slow to 4.0 percent from 4.3 percent in 2019 if the outbreak leads to a much slower rate of growth for China. Economists already are forecasting that China’s economy, the world’s second largest, will expand at about a 5-percent pace in 2020, down from 6.1 percent last year. The Fitch report reckons that China accounts for more than two-thirds of growth for developing economies in Asia and for almost 80 percent of travel. Further interest rate cuts are likely in store for the Philippines, said Alex Holmes of Capital Economics. “The Philippines is likely to be more insulated from the economic fallout of the coronavirus than most other countries in the region,” he said. “But the disruption to the tourism sector and industry will still add to the headwinds the economy faces from slowing consumption growth, and weak exports.” He said the Philippine economy would likely not attain the government’s target growth rate of 6.5 to 7.5 percent and might not even reach the 6.4 percent rate seen in the last quarter of 2019.

,"February 7, 2020",nCov,Aussie travel ban not good – China,Global Times,"In spite of the fact that the World Health Organization (WHO) has unambiguously advised against unnecessary interfering and limiting international travel and trade amid novel coronavirus outbreak, Canberra haphazardly followed Washington’s example of imposing border closure to students, tourists, business travelers and other visitors coming from the Chinese mainland. Such insensitive overreaction is detrimental to the normal exchanges and frequent mobility which are of critical importance to the mutually beneficial cooperation between the two countries. There are 260,000 Chinese students enrolled in schools and universities across Australia, generating $12 billion Australian dollars annually to the country’s economy. At this moment, almost 100,000 of them are being kept in limbo, unable to commence or resume their education onshore due to the abrupt imposition of the travel ban. For those who have successfully entered the country by the closure date, some of the youngsters have been forcibly put in detention while the visas of some other students were arbitrarily and unfairly canceled. Self-conflicting policies and announcements further exacerbated the dire situation, baffling not only students and their parents, but also education providers in Australia. WHO Director General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, rightly advised “all countries to implement decisions that are evidence-based and consistent.” Australia’s precipitous decree clearly runs against sensibility, while betraying its characteristically blind and senseless shadowing of US policies and practices with regard to China. It is understood that the US has its own vested interest in taking advantage of the current health crisis to stir up another scaremongering campaign against China, which runs counter to the basic principles of morality and humanity. Washington’s blatant conniving serves its long-term global strategy of containing and deterring China. Global Times "
,"February 7, 2020",nCov,"Olympic gold dream; on China, let’s play fair",Rene Saguisag,"RENE SAGUISAG THE gung-ho talk we hear that Tokyo 2020 may mean our first Olympic gold notwithstanding, my thesis is that we are chasing our third. The first two, diver Victoria Manalo Draves, daughter of chef-musikero Teofilo of Orani, Bataan, got in the 1948 London Olympics. But, given the rampant racism at the time, she, based in San Francisco, won the same for the United States. She never forgot her roots though and was active in helping Pinoy immigrants in California. In San Francisco, there is a 2-acre downtown park named after her, which I visited in 2013. How can one beat a Victoria na, Manalo pa? Her mother was Gertrude Taylor, an English maid who must have been thrilled that her daughter won in her native England. At that time, no Pinoy could marry a white American under laws barring interracial marriages, which the US Supreme Court finally struck down in 1967 (Loving v. Virginia, 388 US 1). Vicki was invited by the Jaycees after her rousing London twin triumph and was billeted in Malacañang no less by President Elpidio Quirino. She visited her roots in Orani, Bataan, which she repeated in a final sentimental journey home in the last decade. She passed on in 2010, a paradigm for the next Pinoy/Pinay to win our third Olympic gold. She is enshrined in the International Swimming Hall of Fame. There may be some uneasiness here as to whether she won as a Filipino in London. Blood tells, is my short and simple answer. At a time when foreign cagers are naturalized overnight, foreign athletes with Pinoy blood are welcome and foreign coaches/consultants are all over the place. We grieve over Kobe Bryant, let’s cheer for Vicki, the first woman diver of Asian descent to win an Olympic gold (two even). Ernest John Obiena, our pole vaulter who dreams of a Tokyo gold, has a coach from Ukraine (Vitaly Petrov). Two pole vault competitions in China, this month and the next, have been canceled because of the coronavirus malady there. The Tokyo Olympiad? Oh, nonononono! The debate meantime also continues on the arbitral ruling in a process that President Benigno “Pnoy” Aquino 3rd had initiated and won against China. The long ruling I have had no time to read in the original. To be sure, China has. I am just wondering why it pointedly rejects the ruling. Malamang talo(?) — not only in a barbershop is one logical reading. A petty schoolyard win? I’ll take it anyway. It may be a forward step in a journey of a thousand miles. I listened to Justice Tony Carpio late last month and I became more of a true believer that we did have a winning case, bolstered by his tireless continuing further research. I have worked on another matter with our arbitration lawyer, Paul Reichler, a Harvard Law cum laude alum. We trained at different times in the firm of Arnold & Porter in Washington D.C. (We were 70 in 1969-70 and I worked out of a historic townhouse where Lafayette once lived, within walking distance from we lived. I understand the firm has moved downtown, and now has a thousand lawyers all over the world. In my time, I knew it had a strong pro bono commitment. In my stay in the US, I was struck by the fact that black, Catholic and Jewish lawyers seemed to care most for fellow minorities and underdogs.) In 1986, Paul defeated the US for Nicaragua in the World Court (the International Court of Justice or ICJ). America would not comply with the adverse ICJ ruling though. The United Nations could not do anything. Bullies from the schoolyard and in the world stage apparently are the same; they live by their own Basta! code. We may not be in a position to fight anyone, but we should be ready to defend ourselves from any irredentist aggressor or land-grabber. The Viets defended themselves from France, America and China. Indonesia blows up foreign vessels poaching in its waters, China not excepted. The arguable defeatist wala-naman-tayong-magagawa stance of the administration makes me feel forlorn. We may compete in having had the longest record in slavery, under Spain, the US, Japan, the US again, the Ilocanos of Marcos and the Davaoeños of Duterte. The Marcoses ruined our values, institutions and processes as well as the natural evolution of leaders who were cut down in the flower of their youth; the deterioration we kind of arrested in 1986-1987, and was arguably revived vigorously in 2016. In 1986, we said non sibi sed patriae. Not self, but country, and sang Bayan Ko with fervor. Now the Chinese invasion is coming in another form, willy-nilly. Its own domestic fatal victims are now in the hundreds, and counting. It is not China’s fault, of course. Indeed, why shoot oneself in the foot? Who needs the deadly virus? Xenophobia or sinophobia in the 2019 novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV context is just unacceptable. I am with the Prez here, as I was in his success in bringing home the Bells of Balangiga, to conclude a campaign that my fellow maubanin, Fr. Horacio de la Costa, helped start. Now, let’s go get that third Olympic gold in Tokyo in August. Let us hope and pray the current virus scare won’t result in canceling the coming Olympiad, leading unjustifiably to intensified sinophobia. * * * Goodbye and thank you, Sir Gaby Tabuñar, a consummate journalist, a pro, who was so helpful to me when I was candidate Cory Aquino’s amateurish spokesman in the 1985-1986 snap polls.

,"February 7, 2020",nCov,A month of uncertainty,Gab Mejia,"GAB MEJIA A MERE month has passed in the new decade, yet it seems to feel as if many years have gone by. Fires and drought in Australia, volcanic eruptions in Taal, earthquakes in Puerto Rico, threats of a world war from the United States and Iran, mass locust infestation in Somalia, and a global pandemic of the 2019 novel coronavirus acute respiratory disease exponentially spreading from China — all occurring within this seemingly short timescale of a month. The weight of the world has never felt heavier, more burdened by the thought of the growing threats of the climate crisis and xenophobia. All of them nowhere near over. These global issues threatening our environment, health, security and economy are painfully taking a toll on the different governments, institutions and individuals trying to find cures and extinguishing fires to at least solve one thing. The state of the world has never felt more uncertain. Uncertain to a point that is paralyzing — leading to inaction and ignorance from a society that is already full of it. Yet, with all the drudgery that entails these issues around the world, the reality is that more is asked of us to fight these insurmountable battles placed upon our countries and communities. To do more and to act more for the people severely and directly affected by these conflicts in the world. Volunteer in relief operations; donate money to charitable organizations; initiate projects; stop spreading fake news — all of which may seem insignificant, but every single action offers an extra hand to carry the weight and brunt of these burdens. It is only with the strength of togetherness while extinguishing feelings of hate and thoughts of disparity can we strive to solve and act upon these intertwining global issues that have affected us already. From a canceled flight because of the coronavirus to the increasing prices of commodities, and from ash falling in the city to water and electricity shortages — these problems seen day in and day out on our social media newsfeed may all seem removed, but it has affected our daily lives more than we know. And as every single day of this new decade passes, I do remain doubtful yet hopeful about where we are heading as a society, only enamored of the communities continuing to fight for life at large. Yet with all the questions and doubts this new decade has offered and continues to offer, the certainty we can hold onto is that we all lead to one same future, no matter how uncertain. For this, all we need to believe is that we can make a difference. A reality that our future is divided by a mere thin line of the choices and actions we make — both good and bad, only hoping that we are headed to a better and just tomorrow.

,"February 7, 2020",nCov,China up against a horrible kind of US missile,Mauro Gia Samonte,"MAURO GIA SAMONTE First of 2 parts
IT is a good thing that World Health Organization (WHO) Director General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has resolved to conduct a thorough investigation of the 2019 novel coronavirus acute respiratory disease (2019-nCoV ARD). Pursued to its logical conclusion, the investigation could result in unearthing what could be the real scenario in which the dreaded killer virus is being made to spread in China today. For emphasis, I am a scenarist, moreover a filmmaker. I am inclined to taking things along cinematic frameworks. Particularly on matters that have to do with people’s lives, I tend to delve in phenomena much deeper than greet the eye, so to speak. It is a cineaste’s intrinsic capacity for rooting out details that are otherwise imperceptible by the ordinary mind. On the current uproar over the 2019-nCoV, I begin with creating the main character, Direk. It is said in literature that the development of the story is determined by the development of the main character. Direk first became aware of the coronavirus in 2003. That was when the much-dreaded severe acute respiratory syndrome was deemed a pandemic by medical authorities for afflicting people all over the world. Least relevant to people other than Direk was that it was on January 23 that year when Jose Maria Sison had former New People’s Army chief Rolando Kintanar assassinated. Having earlier equated the Sisonite protracted people’s war with the United States design of perpetuating hegemony in the Asia-Pacific region, Direk saw the assassination as a cog in the wheel of that United States agenda: to frustrate Kintanar’s Sandinista-type city-based uprising for having been conceived to achieve victory over a short period of time. The Kintanar strategy was anathema to Sison’s protracted people’s war. The latter strategy serves the US interest well. What rebellion against it would the US welcome than one that does not have any agenda of winning? That means the US clout in all aspects of Philippine polity stays unperturbed. The year 2003 was also when the baffling 9/11 attacks caused the crumbling of the Twin Towers in New York like a deck of cards; it killed some 3,000 people, which US President George W. Bush blamed on Muslim terrorists. Direk observes that when you talk of virus, you inevitably go into such rigmarole as laboratory tests, infusion of chemical cures for virus victims, which, for Direk, is precisely what’s so horrible about the subject matter, because it could involve the mere exigence of letting a killer chemical fly into the air and get masses of humans killed. Otherwise, get swarms of animals, particularly swine, infected with it and then pass on the virus to people. Just a year after the Twin Tower collapse, Direk was intrigued by the “coalition of the willing.” It was a group formed by Bush for launching a war against Iraq ostensibly aimed at punishing Saddam Hussein for stockpiling chemical weapons of mass destruction. Only in that event did Direk get to be really conscious of how chemicals can be made to kill humans in great multitudes. The coalition embarked on the Iraq War, subdued the country, capturing Saddam and ultimately executing him. But have they found any chemical weapons in Iraq? Not an ounce of it. But it permanently ingrained in Direk’s mind the terror of chemical warfare. He was only too aware that in the ongoing nuclear arms race among world powers, the US did it first. America was the first to successfully test the atomic bomb — the first to drop it on humanity. The atomic bombs that fell on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945 killed Japanese civilians in the hundreds of thousands — at last causing Japan to surrender and ending World War 2. But what is the atomic bomb but chemical weaponry? It involves the splitting of atoms — a chemical process called nuclear fission (strict physicists deem it a nuclear process) — of radioactive elements (uranium or plutonium) thereby releasing energy the equivalent of 10,000 tons of TNT. Now, it has been to the misfortune of the US that although it blasted nuclear weapons first, Russia eventually overtook it in the race to world nuclear superiority. A US Senate inquiry a year ago had top US war officials admitting that in the event Russia fired its hypersonic missiles at the US, those missiles would be unstoppable, America would be completely defenseless against them. The only possible way of overcoming the Russian superiority in the nuclear arms race is for the US to be able to fire first. This could be the main reason why the US unilaterally broke away from the Intermediate Range Nuclear Force Treaty, which bans signatories from establishing missile launching bases within a certain limit of territory. With that breakaway, the US is no longer encumbered by the ban and so can fire ballistic missiles at its pleasure. BUT neither would any first-strike by US place it at an advantage in a war against Russia, because Russian hypersonic missiles would intercept that US attack right at its inception — in US territory. It would seem that Russian nuclear edge over America is the one single deterrent to explosion of a nuclear Third World War. Going now to the simmering tension between US and China over the South China Sea, the former must be encountering a similar dilemma. President Donald Trump’s tariff war with China has boomeranged on the US, resulting in a slump in its economy, with both US big business and the consumer community protesting the trade war. For solving this US predicament, war with China seems to be the imperative. If it wins over China in a military confrontation, the US will have a convenient tool for writing off its debt of $1 trillion to China. But China, aside from now challenging US for world economic superiority, has also attained such level of development that makes it superior now to the US even in nuclear armaments. For one thing, China now is equipped with hypersonic missiles similar to that of Russia, making it capable of intercepting whatever nuclear warheads the US would be firing, whether from Guam or Australia, or if we are to believe former Intelligence Service of the Armed Forces of the Philippines chief Victor Corpus, even from US nuclear submarines that could be lurking in the Manila Trench in the South China Sea. At the 70th anniversary celebration of the People’s Republic of China at Tiananmen Square last October, China showcased its nuclear arsenal which included, indeed, the hypersonic missile and the DF 31 capable of hitting targets in as far as Homeland America. So, the US is no longer capable of beating China to the draw in nuclear rivalry. The best it could hope to do is engage the Chinese in conventional warfare, which is precisely what it evidently wants to bring about by increasing tension in the South China Sea. Bear in mind the Scarborough Shoal stand-off, the Philippine arbitration case at the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) at the Hague, the agitation for the Philippines to go to war with China in order to push the PCA ruling which is popularly perceived as favoring the Philippines, and the widespread outcry over the accidental ramming by a Chinese vessel of Filipino fishing boat Gemver 2 near Recto Reed sometime late last year. All these have been US machinations to get the Philippines into military confrontation with China. Credit China’s superb diplomacy and the effort of the Philippine Chinese community, particularly the Federation of Filipino-Chinese Chambers of Commerce and Industry, which went the extra mile in helping defuse the tension in the Philippines-China sea row, for setting the atmosphere for averting a needless military confrontation. From all angles of the nuclear arms contest, the US is at an admitted disadvantage and so would not dare prompt China to engage it in that arena. But conventional warfare involving land, sea and air power would be very costly both in terms of men and machine, as the US did experience in such wars it had to run away from as the Vietnam War, the wars against Pakistan and Afghanistan and the Middle East wars. In its persistent confrontation with China, what could be the overriding question for the US is: how to beat China without a fight? (To be continued) "

Hands stands for H-hand washing frequently, A-avoid crowded places, N-never cough without covering the mouth, D- do wear a mask only when experiencing coughs and colds, and S- seek early consultation and medication when symptoms are detected. Health officials said that some symptoms of the new coronavirus are cough, runny nose, fever, headache, sore throat and difficulty in breathing. Gonzales said the virus could be acquired through “person-to-person” only, which could be transmitted through “droplets” from coughing and sneezing. Gonzales also said that wearing a face mask or surgical mask is recommended for individuals with colds and coughs so that they could not infect the persons around them. Wearing a face mask does not guarantee that a person will not be infected by the virus. Gonzalez said the Hands approach is one of the methods that could prevent a person from being infected with all kinds of illnesses. "

,"February 6, 2020",nCov,Inflation hits 8-mo high in January,"Mayvelin U. Caraballo, TMT","THE country’s headline inflation accelerated to an eight-month high of 2.9 percent in January, the Philippines Statistics Authority (PSA) announced on Wednesday, supporting analysts’ consensus view that monetary authorities could resume easing policy rates as early as this month. A vendor puts a price tag on her bananas at her makeshift stall near Quinta Market in Quiapo, Manila in this August 2019 file photo. PHOTO BY ENRIQUE AGCAOILI The figure — up from December’s 2.5 percent and the highest since May 3.2 percent — fell within the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas’ (BSP) 2.5 to 3.3-percent projection. The result matched the 2.9-percent average forecast in a Manila Times poll of economists.
Core inflation, which excludes selected food and energy items, rose to 4.4 percent from 3.1 percent a month earlier and 3.3 percent in January 2019. “The heavily-weighted food and non-alcoholic beverages index, which registered an annual increment of 2.2 percent, primarily contributed to the uptrend of inflation in January 2020,” the PSA said in a statement. Commenting on the January figure, Bangko Sentral Governor Benjamin Diokno said it “is consistent with the BSP’s prevailing assessment that inflation is expected to gradually approach the midpoint of the target range in 2020 and 2021.” The central bank, he added, will consider all the latest developments in the rate-setting meeting of its policy-making Monetary Board on Thursday, February 6. Last year, monetary authorities implemented a combined 75-basis-point (bps) cut in interest rates. This brought overnight borrowing, lending and deposit rates to 4 percent, 4.50 percent, and 3.50 percent, respectively. Citing the latest inflation data, analysts from ING Bank Manila and JP Morgan expect monetary authorities to cut interest rates by 25 bps on Thursday. “With inflation still expected to remain within target and as global growth is likely to be hampered by the spillover effects from the recent 2019-nCoV (2019 novel coronavirus) episode, we expect the central bank to resume unwinding its previous policy tightening to bolster growth momentum and chase the 6.5 to 7.5-percent growth target,” ING senior economist Nicholas Antonio Mapa said. For her part, JP Morgan’s Nur Raisah Rasid based her view on expectations that “the potential macroeconomic impact of the current 2019-nCov outbreak on the Philippine economy could magnify the lingering downside risk to growth emanating from the lackluster capex outlook this year.” ANZ Research’s chief economist Sanjay Mathur and economist Mustafa Arif, meanwhile, see prospects of the headline inflation figure breaching the upper level of the BSP’s target range as remote. “Our current call is for the central bank to cut its policy rate by 25 bps at its March meeting, although the odds for a cut at tomorrow’s meeting have increased,” they said.
Contradicting them is Nomura economist Euben Paracuelles, who sees the Bangko Sentral keeping its policy rates unchanged on Thursday. “The further pick-up in headline inflation in January was within [the] BSP’s projected range of 2.5 to 3.3 percent, as opposed to materially surprising to the downside, which supports our call for BSP to keep policy settings stable,” he said. Also on Wednesday, the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) said the government remained vigilant as upside risks had emerged from several unexpected phenomena and despite a stable inflation outlook for 2020. “Despite the relatively stable inflation outlook, we cannot be complacent, as the balance of risks remains on the upside for 2020 due to the effects of the Taal Volcano eruption, spread of [the] African Swine Fever, and [the 2019-nCoV],” Socioeconomic Planning Secretary Ernesto Pernia said. He also said the country had intensified its preparedness for disaster risk response, including the formulation of recovery and rehabilitation plans, like in areas affected by the January 12 eruption. Moreover, Pernia said that at the local level, biosecurity and border control measures are being strengthened and regulation on the movement of pork products are strictly enforced around the country. He advised everyone to be on guard against the 2019-nCoV, be aware of related developments here and abroad, and observe precautionary measures and advisories from the Department of Health and other concerned agencies.

,"February 6, 2020",nCov,PH factory output sinks in full year,"Mayvelin U. Caraballo, TMT","THE country’s manufacturing output last December, both in volume and value, continued to contract from the negative growths posted a month and a year earlier, the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) reported on Wednesday. Results of the PSA’s Monthly Integrated Survey of Selected Industries showed that the country’s volume of production index declined by 10.1 percent in December, faster than the 7.8-percent decrease in November and the 9.3-percent drop a year ago. The value of production index also eased further by 9.5 percent from November’s 7.4-percent fall and the 9.1-percent contraction a year earlier. Ernesto Pernia In a statement, the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) said both indices remained in the negative territory for the entire 2019, resulting in a full-year decline of 8.6 percent and 7.1 percent, respectively. “This reversed the positive growth of manufacturing that was recorded in 2018,” it added. Rizal Commercial Banking Corp. economist Michael Ricafort said the latest figures “may be attributed to the lingering US-China trade war that slowed down global economic growth and global trade in 2019, [which partly resulted in] slower demand on Philippine exports and manufacturing.” Lower demand, he added, may also still reflect government underspending, especially on infrastructure, for most of the year because of the delay in the approval of the national budget for 2019; and the slowdown in foreign direct investments (FDIs) into the country. Going forward, Ricafort sees manufacturing activity to improve this year as demand would be spurred by the early approval of the 2020 national budget; the catch-up in state spending, especially on infrastructure; the possible passage of the Corporate Income Tax and Incentive Rationalization Act into law, which could help increase FDIs into the country; relatively low interest rates, which could encourage the financing of more local and foreign investments in the country; and some pickup in global economic growth in 2020. He warned, however, that concerns over the 2019 novel coronavirus acute respiratory disease could slow down global economic growth and global trade, especially in China, the world’s second biggest-economy and one of the Philippines’ major trading partners. Meanwhile, the NEDA said the government should continue supporting initiatives toward digital solutions in the private sector to boost manufacturing growth and bounce back from its decline in 2019. “We encourage industries to capitalize on innovation to reach their growth potential in this era of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. To this end, the government needs to formulate and implement policies and programs to stimulate innovation in the country,” Socioeconomic Planning Secretary Ernesto Pernia said. Building the capacity of the workforce and embedding innovation in training are also crucial to meet technical and emerging market demands. “The Philippines also needs to improve its reputation concerning intellectual property protection. This will attract foreign companies to locate sensitive technologies and product operations in the country,” Pernia said. These will also allow the country to expand from the production of basic products and commodities to higher value intermediate and specialty products for domestic and export purposes. “To support manufacturing growth, there is a need to strengthen the transport and logistics sectors by building quality and climate-resilient infrastructure. In this regard, a proposed bill to amend the Contractor’s License Law will open up the country’s construction sector to eligible and qualified domestic and foreign contractors,” Pernia said. "
,"February 6, 2020",nCov,"Sensitive indicators are good for gossip, and not much else",The Manila Times,"MOST have taken note that the year 2020 has gotten off to an unusually stressful start, with the month of January and the first few days of February being filled with memorable, and mostly calamitous events. The year began with historic bushfires raging across large parts of Australia; an act of war by the United States against Iran, which Iran fortunately has responded to with remarkable restraint; the beginning of the 2019-nCoV coronavirus epidemic (the first death was recorded on January 9); and the unexpected eruption of Taal Volcano. A plague of locusts, said to be the worst in 70 years, has blanketed East Africa; the impeachment of US President Donald Trump, only the third US president to face that ignominious rite (and the third acquitted by the US Senate) in the country’s long history was held; the African Swine Flu made an unexpected and apparently widespread appearance in Mindanao; and on the first day of February, a spectacular fire in Manila that destroyed a San Miguel packaging warehouse also destroyed about a half-kilometer of the still-unfinished Skyway Stage 3, pushing the completion date of the already long overdue and vastly over-budget project to at least July, and probably much later. Apart from all that, Great Britain made its formal exit from the European Union on January 31; that was expected, but the reality of the Brexit still rattled markets and much of the public. And in a minor incident, but one that many in the US saw as a harbinger of doom for the all-important US elections in November, the Iowa caucuses, a non-binding vote that traditionally signals the beginning of the US presidential campaign, was derailed by technical problems with a mobile app organizers inexplicably decided to use to transmit vote tallies. Every one of these events has at least once been identified as having some effect on economic indicators such as gross domestic product (GDP) and inflation. Sometimes they are taken together, as in, “The occurrence of Event A and Event B and Event C contributes to global uncertainty that will negatively affect GDP growth.” Either way, whether a change in an indicator is related to a specific situation or the catch-all of “global uncertainty,” that change is always incremental — perhaps a fraction of a percentage point, perhaps as much as 1 percent — if it is quantified at all, which it usually is not. If you actually live in “an economy,” however, you may have noticed something puzzling: unless there is a very extreme change in circumstances, something that tends to happen only rarely, and more often than not on a relatively localized scale, economic conditions tend to be rather consistent. Changes will be noticeable in something like gas or food prices, for instance, but only over a timeframe of weeks or months. Changes in something bigger like GDP take even longer to be noticed, and sometimes never are. A moderate slowing of GDP growth, on an individual scale, might manifest itself as a worker not getting a raise in pay that he wasn’t aware was even being considered in the first place. So why is so much attention given to sensitive indicators, especially when exacting forecasts are almost never right? The simple reason for this is that there are too many economic analysts and too many business journalists, every one of them is expected to do something resembling work every day, and so they must parse things down to very fine shards in order to stay busy. If it were not for financial markets, the information they share would be utterly useless to anyone. And in the case of the markets, they only use the information for the same reason the sources of it do – to look busy. In 250 years of economic study and thought, most practitioners of the discipline have never figured out that the only useful indicators are specific, undefined ones. For example, “China’s tourism industry will suffer losses in revenue due to the coronavirus epidemic” is a useful indicator, at least to tourism-related businesses in China. But if the media and economic analysts and consultants left it at that, they would be hard-pressed to fill the remaining 59 minutes and 45 seconds of the hour. No one wants that. ben.kritz@manilatimes.net

GETTING READY Nurses at the Ospital ng Parañaque set up equipment inside a tent that would be used to quarantine patients with the 2019 novel coronavirus. PHOTO BY ENRIQUE AGCAOILI At the same time, Health officials said the number of patients suspected to have been infected with the disease rose to 133. Health Undersecretary Orlando Domingo said the 60-year-old woman tested positive for the 2019-nCoV ARD in late January, but she has returned to China. “The patient was infected but was getting better, and a week later, she was discharged,” Domingo said in a news briefing in Manila. The woman was allowed to leave the hospital after her swabs that were tested by the Victorian Australia and Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) came back negative twice. The elderly woman arrived in Cebu City from Wuhan, China via Hong Kong on January 20. She then went to Bohol. Two days later, the Chinese went to a private hospital in Bohol after developing a fever.
AirAsia said it would cooperate with authorities in tracking down the passengers who shared the plane ride with the Chinese woman. “AirAsia is ready and willing to provide relevant documents to the DoH, including the flight manifest and available contact details of guests on board the flight, given the urgency of this situation. The operating flight crews have also been quarantined in compliance with the Philippine government’s travel ban. We advise passengers on-board this flight to seek medical help if they have been feeling unwell,” it said in a statement. Meanwhile, the DoH reported that the number of persons under investigation (PUIs) increased to 133 on Wednesday. There were only 80 PUIs the previous day. Of the 133 PUIs, 115 are currently admitted in hospitals and have been isolated, while 16 have been discharged and placed under strict monitoring. The Health department said out of 133, 63 are Filipinos, 54 are Chinese and 16 are of various nationalities. Filipino quarantined Also on Wednesday, the Department of Foreign Affairs said a Filipino was one of the 10 people on board a quarantined cruise ship in Japan who were found infected with nCoV. The unidentified Filipino, a crew of the cruise ship, will be transferred to a healthcare facility along with the others infected with the virus. The Philippine Embassy in Tokyo said it was closely monitoring the welfare of 538 Filipinos on board the Diamond Princess cruise ship. “The ship is currently docked off the port of Yokohama, Japan under a quarantine implemented by the Japanese government,” Undersecretary Eduardo Meñez said. More cities shut down In China, millions more people were ordered to stay indoors as China battled to curb the spread of the new virus that authorities said has already killed nearly 500 people. With more than 24,000 cases in China, a growing number of cities have been imposing a range of restrictions in recent days far from central Hubei province, the epicenter of the outbreak, as authorities struggle to contain the virus. Global concerns have risen as more countries found cases that were not imported from China. Some 56 million people in Hubei have been under virtual lockdown since last week, with its capital Wuhan at the heart of the health emergency. In Hangzhou, some 175 kilometers (110 miles) southwest of Shanghai, green fences blocked streets near the headquarters of Chinese tech giant Alibaba as a fighter jet circled overhead. Alibaba, one of the world’s most valuable companies, appeared shut down, while deliverymen moved in and out of the nearby fenced-in residential areas to drop off groceries. Many people were also seen going out. The firm is inside one of three districts where some 3 million people were told this week that only one person per household would be allowed outside every two days to buy necessities. At least three other cities in eastern Zhejiang province — Taizhou, Wenzhou and parts of Ningbo — have imposed the same measures, affecting some 18 million people. Similar policies were encouraged by authorities in two cities as far as China’s northeasternmost province, Heilongjiang, and a handful of others along the east coast. In Henan province, which borders Hubei, a district in the city of Zhumadian decided that only one person could leave each household every five days. Residents there have been offered cash rewards for informing on people from Hubei. ‘Window of opportunity’ The World Health Organization (WHO) said the dramatic measures taken by China offered a chance to halt transmission. WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the great majority of cases were in China.
“That doesn’t mean that it won’t get worse. But for sure we have a window of opportunity to act,” he said. Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand all reported new infections not imported from China on Tuesday (Wednesday in Manila). Two fatalities have been reported outside the mainland, in Hong Kong and the Philippines. With Bernadette Tamayo and AFP "

PNA PHOTO Health Undersecretary Myrna Cabotaje said the 42 Filipinos who will be repatriated from Hubei, China would be flown to Clark in Pampanga. From there, they will be transported to Fort Magsaysay where they will be observed if they show the symptoms of the 2019 novel coronavirus acute respiratory disease (2019-nCoV ARD). The Department of Foreign Affairs earlier said that 42 Filipinos have asked to be repatriated. They will arrive on Saturday, February 8. “They will be on quarantine because they are coming from the hot zone,” Cabotaje said during the hearing at the House of Representatives on Wednesday. Cabotaje said officials were also looking for other quarantine sites such as Caballo Island near Manila Bay. Meanwhile, the DoH’s National Capital Region director, Corazon Flores, said they have presented the guidelines, decision criteria and other measures on nCoV to the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council and local government units. For health workers, Cabotaje said the DoH and hospitals have laid down guidelines to ensure the safety of health personnel. She said the P2.2 billion budget that President Rodrigo Dtuerte provided would be used to procure protective equipment and face masks. Also on Wednesday, Sen. Francis Tolentino urged the DoH to procure rapid test kits to detect if a person is infected with the nCoV instead of buying hazardous material or hazmat suits. Tolentino said experts from China’s Jiangsu province have developed a “rapid nucleic test kit” that can detect the virus within 8 to 15 minutes, making it easier to confirm the infection among persons under investigation or PIUs. “Given that you have the necessary budget for the chemical suits, what is important is to detect at the ground level,” Tolentiono said.

In a statement, SCP said parents and caregivers should “promote hygiene practices, including hand washing with soap among children,” to protect them from respiratory ailments such as the 2019-nCoV ARD. SCP Chief Executive Officer Alberto Muyot said children under 5 years old are the most vulnerable to diseases because of their weak immune system. “Every child has the right to have access to safe water supply, adequate sanitation facilities at home, in school, especially in emergency situations like the Taal Volcano eruption where children are among the most affected,” he added. Muyot also raised concern that thousands of learners miss out on school due to the suspension of classes in selected schools in Metro Manila, as preventive move to stop possible spread of 2019-nCoV ARD. Education Secretary Leonor Briones earlier said schools and local government units have the discretion to suspend classes, but they have to conduct makeup classes. The Department of Health has confirmed that two Chinese tested positive for the nCoV in the country. The second confirmed case died last Saturday at the San Lazaro Hospital in Sta. Cruz Manila. SCP Water, Sanitation and Hygiene Advisor Jonathan Valdez said parents and caregivers have important roles to protect children from airborne diseases and infections. “Children learn by example, including proper hygiene practice of parents and caregivers,” he added. He said children could learn from parents some hygiene practices to protect themselves such as proper hand washing with soap and clean water; avoiding touching the eyes, nose or mouth with dirty hands; avoiding getting near other children/adults who are sick; and avoiding eating raw or undercooked animal products. Valdez also urged parents and caregivers to seek medical help when their children or they themselves feel sick and to not self-medicate. “By protecting themselves, parents and caregivers can prevent the spread of airborne diseases at home, thus, setting the first line of defense for their children,” he said. He reminded parents and caregivers to handle and prepare food safely and cook animal products thoroughly. “Parents and caregivers should maintain clean, surfaces and objects particularly for babies prone to putting objects to their mouth,” Valdez said. SCP is advocating exclusive breastfeeding to babies from newborn to six months and continuous breastfeeding to babies up to two years old to support their immune system. It also provides access to safe water for drinking and hygiene, toilet and washing facilities in schools to ensure that children practice proper hygiene. "

Toshiro Muto said he hoped the outbreak in China would be quickly contained to restore confidence in the run-up to the Olympics. “We are extremely worried in the sense that the spread of the infectious virus could pour cold water on momentum for the Games,” he said before a meeting with the International Paralympic Committee (IPC).

We plan to cooperate with the IOC (International Olympic Committee), the IPC, the government and the city of Tokyo to tackle the disease.” More than 20 countries have confirmed cases of the pathogen, which has killed nearly 500 people and infected at least 24,000 in mainland China. Japan has had no reported deaths so far, but at least 10 people on a cruise ship carrying 3,711 passengers and crew quarantined off Yokohama have tested positive for the new coronavirus. Saburo Kawabuchi, the mayor of the Athletes’ Village where an expected 11,000 sportsmen and women will stay, struck a sombre tone. “I hope from my heart that we can overcome this (virus) and have a smooth Olympics,” said the former Japanese football chief. “We will do our everything we can to protect the athletes to allow them to produce their best performances.” Tokyo governor Yuriko Koike promised at the weekend to implement “thorough measures” to protect people from the coronavirus in the run-up to the Olympics. Japan has warned citizens against non-essential travel to China and fast-tracked new rules including limits on entering the country as it tries to contain the spread of the virulent new coronavirus. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe vowed earlier this week that the country would work with the World Health Organization (WHO) to ensure preparations for the Tokyo Olympics would not be disrupted. He also revealed that Japan was developing rapid test kits for the virus. “By coordinating our efforts with the WHO and other related agencies, we will take appropriate steps so that preparations to hold the events will steadily continue,” Abe told a parliamentary session. The Japanese government has chartered three flights to repatriate 565 Japanese nationals from Wuhan, the central Chinese city hardest hit by the virus.

,"February 6, 2020",nCov,"Oxford, Merriam-Webster pick different words of the year for 2019",Yen Makabenta,"YEN MAKABENTA First word 
I WANT to give the coronavirus outbreak a rest even though I have a pile of fresh information to report. Instead, I will devote my space today to the annual “word of the year” awards. As in the case with film awards, the top English dictionaries do not march in lockstep in making their selection of the word of the year. The Merriam-Webster and Oxford dictionaries had markedly different picks as their 2019 Word of the Year. Merriam-Webster curiously bestowed its recognition on the personal pronoun “they.” Oxford awarded its recognition to the neologism, “climate emergency” in a salute to climate change propaganda. Why Merriam-Webster chose ‘they’
Merriam-Webster explained its selection as follows:
“Our Word of the Year for 2019 is ‘they.’ It reflects a surprising fact: even a basic term — a personal pronoun — can rise to the top of our data. Although our look-ups are often driven by events in the news, the dictionary is also a primary resource for information about language itself, and the shifting use of ‘they’ has been the subject of increasing study and commentary in recent years. Look-ups for ‘they’ increased by 313 percent in 2019 over the previous year. “English famously lacks a gender-neutral singular pronoun to correspond neatly with singular pronouns like ‘everyone’ or ‘someone,’ and as a consequence ‘they’ has been used for this purpose for over 600 years. “More recently, though, ‘they’ has also been used to refer to one person whose gender identity is nonbinary, a sense that is increasingly common in published, edited text, as well as social media and in daily personal interactions between English speakers. There’s no doubt that its use is established in the English language, which is why it was added to the Merriam-Webster.com dictionary this past September. “Nonbinary ‘they’ was also prominent in the news in 2019. Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal (WA) revealed in April during a House judiciary committee hearing on the Equality Act that her child is gender-nonconforming and uses ‘they.’ Singer Sam Smith announced in September that they now prefer ‘they’ and ‘them’ as their third person personal pronouns. And the American Psychological Association’s blog officially recommended that singular ‘they’ be preferred in professional writing over “he or she” when the reference is to a person whose gender is unknown or to a person who prefers ‘they.’ It is increasingly common to see ‘they’ and ‘them’ as a person’s pronouns in Twitter bios, email signatures and conference nametags.” Bryan Garner, author of Garner’s Modern English Usage, comments on the new uses of ‘they’ in the National Review (Jan. 23, 2020). He wrote: “The ‘new’ sense of ‘they’ is as a singular pronoun. By a confluence of natural linguistic evolution and a couple of social-engineering campaigns, the word has been thrust into prominence in the last few years. “The evolutionary part has to do with the lack in English of a common-gender third-person singular pronoun. The problem often arises with indefinite pronouns: Everyone can think for himself. Herself? Themselves? Themself? If we stipulate, as 18th-century grammarians did, that the indefinite pronoun ‘everyone’ is singular, what reflexive complement are we to use? In 1745, an English grammarian named Anne Fisher posited that the masculine singular pronoun includes the feminine. So for more than 250 years, speakers of Standard English satisfied themselves with, ‘Everyone can think for himself.’ Grammarians became resolute on the point. “But this solution never really sat well, especially toward the end of the 20th century. Feminists argued (rightly, I think) that the generic masculine pronoun was sexist. Hence ‘enlightened’ speakers would utter, ploddingly, ‘Everyone can think for himself or herself.’ “Then gender politics came into play. As women became an ever-larger segment of the workforce, there were [for example] policy manuals whose provisions felt awkward: An employee may file an EEOC (Equal Employment Opportunity Commission) claim if he believes that he has been discriminated against. All the while, grammatical traditionalists insisted that the masculine includes the feminine. “But then another aspect of gender politics came into play. Some progressives argued that just as we shouldn’t care whether a woman was married or single (the Miss vs Mrs. vs Ms. debate of the 1970s), why should we care whether a person is male or female if it’s irrelevant to an account?… “After the Supreme Court declared in Obergefell v. Hodges that people have a constitutional right to same-sex marriage — and that legal point was firmly settled — a new progressive issue came to the fore: transgender rights. Lots of people now objected even to references to he or she on grounds that these references excluded people who saw themselves as neither a he nor a she. The binary nature of language is itself discriminatory, the argument ran (and still runs)… “In the last five years alone, the singular ‘they’ has been accepted (mostly for transgender people) by most style guides, starting with the Washington Post in 2015 and most recently, in 2019, by The Associated Press Stylebook and The Chicago Manual of Style, together with the style guides of the New York Times and professional associations such as the American Medical Association and the American Psychological Association… “Traditionalists won’t have it. Progressives champion it. Arguments ensue, neither side typically understanding the other’s viewpoint.” Why Oxford chose ‘climate emergency’
In November last year, the Oxford dictionaries declared “climate emergency” as the word of the year for 2019. The definitive record of the English language (referring to Oxford) found a 100-fold increase in the usage of the word. “This represents a new trend in the use of the word emergency,” Oxford said. According to the graph put up by the Oxford English Corpus, for 2018, the frequency per billion words for “climate emergency” was observed to be less than 1,000. But in June-July 2019, it spiked to 5,300. The highest was found in September, with the usage showing a 100-fold increase. As a result, Oxford announced “climate emergency” as the word of the year. In an official statement, they said: “‘Climate emergency’ has been central to 2019 overall, and features in several prominent phrases. However, ‘climate emergency’ stands out for several reasons.” It was observed that in 2018, “climate” did not feature in some of the top words. Besides, “emergency” saw seldom occurrence. However, in 2019, the combination of “climate” and “emergency” saw a phenomenal increase. “Climate emergency” surpassed all other types of emergencies to become the most written about by a considerable margin. It was even used over three times the usage frequency of “health,” the second-ranking word, they said. Taking a look at the equivalent data, Oxford found that for climate collocations — such as “climate crisis” and “climate action” (both are included in Word of the Year 2019 shortlist) — “climate emergency” is still the popular one. “As recorded in our corpus, it (climate emergency) exceeded more moderate or speculative pairings like ‘climate variability’ and ‘climate prediction’,” the officials added. This data put out by Oxford is significant because it indicates a growing shift in people’s language choice in 2019. This is plainly inconclusive. “Climate emergency” is not going to have a long shelf life. Climate activists are losing heavily in their long-running debate with climate realists and skeptics. “Climate emergency” looks fated to be abandoned in the same way that the once popular “population bomb” and “population explosion” have been totally abandoned. yenobserver@gmail.com "
,"February 6, 2020",nCov,The Gringo Honasan I used to admire,Ramon T. Tulfo,"Ramon T. Tulfo PRESIDENT Digong’s statement about the 2019 novel coronavirus should put everyone at ease. The President said: “Let’s start with the narratives by saying that everything is well in the country. “There is really nothing to be extra scared of that coronavirus thing although it has affected a lot of countries… You know one or two in any country is not really that fearsome.” The Department Health says that the first case of confirmed death outside Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the coronavirus, took place in a Manila hospital. Digong was echoing what United States President Franklin Delano Roosevelt told his countrymen during the Great Depression in 1933: “The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.” In a metaphysical sense, we attract what we fear. So, if we collectively fear the spread of the coronavirus in the country as a result of only one death, that fear will manifest in reality. * * * Fear has gripped the world over the coronavirus, fanned by a World Health Organization (WHO) declaration of a “worldwide emergency.” But why didn’t WHO declare a worldwide emergency during the H1N1 epidemic outbreak that originated in the US in 2009. H1N1 flu afflicted 1,632,258 people in 24 countries and killed 285,000. In contrast, the Wuhan epidemic — which China said started on Dec. 31, 2019 — has only infected 20,630 people and killed 427 as of last report. Of the total fatalities, one is in Manila and the rest in Wuhan and Hong Kong. The patient who died of the coronavirus in Manila flew here from Wuhan via Hong Kong. But to repeat what Digong said in that press conference in Malacañang, “one or two [deaths] in any country is really not that fearsome.” As an American saying goes, one swallow does not a summer make. An aside: swallow became the national bird of the US during the administration of President Bill Clinton, courtesy of Monica Lewinsky. * * * How did Information Technology and Communications Secretary Gregorio “Gringo” Honasan 2nd spend the P300 million in intelligence funds that he reportedly got as cash advances from his department? And what’s the purpose of an intelligence fund in a non-military agency like the Department of Information and Communications (DICT)? DICT Undersecretary Eliseo Rio Jr. has resigned, citing Honasan’s P300-million cash advances from the department’s P400-million intelligence funds for 2019. The law mandates that expenditures for intelligence and confidential funds cannot be audited. But the Commission on Audit has “cast doubt on the regularity, validity and propriety of the [P300 million] disbursement.” Honasan said the cash advances in three tranches — P100 million each on Nov. 8, Dec. 3, and Dec. 17, 2019 — would be spent on cybersecurity. But a source in a military cybersecurity unit said the group did not receive a single centavo from the DICT. So, where did the money go? Rio, who until his resignation was undersecretary for operations, said cybersecurity surveillance was not part of the mandate of the DICT. Hmmm. Something smells fishy here. * * * I used to admire Honasan who led several coup attempts against the administration of President Corazon Aquino. In fact, I considered Honasan a close friend after he taught me some basics in combat shooting in 1980 and took me into his confidence. I was then with the Manila Bulletin as a police reporter pinch-hitting for the reporters covering the defense beat on their days off. Honasan, who got his moniker for his mestizo features, was then a lieutenant colonel serving under the defense ministry security group. Honasan, who kept an aquarium of man-eating piranhas in his office, would point out to me the piranhas that he named after some corrupt generals then in the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP), which included the now defunct Philippine Constabulary. Honasan, who was baron of the Philippine Military Academy Class of 1971, said there was complete demoralization in the AFP because of corruption. He said there should be a complete overhaul of the AFP because of massive corruption. I didn’t know it at the time but he and some of his classmates were already plotting to overthrow the government of President Ferdinand Marcos, which culminated in the EDSA Revolution of Feb. 22 to 26, 1986. I had no idea at the time that he would follow the way of the generals that he once hated. Power tends to corrupt; absolute power corrupts absolutely. "

In Vietnam’s southern business hub of Ho Chi Minh city — where three cases of coronavirus have been confirmed — two existing facilities are being converted into field hospitals with a total capacity of 500 beds. They will “receive, monitor and treat” all suspected patients of coronavirus if the epidemic spreads further, according to the director of the city’s health department, Nguyen Tan Binh. In Hanoi, two military facilities have been turned into quarantine centers for up to 1,500 people as the country prepares to receive 950 people from China to be isolated at the sites. Two provinces in northern Vietnam near the China border have also set up beds for close to 3,000 patients. Central Vietnam has centers ready for as many as 3,700. Vietnam has not announced plans to repatriate it citizens from China en masse, though 21 Vietnamese students in Wuhan — the centre of the epidemic — could be brought back on a chartered flight, the government said. Vietnam has banned all flights to and from mainland China and suspended new tourist visas for Chinese nationals or foreigners who have been there in the past two weeks. All passenger trains to and from China have also been halted. AFP "
,"February 6, 2020",nCov,AI to play smart role in epidemic control,Xinhua,"BEIJING: China has called on the country’s artificial intelligence (AI) sector to lend their technological hands to help battle the epidemic. Research and development should be enhanced and industrial cooperation is encouraged to contribute to the discovery, awareness and control of the novel coronavirus, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology said Tuesday in a proposal. A bus dispatcher (right) measures the temperature of a staff member at a bus station in Beijing, capital of China, Feb. 3, 2020. Monday marks the first working day after the Spring Festival holidays for Beijing. Beijing Public Transport Corporation has taken measures such as cleaning and disinfecting buses, ventilating the air, measuring the temperatures of staff members and ensuring staffs working with face masks to prevent the spread of novel coronavirus. XINHUA PHOTO Related AI technologies could be applied to roll out smart devices to support diagnosis and treatment, and used in telecommuting, online education and intelligent production to ensure minimal disruption to people’s lives. The proposal also encouraged the sector to optimize algorithms and enhance computing power to aid the development of related drugs and vaccines. AI is already in use in the country’s epidemic control efforts. Some hospitals are using smart devices to assist diagnosis while train stations install AI-empowered thermal imagers to take passengers’ temperature. Meanwhile, Chinese developers are working on the research and development of a robot that can replace nurses in conducting throat testing to reduce the spread of the novel coronavirus. The research and development started over a week ago by the country’s major robot manufacturer Siasun and the Shenyang Institute of Automation of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Multiple departments have been mobilized in the development, installation and testing work to save time. In a new coronavirus test, a nurse uses a swab to collect secretions from the patient’s throat for testing, which risks infecting the nurse because of the exposure to the virus. The robot, which will include a snake-shaped mechanical arm and a swab collection part, can be controlled remotely to protect the medical staff from being infected, according to Siasun Robot and Automation Co., Ltd.

,"February 6, 2020",nCov,Viral politics,Antonio Contreras,"ANTONIO CONTRERAS REPEATEDLY, we have been hearing officials and supporters of the Duterte government decry critics for politicizing the 2019 novel coronavirus acute respiratory disease (2019-nCoV ARD) outbreak. They have to be called out. They wrongly associate the act of politicizing only with those who are critical of the President, implying that they are aboveboard, and what they do is not political. What is even worse is to imply that politicization is such a bad word. As a political scientist, it is my duty to my academic discipline to educate people about what it means to politicize. The prevailing understanding about the political has gone beyond the confines of the state. Politics is about the exercise of power, and considering that it occurs not only within the state, that politics is present even in ordinary lives. To be political, therefore, is to be involved in the exercise of power in all its manifestations — from the exploitative and oppressive to the empowering and liberating. It can happen on matters of governance, even as it can express itself in personal relationships. To politicize is not a bad thing. People who speak up against oppression politicize the issue, in the same manner as those who tolerate oppression by actively justifying it. It can happen at all levels — from the level of the violation of human rights by the state, to the violation of human rights by individuals. It is easy to malign resistive forms of politics. After all, they challenge established power and authority, and they become politically inconvenient to the establishment. But it has to be said, if only to finally expose the hypocrisy, if not ignorance of many who easily throw around a label that they absolutely know nothing about. A government functionary who is involved in spinning propaganda is as involved in politics, and is an agent of politicization, as the political activist who calls out the propaganda. It is really odd how many in government and its supporters and defenders can easily accuse those who are critical of the government’s reaction to the 2019-nCoV outbreak as guilty of politicizing the issue, without bothering to closely examine the actions of government itself. The 2019-nCoV outbreak is by nature a public health issue, and there is a science behind it. It is common ideally that in order to contain the spread of the virus, quarantine procedures are conducted. These can happen in small-scale laboratory or hospital settings, or on a larger scale. The latter can manifest in actual lockdowns of large areas and in the issuance of travel bans not only within countries but also across countries. We do it even to animals and animal products, as when our government did when it barred the transport, entry and importation of pork products to contain the African swine fever. It doesn’t take a genius to understand that if we can do it to pigs, we can do it to humans. This otherwise technical issue of ordering a travel ban to contain and prevent the spread of a viral epidemic is not a politicized move but is merely an appeal to impose a scientific protocol. In fact, it was the government that politicized it first when it initially refused to impose a total travel ban for the simple reason that it might offend China. It was Health Secretary Francisco Duque 3rd who started politicizing it when he made such a claim. Sen. Christopher Lawrence Go further cemented the politicization when he rationalized that it would be difficult to impose a total travel ban from and to China since it is not the only country with confirmed cases of the 2019-nCoV. To politicize simply means to overlay an issue with considerations emanating from power relations. Our relation with China is a pure and unadulterated embodiment of power. Our hesitation to offend it expresses those power relations. And it doesn’t end there. Power also operates in the manner information is shared and revealed. This is precisely why it is ridiculous for people whose involvement in the Duterte administration, either as functionary or as social media enabler, entailed spinning and packaging the information to marshal support to dare accuse critics of politicizing the issue. Even a freshman journalism major will tell you that Secretary Duque effectively buried the lead story about the death of the second case of 2019-nCoV in the country in the press release issued by the Department of Health (DoH) on February 2. A close perusal of the press release reveals that it was only in the third paragraph that the fatality was mentioned casually, while what was given prominence in the first paragraph was the news about those who tested negative. One could say that we should not dwell on the bad news, and that Duque and the DoH were only trying to organize the messaging to avoid panic. But clearly, a piece of information as vital as a fatality from a deadly disease is a significant matter. Trying to massage the message to paint a safer and more convenient narrative is patently a form of politicization of the information to benefit the government. Meanwhile, even as Duterte officials, supporters and defenders are asking people not to politicize the 2019 nCoV outbreak, the Senate president, Vicente Sotto 3rd, and the Foreign Affairs secretary, Teodoro Locsin Jr., have contributed to the politicization of the issue. During a Senate hearing the other day, the former played a wild conspiracy theory video about the virus being a biological attack against China, while the latter wasted no time in feeding such wild allegations that even included the US as a possible culprit. This, after the Presidential Communications Operations Office had asked people not to share fake news. What is worse, our top diplomat even went to the extent of defending China from allegations that it withheld information about the virus, while taking a dig at the United States and other countries. In addition to showing his pro-China bias, he effectively transformed the unverified video into material to politicize the 2019-nCoV outbreak by spinning political intrigue between countries. "
,"February 6, 2020",nCov,Let’s learn from the nation’s battle against SARS,Ricardo Saludo,"RICARDO SALUDO IT’s much harder the first time. The 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) global epidemic caught the world by surprise, with months passing before the World Health Organization (WHO) and national health authorities began to know the microbe they were dealing with. Despite that fumbling time, with little disease readiness than the world has today, there are still a good number of lessons to learn and apply in today’s 2019 novel coronavirus acute respiratory disease (2019-nCoV ARD) crisis, especially from the Philippine and Asian responses to SARS. The report on how the nation and the region dealt with the 2003 contagion comprises Chapter 4 of Beating the Odds, a book on crisis management under then-President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, coauthored by this writer and University of the Philippines political science professor Dr. Renato Velasco. As the 2010 book recounts, SARS infected 8,096 people and killed 774 worldwide, mostly in China, between November 2002, when the virus first surfaced, and July 2003, when it was subsiding. With international travel and trade carrying the contagion across borders and oceans, Shigeru Omi, the WHO regional director for the Western Pacific, called it “the first emerging disease of the age of globalization.” Lesson No. 1: Build a team
So, what’s there to learn from the fight against SARS in the Philippines and Asia? For starters, President Arroyo recognized the danger and mobilized the many agencies needed to counter the contagion by creating the SARS Management Team (SMT) in March 2003, even when the disease was yet confined to a few countries, and the Philippines was still SARS-free. The SMT ensured top-level focus and clout on the disease, plus the breadth of agencies and the heft of resources for initiatives needed to block its entry and contain its spread. Led by then-Health Secretary Manuel Dayrit, with then-National Security Adviser Roilo Golez as chief adviser, the team included the Departments of Foreign Affairs, the Interior and Local Government, and Labor and Employment (DoLE). Plus the Bureau of Immigration, the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG), the Manila International Airport Authority and the Philippine Society of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases. A month after creating the SMT in April 2003, President Arroyo made sure it wasn’t short on power and money. She issued Executive Order 201, defining the authority and responsibilities of team agencies, and allocating P1 billion in sweepstakes funds for the anti-SARS campaign. Secretary Dayrit was empowered to mobilize not only national agencies, but even the Armed Forces of the Philippines, the Philippine National Police and the PCG, especially to enforce quarantine. These anti-contagion measures eventually found their way to the tough law on quarantine passed in 2004, and now buttressing the system to contain cross-border diseases. Formulated by the Department of Health (DoH), the SMT implemented a five-pronged SARS control policy: 1) prevent or minimize the entry of SARS cases from abroad; 2) prevent or minimize local transmission of the disease; 3) prevent or minimize SARS deaths; 4) educate the public on effective behavior to prevent SARS; and 5) mitigate non-health consequences, like the adverse impact on tourism and overseas employment. The government undertook measures to protect and aid doctors, nurses and other health workers combating the contagion. President Arroyo visited them at the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM), where many SARS patients were quarantined, despite warnings not to risk infection. Besides moral support, there was material aid: the Philippine Health Insurance Corp. allocated P100,000 each for medical expenses of infected health workers and P50,000 for patients needing hospitalization. Fighting untruth and hysteria
Crucial to beating SARS was public information so people do not panic, and, instead, take personal steps to avoid infection. Besides disseminating bulletins, the DoH designated official spokesmens on the issue, including Secretary Dayrit, the heads of RITM and the National Epidemiology Center, which monitors the spread of diseases; DoH regional directors; and the WHO representative in the country. The Health department and the Bureau of Quarantine also opened SARS hotlines via cellphones, landlines and email to handle questions and concerns from the public. The Philippine Overseas Employment Agency, other DoLE-attached agencies and Philippine embassies provided information to overseas Filipino workers (OFWs). And in an unprecedented message, President Arroyo called on OFWs who may be ill to defer travel back home: “I will never, never prevent a Filipino from coming home, but … This is one sacrifice I am asking for the sake of our country, and I shall be very grateful for your forbearance.” Last but not least, to urge media to practice responsible reporting, she held several lunch meetings with newspaper publishers and editors, and broadcast network heads. The DoH also gave ethical policy guidelines for media and advertisers in handling SARS-related information. All that helped minimize fake news. The international front
The international effort was, of course, essential in containing SARS. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations joined China, Japan and South Korea in crafting and instituting agreed measures to stanch the viral spread across borders. In April 2003, the month after the contagion was identified, the 10 nations’ health ministers convened in Bangkok to devise a regional action plan. Among priority measures were airport protocols and steps to protect health workers at all costs, being the most crucial in the anti-SARS effort. After the regional initiatives were agreed, the heads of state of all 10 countries met and affirmed the measures. The summit agreed on a six-point plan, including: – Exchange of information on SARS control and treatment; – Designation of a contact entity in each country, to join an information-sharing network; – Research programs to trace SARS spread patterns and pathology, and training on handling severe cases; a high-level international symposium on SARS in China; special symposia to assess the political, economic and security impact and how to address them. Three Philippine action points were adopted: a policy to give foreign patients the same treatment and care as locals, the creation of a $1-billion Asean SARS fund and an immediate meeting of airport officials. There are other notable measures recounted in the Beating the Odds chapter. The good news is many are already part of the DoH anti-contagion protocol. Having weathered SARS, the Philippines and Asia are better equipped to deal with the 2019-nCoV ARD.

I have read a news report that San Miguel Corp. (SMC) said it would rebuild and resume “at the soonest possible time” the construction of the Skyway Stage 3 project, which collapsed due to the fire that razed SMC’s plastics warehouse in Pandacan. A promise is good, but it should not satisfy everybody and render them mute to ask more questions. Was the storage facility and its content properly inspected? Was there an updated permit from the city to allow San Miguel to store highly flammable or combustible materials? Are we assured that this destruction will not happen again in other parts of the Skyway project? Who pays for the damages inflicted on the residents in the vicinity? * * * On the 2019 novel coronavirus Senate inquiry:
I commend the Senate in convening this much-needed scrutiny of the very important situation that we are now facing. The whole Cabinet was present to share their views and expound on the measures being taken to address the issue. The senators were there (not to blame or criticize) but to air the concerns of their constituencies and exhaust all remedies that may be needed to speed up all actions as the laws provide and allow. Arguments and differences were seen but it was a shining moment to portray that we have a fully functioning government serving our people. * * * Movie scenes that I am tired of seeing:
During gun stand-offs: villain with hostage at gunpoint where the lead actor will succumb to the demand to drop his weapon. Then a shot will be made from somewhere, killing the villain. After watching their story on TV news, one character has to grasp the remote control and turn it off. The police patrol cars with wailing sirens usually arrive seconds after the lead actor had subdued all the villains and the area completely safe. In defusing bombs and other explosives, the bomb’s clock will always stop at one second before detonation; 6,5,4,3,2,1; and just in time, the bomb is defused. While main actor will always knock down several opponents with one power punch during earlier scenes, it will take forever to knock down the main villain. Lead actor always survives after a car collision that sent his car flying and rolling over in the air several times, bomb explosions, falling from cliffs, broken limbs, bullet wounds, even with blood running from nostrils, mouth and ears. Actors and actresses will remove or wear their eyeglasses to project intensity or attention. Ho-hum. Elevator doors always close on time to evade pursuit with pursuer pounding on the door after closing. The lead actors usually take 5 minutes to die after engaging in a litany of words amid labored breathing. There is always a ready bottle of liquor, glasses for two and filled ice bucket whenever drinks are offered to a guest. No one finishes a meal, whether at restaurants or at home. One has to stand up and leave. Cars seem to have the same survival strength as the lead actor. Crashed, warped, dented, with engine smoking, tires burning, broken windshield, but you can still drive them on stairs, jump over cars and bridges, navigate in tight corners and come out alive. Bad guys with guns will always miss their shots at eagle-eyed lead characters, which can duck with precision in most situations. Action heroes will always have a stupid superior who will disagree with him throughout the movie. * * * Integrity is not only about money. It is a compilation of kindness, loyalty to righteousness, courage to embrace defeat and the willingness to correct mistakes. * * * Most times, it’s not the bullet that hurts. It’s finding out it was not the enemy who pulled the trigger. * * * Traffic ideas from a citizen:
– Why can’t malls refrain from simultaneous mega sales during the same weekend? – Suggest tourist-type shuttle buses for exclusive universities to eliminate one-car-per-student drop and pick-up schemes that have been clogging Taft, Ortigas and Katipunan. Designated points can be pinpointed for Makati, Ortigas, Quezon City and Caloocan. – Consider separate working hours for private and public offices to lighten up rush hour. A two-hour difference can make a noticeable impact. – All cities and municipalities should try the “one-way” solution on every other minor artery in Cubao, Ortigas, Marikina, Manila and Mandaluyong. – Lease vacant parking lots as common garage for car owners parking their cars on the streets. Impose a monthly fee for shade and security. – Rent vacant lots for Tricycle Operators and Drivers’ Associations or TODAs for tricycles/pedicab as wells. Barangay (Villages) can handle this. This can work for public utility jeepneys or PUJs and buses as well. – Satellite offices of national agencies should start at the provincial level — Departments of Foreign Affairs, Agrarian Reform, Agriculture, Environment and Natural Resources, Health and Transportation and Communication, and Philippine Charity Sweepstakes, among others. This will decongest government transactions in the National Capital Region. – A one-minute drop-off and pickup limit for all public transport on designated stops. – Simultaneous green light and left turn signals should be tried in additional areas to eliminate U-turn slots. – No pickups and drop-offs in all train stations. At least locate them 200 meters away before or after each station. * * * Good work, good deeds and good faith to all. "
,"February 6, 2020",nCov,‘Do not eat bats’,John Eric Mendoza,"A renowned doctor-biologist warned Filipinos not to eat any kind of bats, following studies that found another strain of coronavirus among the local bat species. Edsel Salvana, director of the Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, said betacoronavirus was found in a bat in Davao after a study conducted by the University of the Philippines in Mindanao. Edsel Salvana PHOTO BY RENE H. DILAN The strain of coronavirus was found on a long-tongued nectar bat during their three-year study. “The coronavirus they’ve found is not unusual, but of course, any kind of coronavirus can have the potential to jump [to humans],” Salvana told The Manila Times. The coronaviruses are a large family of viruses usually found on bats and other wild animals, which may cause illnesses ranging from the common cold and fever to severe diseases. “Ang bats talaga maraming coronaviruses mga ‘yan, and for some reason, ‘yung bats, ang lakas ng immunity nila kaya nagiging carrier sila (Bats carry coronaviruses, and for some reason they have strong immune systems that is why they are carriers),” Salvana said. He added that it is likely the coronavirus gets transmitted to humans with prolonged contact with wild animals such as bats, rather than by eating its meat. For that matter, Salvana advised the public to also refrain from eating bats because they can carry rabies. Bats are a delicacy in some parts of the country. “Mas nakakatakot pa ang rabies kaysa sa coronavirus, kaya ‘wag kayong kumain ng bats, baka magkasakit pa kayo (Rabies is more frightening than the coronavirus, that is why you should not eat bats or you may get sick),” the doctor said.

Health Undersecretary Orlando Domingo told a press briefing in Manila that a 60-year-old Chinese female tested positive for the nCoV-ARD but she “was getting better, and a week later she was discharged”. The woman then returned to China on January 31 after she tested negative at the Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory in Australia and Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) in the Philippines. However, on February 3, RITM notified DoH that the sample taken earlier of the patient tested positive. “We were still sending results to Australia, so they weren’t getting the more clinically relevant sample. So in this case, they (RITM) tested a later sample of the patient,” said Domingo. The elderly woman arrived in Cebu City from Wuhan, China via Hong Kong last January 20, then went to Bohol thereafter, making her the first confirmed case for Central Visayas. Wuhan is the center of the nCoV outbreak. Two days later, the Chinese tourist consulted a private hospital in Bohol after experiencing fever and inflammation of the mucus membrane in the nose known as coryza. The DoH reported that there was now a total of 133 persons under investigation (PUI) for the respiratory disease as of 12 noon on Wednesday. Of the 133 PUIs, 115 are currently admitted and isolated, while 16 have been discharged under strict monitoring. The health department confirmed that out of 133 PUIs, 63 were Filipinos, 54 Chinese, and 16 other foreigners of unidentified nationalities. Furthermore, the Epidemiology Bureau (EB) of the DoH said it was now in contact with 203 persons who had been in close proximity with the suspected carriers. The EB reported that 15 were now exhibiting symptoms of the disease, with 14 under strict monitoring and isolation.

READ: ‘Find the passengers’ CIDG Director Joel Napoleon Coronel, in a press briefing on Wednesday, said more than 50 of the 331 passengers who were on three flights with the two Chinese have been accounted for and contacted. Coronel said the police would assist the Department of Health (DoH) in contacting the remaining 270 passengers within 48 hours with the help of local police and Civil Aviation Board (CAB). Coronel said the two victims from nCoV-hit Wuhan, China took three flights from January 21 to 25. The two, Coronel said, took the first flight from Hong Kong to Cebu on January 21 through Flight 5J 241. They were on board Flight DG 6519 from Cebu to Dumaguete. On January 25, the two took Flight PR 2542 from Dumaguete to Manila. “We contact them, inform them they were on board of the flight and then, determine their physical and medical condition,” Coronel told the reporters. The list of passengers from the airline companies was given by the DoH, Coronel said. Included in the passengers’ information were their email addresses, cellphone numbers, and residence, Coronel said. Coronel said the authorities would go to the addresses indicated by the passengers and inform them that they were on the same flight with the two nCoV victims. “The first priority as of this time are those manifesting symptoms and we hope they will come in and subject themselves to medical examination and treatment if kailangan [if needed],” Coronel said. DoH Epidemiology Bureau officer-in-charge Ferchito Avelino said that the authorities would ask about the passengers’ condition over 14 days, if they have had symptoms of the nCoV and the people they’ve come in contact with. “We will do our best to locate and contact them individually,” Coronel said. However, Coronel said, if the contacted passengers showing symptoms refused to cooperate, police would notify the DoH and the local government units (LGUs). “To probably isolate him and as mentioned to quarantine them if needed,” Coronel said. Coronel also said that if the passengers knew they and the two Chinese were on board the same plane, they were advised to impose a self-quarantine. “If needed pinapakiusapan natin, they can impose self-quarantine.

,"February 5, 2020",nCov,"China deaths rise to 490, Japan confirms 10 cases on ship",THE MANILA TIMES," BEIJING: Deaths from a new virus rose to 490 in mainland China on Wednesday while new cases on a Japanese cruise ship, in Hong Kong and in Thailand showed the increasing spread of the outbreak and renewed attention toward containing it. Ten people from the cruise ship tested positive and were taken to hospitals, while all 3,700 crew and passengers on the ship will be quarantined on board for up to 14 days, Health Minister Nobukatsu Kato said. More tests are pending. In Hong Kong, hospitals workers are striking to demand the border with mainland China be shut completely to ward off the virus, but four new cases without known travel to the mainland indicate the illness is spreading locally in the territory. The growing caseload “indicates significant risk of community transmission” and could portend a “large-scale” outbreak, said Chuang Shuk-kwan, head of the communicable disease branch at the Center for Health Protection.  Hospitals in Hong Kong said they had to cut some services due to striking workers’ absences. More than 7,000 joined the strike Tuesday, according to the Hospital Authority Employees’ Alliance, the strike organizer. The territory’s beleaguered leader, Carrie Lam, criticized the strike and said the government was doing all it could to limit the flow of people across the border. Almost all land and sea links have been closed, but the striking workers want it shut completely. “Important services, critical operations have been affected,” Lam told reporters. “So I’m appealing to those who are taking part in this action: Let’s put the interests of the patients and the entire public health system above all other things.”  With the epicenter of the outbreak, Wuhan, cut off by rail, air and road to try to contain the virus, the US and other countries were organizing more evacuation flights for their citizens still in the central Chinese city. The latest mainland China figures showed an increase of 65 deaths from the previous day, all the new deaths from Wuhan. The number of new cases increased to 24,324, a rise of 3,887 from the previous day. Outside mainland China, at least 180 cases have been confirmed, including two fatalities, one in Hong Kong and another in the Philippines. To treat the thousands of patients, China rushed to build hospitals and converted a gymnasium, exhibition hall and cultural center in Wuhan.  Patients were being moved into a new, 1,000-bed hospital with prefabricated wards and isolation rooms. A 1,500-bed hospital also specially built opens in days. The hospitals made from converted public spaces to treat patients with mild symptoms have a total of 3,400 beds, the simple cots placed in tight rows in cavernous rooms without any barriers between them. One man, Fang Bin, said he saw wards so crowded during a visit to the city’s No. 5 Hospital on Saturday that some patients were forced to sit on the ground.

(Chinatopix via AP) “There are too many patients, it’s overcrowded,” Fang told The Associated Press. He said he was taken from his home and questioned by police after he posted a video of what he saw online. The 10 cases confirmed on the Japanese cruise ship raised that country’s total to 33 cases. They were among 273 people tested because they had a cough or fever, which are symptoms of the virus, or had close contact with a man who got off the ship in Hong Kong and was infected.  Some tests are still pending. The transmission to each person isn’t clear, and the others may have gotten the virus when they got off the ship at other port calls in Vietnam, Taiwan, Kagoshima and Okinawa. The ship returned to Yokohama, near Tokyo, Monday. Thailand confirmed six more cases Tuesday, raising its total to 25. Two are motorcycle taxi drivers who had driven for Chinese tourists. Earlier a Thai taxi driver was also diagnosed with the virus. The cases are concerning because they suggest the virus can spread more easily between people than has been suspected.

Japan said Wednesday 10 people on the cruise ship have tested positive for the new virus and were being taken to hospitals. (Hiroko Harima/Kyodo News via AP) Dr. David Heymann, who led the World Health Organization’s response to the SARS outbreak, said it’s too early to tell when the new coronavirus will peak, but that it appears to still be on the increase. He said the spike in China’s recent caseload is partly because the tally was expanded to milder cases, not only people with pneumonia. It is not yet considered a pandemic, or worldwide outbreak, which WHO defines as sustained transmission in at least two world regions.  Heymann said as the new virus starts to spread beyond China, scientists will gain a better understanding of it. “What we will see is the clearer natural history of the disease,” he said, as those exposed to the virus “are being traced and watched very closely,” he said. Nevertheless, WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus urged countries outside China to share more data on infections, saying detailed information has been provided in only 38% of cases. “Without better data, it’s very hard for us to assess how the outbreak is evolving or what impact it could have and to ensure we’re providing the most appropriate recommendations.” AP "

In a memo signed by Education Secretary Leonor Briones, DepEd said that it also “highly discouraged” activities at the division or district level which would involve the gathering of participants from various schools. Organizers are advised to seek
the recommendation of local health authorities should the activities push throught, it added. Among activities postponed are the upcoming National School’s Press Conference (NSPC) and National Festival of Talents (NFOT) which will be held in Tuguegarao City, Cagayan and Ilagan Isabela respectively. The student journalism and talent competitions were originally scheduled on February 17-21. Also postponed were the National Science and Technology Fair (NSTF) on February 10-14 and the regional athletic meets like Central Visayas Regional Athletic Association, which were supposed to be held in Dumaguete City, Negros Oriental. However, DepEd clarified that the postponement did not cover the Palarong Pambansa 2020 which is set to kick off in Marikina City in May. DepEd had created a task force to closely coordinate with the Department of Health (DoH) to address challenges in schools after the 2019-nCoV ARD entered the country. The Philippines has two confirmed cases of the 2019-nCoV, with one, a Chinese, from virus-hit Wuhan, dying from the infection. "

Gov. Yevgeny Vincente Emano said the provincial government was acquiring thermal scanners for distribution to various ports of entries in Misamis Oriental. He added that the scanners would be handed out to the airport terminal in Laguindingan and to the Mindanao International Container Terminal (MICT) Tagolo-an. Emano said vessels from the Mediterranean that anchor off Macabalan Bay would not exempted from thermal scanning to make sure that passengers on board do not show symptoms of the 2019-nCoV virus. According to Emano, the port area in Macabalan, Cagayan de Oro City, will also benefit from the thermal scanners because the area is the entry port of passengers in Misamis Oriental. The government-owned Northern Mindanao Medical Center (NMMC) at the provincial capitol compound has also activated an “emergency assistance desk” to check patients who enter the hospital premises. Dr. Jose Chan, the NMMC medical director, said health personnel man the desk 24/7 to conduct medical check-ups on patients who are suspected of having contracted the coronavirus and other illnesses. “There is nothing to panic about the 2019-nCoV since the number of Chinese patients under investigation (PUI) at the NMMC [remained at two],” according to Chan. He said that the two Chinese were admitted last week after showing symptoms of the coronavirus. Chan added that the hospital is yet to receive results of the tests on the two PUI. In Cagayan de Oro City, the LGU officials have activated the Barangay Emergency Response Health Team (BERHT) as part of the protocol to gather information about the possible entry of 2019-nCoV into the villages. City Councilor Maria Lourdes Gaane, chairman of the City Council Committee on Health and Insurance, said members of the Berth and barangay (village) health workers conduct regular checks on residents arriving from abroad. Gaane, herself a doctor, added that the Berth report is based on two criteria: “symptomatic or displaying no symptoms, which means that the person has no fever and no other signs and symptoms suggesting illness.” The first reported 2019-nCoV death in the country was that of a 38-year-old male patient who came to the Philippines last January 21, from Wu Han, China, the source of the nCoV.
It was the first death outside China. "

Banzon added that both are foreigners, one a Chinesel and the other a Briton. He said the Chinese was confined at the Bataan General Hospital in Balanga City and the Briton at the Jose Lingad Memorial Hospital in San Fernando, Pampanga. Banzon added that the city was prepared for any eventuality should there be confirmed cases of nCoV. He said they were undertaking a massive information drive to erase wrong information gathered from the social media that the city hall started during flag-raising last Monday. Even in all public schools, the same information campaign has begun, according to Banzon.

,"February 5, 2020",nCov,"China virus to make PH tourism, exports suffer","Mayvelin U. Caraballo, TMT","THE 2019 novel coronavirus acute respiratory disease (2019-nCoV ARD) that broke out in China and has spread overseas would likely drag growth in the Philippines’ tourism and export sectors this year, Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez 3rd said on Tuesday. Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez 3rd Dominguez’s view was shared by a number of analysts, who estimated that the virus’ impact on the local economy would reach between $300 million and $600 million. “A significant impact on the economy [would] most likely be centered on the tourism sector,” Dominguez told a Senate hearing on Tuesday. According to him, travel restrictions imposed by the government to protect Filipinos’ health would likely decrease the sector’s direct gross value added. Latest data from the Department of Tourism (DoT) showed that the number of foreign tourists in the country reached 7.48 million in the first 11 months of 2019, up 15.58 percent from the year-ago figure. Tourists from mainland China were the second-highest in the period, with 1.62 million. Although Dominguez emphasized that it was still too early to determine the economic impact of these restrictions, he said the DoT had committed to continue looking for opportunities in partnership with industry stakeholders. “The agency will intensify the promotion of domestic destinations for local travelers who have decided to postpone or forego international travel for the time being,” he added. The Finance chief also said the lockdown imposed by Beijing on the city of Wuhan — considered a hub of transport and industry in central China, and where the virus originated — could create some supply-chain problems that would affect trade elsewhere. Since China is the Philippines’ top trading partner, Dominguez said this would have an effect on Manila’s outbound shipments. “In the immediate term, the temporary closures of factories in China and possible disruption in global supply chains may cause a temporary [and] slight decline in our exports, particularly of electronics and auto parts,” he said. More than half of Philippine exports to China last year were of electronic parts, according to Dominguez. With this, the Finance chief said the Department of Trade and Industry had committed to work closely with affected Chinese and China-based companies that would be looking to strengthen their operations by adding a production site outside the East Asian country. ‘When China sneezes’ Security Bank Corp. chief economist Robert Dan Roces said tourism would be the first to be hit by 2019-nCoV since China was the second-largest tourist market after South Korea. “Other vulnerable sectors include airlines, gaming, lodging and leisure,” he added. Roces projected probable losses to Philippine growth could reach $300 million (-0.1 percent) a quarter from tourism and external trade losses alone. For his part, ING Bank Manila senior economist Nicholas Antonio Mapa said the virus’ impact on tourism and trade could hit as high as $600 million. “In this case, when China sneezes, the Philippines catches a cold and picks up a cough given recent developments in economic ties,” he added.

In a disclosure on Tuesday, the listed fast food giant said branches of the noodle restaurant “will remain closed as part of the government’s effort to contain the virus.” These stores make up less than 1 percent of the company’s total global branch network and only 3.6 percent of that in the East Asian country. Jollibee owns 389 stores in China, or nearly 7 percent of the 5,973 in total. The stores there account for the 7.4 percent of the the company’s global system-wide sales. The Caktiong-led fast food chain said it had implemented safety measures in its Chinese operations, such as allowing employees to work from home and providing them health guidelines and protective masks. “While it is too early to determine the total impact of the [2019-nCoV] on its business in China, [Jollibee] remains very committed to keep building and growing a profitable business” there, it said. Jollibee was looking to open more stores in China, most of which are Yonghe King. This is part of the food giant’s goal of having 1,000 store in the country. Jollibee saw its net income in the first nine months of 2019 drop by 25.5 percent to P4.53 billion from the year-earlier P6.09 billion because of losses from Smashburger and Red Ribbon.

,"February 5, 2020",nCov,"US factory output up, ends 5-mo slide",Associated Press,"WASHINGTON, D.C.: US manufacturing picked up in January for the first time since July, beating analyst predictions of further contraction, thanks to growth in key sectors, an industry survey released on Monday (Tuesday in Manila) showed. Manufacturing had been on a five-month decline in the United States, fueled by concerns over global growth and the trade war between Washington and China, according to monthly statistics released by the Institute for Supply Management (ISM). Analysts had expected the index to continue its contraction in January, but the ISM reported the monthly manufacturing index instead rose to 50.9 percent, with growth in food, beverage and tobacco products, followed by computers and electronic products propelling the increase. Any reading below 50 percent indicates manufacturing activity is slowing. “Global trade remains a cross-industry issue, but many respondents were positive for the first time in several months,” said Timothy Fiore, chairman of the ISM’s manufacturing survey. In total, eight of the 18 industries surveyed by the ISM showed growth, while employment and the price index both showed a slight increase of around one-and-a-half percentage points. The report marked a reversal from December, which saw the index plunge nearly six points, and new orders drop again — both falling to their lowest points since April 2009. In January, the US resolved both of its major trade disputes, reaching an initial trade agreement with China that set the stage for an easing of tariffs on US industries. Washington also inked a new deal with Mexico and Canada, ending long-running negotiations and removing another uncertainty for companies. But analysts were mixed over whether the positive report was a blip or a true upswing. Rubeela Farooqi, chief US economist for High Frequency Economics, said the report was “likely in response to an easing of trade tensions.” “We expect the upcoming non-manufacturing ISM index to remain comfortably over 50,” she added. But Ian Shepherdson of Pantheon Macroeconomics warned that the spread of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) — which has spurred border and industry closures — could torpedo growth in February. “We have to expect a setback next month as demand from China drops and supply chains are interrupted,” he wrote in a note.

Ismael,"Bong Go blasts DoH for failure to trace hundreds exposed to nCoV LAWMAKERS on Tuesday castigated Health officials for their failure to track down hundreds of passengers who shared a ride with the two Chinese who were infected with the 2019 novel coronavirus acute respiratory disease (2019-nCoV ARD). GRILL TIME Sen. Christopher Lawrence ‘Bong’ Go raises a question during the Senate hearing where government officials, including Health Secretary Francisco Duque 3rd, (seated beside Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr.), were questioned on the handling of the spread of the new coronavirus. PHOTOS BY RENE H. DILAN One of the patients died at the San Lazaro Hospital on Saturday, the first fatality outside China. Sen. Christopher Lawrence “Bong” Go, who presided over the Senate hearing on the nCoV spread, urged the Department of Health (DoH) to hasten the tracking of more than 300 passengers who might have been exposed to the deadly virus. Go, chairman of the Senate Committee on Health, said the DoH could tap policemen and immigration personnel in tracing the whereabouts of the airline passengers. The Chinese couple arrived in the Philippines on January 21 from Hong Kong and visited the cities of Cebu and Dumaguete before flying to Manila. The man died on February 1. “Dapat hanapin talaga nila. Dapat nila panagutan ‘yan. Dapat nilang i-account. Sabi naman ng taga-PAL (Philippine Airlines) sa akin kanina, binigay raw nila ang mga pangalan (They should find them. That’s their responsibility. PAL executives told me that they submitted the names of the passengers),” Go told reporters. Some senators castigated Health Secretary Francisco Duque 3rd for the failure of his department to track down the passengers. Duque, who was grilled during the Senate hearing, admitted that only 17 percent or 57 of the 331 passengers had been tracked down. Duque said it was difficult to track down the passengers because airlines only shared with government officials the names of those who were on the same plane as the Chinese couple. Go however told the DoH to coordinate with other government agencies. “Gamitin niyo ang mga pulis. Gamitin natin ang immigration officials. Kaya ‘yan. If there’s a will, there’s a way. May paraan talaga. Gawin niyo na may dedikasyon ang inyong trabaho (Tap the police and immigration officials. That can be done. Find a way. Show more dedication),” he said. “Dapat ayusin ninyo ‘yung sistema ninyo, coordination, kaya nga meron kayong Inter-Agency Task Force para pag-usapan at gumawa kayo ng solusyon sa bawat problemang darating sa atin (Improve your system, your coordination. That’s the reason why you have an interagency task force, so that you can discuss measures and solutions to problems),” he fumed. Sen. Francis Pangilinan also took Duque to task for the failure of his department to track down the passengers. Transportation Secretary Arthur Tugade admitted that there was a glaring failure among government agencies to communicate in contacting the passengers seated near the Chinese passengers. Tugade said it was up to the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) and Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines to submit the list of their passengers because they have power over airlines. “What is the protocol? It is a sad situation. There is failure to coordinate,’’ Tugade said. Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr., who attended the hearing, agreed that the tracking down of the passengers was the job of the CAB and the Bureau of Immigration. Ed Monreal, general manager of the Manila International Airport Authority, however, told the senators that the airlines would not withhold the names of passengers based on protocols. Privacy Commissioner Raymund Enriquez Liboro said that while data privacy is a right, it is not absolute. “If a government agency pursuant to its constitutional or statutory mandate, requests airlines to release passenger manifest, the same is allowed under the Data Privacy Act of 2012,” he said in a statement. “In responding to a critical public health issue like nCov, the DoH has the mandate, purpose and the necessity to collect and process personal data to uphold the public welfare. Therefore, nothing should prevent airline companies from releasing relevant passenger data to competent and mandated authorities like the Department of Health,” he added. Alarming Dr. Rabindra Abeyasinghe, World Health Organization (WHO) representative in the Philippines, said countries with confirmed cases of nCoV need to improve their preparedness to respond to the disease. Go admitted that the situation was alarming. “Oo, alarming, high-risk nga ang ating status. Ngayon dapat i-contain talaga natin. Tama ‘yung meron tayong travel ban sa ngayon, at kung kailangan pong dagdagan, maaaring irekomenda po ito ng Inter-Agency Task Force sa ating Pangulo (Yes, it’s alarming, our status is high-risk. We have to contain it. It is right that we imposed a travel ban, and if the inter-agency task force recommends that it be widened, we will recommend this to the President),” he said. The senator appealed to the public to cooperate with the government. “Huwag na po tayong mag-panic. Huwag tayong magkalat ng mga fake news. Tulungan po natin ang ating mga kababayan. Huwag nating dagdagan ang problema natin (Let us not panic. Let us not spread fake news. Let us help each other),” he said, adding that those who spread fake news should be quarantined. Go gave assurances that the government remains on top of the situation and is committed to assist Filipinos and the rest of the world in laying down measures to mitigate the impact of the virus on the worldwide community. “Since day 1, the whole Duterte administration has said that it has been on top of the situation and is doing everything it can to address the issue. The President, and even a key official from the World Health Organization, have commended the efforts of this government in responding to this worldwide health concern,” he said. Duque said that of the 80 patients under investigation, 67 have been admitted in hospitals and isolated. He said the new coronavirus “can survive and stay for as long as ten hours on inanimate objects like keyboards, tables.” President Rodrigo Duterte has approved the budget needed for the procurement of protective equipment for around 5,000 health workers. Death toll up The death toll in mainland China from the new type of virus has risen to 425, with the total number of cases now standing at 20,438, officials said on Tuesday. The new figures come after the country opened a new hospital built in 10 days, infused cash into tumbling financial markets, and further restricted people’s movement in hopes of containing the rapidly spreading virus and its escalating impact. Japanese officials were deciding whether to quarantine more than 3,000 people on a cruise ship that carried a passenger who tested positive for the virus. The latest figures are up from 361 deaths and 17,205 confirmed cases. Other countries are continuing evacuations and restricting the entry of Chinese or people who have recently traveled in the country. In the province at the epicenter of the outbreak, Hubei, a specialized 1,000-bed hospital started treating patients and a second hospital with 1,500 beds is to open within days. Other countries continued evacuating citizens from hardest-hit Hubei province and restricted the entry of Chinese or people who recently traveled to the country. WHO said the number of cases would keep growing because tests are pending on thousands of suspected cases. Chinese President Xi Jinping, presiding over a special meeting of the country’s top Communist Party body for the second time since the crisis started, said “[W]e have launched a people’s war of prevention of the epidemic.” He told the Politburo standing committee that the country must race against time to curb the spread of the virus and that those who neglect their duties will be punished, state broadcaster CCTV reported. Medical teams from the People’s Liberation Army were arriving in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province, to relieve overwhelmed health workers and to staff the new 1,000-bed hospital, located in the countryside far from the city center. Impact Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez 3rd said the economic costs of the infection on the economy would most likely be centered on the tourism sector. Dominguez also said “it’s too early to estimate the economic impact of the novel coronavirus.” Meanwhile, the Board of Directors of the Philippine Health Insurance Corp. has approved a benefit package for member-patients under investigation or PUIs for possible 2019-nCoV infection who are admitted in healthcare facilities.

,"February 5, 2020",nCov,Clock ticking for firms that depend on Chinese imports,Agence France-Presse,"WASHINGTON, D.C.: For companies bracing for losses from China’s 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, the damage has so far been delayed, thanks to good timing: The outbreak struck when Chinese factories and many businesses were closed to let workers travel home for the week-long Lunar New Year holiday. But the respite won’t last. If much of industrial China remains on lockdown for the next few weeks — a very real possibility — Western retailers, automobile companies and manufacturers that depend on Chinese imports will start to run out of the goods they depend on. In order to meet deadlines for summer goods, retail experts say Chinese factories would need to start ramping up production by March 15. If these factories were to remain idle through May 1, it would likely cripple retailers’ crucial back-to-school and fall seasons. “There’s complete uncertainty,’’ said Steve Pasierb, chief executive officer (CEO) of the Toy Industry Association. “This could be huge if it goes on for months.’’ Wuhan, the Chinese city where the outbreak originated, is a center of automotive production. It’s been closed off, along with neighboring cities, isolating more than 50 million people and bringing factories to a standstill. So far, US automakers haven’t had to curb production for want of Chinese parts. But David Closs, professor emeritus at Michigan State University’s Department of Supply Chain Management, said the clock was ticking. “I would say it’s weeks at the most,’’ Closs said. “One to two to three weeks.’’ The partial shutdown of Wuhan has harmed the production of television display panels and raised prices, according to a report by research group IHS Markit. The city has five factories making liquid crystal displays (LCDs) and organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), both of which are used for TV and laptop monitors. China accounts for more than half of the global production of these panels. David Hsieh, an analyst at IHS Markit, said in a report “these factories are facing shortages of both labor and key components as a result of mandates designed to limit the contagion’s spread,” leading suppliers to raise panel prices more aggressively. Phone-maker Motorola, which has a facility in Wuhan, said that so far, it expected little impact, because it had a flexible global supply chain and multiple factories around the world. Its priority has been the welfare of local employees, Motorola, owned by the Chinese electronics giant Lenovo, said in a statement. Apple CEO Tim Cook told analysts last week that the company’s contractors in China had been forced to delay reopening factories that closed for the Lunar New Year. He said the company had sought ways to minimize supply disruptions. Most of his company’s iPhones and other devices are made in China. In the meantime, economists are sharply downgrading the outlook for China’s economy, the world’s second-biggest. Tommy Wu and Louis Kuijs of Oxford Economics have slashed their forecast for Chinese economic growth this year from 6 percent to 5.4 percent. They expect most of the damage to be inflicted in the first three months of 2020. “But a more serious and long-lasting impact cannot be ruled out,’’ they wrote on Monday.
Forecasters are contending with unknowns. No one knows how long the outbreak will last, how much damage it will cause or how policymakers will respond to the threat. Some look back to the outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome that paralyzed the Chinese economy for the first few months of 2003. But the damage from that disease faded quickly: China was booming again by year’s end, and the world economy emerged mostly unscathed. But times have changed in ways that are not favorable to containing the economic damage. Back then, China was the world’s workshop for cheap goods — toys and sneakers, for instance. Now, China has moved up to sophisticated machine parts and electronics like LCDs. And it accounts for about 16 percent of global economic output, up significantly from just 4 percent in 2003. "

Over a hundred stranded Chinese passengers at the NAIA terminal 1 on Monday evening wait for an 8 p.m. China Southern Airlines flight to Guangzhou. Photo by BENJAMIN L. VERGARA From a high of 7,700 points at the start of the year, PSEi plunged to 7,200 points. “2020 is definitely starting for the PSEi in a terrible way,” Axiory Global Ltd. Director of Research and Education Tomasz Wisniewski said, noting that the new coronavirus had sidelined investors. “Index lost around 500 points, which is a lot, if we consider that it happened in only two weeks,” he added. The local bourse was promising at the start of the year with analysts setting optimistic outlooks. With 2019 ending with nearly a 5-percent uptick, the main index was projected to go as the high as 9,000 level this year on the back of strong economic fundamentals — inflation was finally subsiding, which can support corporate earnings growth. But the nCoV-ARV outbreak dampened investor sentiment for the local stock exchange and its regional peers. Wisniewski said the main index had now entered bearish territory, with investors monitoring if it would slip further to 6,800 level. The virus had also scared off foreign investors from putting their money in the local stock exchange, Philstocks Financial Inc. analyst Piper Chaucer Tan said. “Net foreign position validates this since for the month of January we recorded net foreign selling position of P8 billion as investors are selling off Philippine shares,” he added. “The virus scare is not just within the corners of China, but it spreads globally, affecting financial markets and Philippine market is no exemption,” he said. Transport, tourism take hit Airlines have also become victims of the virus, with some canceling flights to and from China. “Naturally, when we are talking about the global health concern, companies that take the
biggest hit are usually from the transport sector,” the Axiory analyst said. He added that shares of Cebu Pacific operator Cebu Air Inc. and maintenance repair and overhaul firm MacroAsia Corp. have been heavily sold off. “Look for example at Cebu Air, which, despite a steady growth in 2019, now is suffering a hard time. The same goes for MacroAsia, which was doing well since 2017, just to drop like a rock in the past two weeks,” he said. Cebu Air and MacroAsia have recorded a decline in their shares of 15 percent and 40.11 percent, respectively. Philstocks’ Tan said local tourism — hotel, leisure and casino — would also be affected from flight cancellations, especially because China had the second largest share in tourism arrival last year. “We cannot quantify with absolute certainty as to figures of these damages but we know that this will have effect to our tourism sector,” he added.

,"February 5, 2020",nCov,China admits slow action on virus spread,Agence France-Presse,"BEIJING: China’s top leadership body admitted “shortcomings and difficulties” in its response to a coronavirus outbreak that has killed more than 360 and infected more than 17,000, state media reported. The comments came after China reported 57 new deaths as of Monday — the single-biggest daily increase since the virus was detected late last year in the central city of Wuhan, where it is believed to have jumped from animals at a market to humans. The elite Politburo Standing Committee called for improvements to the “national emergency management system” following “shortcoming and difficulties exposed in the response to the epidemic,” according to Xinhua news agency. “It is necessary to strengthen market supervision, resolutely ban and severely crack down on illegal wildlife markets and trade,” it added. Officials in Wuhan have been criticized for withholding information about the outbreak until the end of last year, despite knowing about the new illness weeks earlier. China’s death toll from the coronavirus has now surpassed that of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) crisis nearly two decades ago, with the government on Monday saying it “urgently” needed medical equipment and surgical masks to tackle the outbreak. The virus has since spread to more than 24 countries despite many governments imposing unprecedented travel bans on arrivals coming from China. At the Politburo meeting, President Xi Jinping said controling the outbreak would have a “direct bearing on the stability of the overall economic and social situation, as well as China’s opening up,” Xinhua said. Authorities in provinces that are home to more than 300 million people — including Guangdong, the country’s most populous — have ordered everyone to wear masks in public in an effort to contain the virus. But factories capable of producing around 20 million masks a day are only operating at 60 to 70 percent of capacity, Industry Department spokesman Tian Yulong said, adding that supply and demand remained in “tight equilibrium” as a result of the Lunar New Year break. Tian said authorities were taking steps to bring in masks from Europe, Japan and the US, while the Foreign Ministry said countries, including South Korea, Japan, Kazakhstan and Hungary had donated medical supplies. All but one of the 57 new deaths reported Monday were in Wuhan and the rest of Hubei province, most of which has been under lockdown for almost two weeks. The national death toll reached 361, exceeding the 349 mainland fatalities from the SARS outbreak of 2002-03. SARS killed a total of 774 people, with most other deaths in Hong Kong. With 17,200 confirmed infections, the mortality rate for the new coronavirus is around 2.1 percent, compared with 9.6 percent for SARS. The virus is taking an increasing economic toll, shutting down businesses, curbing international travel and impacting production lines of major global brands. The Shanghai stock market plunged almost eight percent Monday on the first day of trading since the holiday as investors played catch-up with last week’s global retreat. In Wuhan, which has been transformed from a bustling industrial hub into a near-ghost town, residents have been living in deep fear of catching the virus. The city’s medical facilities have been overwhelmed, with Xinhua reporting that 68 medical teams of 8,300 staff had been sent to Hubei. AFP "

PHOTO FROM NORTHPORT The Philippine Ports Authority (PPA) has adopted stringent prevention measures against the deadly 2019 novel coronavirus acute respiratory disease (2019-nCoV ARD) in all its ports nationwide after the Department of Health (DoH) confirmed two (2019 nCoV ARD) cases. PPA General Manager Jay Daniel R. Santiago said that with the recent confirmation of 2019 nCoV ARD cases from the DoH, they immediately deployed the ports’ safety, health and security personnel to immediately craft additional prevention measures on top of the general advisories from the DoH. “We are also in close coordination with Customs, Immigration and Quarantine, as well as security vessel boarding teams, in order that essential information that may need swift action could be provided to ground personnel,” Santiago added. Santiago has directed all port managers to double the measures from general thermal scanning to individual checks if a passenger reaches a certain body temperature level. The PPA said the ports with high concentration of passengers and tourists include North Harbor in Manila, Batangas, Mindoro, Bohol, Davao, Palawan, Zamboanga and Bicol. “Early detection plays a significant role in the prevention of the entry of the virus via our ports, that is why we are asking the DOH to augment the existing number of scanning machines as well as digital thermometers in our ports and at the same time deploy additional health and quarantine personnel to secure our ports,” Santiago said. He added that they have put in place their 2019 nCoV ARD Malasakit HelpDesk to facilitate the processing of reports should there be 2019 nCoV ARD victims. Face masks and sanitizers were distributed to frontline employees. Digital and traditional visual advisories on prevention of spreading the coronavirus were posted in conspicuous places inside and outside the ports. “The measures being adopted by the PPA is in line with the earlier pronouncements of the Department of Transportation to reduce the risk of virus contamination via the ports,” the PPA said. “The travel ban issued by Malacañang on Friday was also a welcome development in guarding the ports,” Santiago added.

Jaime FlorCruz shares his views during a visit to The Manila Times. PHOTO BY ENRIQUE AGCAOILI “I really feel bad for China. But I think the epidemic shows the good and the bad of the Chinese system,” he said during a roundtable discussion with editors and reporters of The Manila Times. “The bad thing is because it is authoritarian, sometimes the decision making, especially in reporting about it, was delayed. But the good thing [is] because when they decide to do things, it’s swift. They could do it quickly, just as they had just finished in eight days I think these new hospitals with 1,000 beds. Another one is coming up later this week,” he added. “So, China I think has the ability to do what many countries can’t do like locking down the whole cities, [with] 40 million or 50 million [population],” FlorCruz said. Hubei province has a population of 40 million, of which about 11 million are in Wuhan, its capital. There are about 300 Filipinos in Hubei, 150 of whom live or work in Wuhan. “So, only China can do something as drastic, as draconian as that. It’s tough for the people, but perhaps that’s the only way to cut the transition of the disease,” FlorCruz said. He noted that the media plays an important role in informing the public, but it should refrain from causing unnecessary fear or overdramatizing the epidemic. “The role of the media should be to dig deep into why it happened, what should people do but, at the same time, make sure that the context is clear,” he said. “We should help distinguish myths. I think that’s the role of the media now, to inform, forewarn, but inform in a realistic way and not in an alarmist way.”
FlorCruz also warned against Sinophobia. “We should be careful not to get to the trap of blaming the Chinese as if they wanted to impose this on themselves,” FlorCruz stressed. “We should realize that the impact of this one on Chinese economy and world economy will probably be much more than what SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) imposed,” he said. “If China suffers, the whole world suffers.” “In that sense, we should really wish China well. That they overcome this crisis because whatever happens to China, will affect our lives here and the lives of the rest of the world,” FlorCruz added. With a reports from ZACARIAN GAVIN SARAO "
,"February 5, 2020",nCov,International carriers reeling from effects of nCoV,Genivi Factao,"International carriers were feeling the impact of the deadly 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) as government tightened security measures in all ports nationwide. Patrick Ronas, president of the Association of International Shipping Lines (AISL), said they support the government’s safety precautions to prevent the entry of 2019-nCoV. Patrick Ronas THE MANILA TIMES FILE PHOTO “We fervently pray that measures be taken to try and address the situation with the prevention of the entry of the virus in mind but keeping the wheels of commerce turning,” he said. Ronas said shipping lines together with the terminals and the bureaus of Quarantine, Immigration and Customs can impose preventive measures on how to prevent person to person contact on ships. This is the same thing that other countries were doing now to address the 2019-nCoV situation. “Currently, there is no country imposing a 14 -day quarantine period, and we are the only country to be imposing such. Let us forget what such disruption will cost shipping, but the effect of such a move to the economy will be enormous,” he said. “There will not be a port congestion as shipping lines will skip calling Manila in view of this. Carriers being part of the supply chain will try to find other routes to get the cargo across but the cost of doing so will be substantial,” he added. “There will also be a situation wherein empty containers are being stranded in the country, as most of these containers are returned to China. And so, there will definitely be congestion at the depots because of this,” he added. PPA General Manager Jay Daniel R. Santiago has set the parameters for cargo ships calling in the country’s ports even from those originating from China and its Special Administrative Regions (SARs). Majority of Philippine cargoes originate from hub ports in China and its SARs like Hong Kong and Taiwan, since Philippine ports were predominantly considered as feeder ports. Santiago said ships calling in the Philippines more than 14 days after calling out at a port in China or its SARs would be allowed to dock without restrictions. “We cannot afford to ban the entry of international ships to our shores in the midst of this nCoV ARD scare as doing so will surely paralyze our supply chain as most of our imports and exports go to the hub ports located in China and its SARs,” Santiago said. Ronas agreed not to impose the ban on ships, as this would bring trade disruptions and would have economic impacts. “Not only us but the whole country, if they push through with this (ban on ships), we will be affected economically. There’s no need to ban ships as the number of crew is very little.
They can quarantine crew while at the Port in Manila,” he said. Quoting the World Health Organization (WHO), Ronas said it is safe to receive a letter or package from China. “Yes it is safe. People receiving packages from China are not at risk of contracting the new coronavirus. From previous analysis, we know coronavirus do not survive long on objects such as letters or packages,” according to WHO. PPA only banned the disembarkation of the crew of any vessel which called in China or any of its SARs within the 14-day period prior to its arrival in any Philippine port. Santiago said no visitors were allowed within such period in order to minimize person-to-person interaction with the crew. “We also noted that vessel operators also change crew at some point in the voyage of the vessel, and if such case happens in the Philippines, the crew who will be replaced shall undergo strict quarantine period and only be allowed to go home if cleared by the Department of Health,” Santiago added.

,"February 5, 2020",nCov,Japan ship quarantined on virus fears,Associated Press,"TOKYO: Japanese authorities are racing to contain a possible outbreak of the Wuhan coronavirus after it was revealed that an infected passenger flew into Tokyo and spent a few days aboard a Princess Cruises ship, forcing authorities to lock down the vessel and quarantine thousands of people on board. The ship, the Diamond Princess, ended its planned 14-day itinerary early and is currently docked off the coast of Yokohama, not far from the Japanese capital. Medical officials are going room-by-room to check each guests’ temperature and medical condition, Japan’s Health Ministry said in a statement. PROTECTION People wear face masks as they walk along a street during snowfall in Sapporo, northern Japan. Japan’s Health Ministry reported three new cases on February 3 and could have rise further had it failed to quarantine a ship loaded wit h a passenger suspected to be suffering from coronavirus. AFP PHOTO Several passengers have reported feeling ill, and the tests to check if they contracted the virus will take four to five hours, the ministry said. Passengers and crew will now be required to stay on board until at least Tuesday night. There are 2,666 guests and 1,045 crew members on board, Princess Cruises said in a statement. Japan has previously reported 20 cases of the novel coronavirus, all unrelated to the cruise. Though Japanese officials have moved quickly to respond to this case, it has renewed concern about just how easy it could be for one patient who is unwittingly carrying the virus to pass it on in an increasingly globalized world where millions of people travel at ease. Health authorities say patients can be infectious even if they are not presenting symptoms. The incubation period is believed to be about 14 days. However, researchers are still working to determine whether the Wuhan coronavirus can spread via what’s known as the fecal-oral route, an important factor in determining just how infections the virus is, said Dr. John Nicholls, a clinical professor in pathology at the University of Hong Kong. But Nicholls cautioned against panic because there are just too many unknowns surrounding the Wuhan coronavirus and this case to determine how widely one individual could spread the virus. AP "

At the same time, the PPA has canceled all visitation privileges given to relatives of Filipino seafarers to board, as well as boarding privileges of nongovernment organizations extending moral, emotional and spiritual help to seafarers. Jay Daniel Santiago , General manager of Philippine Ports Authority THE MANILA TIMES FILE PHOTO The PPA made the decision in order to protect Philippine borders from further contamination with the deadly 2019 novel coronavirus acute respiratory disease (2019-nCoV ARD). On Sunday, the Philippines recorded the first 2019-nCoV ARD death outside China. In a statement, PPA General Manager Jay Daniel R. Santiago said that an advisory to mariners and vessels, including all port stakeholders have already been issued and the measure is now implemented. “Not only the passengers coming from Chinese territories should be barred from disembarking. We should also disallow vessel crews, which recently called [on] any China port,” Santiago said. “It is also a practice in the country that relatives of Filipino seafarers are allowed visitation rights as well as several institutions giving moral, spiritual and emotional support to anxious seafarers, these are also temporarily suspended,” Santiago stressed. However, vessels calling at any Philippine port more than 14 days after calling at any China port, shall be allowed without any restrictions, Santiago added. To ensure that this is implemented, a special team shall be deployed to monitor the movements of personnel and people inside the port. The PPA is also coordinating closely with the Office for Transportation Security and the Maritime Industry Authority as well as agents of ships calling on the Philippines to issue parallel directives within their jurisdiction. Last Friday, the PPA adopted stringent prevention measures in PPA-controlled ports, which include, among others, general thermal scanning to individual scanning, which checks if a passenger reaches a certain body temperature level. As early as the first report of an outbreak in China involving the 2019-nCoV ARD, the agency immediately put into place frontline defense against the possible entry of the virus in the country via the ports. The PPA is also in close coordination with Customs, Immigration on Quarantine as well as Security vessel boarding teams so that essential information that may need swift action could be provided to the ground personnel. The agency has likewise started to establish dedicated nCoV Malasakit Help Desks to facilitate the processing of reports for possible victims. Face masks and sanitizers have also
been distributed to frontline employees. “We recognize the dilemma of our seafarers and the difficulty that they face while at sea, but we also have to guarantee the safety of those offshore. Rest assured that everything will be reinstated when this [2019-nCoV] ARD scare is over,” Santiago said. “Right now, we just have to work together to protect one another, and deeper understanding of the situation is expected from all of us,” Santiago stressed.

Depasupil,"MORE than 25,000 Filipino household service workers (HSWs) or domestic helpers may lose their jobs as a result of the travel ban imposed by the government against Hong Kong and Macau as part of Manila’s precautionary measures to contain the spread of the 2019 novel coronavirus acute respiratory disease (2019 nCoV ARD). A total of 10, 000 returning HSWs and 15,000 newly contracted ones, according to recruitment authorities, would likely lose their jobs if the travel ban would not be lifted by the end of this month. Alfredo Palmiery, president of the Society of Hong Kong Accredited Recruiters of the Philippines, said the 15,000 HSWs with new contracts for employers in Hong Kong have only two to three weeks to join their new employers or they would lose their jobs. On the other hand, the estimated 10,000 returning HSWs who are now in the Philippines on vacation for two to three weeks may also end up jobless if they cannot return on time. There are more than 300,000 Filipino workers in Hong Kong and Macau, which are both special Administrative Regions of China. The government is extending assistance to overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) affected by the temporary ban on the travel to China, Hong Kong, Macau and other coronavirus-affected areas, the Department of Labor and Employment announced on Monday. The Bureau of Immigration has strictly implemented the travel ban on directives from Malacañang. But Labor Secretary Silvestre Bello 3rd has assured the affected workers of financial assistance, including accommodation and transportation, to ease their plight. Bello, who is currently in Kuwait, told Acting Labor Secretary Renato Ebarle to order the Overseas Workers Welfare Administration (OWWA) to provide a P10,000-cash assistance for the accommodation and transportation of each stranded OFW. In a memorandum to OWWA, Ebarle said the move would help ease the burden on departing workers, and assist them in their transport back to their hometowns. Those stranded will also be provided with accommodation at the OWWA halfway house while arrangements for their travel to the provinces are being made. Hundreds of OFWs, bound mostly for Hong Kong and Macau, were stranded at the Manila airport on Monday as a result of the travel ban imposed by President Rodrigo Duterte as precautionary measure to prevent the spread of nCoV that originated from the city of Wuhan in Hubei province, China. The move also followed the first reported death from the virus in the Philippines, the first casualty outside Chinese territory. "
,"February 5, 2020",nCov,China’s anti-doping agency halts testing,Agence France-Presse,"LAUSANNE: China’s state anti-doping agency “temporarily” suspended testing on Monday less than six months before the Tokyo Olympics in response to the coronavirus epidemic, the International Testing Agency told AFP. “The situation is one of caution so as not to endanger athletes or test officials and while recognizing the importance of anti-doping activities, the priorities are to maintain public health for all,” said the ITA, the body created in 2018 to carry out drug testing worldwide. The 2020 Olympics start on July 24. The Chinese agency (CHINADA) “will gradually resume testing as soon as the situation improves,” the ITA said, adding that it was examining whether “private providers” could conduct tests. “We are still six months away from the Tokyo games,” an ITA spokeswoman said. “It is indeed likely that this will have an impact on the testing missions in China and solutions will have to be found.” The World Anti-Doping Agency said it was monitoring the problem. He added that it was up to anti-doping organizations such as ITA and CHINADA to ensure that “athletes are still being properly tested, despite the outbreak.” The Chinese authorities reported 57 new deaths from the virus on Monday, taking the tally past 360 since the virus was detected late last year in the central city of Wuhan, where it is believed to have jumped from animals. The virus has infected more than 17,200 people in China, and spread to 24 countries. “This is not the first time that such an outbreak has occurred,” pointed out the WADA spokesman, citing SARS and Zika. CHINADA carries out some 15,000 anti-doping tests a year, according to its website. In 2017 it conducted more than 10,000 tests, the third most by any national agency behind Germany and Britain, according to WADA. China is a sporting power both in competition and as a host. It finished third in gold medals and second in total medals at the 2016 Rio Olympics and has high hopes for the Tokyo Games, but it has had some doping issues. AFP "

,"February 5, 2020",nCov,Retrofitting government,Ingming Aberia,"INGMING ABERIA THE successive occurrences of emergency situations have exposed an old weakness of government: while organizations are in place, fool-proof templates for acting in certain situations are not. Stated another way, it takes emergencies for government to think and act in ways that aim to respond to them. The threat of a full-blown armed conflict between the United States and Iran just a month ago, to cite an example, left the government rushing to put up a makeshift committee to plan for the repatriation of overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) in Iran and Iraq, among other Middle East countries. This kind of mechanism should have been established ages ago, ready for activation whenever the need for it arises, considering that OFWs everywhere, especially in the Middle East, have been exposed to this kind of risk for years. The more recent eruption of Taal Volcano and the 2019 novel coronavirus acute respiratory disease from China, to cite more examples, exposed the government’s lack of an effective warning system and a universally accepted protocol for communicating public advisories. And yet we have laws, foremost of which is the Disaster Risk Reduction Management (DRRM) Act of 2010 that, by this time, should have provided compelling basis for institutionalizing the systems of coordination among agencies tasked with responding to disasters. Obviously, some emergencies are more complex than others. The magnitude of displacement brought about by the Taal eruption brings to mind the urgent need for DRRM and climate change adaptation (CCA) to emphatically inform planning and actual use of resource bases, especially available land areas. Thankfully, government has been trying to address this issue — example: requiring local government units to adopt land use plans that integrate DRRM and CCA perspectives. Calamity-prone areas and danger zones like the areas surrounding the Taal Volcano are no-build zones. But the government should not stop there. The law has no effect if people are fighting for survival. The area in which government appears to require retrofitting is a preferential focus on countryside investments that will stimulate economic hubs in the poorest parts of the country. This needs to be more purposeful than what former president Fidel Ramos tried to do with his Club of 20 vision. The aim is to add value to economic activities in those areas, boost profitability of supply chains for industries and agriculture that would ultimately result in farmers being justly compensated for their labor. Concentration of investments has influenced movement of populations; it should also work to encourage settlements away from danger zones and overcrowded cities. Speaking of cities, the benefit of hindsight shows us what we missed in planning for urban settlements. Design and implementation of public policies derived from loose socioeconomic assumptions have long been eyed as prime suspects; they should have been checked years ago for giving rise to the sprawl of cities without corresponding capacities to cope with traffic congestion, economic inefficiencies, natural and man-made disasters, and criminality. Sound assumptions with adequate grounding and sensitivity to future social, economic and technological changes should have encouraged the design of subways instead of the elevated highways that we have in Metro Manila, at a cost that should be much lesser than what we now pay for. The relatively easier access to livelihood opportunities in cities has reconfigured demographics resulting in, among many observable side effects of progress, Meralco posts, for example, competing for land use with sidewalk vendors. As a student of public administration, I can only hope that the current efforts by government to address our persistent problems by creating more agencies (Department of Water, Department of Disaster Resilience, Department for OFWs and every conceivable form of task forces, including the never-say-die debates on arming the President with emergency traffic management powers) is a product of a comprehensive study, lest we continue to experience the ill-effects of public mismanagement. One worries that government has taken a fancy to growing big, and in managing by ad-hoc objectives, depending on where the wind blows like back to the old Macho Joseph “Erap” Estrada’s oido style. For example, while there is a case for government taking over private sector operations that are failing in terms of promoting the public good, the need for a thorough and careful deliberation is equally important. Just because today’s broadside against public-private partnership schemes has opened awareness of the creation of private gain at the expense of public pain — which is what government rants about in the case of the privatized water utilities in Metro Manila and nearby cities — may not yet suffice as a rational basis for government to fatten itself with the creation of more offices, especially profit-making corporations, and the hiring of an extra mass of personnel. In the first place, we must not forget that government — at least from Philippine experience — has never been known for making profit from its publicly owned or controlled corporations. To support their continued operations, taxpayers subsidize them. During the twilight years of the Marcos regime, at a time when public support for it was waning, the dictator needed to manage the allegiance of at least four sectors: the military establishment, the international finance community, the oligarchy, and the political dynasties. The strategies included creating government agencies — at one time there was a total of almost 300 corporations — to which a mix of retired military generals, technocrats and nominees of oligarchs and political families were appointed, as well as taking control of big business by favored cronies. One must note that the Marcos formula does not, by itself, equal to corruption. But the conditions, underpinned by political patronage, that supported it glittered with the spoils of one-upmanship and deceit, too enticing even for the clean souls not to come out of it totally unsullied, especially if leaders were nowhere leading by example. It was not a matter of if, but a question of when, the rot was to metastasize into an untenable reputational and credibility issue for the government. There are signs that the Duterte government could be falling into this trap. We have seen President Rodrigo Duterte long enough to believe that he has no time for serious thought. It is time for his advisers to get moving and rescue us from the temptation of reliving history. Email: comments@ingmingaberia.com "

If guests report symptoms, ask three questions indicated in the DOH Decision Table below. Passersby walk past a tarpaulin outside Manila Doctors Hospital enjoining citizens to take care of their health. THE MANILA TIMES FILE PHOTO Decision Table
1. Have you recently (14 days) travelled to China or a country or place on the WHO list with local transmission or outbreak of 2019-nCoV? 2. Have you had recent contact with a person with a confirmed or suspected case of 2019-nCov? 3. Do you have such symptoms as fever greater than 38 degrees Celsius and flu-like symptoms such as cough, difficulty of breathing or shortness of breath? If the guest answers yes to any of the questions, s/he shall be considered “probable nCoV” and must be referred to nearest local health worker or government hospital for nCoV medical protocol. If the guest answers no to any of the questions, s/he shall be considered “negative nCoV” but must be referred to a doctor to address symptoms. Stringent sanitation standards in all sectors of the workplace like housekeeping and food and beverage must also be implemented. Other tourism enterprises and tourism-related enterprises are encouraged to adopt this set of guidelines and customize to the most appropriate process in their operations. The following practices have been recommended to prevent the further spread of nCoV: – Practice frequent and proper handwashing
– Practice proper cough etiquette
– Always bring a handkerchief/tissue
– Cover the mouth and nose using a handkerchief/tissue (sleeves or crook of the elbow may also be used to cover the mouth when coughing or sneezing)
– Move away from people when coughing
– Do not spit
– Throw away used tissues properly
– Always wash your hands after sneezing or coughing
– Use alcohol/hand sanitizer
– Avoid unprotected contact with farm or wild animals
– Ensure that food is well-cooked
– Maintain a healthy lifestyle to build up immunity The Bureau of Quarantine, meanwhile, is working with airlines and airport authorities to strengthen border surveillance, while the Epidemiology Bureau is heightening its community surveillance. The DOT will continue to coordinate with tourism stakeholders and LGUs nationwide and underscore the value of taking precautionary measures to prevent the spread of the nCoV. To ensure safety and security of travelers and citizens, the DOT calls on the travel trade partners, local health, police and security establishments, and other stakeholders to help provide proper guidance and assistance, when needed. The public can get information about the 2019-nCoV from the DOH’s and WHO’s official press releases, website, and official social media platforms.

Philippine Embassy Charges d’Affaires Elmer Cato deplored the posting by a local online publication of the photograph of the Filipino worker. In a post on the Embassy’s Facebook page, Cato said the Philippine was “saddened that the publication also posted passport and others details of the said Filipino despite statements by concerned authorities clarifying the matter”. “This evening, the Embassy was informed by the employer of the Filipino national that based on the medical tests conducted today by Libyan health authorities there are no indications that said Filipino national is carrying the virus,” Cato said. On Tuesday, the Libyan health office issued a statement clearing the concerned unidentified Filipino of nCoV infection. “In contact with the medical clinic at Mytt Oil and Gas Company, the National Center for Disease Control has followed the case of a member of the company who holds Filipino citizenship.” “After medical detection and case analysis, it was found that there were no systems of the corona virus,” Libya’s NCDC zaid. “Also by checking the travel history of the situation, it was found to be coming from the Philippines, in the United Arab Emirates, and Malta, which is considered to be very small,” it added. Cato, on Twitter, thanked the NCDC “for agreeing to release its findings on tests conducted on newly arrived Filipino oil platform worker earlier reported to have corona virus syndrone. The Filipino tested negative.” Replying to Cato’s tweet, Foreign Affairs Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr., instructed the former to “thank them for us, send results to DoH (Department of Health) through DFA (Department of Foreign Affairs) instantly.” Cato said the Embassy “understands the matter is of public concern not only in Libya but in the rest of the world and would like to request that only accurate information be published so as not to add to the growing hysteria over this new outbreak.” A netizen had asked Cato to demand a public apology from Libyan authorities for fear that Filipinos may be harassed by people who would believe the fake news. Cato, however, said, “We understand where they are coming from. The virus is of concern to all of us here. We are thankful that the said post had been removed.” BERNADETTE E. TAMAYO  "

,"February 4, 2020",nCov,Hospitals cut services as worried Hong Kong has 1st death,THE MANILA TIMES,"BEIJING: Hong Kong hospitals cut services on Tuesday as medical workers were striking for a second day to demand its borders with mainland China be shut completely to ward off a virus that caused its first death in the semi-autonomous territory. All but two of Hong Kong’s land and sea crossings with the mainland were closed at midnight after more than 2,000 hospital workers went on strike Monday. As many as 9,000 medical workers could join a bigger walkout Tuesday to demand closure of the border across which tens of thousands of people continue to travel daily. Hong Kong’s Hospital Authority said it was cutting back services because “a large number of absent from duty” and “emergency services in public hospitals have been affected.” Hong Kong was hit hard by SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, in 2002-03, an illness from the same family of viruses as the current outbreak and which many believe was intensified by official Chinese secrecy and obfuscation. The mainland’s latest figures of 425 deaths and 20,438 confirmed infections of the new coronavirus were up from 361 deaths and 17,205 cases the previous day. Outside mainland China, at least 180 cases have been confirmed, including two fatalities, in Hong Kong and the Philippines. The patient who died in Hong Kong was a 39-year-old man who had traveled to Wuhan, the mainland city that has been the epicenter of the outbreak, before being hospitalized. The Hospital Authority said Tuesday he had existing health conditions but did not give details. Most cases of the illness have been mild, but most who died have been older people with other ailments such as diabetes or heart disease.

(AP Photo/Vincent Yu) Late Monday, China’s President Xi Jinping presided over a special meeting of the top Communist Party body for the second time since the crisis started, saying “we have launched a people’s war of prevention of the epidemic.” He told the Politburo standing committee the country must race against time to curb the spread of the virus and those who neglect their duties will be punished, state broadcaster CCTV reported. Other countries are continuing evacuations and restricting the entry of Chinese or people who have recently traveled in the country. A plane carrying Malaysians from Wuhan arrived in Kuala Lumpur and the 133 people on board were to be screened and quarantined for 14 days, the maximum incubation period for the virus. Taiwan on Monday flew home 247 of its citizens from Wuhan and had sent three passengers for treatment after they were found to have fever or sore throats. The other passengers are being quarantined at medical facilities for the next two weeks. Germany’s Lufthansa became the latest international airline to suspend flights to China, and several countries are barring Chinese travelers or people who passed through China recently.

(AP Photo/Vincent Yu) Medical teams from the People’s Liberation Army were arriving in Wuhan to relieve overwhelmed health workers and to staff a new 1,000-bed hospital. It was built in just 10 days, its prefabricated wards equipped with state-of-the-art medical equipment and ventilation systems. A 1,500-bed hospital also specially built for patients infected with the new virus is due to open within days. With no end to the outbreak in sight, authorities in Hubei and elsewhere extended the Lunar New Year holiday break, due to end this week, well into February to try to keep people at home and reduce the spread of the virus. All Hubei schools are postponing the start of the new semester until further notice. Chinese scientists said they have more evidence the virus, which was first detected in Wuhan in December, likely originated in bats. In a study published in the journal Nature, Shi Zhen-Li and colleagues at the Wuhan Institute of Virology reported that genome sequences from seven patients were 96% identical to a bat coronavirus. SARS is also believed to have originated in bats, although it jumped to civet cats before infecting people. Scientists suspect the latest outbreak began at a seafood market in Wuhan where wild animals were on sale and in contact with people. The World Health Organization last week declared the virus a global health emergency and expressed concern about how it was spreading in other countries, beyond those who were Chinese or who had traveled in Hubei recently. On Tuesday, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said a 42-year-old South Korean woman tested positive for the virus, days after she returned from a trip to Thailand with chills and other symptoms. It is South Korea’s 16th case. Thailand has confirmed 19 cases, mostly Chinese tourists but also in a Thai taxi driver. A passenger on a Japanese-operated cruise ship tested positive after leaving the vessel while it was in Hong Kong, and Japanese officials were considering a quarantine of the more than 3,000 people on board. The Diamond Princess returned to Yokohama after making port calls in Vietnam, Taiwan and Okinawa. A team of quarantine officials and medical staff boarded the ship Monday and began medical checks of everyone on board, a health ministry official said, speaking on condition of anonymity in keeping with department rules. The ship’s captain said Hong Kong’s health authorities notified the ship about the passenger’s infection on Saturday, according to a recording of the announcement tweeted by a passenger. The patient is recovering, and his traveling companions so far have not been infected, the captain’s announcement said. “I wish we were informed as soon as they found out, then I could have worn a mask or washed hands more carefully,” the passenger said. “I was in Hong Kong nine days ago and it seems to be too late now.” AP "
,"February 4, 2020",nCov,Duterte assures public of transparency amid nCoV scare in PH,"Catherine S. Valente, TMT","PRESIDENT Rodrigo Duterte has assured the public that the government “will never hide anything” about the true state of the 2019-novel coronavirus acute respiratory disease (2019-nCoV ARD) in the country, as he allayed fears over the outbreak that has killed over 300 people and infected thousands of others. In a press conference after an “emergency meeting” on the coronavirus threat in Malacañang on Monday night, Duterte insisted that there was no reason for the government to hide such health-related information from the public, as it has the situation under control. “Wala naman — wala namang itinago doon (There’s nothing. nothing is being hidden). We will not… I can assure you. This government will never hide anything,” Duterte told reporters. “If it says that you are going to die tomorrow because of this — it’s a contagion all over, we will tell you that,” he said. Duterte said it was useless pretending that there were fewer persons under investigation for 2019-nCoV because it was not worth hiding. “If it would cost your life, lives, we will not hide that. Why should we? It’s a reality. Whether you admit it or not, you have to bury the dead. So what is there to hide? It’s not a treasure. It is not something of value to us. It does not contribute to the national wealth. Why should we hide?” he said. The President made the assurance after rumors surfaced on the internet that the Department of Health (DoH) was hiding information, particularly on the two 2019-nCoV cases whose confirmation was not released at the same time. On Saturday, the country’s second 2019-nCoV case, a 44-year-old Chinese male from Wuhan, China, died. He was the first reported death due to the deadly virus outside of China. He was the companion of the 38-year-old woman from Wuhan, China who was the first confirmed case of nCoV in the country. The President has assured the public that there was no need for the public to be hysterical, saying the virus will “die a natural death.” “Everything is well in the country. There’s nothing really to be extra scared of that coronavirus thing. Although it has affected a lot of countries but in… You know one or two in any country is not really that fearsome,” Duterte said. READ: Duterte assures public ‘all is well’, calls for stop to ‘sinophobia’ “You know, this coronavirus is scaring people all over the country. The response of the people from the initial reports of coronavirus was almost hysterical when there was really no need for it actually. And if there is really a virus going around, why do you have to be hysterical?” he added. With the help of “medical science,” Duterte said powerful medicines have been formulated to treat various illnesses. “I’m sure I said that every nation who has the resources would or already are at work to find out a solution or a way out,” the President said. “Malay mo ‘yung atin (Who knows we)— the Filipinos are also doing it. They are conducting… Who knows that tayo ang maka-una makita (we could be the first to find a treatment),” he added. Currently, there is no specific treatment recommended for 2019-nCoV. Instead, supportive care is given to infected individuals to help relieve symptoms. WITH A REPORT FROM REINA C. TOLENTINO "

,"February 4, 2020",nCov,PSEi goes downhill for 6th consecutive day,Tyrone Jasper C. Piad,"The local bourse has not yet sought refuge from the global epidemic that is the 2019-novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV), plunging into red territory for sixth consecutive trading day. The benchmark Philippine Stock Exchange index (PSEi) dropped by 0.89 percent or 63.76 points to end at 7,137.03 while the wider All Shares declined 0.82 percent or 35.38 points to finish at 4,256.83 on Monday. PSEi has gone down by nearly 8 percent year-to-date, markedly lower from 7,700 level at the start of 2020. “Mounting fears on the coronavirus and its impact on the global economy sends the local bourse, together with the other Asian markets, into negative territory,” Philstocks Financial Inc. said in a market comment. The steep losses led another sell-off across Asia following a painful week for global markets with the virus death toll topping 360 people and more than 17,000 infected, and governments around the world banning flights to and from China. Analysts have warned the outbreak could slash global growth this year, throwing a spanner in the works just as economies were showing signs of stabilizing after more than a year of slowing. Observers said that with China being a crucial part of the global trade infrastructure, other countries would also be badly hit, while major corporate names have frozen or scaled back their Chinese operations, threatening the global supply chain. “Philippine stocks fell sharply as investors grew increasingly worried about the potential economic impact of China’s fast-spreading coronavirus,” Regina Capital Development Corp. head of sales Luis Limlingan added. Wall Street was down. Dow Jones, S&P 500 and Nasdaq fell by 2.09 percent, 1.77 percent and 1.59 percent, respectively. In Asia, most markets were in the red as well.

,"February 4, 2020",nCov,nCoV deadlier than SARS,Agence France-Presse,"BEIJING: China’s death toll from a new coronavirus jumped above 360 on Monday to surpass the number of fatalities during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) crisis two decades ago with dozens of people dying in the epicenter’s quarantined ground zero. The national death toll reached 361, exceeding the 349 mainland fatalities from the SARS outbreak of 2002 and 2003. SARS, caused by a pathogen similar to the 2019 novel coronavirus acute respiratory disease and also originated in China, killed 774 people — with most of the other deaths in Hong Kong. The 57 confirmed new deaths was the single-biggest increase since the virus was detected late last year in the central city of Wuhan, where it is believed to have jumped from animals at a market into humans. The virus has since spread to more than 24 countries, despite many governments imposing unprecedented travel bans on people coming from China. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the crisis a global health emergency and the first foreign death from the virus was reported in the Philippines on Sunday. In China, all but one of the 57 new deaths reported on Monday were in Wuhan and the rest of Hubei province, most of which has been under lockdown for almost two weeks, to stop people leaving and transmitting the virus. In Wuhan, which has been transformed from a bustling industrial hub into a near-ghost town, residents have been living in deep fear of catching the virus. The city’s medical facilities have been overwhelmed, with state news agency Xinhua reporting Monday that 68 medical teams of 8,300 staff from across China had been sent to Hubei to “aid novel coronavirus control.” The number of infections in China also jumped significantly on Monday, passing 17,200.
In a worrying signal, the eastern industrial city of Wenzhou was on Sunday placed under a similar lockdown to Wuhan. Only one resident per household in Wenzhou is allowed to go out every two days to buy necessities, authorities announced. Stopping the spread The G7 countries — Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Britain and the United States — have all confirmed cases of the virus. They would discuss a joint response, German Health Minister Jens Spahn said on Sunday (Monday in Manila). The US, Australia, New Zealand and Israel have banned foreign nationals from visiting if they have been in China recently, and they have also warned their own citizens against traveling there. Mongolia, Russia and Nepal have closed their land borders. Masks China said Monday it urgently needed medical equipment and surgical masks. “What China urgently needs at present are medical masks, protective suits and safety goggles,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Hua Chunying said. Authorities in provinces that are home to more than 300 million people — including Guangdong, the country’s most populous — have made it compulsory to wear masks in public in an effort to contain the virus. But factories capable of producing around 20 million masks a day are only operating at between 60 and 70 percent of capacity, Industry Department spokesman Tian Yulong said, adding that supply and demand remained in “tight equilibrium” as a result of the Lunar New Year break. Tian said authorities were taking steps to bring in masks from Europe, Japan and the US, while the Foreign Ministry said countries, including South Korea, Japan, Kazakhstan and Hungary, had donated medical supplies. Vaccine Meanwhile, United Kingdom’s pharmaceuticals giant GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) said Monday it was joining a global race to develop a vaccine for the new coronavirus. The UK government also pledged £20 million ($26 million) in funding for research at the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) — a civil group formed at the World Economic Forum in Davos in 2017. GSK said its work would complement the four projects already being funded through CEPI to develop a vaccine for the deadly China strain. “Our [vaccine] adjuvant technology has previously been used successfully in the pandemic flu setting,” GSK Vaccine chief medical officer Thomas Breuer said in a statement. “It enables using only small quantities of the vaccine antigen which allows the production of more doses of the vaccine — a crucial advantage in a pandemic.” Adjuvant are agents that boost a body’s response to vaccine or other treatment. The WHO has declared a global virus emergency but refrained from calling the new epidemic a “pandemic.” That term is reserved for disease that spread across multiple continents or worldwide. CEPI was originally formed in response to the Ebola epidemic that killed more than 11,300 people of the 29,000 recorded cases in west Africa from 2013 to 2016. "

Health Secretary Francisco Duque 3rd PHOTO BY RENE H. DILAN Health Secretary Francisco Duque 3rd said the department was monitoring 80 patients suspected to be carrying the deadly virus. These patients under investigation (PUIs) are being observed in various hospitals.
On Saturday, there were only 36 PUIs. “This substantial increase in the number of PUIs is due to the strengthened surveillance system and contact tracing of the Epidemiology Bureau,” Duque told reporters. Fercito Avelino, head of the Health department’s Epidemiology Bureau, said officials have traced 74 persons who sat near the Chinese couple who had been confirmed to be carrying the virus. The man died on Saturday. Avelino added that eight persons who came in contact with the infected couple developed cough and colds, symptoms of the respiratory disease. All those who had contact with the couple were told to undergo home quarantine for 14 days. On Sunday, the Health department confirmed the death of the 44-year-old man, the country’s second confirmed case of nCoV. The man was the travel companion of the 38- year-old woman who became the country’s first case of nCoV. The couple traveled to Cebu City and Dumaguete City days before seeking treatment. The Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) reported that 30 PUIs tested negative for nCoV. The RITM said 10 patients had been discharged from hospital, but were under strict monitoring. “’Yung mga pinauwi po na sampu sila ay na-clear na, although sila ay pinapayuhan namin na maging conscious sa kanilang kalusugan, base sa kanilang laboratoryo sila ay negatibo sa nCoV (The ten people who were sent home have been cleared, although we advised them to be conscious of their health, based on their laboratory results, they are negative of nCoV),” Avelino said. He added that those under home quarantine should isolate themselves and not mingle with family members. "

Undersecretary Ernesto Abella. Photo By Rene Dilan Last week the DFA called for the voluntary repatriation of Filipinos in Hubei amid health concerns over the 2019 novel coronavirus acute respiratory disease (2019-nCoV ARD) outbreak. “About 40 Filipinos have already requested to be repatriated. The expected goal is to be able to fetch them within the week,” Abella said in a press briefing. None of the 295,047 Filipinos in China were confirmed to be infected by the virus, he added. There are 300 Filipinos in Hubei, 150 of them in Wuhan, where the nCoV epidemic originated. The Foreign Affairs department said it intends to fly home the first batch of Filipinos this week “subject to China’s rules on disease containment, including immigration clearances, quarantine process, among others.” Also on Monday, Philippine Ambassador to China Jose Santiago Sta. Romana said the Philippine government was coordinating with Chinese authorities on arrangements to repatriate Filipinos in Wuhan. The Philippine Consulate General in Hong Kong has advised Filipinos to take necessary precautions such as using masks and washing hands thoroughly to prevent contracting nCoV. They were also advised to “avoid large crowds and gatherings and avoid interaction with persons exhibiting symptoms.” Community organizations were also advised to postpone public events to help reduce the risk of infection. Meanwhile, President Rodrigo Duterte has approved a ban on travelers arriving from China and its special administrative regions Hong Kong and Macao. The ban does not cover Filipino citizens and holders of permanent resident visas issued by the Philippine government, but they must be quarantined for 14 days. The government was considering Fort Magsaysay in Nueva Ecija province as a mass quarantine area and Secretary Martin Andanar of the President Communications Operations Office confirmed this Monday. “Ang sinabi po ni Secretary Duque (Secretary Duque said) they’re considering Fort Magsaysay kasi nga sa laki ng facility at pwedeng i-quarantine doon kahit na ilang daan o libong pasyente (because the facility is huge and thousands of patients can be quarantined there). Ten thousand ‘yung capacity [of] Fort Magsaysay,” said Andanar, referring to Health Secretary Francisco Duque 3rd. There is still no quarantine area suggested in Visayas and Mindanao, he added. Celia Carlos, director of the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine, said in the interagency meeting on Friday, the plan was for a team from the Department of Health, Bureau of Quarantine, Bureau of Immigration and the DFA “to visit the prospective facilities” which included Fort Magsaysay. “I projected the decision tool earlier in my presentation. And there’s a part there where if personnel returning from China have no symptoms, no fever, no respiratory symptoms, just a history of travel, they need to do self-monitoring at home. So, they stay at home, preferably separated from the rest of the household. If they can stay in a separate room, that’s much better,” Carlos said. She advised Filipinos arriving from China to wear masks for about 14 days. “But if they develop symptoms, they’re advised to go to a facility which can evaluate them,” she said. Overseas Filipino workers on vacation in the Philippines would not be allowed to leave for China, Hong Kong or Macao because of the travel ban, Dana Sandoval, Immigration spokesman, said in the press briefing. She added that about 300 Chinese were stranded at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport “because most of the airlines have canceled their flights already to and from the different parts of China.” Sandoval said the Chinese Embassy in Manila “pledged to send an aircraft to fetch their citizens.” Carlos said there are different ways of protecting oneself from contracting the virus, including the washing of hands, avoiding close contact with anyone with flu-like symptoms or colds and avoiding unprotected contact with live, wild or farm animals. Carlos added that a mask should be worn “if we have respiratory symptoms such as cough and difficulty of breathing; if we are providing care to individuals with respiratory symptoms; and if you are a health worker and attending to individuals with respiratory symptoms.” Since there is no community transmission of the novel coronavirus in the Philippines, “we are not recommending its use for the general public who do not have respiratory symptoms,” she said.

,"February 4, 2020",nCov,HK medics strike for China border closure over virus fears,Agence France-Presse,"HONG KONG: Hundreds of Hong Kong medical workers walked off their jobs on Monday, demanding the city close its border with China to reduce the coronavirus spreading — with frontline staff threatening to follow suit in the coming days. The financial hub has 15 confirmed cases of the disease, many of them brought over from the Chinese mainland where the epidemic began and has so far killed more than 360 people. The action by non-essential medical staff comes as the city’s pro-Beijing leadership resists completely sealing the border. Authorities have argued that doing so would be discriminatory, economically damaging and go against advice from the World Health Organization. Instead, the city government has closed some crossings with arrivals down some 50 percent since last week. But there is growing public anger in a city that maintains a deep historical mistrust of the mainland after the 2003 SARS outbreak — which was initially covered up by Beijing — killed nearly 300 Hong Kongers. Thousands of members of a newly formed medical worker union voted Saturday to strike unless their demand for the border to be closed was met, with the first group downing tools on Monday. The first strikers are “non-essential” staff but the union has said frontline workers, including doctors and nurses, will walk out on Tuesday if their demands are not met. Staff gathered outside hospitals across the city on Monday morning, handing white ribbons to colleagues encouraging them to join the strike action. “If there is no full border closure, there won’t be enough manpower, protective equipment, or isolation rooms to combat the outbreak,” Winnie Yu, chairwoman of the 9,000 member Hospital Authority Employees Alliance, told reporters. Talks with the government broke down on Sunday after the union said city leader Carrie Lam had decided to not attend discussions i n person. The Hospital Authority, which employs some 75,000 people, said it sympathized with calls to lower the risk of new infections but was opposed to industrial action, saying patients would suffer. It warned half of pre-booked operations would be canceled or delayed by the strike. Hong Kong’s government called on workers to “reconsider their decision, continue to safeguard Hong Kong with their professionalism and together win the battle against the disease.” Some 13,400 mainlanders entered Hong Kong on Saturday, down from 27,800 three days earlier before the partial checkpoint closures were announced. More than 100,000 Hong Kong residents are also returning to the city each day, some 56,000 via land crossings with the mainland. Criticism of the Lam administration’s decision not to seal the border has come from opposition lawmakers and some medics — but also from her own pro-Beijing camp. “We think the government should take decisive and strict immigration control measures to minimize the chances of the virus coming into the city,” Starry Lee, from the pro-establishment DAB Party, told reporters on Monday.

With its wide-ranging criteria for evaluation, individual countries and their citizens can assess where they stand against the current threat and how prepared or capable is their public health system. Project developers
The GHS Index is a project of the Nuclear Threat Initiative and the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security and was developed with the Economist Intelligence Unit. These organizations believe that, over time, the GHS Index will spur measurable changes in national health security and improve international capability to address one of the world’s most omnipresent risks: infectious disease outbreaks that can lead to international epidemics and pandemics. The index is intended to be a key resource in the face of increasing risks of high-consequence and globally catastrophic biological events and in light of major gaps in international financing for preparedness. These risks are magnified by a rapidly changing and interconnected world; increasing political instability; urbanization; climate change; and rapid technology advances that make it easier, cheaper, and faster to create and engineer pathogens. The index was developed with the guidance of an international expert advisory panel. The GHS Index data are drawn from publicly available data sources from individual countries and international organizations, as well as an array of additional sources, including published governmental information, data from the World Health Organization (WHO), the World Organization for Animal Health, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the World Bank, country legislation and regulations, and academic resources and publications. Unique in the field, the GHS Index provides a comprehensive assessment of countries’ health security and considers the broader context for biological risks within each country, including a country’s geopolitical considerations and health system and whether it has tested its capacities to contain outbreaks. Knowing the risks, however, is not enough. Political will is needed to protect people from the consequences of epidemics, to take action to save lives, and to build a safer and more secure world. Why index needed
It is likely that the world will continue to face outbreaks that most countries are ill-positioned to combat. In addition to climate change and urbanization, international mass displacement and migration — now happening in nearly every corner of the world — create ideal conditions for the emergence and spread of pathogens. Countries also face an increased potential threat of accidental or deliberate release of a deadly engineered pathogen, which could cause even greater harm than a naturally occurring pandemic. The same scientific advances that help fight epidemic disease also have allowed pathogens to be engineered or recreated in laboratories. Meanwhile, disparities in capacity and inattention to biological threats among some leaders have exacerbated preparedness gaps. The GHS Index seeks to illuminate those gaps to increase both political will and financing to fill them at the national and international levels. Unfortunately, political will for accelerating health security is caught in a perpetual cycle of panic and neglect. Over the past two decades, decision makers have only sporadically focused on health security, despite concerns stemming from the 2001 anthrax attacks, the emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronaviruses, and the looming threat of a pandemic caused by a novel strain of influenza. In September 2014, the United Nations Security Council met in crisis over the growing Ebola epidemic in West Africa. Massive global assistance was needed to stop the outbreak because of insufficient national capacities in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone to quickly detect and respond to the epidemic. As a result, the West Africa Ebola epidemic killed at least 10,000 people and infected more than 28,000. The three affected countries lost $2.8 billion in combined gross domestic product, and a massive global response totaled billions of dollars before the outbreak was contained. The crisis awakened the world to the reality that pathogens can emerge unexpectedly, and when outbreaks occur in countries that are unprepared, they can spill beyond borders, threatening the peace, health and prosperity of all countries. But despite newly available vaccines and therapies, response to the Ebola outbreak that began in 2018 in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo has been hampered by violence and instability, community resistance to outbreak mitigation measures, hospital transmission, delays in detection and isolation, and lack of funding and resources. Delays in the global response to Ebola in 2014 led to a restructuring of the WHO and prompted calls for measurement and transparent reporting of countries’ public health capacities, including the launch of the voluntary WHO IHR Joint External Evaluations. Since then, health, policy and security leaders have developed numerous high-level reviews and recommended ways to identify, finance, and fill major preparedness gaps. These recommendations are relevant for epidemic threats, such as Ebola, and high consequence pandemic threats, such as a fast-spreading respiratory disease agent that could have a geographic scope, severity, or societal impact and could overwhelm national or international capacity to manage it. Some of those recommendations have been implemented, but many have been shelved owing in part to lack of financing. Nearly all recommendations pointed to a need to better understand and measure — on a transparent, global, and recurring basis — the state of international capability for preventing, detecting, and rapidly responding to epidemic and pandemic threats. The GHS Index is designed to meet this need. Ranking of countries and scores
The GHS Index assesses countries’ health security and capabilities across six categories, 34 indicators, and 85 sub-indicators. The findings are drawn from open source information that answered 140 questions across the categories. The full report offers 33 recommendations to address the gaps identified by the index. National health security is fundamentally weak around the world. No country is fully prepared for epidemics or pandemics, and every country has important gaps to address. Countries are not prepared for a globally catastrophic biological event. There is little evidence that most countries have tested important health security capacities or shown that they would be functional in a crisis. Most countries have not allocated funding from national budgets to fill identified preparedness gaps. More than half of countries face major political and security risks that could undermine national capability to counter biological threats. Most countries lack foundational health systems capacities vital for epidemic and pandemic response. Coordination and training are inadequate among veterinary, wildlife, and public health professionals and policymakers. Improving country compliance with international health and security norms is essential. Following are the top 10 countries in the GHS index, their rank and their scores: United States (1), 83.5; United Kingdom (2), 77.9; Netherlands (3), 75.6; Australia (4), 75.5; Canada (5), 75.3; Thailand (6), 73.2; Sweden (7), 72.1; Denmark (8), 70.4; South Korea (9), 70.2; and Finland (10), 68.7. China, where the Wuhan coronavirus originated, is ranked 51st, with a score of 48.2. Vietnam preceded it at 50th, with a score of 49.7. And where is the Philippines? It ranked at 53rd, with a score of 47.6. And affirmed its closeness to China. The ranking of Thailand at sixth place is good news. Its good health system may be the reason why there are reports of successful cures of coronavirus patients in Thailand. Malaysia also ranked high at 18th, with a score of 62.2. Indonesia stood at 30th with a score of 56.6. Singapore, which is obsessed with rankings,was at 24th, with a score of 58.7. Japan was surprisingly at 21th, scoring only 59.8. I will report again on the Global Security Index in my next column. yenobserver@gmail.com "
,"February 4, 2020",nCov,We are a nation of hypocrites,Ramon T. Tulfo,"Ramon T. Tulfo THE 2019 novel coronavirus acute respiratory disease — scientifically known as the 2019-nCoV ARD — has gripped the world in fear of a pandemic. In the country, the coronavirus has fanned anti-Sino sentiments, opening up old prejudices against the Chinese and ethnic Chinese-Filipinos because the epidemic started in the city of Wuhan in Hubei province. Before the hysteria gets out of control, let’s put things in their proper perspective. In 2009, the H1N1 flu virus afflicted 1,632,258 people in 214 countries and killed 285,000. The H1N1 came from the United States. Compare that figure to the Wuhan coronavirus, which has infected 17,387 people in 20 countries and killed 362, so far. So, why was there no outcry then against the US or the American people because of the H1N1 virus? Because, folks, most of the so-called free world is controlled by US media. Did we ignore the H1N1 epidemic because it came from the US, the country which most of us still look up to as motherland? Colonial mentality. And China? It has a totalitarian government and is not friendly with the media; hence, the term “bamboo curtain.” But, in its current dilemma, China has become transparent and opened its doors to scientific study. The world has seen how the Chinese government has imposed a complete lockdown of Wuhan, forbidding its residents from leaving the city and barring non-residents from entering it. We have seen how industrious or diligent the Chinese are in constructing a 1,000-bed hospital for coronavirus patients in just 10 days. Despite what Filipinos have seen about what China is doing to contain the coronavirus, most of us still despise the Chinese by calling them unimaginable names. Many of us consider the Chinese people dirty for eating exotic food like dogs, snakes, monkeys and bats. Bats are suspected of being the origin of the coronavirus. We forget that we also eat dogs, snakes, monkeys, mountain cats (called musang in Tagalog) and bats. In a province in Luzon, some people would not feed a dog about to be slaughtered for days. And then, they would feed the dog lugaw (rice porridge) and, after a few hours, slaughter the poor dog. The dog’s intestines, which have been filled with lugaw, would then be made into a sausage. Until a few years ago, dogs for slaughter were sold openly in the Baguio City market. And don’t forget that many Kapampangans, or people in Pampanga and some parts of Tarlac, eat rats. Yes, field rats. And snakes, bats and monkeys, too. How do I know this? I’ve partaken of the above-mentioned delicacies at one time of the other. We accuse the Chinese of being dirty, but we sometimes forget our toilet bowls in our homes flushed after use. Go to an ordinary Filipino home and ask the host to be allowed to use the restroom (or comfort room) and the stock answer is, “Hintay muna, titingnan ko kung nilinis na ang banyo (Wait, I’ll see if the toilet has been cleaned). In ordinary restaurants, most toilets are not clean. The only clean restrooms are those in first-class restaurants and hotels. Not so in China, where all toilets are clean. I should know, I’ve been to many places in China and am a witness to its clean rest rooms. We accuse the Chinese of spitting in public, but we forget that many of us urinate or piss in open public places just like dogs do. I remember that joke about the propensity of Filipinos to urinate in public and let me share it with you. When Ronald and Nancy Reagan visited Manila many years ago, they were met at the airport by Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos. On the way to Malacañang, the Reagans saw men pissing on walls or trees and pointed this out to the Marcoses. The Marcoses were so embarrassed they couldn’t say a word. When it was the time for the Marcoses to visit the United States, they were met at the airport by the Reagans. On the way to the White House aboard a stretch limousine, the Marcoses saw a man urinating in the street and promptly called the attention of the Reagans. “So, we don’t have the monopoly of people urinating in public, Mr. President,” Ferdinand told Ronald. Embarrassed, Ronald Reagan ordered their convoy to stop and directed his Secret Service agents to arrest the man and bring him before him, Nancy and their visitors. The man turned out to be a Filipino! End of joke. So, remember this saying: When we point an accusing finger at anyone, another three fingers are pointed at us. "
,"February 4, 2020",nCov,65 areas in PH watched for bird flu,Eireene Jairee Gomez,"THE Department of Agriculture’s Bureau of Animal Industry (DA-BAI) is closely monitoring 65 areas across the country that could be possible entry points for the H5N1 avian influenza or bird flu. The monitoring was launched after the avian flu was reported in China’s Hunan province.
Speaking to reporters on Monday, BAI Director Ronnie Domingo said the critical areas are wetlands and forests where migratory birds frequent. Migratory birds settle along the coastal areas of Paranaque City. File Photo The areas include Buguey Wetlands (Cagayan province), Candaba Swamp (Pampanga), Naujan Lake (Mindoro), Olango Island (Cebu), Agusan Marsh (Agusan del Sur) and Las Piñas-Parañaque Critical Habitat and Ecotourism Area (coasts of the cities of Las Piñas and Parañaque). “We will not stop our programs to prevent the entry of avian flu in our country. Our regular surveillance is continuous,” Domingo said. The Philippines has a significant role in bird migration. It has 117 “Important Bird Areas,” which serve as habitats for large numbers of these birds at a time, making them crucial sites for bird conservation. There are over 600 bird species in the Philippines, around 150 of which are migratory such as grey heron, purple heron, peregrine falcon, northern shoveler and the Philippine mallard. Domingo said the country does not allow vaccines to prevent the bird flu, noting that there are about 190 subtypes that can cause mutation, and can only worsen the presence of the disease. “It’s useless. Vaccines are prohibited because we might just introduce new subtype,” Domingo said. Last Sunday, China’s Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs reported that almost 18,000 chickens were culled in Hunan after an outbreak of H5N1. Hunan lies on the southern border of Hubei province, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak. Reports say bird flu is much deadlier than either the severe acute respiratory syndrome or the 2019 novel coronavirus acute respiratory disease, but no human cases have been reported yet following the outbreak in China. Since 2003, H5N1 has killed 455 people worldwide, according to the World Organization for Animal Health. As part of the efforts to prevent the presence of bird flu in the country, Domingo said the Agriculture department would continuously impose temporary ban on poultry products from countries affected by bird flu. Just last week, Agriculture Secretary William Dar issued a directive imposing a temporary ban on the importation of domestic and wild birds, and their products, including poultry meat, day old chicks, eggs and semen originating from Poland after it reported an outbreak of H5N8 Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza. In 2017, the DA confirmed an avian influenza outbreak in Pampanga, with about 37,000 birds dying from H5N6 and over 600,000 birds culled to stop the disease from spreading further. "
,"February 4, 2020",nCov,Police to help monitor face mask hoarding,Darwin Pesco,"The police will assist concerned agencies in monitoring the hoarding of face masks and other medical supplies that have gone scarce because of the 2019 novel coronavirus acute respiratory disease (2019-nCoV ARD) scare. Police will assist concerned agencies in monitoring the hoarding of face masks and other medical supplies. Philippine National Police chief Gen. Archie Francisco Gamboa said on Monday he had assigned the Criminal Investigation and Detection Group and local police units to help the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) and the local government units (LGUs) in checking reports of hoarding of and profiteering in the masks and related items. Gamboa made it clear that the DTI was still the leading agency in the crackdown on traders overpricing medical supplies. He also gave orders to the chiefs of police to watch the stores for possible panic buying. “We have given orders to the chiefs of police to monitor possible supplies and possible panic buying of masks and the orderliness in buying, “ Gamboa said. He noted that wearing masks inside police camps was left to the discretion of their commanders. Following the reported death of the first nCov patient in the Philippines, Gamboa urged the public to remain calm. “I would like to echo the call of our health authorities to remain calm and informed amid this global public health emergency, and instead focus attention and effort in promoting personal hygiene and strengthening of the immune system thru proper nutrition and healthy lifestyle,” he said. Last week, Interior Secretary Eduardo Año ordered barangay (village) officials to start an intensive cleanup drive by properly disposing of garbage and cleaning up the streets and waterways. Año also directed LGUs to create their own Coronavirus Task Force. "
,"February 4, 2020",nCov,Misplaying the racism card,Antonio Contreras,"ANTONIO CONTRERAS RACISM is a scourge that should be resisted. It is a social virus that needs to be avoided. It is a kind of labeling that places those who are targeted at a subordinate and marginalized position and, worse, they end up oppressed and persecuted. But racism has to be understood and condemned within a context. It is not to be reduced, as at present, in mere epithets and slurs against a particular ethnic group or race; otherwise, it becomes politically meaningless. Racism must be understood in the context of power relations in society where it is exercised by the privileged to subordinate, objectify, exploit and persecute those ethnic or racial others who are either in the minority or are less privileged. Americans of African, Latino and Asian descent are subjected to racism in a white America not necessarily because the latter is the majority, but simply because they dominate the corridors of power. Native Americans and Hawaiians experience racism in a society where they have been reduced to a minority. However, in an apartheid South Africa, the blacks were the majority but they were subjected to racist policies by a white government controlled by the Afrikaners who were the minority. Racism is not about numbers, or hurt feelings. It is about who has power and privilege in society. An African-American who curses a white policeman using a racial epithet is not racist in the same manner that a woman who calls out the misogyny of a man is not sexist. People who are marginalized, or who are subordinated, use racial epithets against the dominant and powerful race or ethnic groups in the context of resistance. Some may even call it a form of righteous rage. In fact, when the privileged race or ethnic group calls it racist, it is considered as an act deployed to delegitimize that rage. It is undeniable that the ethnic Chinese in the Philippines have been subjected to racist discrimination even as they also hold deep-seated derogatory views against the non-ethnic Chinese. However, while the latter may be interpreted as forms of bigotry, they should be seen as defensive mechanisms by a minority and not racism. But the line that defines racism towards the ethnic Chinese has become blurred. Their position as a marginalized minority may no longer be true. This is due to the fact that they have dominated the economy, to a point that in most ordinary people’s minds, the ethnic Chinese is stereotyped as belonging to the wealthy class. From being a marginalized ethnic group, the ethnic Chinese is now associated with economic power. The pivot of President Rodrigo Duterte towards China has given mainland China a preferred position in our political economy. To the ordinary Filipino, this has found expression in Chinese workers competing with our jobs, Chinese ships preventing our fishermen from fishing within our exclusive economic zones, and foreigners easing out Filipino tenants from condominium apartments and taking up spaces that oftentimes are exclusive. The ordinary Filipinos now associate the ethnic Chinese with privilege, with the power of influence of no less than the President securely behind them. Unfortunately, most Filipinos fail to distinguish Chinese nationals from Chinese Filipinos. And then the 2019 novel coronavirus acute respiratory disease (2019-nCoV ARD) happened. It is most unfortunate that the acts of this government and the pronouncement of its officials, whether they be because of plain carelessness or a mere manifestation of the biases or imprimatur of the President, from earlier refusing to issue travel bans because it would single out and offend China, to ordering a 14-day quarantine to returning overseas Filipino workers from China, but giving quarantine clearances to tourists from there, have fertilized and awakened the dormant sentiments of the Filipinos against the ethnic Chinese. One needs to understand how fear of a virus can easily juxtapose with an irrational fear towards a privileged other, more so if that other is associated with the place where the virus came from. And this fear can easily turn to anger in the face of a government that appeared to be more concerned about not hurting the feelings of China and its leaders, and less about the health and safety of its own citizens. While racism is real, it is also problematic to loosely attach it to all people who pushed for a travel ban, or who expressed outrage over what they perceived as unwarranted privilege given to the Chinese by this government. There is a fine line that needs to be divined between racism and racially based criticism, in the same manner that one has to be careful not to confuse racism with righteous anger and resistance. To the ordinary Filipino, the ethnic Chinese is no longer an underprivileged class living in poor enclaves. Without distinguishing between Chinese nationals and ethnic Chinese-Filipinos, they end up resenting them as a privileged and influential other. In the face of a virus threat, resentment can easily turn into racial anger. Defenders of the Duterte government now play the racism card against those who call it out for its mishandling of the nCoV threat. But one cannot easily play the racism card here. If there is one that should be blamed for the unleashing of rage against anything ethnically Chinese, it should be the government for blatantly being subservient to China, effectively pitting Filipinos against ethnic Chinese-Filipinos and ordinary Chinese nationals who should not be blamed for the sins of their leaders. Had this government restrained its blatant appeasement, if not subservience, towards China and had some backbone from the moment the people needed it to protect them, a different reaction would have emerged. It is already written in the survey results. Most Filipinos do not trust China. The government may have gotten away with its policy of appeasement when 22 Filipino lives were put at risk at Recto Bank, perhaps because that was not about an unknown threat that now threatens everyone, even the diehard Duterte supporters.

,"February 4, 2020",nCov,Pagcor backs DoH effort in monitoring nCoV cases,The Manila Times,"THE Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation (Pagcor) said that amid the global panic over the spread of the highly contagious and deadly 2019 novel coronavirus (nCoV), it is supporting the effort of the Department of Health (DoH) in strictly monitoring the entry of Chinese citizens being employed by several gaming firms in the country. The agency issued a memorandum to all Philippine Offshore Gaming Operators (POGOs) and service providers to exercise extreme caution in selecting employees to be sent to the Philippines. Another order was issued by Pagcor on January 27 imposing a 10-day quarantine period on POGO’s newly hired and returning employees, who are mostly Chinese nationals, from countries with reported novel coronavirus. However, Pagcor said that “even before the agency came out with the said directive, some POGO entities have already voluntary avoided the entry of such workers to the country.” Although the World Health Organization has not yet declared a global emergency, Pagcor said “the Philippine government has tightened the noose on the entry of workers and tourists coming from Wuhan, China and other countries with reported 2019-nCoV infections.” "

They will assist in the evacuation of Filipinos in China. PHOTOBY RUY L. MARTINEZ “We will do what is needed to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus. Rest assured that the Duterte administration takes this threat seriously. I am appealing to the public to cooperate with authorities in order to ensure the safety of everyone,” the senator added. In a radio interview, Go said the government would exhaust efforts to ensure the safety of at least 40 Filipinos in Wuhan who want to return to the Philippines once the Chinese government gives its go signal to Philippine authorities. “So far, 40 have signified that they want to go home, however, we still need clearance from China. If they are allowed to go out [of China], the government is ready to fetch them… we can send aircrafts, the government is prepared to help,” he added. The senator emphasized that the priority of the Duterte Administration is the safety of all Filipinos, here and abroad. Go, who heads the Senate Committee on Health, said the government had already put up defenses to prevent the spread of contagion even before the Department of Health confirmed the first case of nCoV in the Philippines. He said he suggested to President Duterte the ban on travelers from Wuhan and the entire Hubei province as a precaution against the spread of the virus in the country. Go added that he also suggested a temporary ban on travelers from other affected areas with confirmed nCoV cases. The ban should last until the health dissipates, he said.

,"February 4, 2020",nCov,"WHO praises China while declaring emergency, but what about Wuhan mayor?",Frank Ching,"Frank Ching A WEEK after it decided not to declare the 2019 novel coronavirus acute respiratory disease epidemic in China a public health emergency of international concern, the World Health Organization’s (WHO) emergency committee met again on January 30 and decided that a global crisis had emerged with the disease having spread to 18 countries and human-to-human transmission in three of them. Ironically the committee, in recommending the declaration of an international emergency, praised China for its “commitment to transparency” even though government control of information continued to be a burning issue within China. The committee pointed out that, of 83 cases in the 18 countries, only seven had “no history of travel in China.” Oddly, despite the role that travel in China evidently played in the spreading of the virus, the committee said it “does not recommend any travel or trade restriction based on current information available.” WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who had just returned from Beijing, praised China, no doubt accurately with its massive lockdowns, for setting “a new standard” for outbreak response. Despite the WHO’s stance, a number of countries moved to restrict travel to and from China. These included the United States, Singapore, Australia, Indonesia and Vietnam. The Philippines, where the first coronavirus death outside China occurred, has banned travelers from Hong Kong and Macau, as well as the mainland. While the WHO praised Chinese actions, there was criticism within China itself for the way information on the health crisis had been handled at both the local and national levels. Significantly, one of the critics was the Supreme People’s Court. On January 28, an article on the court’s official WeChat account commented on the detention by Wuhan police in early January of eight people for “spreading rumors” online. It turned out that all eight were doctors, and they were discussing the mysterious pneumonia-like disease quietly spreading in the city. One doctor, Li Wenliang, an ophthalmologist, told members of a medical school alumni WeChat group on December 30 that there were seven cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in the hospital where he worked. He was summoned by the police and reprimanded for spreading rumors that had “severely disturbed the social order.” But the court had a different view. According to the article on the court’s account, while Li was wrong in that those patients were not suffering from SARS, they had a disease that was similar and he had not manufactured fake news for any ulterior purpose. If people had listened to him and worn masks and avoided the wildlife market, China might be in a better position now to deal with the virus, it said. Criticism of the central government came, perhaps surprisingly, from the mayor of Wuhan, the city at the epicenter of the epidemic. The Wuhan government had been severely criticized for withholding information or for providing misinformation. The Mayor, Zhou Xianwang, was interviewed January 27 by China Central Television, China’s national broadcaster, as part of its special coverage on the nation’s efforts to counter the new coronavirus. Mayor Zhou readily acknowledged that “everyone was dissatisfied with the way we disclosed information.” But, the mayor explained, China has a law on the handling of contagious diseases and “information may be disclosed only as permitted according to that law.” “As a local government,” the mayor said in the interview, no doubt watched with keen interest by senior officials in Beijing, “we may disclose information only after we are given permission to do so. That is something that many people do not understand.” Article 38 of the Communist Party’s “Regulations on requesting instruction and reporting on major matters” says: “When an infectious disease breaks out and prevails, the health administration department under the State Council shall be responsible for announcing to the public information on the epidemic situation of the infectious disease, and may authorize the health administration departments under the people’s governments of provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government to announce to the public information on the epidemic situation of the infectious disease in their own administrative areas.” Mayor Zhou in effect alleged that it was not him but the central government that had left its citizens in the dark about the health threat in their midst. So far, the Chinese government has not responded to the mayor’s allegation. Coming after SARS in 2003, when officials in both Guangdong and Beijing lied about the gravity of the situation, the Chinese government needs to explain, to its own people and to the world, just how the system is supposed to work in a health crisis and why, this time around, it did not work the way it should have.

,"February 4, 2020",nCov,"‘No mask, no entry’ at upcoming K-Pop gigs",The Manila Times,"PLUS: Cancelled festivals amid nCov scare
A concert producer has issued a new set of guidelines for three highly anticipated K-Pop concerts happening in Manila this month, while two other long-established festivals have been cancelled amid the escalating 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) pandemic around the world. Following the Department of Health’s advisory to avoid crowded places in general, Happee Sy-Go of Pulp Live World announced that they will impose a “no mask, no entry” policy for the shows of South Korean boy group NCT Dream, SEVENTEEN and the cast of hit Korean variety show “Running Man.” SEVENTEEN’s “Ode to You” concert is scheduled on February 8 at the Mall of Asia Arena (MoA) to be followed “Running Man’s” “A Decade of Laughter” tour in Manila on February 9 also at MoA. NCT Dream’s “The Dream” concert, meanwhile, has a show date on February 29 at the New Frontier Theater. “We highly discourage those coming from [nCov] affected areas to [come to] the show for everyone’s safety… Body temperatures will also be checked [upon entry] and alcohol stations will be set up [around the venue].” Sy-Go said in a statement. These guidelines are in addition to the production’s strict rule of “no mask, no entry” for all patrons. Meanwhile, the Cultural Center of the Philippines (CCP) regretfully cancelled its annual “Pasinaya” festival, which was initially slated from February 7 to 9. The event is noted for bringing the arts closer to the masses around this time each year. “For the past 15 years, the CCP Open House Festival has been drawing thousands of spectators who can see-all-they-want for a suggested minimum donation of P50. Last year, more than 16,000 people participated in the country’s biggest multi-arts festival,” stated CCP artistic director Chris Millado. “As the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus as a public health emergency of international concern, we urge the Filipino people not to panic and remain calm. Let us work together to prevent the virus from spreading. Let us remain vigilant and keep safe,” Millado added. Even Baguio’s local government cancelled the opening of the world famous Panagbenga Festival, whic was supposed to hold its opening activities on January 31 and February 1. All big public activities in Baguio were likewise called off including the Cordillera Administrative Region Athletic Games on February 15 and the street events every Sunday on Session Road. Mayor Benjamin Magalong noted they will still need to assess if the city will push through with the Panagbenga street and float parades on February 29 and March 1. “The tourism revenues are the least of my concerns. My main priorities are the health of my constituents,” Magalong in a statement. The series of announcements came soon after Philippine Health Secretary Francisco Duque 3rd confirmed on January 30 the country’s first case of nCoV, compounded Sunday by the first recorded nCov death outside China here in Manila.

,"February 4, 2020",nCov,China hunts for travelers from virus epicenter,Agence France-Presse,"BEIJING: Communities in China are offering cash rewards, knocking on doors and questioning people trying to enter their neighborhoods — but they’re not looking for criminals. They’re searching for anyone coming from Wuhan, the central city at the epicenter of a deadly virus epidemic that has sparked fear — even panic — in China and beyond. The end of the extended Lunar New Year holiday this weekend has raised concerns that the new coronavirus could spread further as people travel across the country. In Beijing, neighborhoods have sealed themselves off — some with homemade barriers — to force visitors or anyone returning home from the holiday to register their travel history. Twenty-six-year-old Wuhan native Lucy Huang, a documentary maker living in Beijing, puts on a protective face mask at her house in Beijing. Communities in China are offering cash rewards, knocking on doors and questioning people trying to enter their neighborhood, not looking for criminals, but for anyone coming from Wuhan, the central city at the epicenter of the deadly coronavirus epidemic. AFP PHOTO One district in northern Shijiazhuang City is even offering cash incentives of 2,000 yuan ($288) for reporting anyone who has traveled to Wuhan in the past two weeks. For some communities, anyone who has visited central Hubei province — of which Wuhan is the capital — is no longer welcome at all. “Even if you live here, you can’t enter,” said a security guard at the entrance of a Beijing neighborhood when asked about returning Hubei residents. “Those from Hubei could bring the infection here,” he told the Agence France-Presse (AFP), wearing a blue mask. “If you’re from Hubei, you have to notify the neighborhood committee.” China has scrambled to contain the epidemic by halting transport from Wuhan, suspending overseas tour groups, cutting long-distance bus routes and suspending thousands of trains. But the virus has continued to spread, killing more than 360 people and infecting more than 17,000 across the country. Most of those infections — 11,177 — are in Hubei. All but one of the 57 deaths reported on Monday were in the province. Beijing, in comparison, has reported 191 cases. A week ago, China’s Health Commission urged villages around the country to leave “no blind spots” when investigating where people have traveled. But with the holiday ending on Monday, local governments are under pressure to root out those who have visited the hard-hit province of Hubei. “If they look unfamiliar or are dragging a suitcase, I’ll ask them to register,” said a woman working at a compound in Beijing. “I’m pretty worried,” she added, only offering her surname, Mei. ‘Bottom-up’ tracking
Though some neighborhoods have taken the extreme stance of blocking visitors or residents from Hubei, many will allow travelers back in — but monitor them stringently over a two-week quarantine period. Once back in their homes, “they cannot go in and out,” explained Xu Aimin, secretary of a neighborhood in Beijing. If they need to buy food, the neighborhood committee can do that for them, she explained. Residents from Hubei province also receive daily phone calls and have their temperature recorded during quarantine, she added. According to Xu, her neighborhood committee — which manages an apartment complex of more than 2,400 households — has knocked on every door to check each residents’ records. “Our information is bottom-up,” she told the AFP, adding that they also check travel histories. “We want to let everyone become a source of information,” Xu said. If residents “don’t trust the person next door, they should promptly call [the neighborhood committee].” The virus has already spread in large numbers across China, despite drastic government lockdown measures in Hubei, highlighting the challenge of countering a pathogen like this. On Sunday, authorities announced lockdown measures for Wenzhou, a city of nine million people that has reported hundreds of infections. Wenzhou is more than 800 kilometers by road from Wuhan. Wuhan stigma
But the rush to close off neighborhoods to outside visitors could also create a backlash from frustrated residents. It is a concern shared by the Beijing government, which on Saturday reminded community leaders they had “no power” to stop people from entering their neighborhood once they had passed a temperature check. Still, that hasn’t quelled fears about the increased risk of infection from travelers returning home. Gou Hairong, a woman returning to Beijing from Chengdu, southwestern Sichuan province, told AFP on Sunday that she had been barred from her compound. Stranded at the Beijing West railway station, the 24-year-old said her neighborhood had told her she was “not allowed in at all.” “If they really don’t let me back in, I’m prepared to buy another ticket home,” she said. The targeting of people from Wuhan and Hubei province has also raised concern of deepening stigma. “How you see Wuhan is how the world will see China,” wrote one user on Weibo, China’s Twitter-like social media site. Lucy Huang, a documentary maker living in Beijing, said early in the outbreak there was a trend on Weibo of “everyone criticizing Hubei people and Wuhan people.” “As a Wuhan native, I felt very hurt,” the 26-year-old told AFP. “I felt disappointed that people didn’t even have any sympathy.” While Huang said she understood the need for caution, she felt “our enemy has always been the virus itself, and should not be Hubei people or Wuhan people.” AFP "
,"February 3, 2020",nCov,Hong Kong economy shrinks for first time in a decade,THE MANILA TIMES,"HONG KONG: Hong Kong confirmed on Monday it plunged into recession in 2019, suffering its first annual contraction in a decade as the city buckled under the twin pressures of the US-China trade war and months of furious pro-democracy protests. The data was released as the semi-autonomous city begins the lunar new year facing another economic crisis — the outbreak of a deadly new coronavirus strain which began on the Chinese mainland and is compounding Hong Kong’s economic woes. Last year was the worst for Hong Kong’s growth since 2009, when the financial hub was hit hard by the global financial crash. The crisis was initially sparked by the trade war between Beijing and Washington, hitting the export-heavy economy. But the hard times were made worse by months of seething and often violent protests seeking greater democracy and police accountability. Official figures released on Monday showed Hong Kong’s gross domestic product shrank 1.2 percent on-year for 2019. The fourth quarter — which witnessed the worst violence between police and protesters — clocked a 2.9 percent contraction, the third straight quarter of declines. Hong Kong’s Chief Executive Carrie Lam (2nd L) speaks during a press conference in Hong Kong on February 3, 2020. (Photo by Anthony WALLACE / AFP) ‘Heavy toll’ “The local social incidents with violence during the quarter took a further heavy toll on economic sentiment as well as consumption and tourism related activities,” the government said in a statement. “Total exports of goods continued to decline amid the difficult external environment, though at a somewhat narrower rate,” it added. Clashes between protesters hurling bricks and petrol bombs and police wielding tear gas and rubber bullets became a weekly occurrence for nearly six months last year. The protests have died down in frequency and ferocity in the last two months, but the underlying cause has not gone away. Hong Kongers are rattled by the feeling that an increasingly assertive Beijing is clamping down on their city’s freedoms. The protests were first sparked by a proposal to allow extraditions to the mainland and its opaque, Communist Party-controlled legal system. But they soon morphed into a popular revolt against Beijing’s rule. The extradition bill was eventually killed off after months of unrest, but the movement has achieved few of its other demands, which include an inquiry into the police, an amnesty for those arrested and fully free elections. Economists see little reason for cheer in the months ahead. “The coronavirus outbreak will probably keep the city in recession for a while longer,” Capital Economics wrote in a note to clients after the GDP figures were released. AFP “The virus outbreak will certainly dampen any green shoots,” added Raymond Yeung at ANZ. “We will see a bigger negative in the first quarter (of 2020).” AFP      "
,"February 3, 2020",nCov,China finishes new hospital for virus patients as toll grows,THE MANILA TIMES,"BEIJING: China sent medical workers and equipment on Monday to its just-completed 1,000-bed hospital for treating victims of a new virus that has caused 362 deaths and more than 17,300 infections at home and abroad. Reopening of schools was also delayed to keep the virus from spreading further in hardest-hit central Hubei province, where the specialized hospital in the provincial capital Wuhan was completed in just 10 days. A second hospital with 1,500 beds is under construction. Restrictions were tightened still further in one city by allowing only one family member to venture out to buy supplies every other day. Medical teams from the People’s Liberation Army continued to arrive in Wuhan to relieve the city’s overwhelmed health workers and to work at the new hospital, located in the countryside far from the city center. Footage shown by state broadcaster CCTV showed prefabricated wards equipped with state-of-the-art medical equipment and ventilation systems. Leading Chinese epidemiologist Zhong Nanshan said additional hospital space was crucial to stopping the spread of new infections.

(Chinatopix via AP) “The lack of hospital rooms forced sick people to return home, which is extremely dangerous. So having additional (beds) available is a great improvement,” Zhong told CCTV’s 24-hour news channel. Zhong played a major role in overcoming China’s 2002-2003 outbreak of SARS, a coronavirus from the same family as the current pathogen. In a sign of the economic toll of the outbreak, China’s Shanghai Composite index plunged 8.7 percent as financial markets reopened Monday following the Lunar New Year holiday. China’s new totals of 361 deaths and 2,829 new cases over the last 24 hours, bringing the Chinese total to 17,205 cases, come as other countries continued evacuating hundreds of their citizens from Hubei and imposed travel restrictions affecting Chinese or people who recently traveled in the country. The World Health Organization said the number of confirmed cases will keep growing because thousands of specimens from suspected cases have yet to be tested. The Philippines banned the entry of all non-citizens from China after two cases were confirmed there, including the only death outside China. The US, Japan, Singapore, Indonesia, New Zealand and Australia have imposed similar restrictions despite criticism from China and WHO’s guidance that such measures were unnecessary. About 150 cases have been reported in two dozen other countries. The Philippine Health Department said a 44-year-old Chinese man from Wuhan died from the virus and his companion remained hospitalized. Vietnam counted its seventh case, a Vietnamese American man who had a two-hour layover in Wuhan on his way from the US to Ho Chi Minh City. The US total rose to 11 cases, mostly involving recent travel to Wuhan.

(Chinatopix via AP) Also, six officials in the city of Huanggang, next to Wuhan in Hubei province, were fired over “poor performance” in handling the outbreak, the official Xinhua News Agency reported. It cited the mayor as saying the city’s “capabilities to treat the patients remained inadequate and there is a severe shortage in medical supplies such as protective suits and medical masks.” The trading and manufacturing center of Wenzhou, with nearly 10 million people in coastal Zhejiang province, confined people to their homes, allowing only one family member to venture out every other day to buy necessary supplies. Huanggang, home to 7 million people, imposed similar measures on Saturday. With no end in sight to the outbreak, authorities in Hubei and elsewhere extended the Lunar New Year holiday break, due to end this week, well into February to try to keep people at home and reduce the spread of the virus. All Hubei schools are postponing the start of the new semester until further notice. The crisis is the latest to confront Chinese leader Xi Jinping, who has been beset by months of anti-government protests in Hong Kong, the reelection of Taiwan’s pro-independence president and criticism over human rights violations in the traditionally Muslim territory of Xinjiang. Meanwhile, the domestic economy continues to slow, weighed down by slowing demand and the trade war with Washington. "
,"February 3, 2020",nCov,PH reports first nCoV death,John Eric Mendoza,"The Philippines on Sunday reported the death of a Chinese man confirmed to have been afflicted with the 2019 novel coronavirus acute respiratory disease (2019-nCoV ARD), the first fatality outside of China. The 44-year-old man arrived from Wuhan, China by way of Hong Kong on January 21, Health Secretary Francisco Duque 3rd said. The man succumbed to severe pneumonia on Saturday, he added. World Health Organization (WHO) Representative to the Philippines Rabindra Abeyasinghe, who joined Duque at a press briefing, said the man did not acquire the infection while in the Philippines, “but in the epicenter of the disease in Wuhan, where there are very large number of deaths.” MASKED FOR MASS A churchgoer at the St. Peter Church in Commonwealth Avenue, Quezon City receives communion through the hand as advised by Church officials to prevent the spread of the 2019 novel coronavirus acute respiratory disease.

The Department of Health (DoH) said the man had traveled with a 38-year-old woman, who became the first recorded nCoV patient in the Philippines. The pair sought medical help on January 25 after the woman developed a mild cough while her companion experienced fever, cough and sore throat. “The condition of the patient deteriorated within the last 24 hours, resulting in his demise,” said Duque. The two visited Cebu City and Dumaguete City days before seeking treatment. The woman is being kept in isolation at the San Lazaro Hospital in Manila, while the Health department is working with the Chinese Embassy to “ensure the dignified management of the remains [of the male Chinese], according to national and international standards,” Duque said. So far, the DoH and Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) said 24 patients under investigation (PUIs) had tested negative for nCoV. As of noon Saturday, the DoH reported five more PUIs, bringing the total to 36. Twenty-three of them have been admitted and isolated. Ten patients have been discharged but kept under strict monitoring, and four PUIs are undergoing tests at RITM.

Meanwhile, in Dumaguete, authorities could not locate two Chinese students reported to have flu-like symptoms. Bimbo Miraflor, public information officer of the Negros Oriental provincial government, told The Manila Times on Sunday that the two students from a school in Xiamen, China, told authorities they would go to Cebu City after their stay in Dumaguete. He said the two were reported by the management of the hotel where they stayed as “persons under investigation.” Miraflor noted that the Chinese students had “fever of 38 degree and up, [were] coughing and [had] body malaise.” “First, there was a report that they were quarantined. However, when the DoH team checked them up, it found that quarantine was not implemented,” he said. New city under lockdown
On Sunday China locked down a major city far away from Wuhan, as the death toll from the disease soared to 304. The lockdown and the discovery of the first nCoV death outside China added to deepening concerns about the potential for the virus to spread, as more governments around the world closed their borders to people from China. Since emerging out of Wuhan late last year, the coronavirus has infected nearly 14,500 people across China and reached 24 countries. Many of the infections overseas have been of people who had traveled from Wuhan, an industrial hub of 11 million people, or surrounding areas of Hubei. China has embarked on unprecedented efforts to contain the virus, which is believed to have jumped to humans from a Wuhan animal market and can be transmitted among people in a similar fashion to the flu. Those efforts have included extraordinary quarantines in Wuhan and surrounding cities, with all transport routes out banned, effectively sealing of more than 50 million people. But 10 days after locking down Wuhan, authorities on Sunday announced similar draconian curbs on people movement in Wenzhou, 800 kilometers away. Wenzhou is a coastal city of 9 million people in Zhejiang province, part of the eastern industrial heartland that has powered China’s economic rise over recent decades. Only one resident per household is allowed to go out every two days to buy necessities, and 46 highway toll stations had been closed, authorities announced. The city had previously closed public places such as cinemas and museums and suspended public transport. Zhejiang has 661 confirmed infections, with 265 of those in Wenzhou, according to Beijing. This is the highest tally for any province in China after ground-zero Hubei. Internationally, governments continued their efforts to erect virtual borders against the disease. The United States, Australia, New Zealand and Israel have banned foreigners from visiting if they had been in China recently, and warned their own citizens from traveling there.

,"February 3, 2020",nCov,"Travelers from China, HK, Macao barred","Ma. Reina Leanne Tolentino, TMT","President Rodrigo Duterte has approved a temporary ban on travelers arriving from China and its special administrative regions Hong Kong and Macao. The ban does not cover Filipino citizens and permanent resident visa holders, but they must be quarantined on arrival. Palace spokesman Salvador Panelo said on Sunday the President issued a directive coursed through Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea to contain and neutralize the 2019 novel coronavirus acute respiratory disease (2019-nCoV ARD). People wearing face masks in a wet market as residents in Mei Foo district protest against government plans to convert the Jao Tsung-I Academy a local heritage site into a quarantine camp amid the outbreak of the novel coronavirus which began in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, in Hong Kong on February 2, 2020. “With the safety of the country and all persons within our territory as prime considerations, and upon further advise from the Department of Health that the virus has affected all regions of China, the President has immediately approved the following recommended guidelines of the task force,” Medialdea said. Filipinos and permanent resident visa holders coming from “any place in China” and its special administrative regions must undergo a 14-day quarantine. The President had earlier approved a recommendation to set up a repatriation and quarantine facility. He also approved the ban on travel by Filipinos to China and its special administrative regions. Medialdea said Duterte would preside at the next meeting of the task force on the Wuhan virus on Monday to be attended by heads of departments, agencies, offices and instrumentalities of the government, state corporations and schools and local governments. The task force would issue guidelines on handling the coronavirus situation “until the threat is over,” he added.

PHOTO BY J. GERARD SEGUIA Medialdea said the military, police and other law enforcement agencies “are all on standby and have been directed to give the necessary assistance to ensure the implementation of this directive to ensure the safety and well-being of everyone.” The task force has been authorized to ban the entry of travelers from other areas where the nCoV is widespread. “We assure the Filipino people that the directives issued by the President as well as the protocols being implemented as well as succeeding ones are all geared for the safety of our countrymen and will last until the danger of the dreaded disease has ceased,” Panelo said. “We reiterate the advice of the DoH (Department of Health) to the public to observe strictly the measures undertaken on personal hygiene like regularly washing the hands and wearing surgical masks when going around crowded areas when one has coughs and colds or has a fever,” he added. On Thursday, the DoH confirmed the first case of the virus in the Philippines. A day later, Duterte issued a ban on travelers from Hubei province and other places in China hit by the nCoV. Following the directive, about 90 passengers on a China Southern Airlines flight from Guangzhou that landed at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport on Sunday were stopped from leaving the plane. Most of the passengers were Chinese, with a few Canadians, Dutch and French. Angry passengers confronted airport authorities upon knowing that they were being flown back to Guangzhou. Chinese not singled out
Sen. Christopher Lawrence “Bong” Go on Sunday stressed that the Philippine government is not singling out Chinese in banning travelers from China. Go said the order “covered all travelers from China to the Philippines, regardless of nationality.” “We empathize with China, given what they are going through but we are doing this to protect the country and its people,” he expressed in a radio interview. “During my discussion with President Rodrigo Duterte last Saturday night on the government’s efforts to address the 2019 novel coronavirus acute respiratory disease situation, I recommended to the President to implement a temporary travel ban on travelers coming from any part of China and its Special Administrative Regions,” Go said. Senate President Vicente Sotto 3rd described the ban as “drastic, but necessary.” Sen. Ana Theresia “Risa” Hontiveros welcomed the President’s decision to impose the China-wide travel ban. “The safety of all is our priority,” she said. Sotto has called for the creation of an inter-agency body to update the public on the medical status of the nCoV and of government actions to control its spread. The coronavirus scare has triggered a shortage of protective masks in Metro Manila. There were also reports that stores that had the surgical and N-95 masks were overpricing them. Concerns over disease will not stop the annual alumni homecoming of the Philippine Military Academy (PMA), after the Baguio City government canceled the opening parade of Panagbenga Festival. The PMA Alumni Association Inc. (PMAAAI) said in a statement over the weekend that the traditional reunion on PMA grounds would go as planned on February 14 to 15. “The once-a-year, low-density, low-intensity homecoming activities confined inside Fort del Pilar, where participants converge only for short periods, pale in comparison to the city’s high-density festivities like Panagbenga, which was canceled,” the PMAAAI said.

Año said each barangay “must be adequately informed about the disease and [must be] prepared to adopt protocols in containing it.” Members of the team will be appointed by the barangay chairman. A team will be composed of an executive officer, a barangay tanod (peace officer) and two health workers that include a nurse or a midwife. Bhert members will be equipped with protective equipment such as surgical gowns, goggles, masks and gloves. Each team will visit the household of passengers arriving from a coronavirus-infected country in the barangay. “They will then list down the names of persons that the suspect has had contact with or without a copy of the list of arrivals from the Bureau of Immigration,” Año said. “We have to prepare for the possible eventuality that 2019-nCoV ARD reaches our communities. We need to prepare for this,” he added in a statement. House Speaker Alan Peter Cayetano, meanwhile, urged the Department of Health (DoH) to coordinate closely with local government units (LGUs) on the dissemination of information on the 2019-nCoV ARD. Cayetano said the DoH should tap LGUs and congressional representatives of various legislative districts to cascade easy-to-understand information to their constituencies. “We have social media to help inform us, but the information that we are sometimes getting are confusing because they are unverified and do not come from official channels. Kung tutulungan natin ang DoH na maipalaganap ang tamang impormasyon tungkol sa (If we help the DoH in disseminating the right information about the) novel coronavirus, maiiwasan ang (we would prevent) panic…[and] health scare,” he added. The speaker said through the LGUs, information could be delivered in “simpler, easy-to-understand language.” “The best way to control the spread of nCov is through prevention.

,"February 3, 2020",nCov,Temporary lockout of all travelers from China is reasonable,The Manila Times,"THERE are sound and compelling reasons for the decision by the Philippine government to decree a temporary ban on all travelers from China, in light of the global health emergency declared over the coronavirus outbreak. First, it has now been established that the first coronavirus death outside of China has occurred here in the Philippines. Our Department of Health reported that a 44-year-old Chinese man from Wuhan was admitted on January 25 to a Philippine hospital after experiencing fever, cough and sore throat. He developed severe pneumonia, and in his last few days, “the patient was stable and showed signs of improvement; however, the condition of the patient deteriorated within his last 24 hours resulting in his demise.” AFP PHOTO The man’s 38-year-old female companion, also from Wuhan, first tested positive for the virus and remains in hospital isolation in Manila. It was because of this case that President Rodrigo Duterte approved a temporary ban on all travelers, except Filipinos, from China and its autonomous regions. The United States, Japan, Singapore and Australia have imposed similar restrictions. Second, the coronavirus outbreak still shows no signs of abating in two weeks, and China itself has taken more stringent measures to contain the emergency. Six officials in the city of Huanggang, neighboring the epicenter of Wuhan in Hubei province, have been fired over “poor performance” in handling the outbreak. Figures from China’s National Health Commission showed an increase of 45 in the death toll and 2,590 in the number of cases for a total of 14,380, well above the number of those infected in the 2002 to 2003 outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome, which broke out in southern China before spreading worldwide. With the outbreak not abating, authorities in Hubei and elsewhere have extended the Lunar New Year holiday well into February. The annual travel crunch of millions of people returning from their hometowns to the cities is thought to pose a major threat of secondary infection at a time when authorities are encouraging people to avoid public gatherings. All Hubei schools will postpone the opening of the new semester until further notice and students from elsewhere who visited over the holiday will also be excused from classes. Far away on China’s southeast coast, the manufacturing hub of Wenzhou put off the opening of government offices until February 9, private businesses until February 17 and schools until March 1. With nearly 10 million people, Wenzhou has reported 241 confirmed cases of the virus, accounting for one of the highest levels outside Hubei. Despite imposing drastic travel restrictions at home, China has chafed at the travel restrictions now being imposed by foreign governments. It criticized Washington’s order barring entry to most non-citizens who visited China in the past two weeks. Apart from dinging China’s international reputation, such steps could worsen a domestic economic crunch, with China’s economy already growing at its lowest rate in decades. Third, the rapid spread of the coronavirus outbreak in two months impelled the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare it a ‘’global health emergency.’’ That declaration “flipped the switch” from a cautious attitude to recommending that governments prepare for the possibility the virus might spread. Most cases reported so far have been people who visited China or their family members. The WHO acted out of concern for poorer countries that might not be equipped to respond. The WHO declaration calls for a coordinated international response and should bring in more money and resources into the global effort at containment. “Countries need to get ready for possible importation in order to identify cases as early as possible and in order to be ready for a domestic outbreak, if that happens,” Australia, Germany, Japan, South Korea, the United Arab Emirates, the US and Vietnam all reported new cases Saturday. Spain confirmed its first case. The death rate in China is falling, but the number of confirmed cases will keep growing because thousands of specimens from suspected cases are yet to be tested, the WHO said. "
,"February 3, 2020",nCov,China to boost global cooperation vs epidemic,Xinhua,"BEIJING: China stands ready to boost international cooperation against the 2019 novel coronavirus acute respiratory disease, Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Saturday night in a phone conversation with German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas. PASSENGERS DISINFECTED This handout photo taken and released by the Indonesian Embassy on Sunday, shows officials in full protective gear disinfecting Indonesian students as they disembark upon arrival at Hang Nadim International Airport in Batam, following their evacuation from the Chinese city of Wuhan due to the deadly SARS-like virus. AFP PHOTO / INDONESIAN EMBASSY Maas expressed support for China’s battle against the spread of the novel coronavirus, saying the open, transparent and cooperative attitude and the forceful and effective measures the Chinese government had adopted were admirable. The German side has provided China with a certain amount of urgently needed medical supplies and stands ready to offer more assistance in line with China’s needs, he added. Wang thanked Germany for the help, and briefed Maas about the latest progress in China’s prevention and containment efforts. He stressed that the Chinese government not only keeps the Chinese people’s safety and health in mind, but is doing its best to safeguard global public health security. The health and lives of Germans in China were secure, he pointed out, adding that China had confidence and ability to prevail over the epidemic, and is willing to step up cooperation with Germany and other members of the international community. China, he said, hopes that Germany would look at the epidemic and China’s prevention and containment efforts in an objective and reasonable manner, take the World Health Organization’s authoritative advice seriously, and help ensure that normal bilateral exchanges will not be disrupted. Maas said the German side would continue to maintain communication with China and jointly deal with the epidemic. Meanwhile, Chinese authorities on Sunday said that the remains of patients infected with the novel coronavirus should be cremated close to where they are, and funeral traditions such as a farewell ceremony are banned. The remains of infected patients shall not be transported among different provincial-level regions, and not be preserved by burial or other means, according to a trial guideline jointly issued by the general offices of the National Health Commission, the Ministry of Civil Affairs and the Ministry of Public Security. The bodies should be disinfected and placed in a sealed bag by medical workers as required, which are not allowed to be opened after sealing. Funeral homes should send special personnel and vehicles to deliver the bodies according to the designated route, and the bodies should be cremated in designated cremators, the guideline stressed.

,"February 3, 2020",nCov,Inflation likely to settle at 2.9% in Jan,Anna Leah E. Gonzales,"The country’s headline inflation likely accelerated in January due to lower prices of some food items, analysts polled by The Manila Times said. Projections for the month ranged from 2.8 to 2.9 percent with a 2.9-percent average, an uptick from the 2.5 percent posted in December last year but still lower than the 4.4 percent in January 2019. The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) earlier projected inflation remained flat at 2.5 percent or picked up to 3.3 percent in January. The Philippine Statistics Authority will release official January inflation data on February 5. “Our headline inflation rate call for January is 2.9 percent year-on-year, with a forecast range of 2.8 percent to 3.0 percent,” said Security Bank Corp. chief economist Robert Dan Roces. Roces said price growth for major commodities showed mixed trends. “Significant drop in rice prices may be offset by upticks in fish and vegetables, while a surge in oil price futures during the US-Iran tensions have not pushed up domestic pump prices,” he said. “The impact of Taal’s eruption appears to be moderate and cost-push effects may be fully felt by February, if at all, as agricultural activities resume in the area,” Roces added. Roces said near-term upside risks to inflation include possible supply constraints to rice as Thailand and Vietnam will be reducing exports. An analyst from ING Bank Manila, meanwhile, also projected inflation to settle at 2.9 percent in January. “January saw higher prices for select meat items (beef, chicken, galunggong [round scad] and alumahan [mackerel]) while others were lower (pork, bangus [milk fish] and tilapia). Most vegetable prices were lower although fruit prices trended higher. Meanwhile, rice prices posted deflation in January, albeit at a lesser pace with base effects wearing off,” said ING Bank Manila senior economist Nicholas Antonio Mapa. “Given the heft of the food basket, headline inflation will likely still be driven by the fate of this all important sector. Temporary supply side shocks noted in December (typhoons Tisoy and Ursula) and in January (Taal Volcano eruption) will likely exert upward pressure on the food basket as a whole. But just like any supply oriented inflation push, we can expect this pressure to dissipate rather quickly once supply side bottlenecks are addressed,” he added. Mapa said that for energy items, utility costs were lower year-on-year, according to Manila Electric Co. (Meralco). Meralco’s per kilowatt-hour (kWh) rate for households consuming 200 kWh monthly was earlier reduced by 41 centavos last month. Mapa said that transport costs saw mixed trends with the 2020 tranche of the excise tax under the Tax Reform for Acceleration and Inclusion on fuel implemented. He added that diesel prices were reported lower than 2019 although gasoline prices were up from the same period last year. Mapa said that for the full-year, ING Bank expects inflation to bounce then settle and average roughly 3 percent for 2020 with current inflation forecast at 3.2 percent for the year. He said, however, that upside risks to inflation outlook include base effects and supply disruption. “On the flip side, the Philippines looks to capitalize on better weather in 2020 which could translate to better crop yields compared to 2019, which was an El Niño year for the Philippines,” said Mapa. Moves by BSP, coronavirus effect
Mapa said looking past these short term and supply oriented threats, ING Bank believes that the BSP will likely to continue its policy reversal in 2020, with up to 50 basis points worth of rate cuts. “With the growth outlook dimming on a global scale and with the domestic economy needlessly hampered by previous policy tightening, follow through easing may help ensure that the Philippines can safely navigate the more challenging environment. Thus, we reiterate our expectation for a policy rate cut at the February (BSP) meeting although the scope for further rate cuts may be narrowing,” he said. An analyst from Rizal Commercial Banking Corp. (RCBC) offered the lowest projection of 2.8 percent due to base effects and uptick in some prices of food, agricultural products, and other basic commodities in hard-hit areas of the Taal volcanic eruption. RCBC Chief Economist Michael Ricafort said, however, these were offset by the recent decline in global crude oil prices to three-month lows on concerns that the latest coronavirus may slowdown global economic growth and global inflation. “Faster local economic growth, at 6.4 percent in 4Q (fourth quarter) 2019, the fastest in nearly two years, could also fundamentally lead to some pick up inflation,” said Ricafort. “However, the major offsetting catalyst that could ease inflationary pressures: global crude oil prices sharply declined in the latter part of January 2020 due to concerns over the latest coronavirus could lead to slower global economic growth and lower demand for oil, especially in China and in other affected countries, in terms of some reductions in tourism, travel, retail sales, and other related businesses,” he added. Ricafort said that for this year, the African swine fever would remain to be a threat in terms of some pick up in the prices of fish, chicken, beef and other alternative meat products. He said, however, that the latest coronavirus situation could slow down global economic growth and global inflation, especially with the sharp decline in global crude oil prices, as well as increased global market risk aversion. “Some residual effects of the lingering US-China trade war could still cause relatively slower global economic growth and relatively slower global inflation, until tariffs are eventually scaled back,” said Ricafort. “Thus, further easing of local monetary policy, by way of a cut in local policy rates by 25 basis points, as early as the next monetary policy-setting meeting on Feb. 6, 2020 remains possible,” he added.

,"February 3, 2020",nCov,"PSEi may slip below 7,000",Tyrone Jasper C. Piad,"With the local bourse ending at the 7,200 level in January, it is seen to continue going downhill — even slipping below the 7,000 mark — as the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) fears put investors at the sidelines. “We think that it is possible for the [main index] to decline below 7,000 if the [2019-nCoV] cases in the Philippines escalate further,” Philstocks Financial Inc. research associate Claire Alviar said. Lat week, the Department of Health reported that a 38-year-old female tourist from Wuhan, now quarantined in an unidentified hospital, had tested positive for the 2019-nCov, making her the country’s first confirmed case. The severe acute respiratory syndrome-like disease, which first broke out in the Wuhan, China last December, already killed at least 200 people with thousands more ill. “Coronavirus fears will continue to weigh on the market and developments will be watched by investors,” she said. While the 2019-nCov will be the focus this week, Alviar said that economic data like manufacturing index, inflation and interest rates decisions could buoy the market above the 7,000 line. She pegged the support level at the 6,800 mark. Brokerage firm 2TradeAsia, meanwhile, shared the same sentiment, setting the immediate and secondary support at the 7,000 level and 6,900 mark, respectively. Resistance is at the 7,300 to 7,400 range, it added. “Brace for further volatility from hereon, as markets digest developments on the nCoV side, and its accompanying economic repercussions,” the brokerage firm said.

,"February 3, 2020",nCov,China’s efforts to contain virus outbreak: Lessons for PH,Dan Steinbock,"DAN STEINBOCK The Chinese government has used strong measures to contain the spread of the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan. The human costs and economic impact will depend on the eventual diffusion and infectiousness of the new virus. AS the number of the infected continues to accelerate and evidence of human-to-human transmission has been discovered in and outside China, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared global health emergency. Recently, the Philippines confirmed the first 2019 novel coronavirus acute respiratory disease (2019-nCoV ARD) death outside China. The Duterte government has taken a reasonable stance of calm and reason toward the outbreak: “As the issue of a viral outbreak affects everyone, let us not engage in discriminatory behavior, nor act with any bias toward our fellowmen.” The inconvenient truth is that the Wuhan outbreak is neither the first nor the last of its kind. However, China’s efforts to reduce fatalities in megacities are a pioneering one. Despite enhanced capabilities, new risks
After the outbreak of a new coronavirus — the 2019-nCoV ARD — and evidence of human-to-human transmission, China’s central government urged people to stay home, restricted travel and canceled major public events. That caused travel to plunge during the Lunar New Year, but likely saved countless lives. Moreover, China has extended the holiday period to keep people at home and reduce the risk of the spread, while extending several billions of dollars to help contain the virus. While the full effect of the outbreak on the Chinese and the global economy is too early to assess, probable impact scenarios can be assessed. Internationally, markets have usually responded to virus outbreaks with sharp but temporary early reactions until the spread has been halted. With the new coronavirus, analysts initially relied on the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2002 and 2003, as a guideline to these projections. But that was premature. In the early 2000s, China’s efforts to control SARS were criticized as the disease spread internationally before the global outbreak was subdued. A decade later, Chinese response to the avian influenza (H7N9) was significantly faster, broadly praised and the disease did not spread widely. In recent years, China has significantly strengthened its national and local surveillance systems to prevent and control diseases. Laboratory and hospital capacity have been significantly reinforced. The record in emergency management is varied at local level, however. In the case of the new coronavirus, Chinese authorities alerted relatively quickly outside bodies, including the WHO. Despite improved Chinese capabilities, there are now new risks, due to greater global integration. In 2003, China’s air, rail and road travel was only a fraction of what it is now and most Chinese lived in the countryside. Today, China has the world’s largest logistical hubs and 60 percent of people reside in densely populated cities. That’s the reason for the effort to insulate Wuhan and its 11 million people, Hubei province, and other proximate urban centers, altogether 56 million people — which is comparable to the population of South Korea or South Africa. The timing also differs. Unlike SARS, the current outbreak took place right before the Chinese Lunar New Year, which is accompanied by the world’s largest human migration. That’s why the government took extraordinary measures to reduce the risk of accelerated spread, which may set a new norm for the struggle against epidemics in megacities. Early human costs
During the SARS outbreak, 8,100 people worldwide were infected, while 774 died, mainly in the Chinese mainland and Hong Kong; 10% of the total. Transmissibility, which is measured by the basic reproduction number (the number of people a newly infected person is likely to pass the virus to), was about 2 to 5. With the new coronavirus, there are currently (12 p.m. Wuhan time, February 2) 14,551 confirmed cases around the world, while 304 have died; 2.1 percent of the total. Assuming present pace, the number of the cases will exceed 20,000 soon. According to early evidence, the reproduction number is 3.3 to 5.5. Despite similar transmissibility, mortality rate in coronavirus seems to be a fifth relative to SARS (11 percent) and far lower relative to the Middle East respiratory syndrome or MERS (35 percent). Importantly, the mortality rate is relatively highest in Wuhan (5.5 percent). When the province of Hubei with its 58 million people is removed from the Chinese data, the national mortality rate plunges dramatically to 0.3 percent. If Chinese data is excluded from the international mortality rate, it plunges to zero (0 percent). Interestingly, no deaths have been reported outside the country, for now. Wuhan is the outbreak’s storm center. And since symptoms may not show during the two to 14-day incubation period, it would seem to undermine the traditional containment practices because asymptomatic people could be spreading the disease undetected. That’s why some observers underestimated the crisis in the early phases. If the new virus can be detected only after collateral damage, there is worse ahead, as Chinese authorities suggest. There could be room for some hope, however. Recently, Zhong Nanshan, a renowned scientist at China’s National Health Commission, said he thought the outbreak “should reach a peak in a week or around 10 days”; after the first week of or mid-February. Mortality rate could continue to fall, thanks to life support technology and extraordinary efforts by researchers and medical workers. What analysts are now monitoring is the milestone when the number of new infections begins to decelerate because it could signal the turning point for sentiment as well. But that may still be some way ahead. Early economic costs
In the Chinese mainland, the new coronavirus outbreak has already hit transportation, tourism and travel, restaurants and retail, which will impair near-term consumption data, while harming stocks most exposed to consumer markets. Globally, the early damage was first felt in commodities, which react fast to outbreaks when even small changes can cause a large plunge in prices penalizing the sales of jet fuel, diesel and gasoline. On January 3, crude oil was still trading at $64, but has since then plunged to $51.5; almost 20 percent. In light of the current data, the adverse impact is disproportionate, yet typical. While all early impact scenarios are subject to great epidemiological uncertainty, economic damage in past outbreaks typically hits first household consumption and trade. It is likely to be compounded in huge regional hubs, such as Wuhan, “China’s Chicago.” Moreover, as the government response takes off, outbreak spending accelerates in emergency services. Yet, such measures, though critical for human lives, do not usually have a significant impact on the overall economy. If outbreaks prove protracted, they may penalize companies’ capital expenditures, which are sensitive to demand expectations, and cause disruptions in supply chains as reduced mobility generates temporary outages. As Wuhan was positioned to record solid 7.8 percent growth in 2020, the outbreak damage in the city and broader region will have an impact on economic data. Moreover, as the outbreak is still spreading across borders, global companies with broad presence in China, including US companies, have begun to suspend operations restricting travel. Meanwhile, the WHO has recommended against “measures that unnecessarily interfere with international trade or travel.” Since stringent financial conditions in markets are likely to further amplify collateral damage and thereby risk aversion, such accelerated measures will soon begin to have an impact on global markets, as evidenced the 600-point plunge by Dow Jones last week. Impact scenarios in China
Before the outbreak, China was moving toward a mild recovery. Despite the US trade war, gross domestic product growth amounted to 6.1 percent in 2019. Given progressive deceleration, which is normal after industrialization, China was expected to grow by 5.8 percent to 6.2 percent in 2020. Today, three scenarios prevail. In the “SARS-like impact scenario,” a sharp quarterly effect would be followed by a rebound in short order. The broader impact would be relatively low and regional. The impact on annualized growth would be relatively low. In the “accelerated impact scenario,” the adverse impact would be steeper in terms of damage, while a rebound would follow only later. The impact on annual growth would prove more significant, along with the broader impact. In the “disruptive impact scenario,” the adverse impact is harder to assess. Whether of natural or synthetic descent, the new coronavirus occurred in the worst time (before the largest human migration) in the worst place (huge regional hub). Oddly enough, it is not the only recent anomaly. Last fall, African swine fever (ASF), which had never before been seen in China but now mysteriously appeared with the onset of the US trade war, decimated half of China’s pigs, which doubled pork prices and contributed to inflation causing pricey US pork exports to double in China. The odds for two such consequent anomalies, timing and location are exceedingly low. Yet both did occur in almost perfect sequence. The question is why and how. For now, central government seeks to use maximum efforts to contain the outbreak of the novel coronavirus. Over time, it is likely to boost further national and local surveillance systems, and emergency management in megacities, while protecting China against potential external bio-threats that have destabilization potential.

,"February 3, 2020",nCov,DoH’s credibility problem worsens nCoV fears,Tita C. Valderama,"TITA C. VALDERAMA THE Philippines has just made another world record, but it’s something we can’t be proud of. The country is in the global news this weekend for having the first coronavirus death outside China. The death of the 44-year-old man from Wuhan City in Hubei province, the second confirmed case in the Philippines of the 2019 novel coronavirus acute respiratory disease (2019-nCoV ARD), speaks well of the government’s mishandling of what the World Health Organization (WHO) has classified as a global epidemic. It would seem that the Department of Health (DoH) has not been forthright in its public updates on the 2019-nCoV ARD. Or, at least, it has been keeping important information close to its chest until it could no longer be denied. The man who died was a companion of the 38-year-old Chinese woman, also from Wuhan, who was the first and only other person to test positive for the virus in the Philippines. It was the first death out of more than 130 cases reported in around two-dozen other countries and regions outside of mainland China. Reports have it that the growing epidemic that originated in Wuhan City has been infecting a daily record of 14,000 people. The death toll in China had reached 304 as of the Saturday, according to China’s television network CCTV, citing figures from its National Health Commission. The first two confirmed cases from the coronavirus outbreak from Wuhan City arrived in the Philippines via Hong Kong on January 21, and were even monitored to have gone to Cebu and Dumaguete City before they flew back to Manila on January 25, and submitted themselves to medical tests after having mild cough. Despite rapidly multiplying cases of the coronavirus strain, the government refused to follow other countries’ moves to stop the entry of Chinese visitors by not accepting airlines and sea vessels from China, particularly from Wuhan City, the epicenter of the outbreak. A travel ban was announced only last Friday, after the first confirmed case was announced. And it was a useless ban considering that it covered only Hubei province, which was already on lockdown. After the death last Saturday of the second positive case, the government widened the ban to cover Hong Kong and Macau, which appeared to be the most common transit point of the Chinese visitors. The first two confirmed cases of the 2019-nCoV ARD in the Philippines keep sowing fear among Filipinos in view of the big number of Chinese visitors who were allowed to come in through Boracay, Davao and Manila because they did not exhibit symptoms of the virus. But Health Secretary Francisco Duque 3rd himself said that the first case was asymptomatic. And we learned that there’s been a second confirmed case one day after he had died. In media interviews last week and during his appearance for the Question Hour at the House of Representatives last Thursday, Duque was adamant in not recommending a travel ban on tourists from China, saying diplomatic relations with China might sour if the Philippines would bar the entry of Chinese visitors as part of preventive measures to contain the spread of nCoV ARD. But on Friday, when the first confirmed case was made public, Duque said he was recommending a travel restriction to and from Hubei province. However, it had to take Sen. Bong Go to convince President Duterte to declare a travel ban, even when it had been rendered useless because China had already stopped flights to and from Hubei. The coronavirus death toll in China breached 300 and infections accelerated as more countries banned travel to and from the mainland. Several airlines in Asia, Europe and the Middle East have suspended flights to the mainland. The confusion over who should wear face masks, what type of mask to use, and how to wear the mask was yet another case of mishandling of the coronavirus problem. The DoH needs credible faces who could explain in layman’s terms issues about the nCoV-ARD and allay people’s fears, just like how Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology Director Renato Solidum Jr. and the chief of its Volcano Monitoring and Eruption Prediction Division Mariton Bornas handled the eruption of Taal Volcano a few weeks ago. The DoH has a credibility problem that aggravates people’s fears about the coronavirus contagion. "
,"February 3, 2020",nCov,Disease and death in today’s globalized world,Marit Stinus-Cabugon,"MARIT STINUS-CABUGON JANUARY 30 was the inaugural World NTD Day. NTD stands for Neglected Tropical Diseases. Combined, 20 NTDs affect more than 1.5 billion people in 149 countries, including the Philippines (worldntdday.org). The World NTD Day is part of the World Health Organization’s (WHO) 2012-2020 Roadmap on NTDs. Unfortunately, the emergence of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) overshadowed the event. Instead we will remember Jan. 30, 2020 as the day the WHO declared the 2019-nCoV outbreak a “public health emergency of international concern.” The neglected tropical diseases that kill, blind, disable and disfigure thousands of mostly poor people continue to be relatively neglected as the world’s attention is focused on the Wuhan virus outbreak. As of February 1, it was confirmed that there were11,943 cases of infection with 2019-nCoV, with 259 deaths since Dec. 8, 2019, when the first case emerged in Wuhan. From Wuhan the virus spread to the rest of China and more than 20 other countries so far. Anti-Chinese sentiment has been reported in some countries as a result. This is unfortunate. If we want to blame anybody for the spread of the virus it should be the government authorities, not the people. The figure of 11,943 confirmed cases in less than two months is alarming. But let us not forget that every day, more than 14,000 children below the age of 5 die from mostly preventable diseases. There are other international health emergencies such as measles, polio, Ebola and HIV-AIDS, all competing for inadequate resources, both material and human. Nations, including the Philippines, struggling to cope with existing public health challenges, are now forced to divert and dedicate already inadequate health sector funding, facilities and manpower to the 2019-nCoV outbreak. The Department of Health has been busy addressing polio and measles outbreaks, dengue, tuberculosis, HIV, 10 NTDs, among others. Government hospitals in urban centers are overcrowded with patients who cannot afford admission and treatment at private hospitals while public provincial medical facilities lack doctors, nurses, equipment and medical supplies. More than 1.6 million Chinese tourists visited the Philippines last year. About 50 percent of them arrived at Mactan Cebu International Airport. The woman reported as the first confirmed case of 2019-nCoV in the country entered the Philippines via Mactan. Absent a ban, the Cebu provincial government is calling for a two-week quarantine for travelers arriving from China. Such a long quarantine period will likely deter most Chinese tourists from entering the Philippines through Cebu — 14 days’ quarantine is likely longer than most tourists intend to spend in Cebu. Jia Le, the Consul General of China in Cebu, in a press conference on January 29, emphasized that so far no country had banned travelers from China. However, since then several nations, including the US and Singapore, have instituted such travel restrictions. There is no denying that the virus spread from Wuhan to the rest of the world, including China. But that is already water under the bridge. Chinese tourists and consumers, goods and investments fuel the economy of today’s globalized world. While the Chinese government may have failed in some major way to manage the outbreak, it is unlikely to be the end of the world. As stated, disease and death in much larger numbers plague our modern world. This doesn’t mean that the 2019-nCoV outbreak is a trivial matter. Aside from causing infection and death, the outbreak has already resulted in major economic disruptions. Hundreds of business establishments and factories have been closed in China. The tourism sector, including the airline industry in China and in the countries that benefit from the growing number of Chinese tourists, is taking a big hit. All in all, thousands if not millions of jobs are affected. The Lancet, in “Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 99 cases of [2019-nCoV] pneumonia in Wuhan, China” (Jan. 30, 2020), details the course of the disease in early fatalities: Patient 1 (a 61-year-old man) was “diagnosed with severe pneumonia and [acute respiratory distress syndrome or ARDS]. He was immediately admitted to the [ICU] and given an intubated ventilator-assisted breathing therapy. Later, the patient, having developed severe respiratory failure, heart failure, and sepsis, experienced a sudden cardiac arrest on the 11th day of admission and was declared dead. Patient 2 (a 69-year-old man) had severe pneumonia and ARDS after admission. The patient was transferred to the ICU and given ventilator-assisted breathing, and received anti-infection and (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) treatment after admission. …On the ninth day of admission, the patient died of severe pneumonia, septic shock, and respiratory failure. …The course of the disease and lung lesions progressed rapidly in both patients, with both developing multiple organ failure in a short time.” The painful deaths of these two Chinese men illustrate the immense suffering of 2019-nCoV victims and remind us that actions towards containing the outbreak must be tempered with solidarity and compassion.

There are 300 Filipinos in Hubei province, 150 of whom are in its capital Wuhan, the epicenter of the deadly virus epidemic. The Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) earlier said about 50 Filipinos, mostly in Wuhan, had expressed desire to be evacuated. The DFA said it is ready to repatriate Filipinos in China. The Foreign Affairs department intends to repatriate the first batch of Filipinos next week subject to China’s rules on disease containment, including immigration clearances and quarantine process, among others. Filipinos in Wuhan City and the rest of Hubei province would be afforded priority in the first batch of repatriates, the DFA said in a statement. Upon arrival in the Philippines, those repatriated will be subjected to 14 days of mandatory quarantine based on the guidelines of the Department of Health. The DFA, through the Philippine Consulate General in Shanghai, advised all Filipinos in Wuhan and the rest of Hubei to monitor and comply with the advisories from Chinese health authorities and cooperate with efforts to quell the spread of the deadly virus. The Foreign Affairs department had temporarily suspended the issuance of visa for travelers coming from Hubei. "
,"February 3, 2020",nCov,Cebu Pacific’s China flight cancellations to impact Q1 results,Lisbet K. Esmael,"THE operator of low-cost carrier Cebu Pacific expects its first quarter financial performance to take a hit from the temporary suspension of all its flights to mainland China amid the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) fears. Cebu Pacific spokesperson Charo Logarta-Lagamon told The Manila Times operations to mainland China — Beijing, Shanghai, Xiamen, Shenzen and Guangzhou — including Hong Kong and Macau account for 9 percent of the group’s total flights. The airline offers 232 flights per week to those destinations, she noted. “Potential impact may be about P3 billion on operating profit,” she said in a Viber message. “However, with very strong cash balance, very low debt-to-equity ratio, and a diverse international vs domestic market, while concerns over the novel coronavirus may affect our first quarter financial performance, we also feel that this is something we can go through as one of the strong and resilient airlines in the industry,” the official added. The Gokongwei-led firm on Sunday canceled all of its flights between the Philippines and China until March 29 following the Department of Health’s confirmation of the first case of the 2019-nCoV in the Philippines. Flights between the Philippines, Hong Kong and Macau, meanwhile, have been reduced. “More than how the nCoV concerns will affect our financials, our priority is the safety of our passengers and personnel,” Lagamon said. Flag carrier Philippine Airlines (PAL) also cut its flights between Manila and China by more than 50 percent on Saturday. PAL offers 69 flights per week to China, or 18,165 seats, PAL spokesperson Cielo Villaluna said. While they do not have direct flights to Wuhan — the city believed to be where the 2019-nCoV originated — the two domestic carriers have provided their passengers an option to either refund, rebook or reroute their trips amid Filipinos’ growing fear of the deadly new virus. Both PAL and Cebu Pacific started contacting passengers who traveled on their flights with a 38-year-old woman from Wuhan, believed to be first case of the deadly virus in the Philippines. "

,"February 2, 2020",nCov,Apple temporarily closes stores in China amid virus outbreak,THE MANILA TIMES,"SAN FRANCISCO: Apple is temporarily closing its 42 stores in mainland China, one of its largest markets, as a new virus spreads rapidly and the death toll there rose to 259 on Saturday (Sunday in Manila). The iPhone maker said in a statement it was closing stores, corporate offices and contact centers in China until Feb. 9 “out of an abundance of caution and based on the latest advice from leading health experts.” “Our thoughts are with the people most immediately affected by the coronavirus and with those working around the clock to study and contain it,” the statement said. Apple’s online store will remain open. China is the company’s third biggest market in terms of sales behind the United States and Europe and it is also where most iPhones and other devices are made. CEO Tim Cook told analysts on Tuesday that uncertainty due to the outbreak was keeping the Cupertino, California-based company from offering more specific guidance about its financial performance in the coming months after announcing results for the holiday shopping season that were far better than investors anticipated. That performance propelled Apple’s stock price to new highs earlier this week, but the escalating uncertainty about the situation in China quickly dampened spirits. Apple shares dropped 4% Friday to finish at $309.51. In this March 6, 2019, file photo, Chinese security guards march past an Apple store in Beijing, China. (AP Photo/Ng Han Guan, File) In a Saturday note, Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives predicted the store closures will have a “negligible” impact on Apple, largely because consumers in mainland China will still be able to buy iPhones and other products through online channels. Even if the shutdown of the brick-and-mortar stores extends throughout the entire month of February, Ives predicted it would lower only lower Apple’s annual iPhone sales in that region by about 3%. Apple doesn’t disclose how many iPhones it sells in China, but the company generated nearly $44 billion in revenue from the country in its last fiscal year. Cook also said the company’s contractors in China have been forced to delay reopening factories that closed for the Lunar New Year holiday. Cook said the company was looking for ways to minimize supply disruptions. Some of its suppliers are in Hubei, the Chinese province at the center of the outbreak that’s been under lockdown for more than a week. AP "
,"February 2, 2020",nCov,China death toll reaches 259; WHO warns countries to prepare,Associated Press,"BEIJING: China’s death toll from a new virus rose to 259 on Saturday (Sunday in Manila) and a World Health Organization official said other governments need to prepare for“domestic outbreak control” if the disease spreads in their countries. Beijing criticized Washington’s order barring entry to most foreigners who visited China in the past two weeks. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced similar measures Saturday, following Japan and Singapore. South Korea and India flew hundreds of their citizens out of Wuhan, the city at the center of an area where some 50 million people are prevented from leaving in a sweeping anti-virus effort. The evacuees went into a two-week quarantine. Indonesia also sent a plane. The number of confirmed cases in China rose to 11,791, surpassing the number in the 2002-03 outbreak of SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome. The virus’ rapid spread in two months prompted the World Health Organization on Thursday to declare it a global emergency. That declaration “flipped the switch” from a cautious attitude to recommending governments prepare for the possibility the virus might spread, said the WHO representative in Beijing, Gauden Galea. Most cases reported so far have been people who visited China or their family members. The agency acted out of concern for poorer countries that might not be equipped to respond, said Galea. Such a declaration calls for a coordinated international response and can bring more money and resources. WHO said it was especially concerned that some cases abroad involved human-to-human transmission. “Countries need to get ready for possible importation in order to identify cases as early as possible and in order to be ready for a domestic outbreak control, if that happens,” Galea told The Associated Press. On Friday, the United States declared a public health emergency and President Donald Trump signed an order barring entry to foreign nationals who visited China within the last 14 days, which scientists say is the virus’ longest incubation period. The restrictions don’t apply to immediate family of American citizens and permanent residents. China criticized the US controls and “unfriendly comments” that Beijing was failing to cooperate. “Just as the WHO recommended against travel restrictions, the US rushed to go in the opposite way. Certainly not a gesture of goodwill,” said foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying. WHO Secretary-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that despite the emergency declaration, there is “no reason for measures that unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade.” Meanwhile, iPhone-maker Apple announced Saturday that it was closing all of its 42 stores as well as its corporate offices in mainland China, one of its largest markets, until Feb. 9. The ruling Communist Party postponed the end of the Lunar New Year holiday in Hubei province, where Wuhan is located, for an unspecified “appropriate extent” and appealed to people there to stay home. Another locked-down city in Hubei, Huanggang, on Saturday banned almost all residents from leaving their homes in the most stringent controls imposed yet. The government said only one person from each household would be allowed out to shop for food once every two days. “Others are not allowed to go out except for medical treatment, to do epidemic prevention and control work or to work in supermarkets and pharmacies,” it said in an announcement. China’s anti-disease controls started with the Jan. 23 suspension of plane, bus and train links to Wuhan, an industrial center of 11 million people. The lockdown has spread to surrounding cities. The holiday, China’s busiest annual travel season, ends Sunday in the rest of the country following a three-day extension to postpone the return to factories and offices by hundreds of millions of workers. The official Xinhua News Agency said people in Hubei who work outside the province also were given an extended holiday. The party decision “highlighted the importance of prevention and control of the epidemic among travelers,” Xinhua said. Beginning Sunday, the United States will direct flights from China to seven major airports where passengers can be screened. Those returning from Hubei province will be subject to a 14-day quarantine. On Saturday, Defense Secretary Mark Esper approved a request from the Department of Health and Human Services for the possible use of military facilities to accommodate 1,000 people who may have to be quarantined upon arrival from overseas. American Airlines, British Airways, Finnair and Hong Kong’s Cathay Pacific have canceled or cut back service to mainland China. Vietnam suspended all flights to China. Delta Air Lines said Saturday that it was accelerating plans to suspend its flights between the US and China, with the last flight from China now leaving Sunday.

(AP Photo/Kin Cheung) The US order followed a travel advisory for Americans to consider leaving China. Japan and Germany also advised against nonessential travel to China. Britain did as well, except for Hong Kong and Macao. Countries including Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, South Korea and Turkey all evacuated some citizens from China on Saturday. The Kremlin said Russia would use its air force planes starting Saturday for evacuations. Germany’s defense minister said a plane carrying 128 passengers, most of them German citizens, was refused permission to land and refuel in Moscow due to what the Russians said was lack of capacity. The military transport plane had to divert to Helsinki before it landed in Frankfurt. None of the people aboard was suspected of infection but they all will be quarantined at a military base for two weeks as a precaution, according to the German Foreign Ministry. At least 24 countries have reported cases since China informed WHO about the new virus in late December. Australia, Germany, Japan, South Korea, the United Arab Emirates, the United States and Vietnam all reported new cases Saturday. Spain confirmed its first case — a German man who had close contact with an infected person in Germany and then traveled to the Canary Islands with friends. Four friends who were hospitalized with him have not shown symptoms. Both the new virus and SARS are from the coronavirus family, which also includes those that cause the common cold. The death rate in China is falling, but the number of confirmed cases will keep growing because thousands of specimens from suspected cases have yet to be tested, WHO’s Galea said. “The case fatality ratio is settling out at a much lower level than we were reporting three, now four, weeks ago,” he said. Although scientists expect to see limited transmission of the virus between people with family or other close contact, they are concerned about cases of infection spreading to people who might have less exposure.

,"February 2, 2020",nCov,PH widens travel ban,Bernadette Tamayo,"SEN. Christopher “Bong” Go on Sunday  said President Rodrigo Duterte has agreed to widen the travel ban against Chinese visitors to include all travelers coming from anywhere in China. He however stressed that the Philippine government is not singling out Chinese in its travel ban amid the threat of the deadly 2019 coronavirus. The senator said the order “covered all travelers from China to the Philippines, regardless of nationality.” The deadly nCoV originated in Wuhan, the capital of the Hubei province in China with 11 million population. “We empathize with China given what they are going through but we are doing this to protect the country and its people,” Go said in a statement. “The Philippine government is committed to help China and other affected countries address this worldwide health concern,” he said. “During my discussion with President Rodrigo Duterte last Saturday night on the government’s efforts to address the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Acute Respiratory Disease situation, I recommended to the President to implement a temporary travel ban on travelers coming from any part of China and its Special Administrative Regions.” “This was on top of the existing temporary travel ban imposed on those coming from Hubei province and other affected areas,” Go said.

,"February 2, 2020",nCov,DoH confirms first NCoV-ARD death,John Eric Mendoza,"HEALTH Secretary Francisco Duque 3rd confirmed on Sunday that a Chinese man died of the Novel Coronavirus Acute Respiratory Disease (2019 NCoV-ARD) on Saturday, the country’s first fatality. “This is the first reported death outside China, but bear in mind that this is not a locally acquired case, but in the epicenter of the disease in Wuhan, where there are very large number of deaths. We are working with the DoH to minimize and contain the disease,” said World Health Organization Philippine Representative Rabindra Abeyasinghe. The 44-year-old man was the partner of the Chinese woman who became the country’s first confirmed case of the novel coronavirus. Both were admitted to the same hospital. The man died of complications of the disease on Saturday. His remains had been cremated, the Health department said. Health officials said the woman is well. The Health department said 24 of the 36 persons under investigation tested negative of the SARS-like disease. "
,"February 2, 2020",nCov,2020’s calamitous start,Marlen V. Ronquillo,"MARLEN V. RONQUILLO Porcine diseases in the Philippines, even the lethal ones, usually have brief, rampaging spans. A veteran hog raiser, battle-scarred by his countless efforts to counter farm site infestations of transmissible gastroenteritis, porcine reproductive respiratory syndrome and the like, said major swine outbreaks are usually over in three months, max. The usual casualty count is one fourth of the stock. But then, you can move on after that because there are usually a 10-year period before anything deadly strikes again. This time it is different. The African swine fever (ASF), which was spread by tainted meat from China, started infesting hog farms in the Region 4A or Calabarzon (Cavite, Laguna, Batangas, Rizal and Quezon) area early in September last year. It is still around, swiftly and methodically killing small farms in Tarlac, Bataan and Pangasinan. At the start of the year 2020, the ASF has wiped out the most productive hog-producing enclave in Central Luzon:  the Porac-Angeles-Magalang area. Several farms with populations of 1,000 to 20,000 per farm had been wasted by the ASF, with investments amounting to hundreds of millions of pesos down the drain. Not included in the count is the human toll, the desperation of the raisers (some third-generation hog producers) and the joblessness of their workers, some with them from 20 to 30 years. Maybe the toll in the Calabarzon area is worse. The ASF is too lethal that it leaves nothing in its wake.  Worse, it is both lingering and persistent. January 2020 has yet to close when a deadly coronavirus, this time swiftly and methodically killing human beings, was first reported in Wuhan City, China. It has already killed more than 200 people and the virus has spread to the United States, France, Australia, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, Nepal and several other countries. A lockdown order, this time to save humans, covers around 40 million people living in 12 cities in and around Wuhan. Other countries, close to panic, have started evacuating their nations in the lockdown areas. Those ill equipped to do emergency airlifts, have just cautioned their citizens to just take the necessary precautions. The lessons of the ASF and the vast swaths of A-1 hog producing areas that it has wasted in its deadly wake serve as a grim reminder of the deadly viruses that spread from China. Whether the Philippine government authorities admit this or not, this is a reality. And the possible carriers are many: Chinese tourists in the resort areas. Chinese workers of Philippine offshore gaming operators are all over Metro Manila, who share domicile with our countrymen in the crowded condos. Chinese workers in the many construction sites funded by China loans. There are neither restrictions nor monitoring of Chinese nationals who move in and out of the country. So far, only one case of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), a Chinese woman, was reported in the country. But the sense of panic is there and the legendary incompetence and underfunding of the Department of Health (DoH) does not help.  At least 10 schools in Metro Manila, those with Filipino-Chinese students in particular, have imposed class suspensions, even without the go signal from the DoH. The sense of panic is partly caused by the news that single case and reports that several foreigners recently arrived into the country from Wuhan and they are currently under strict monitoring. A total ban on travelers from China will most likely be imposed. Right now, a strict quarantine is being imposed on arrivals from China, on top of the visa restrictions for people coming from the lockdown areas. The World Health Organization, which was earlier undecided on the scope and gravity of the virus, has declared the virus a global emergency. With more than 8,000 cases in the 20 countries and more than 200 deaths (as of Friday morning, January 31), it has to issue a global emergency declaration. The global corporate giants with production, assembly and supply chains in China have been adversely affected by the fast-spreading, fast-killing virus. Global tourism has taken a hit. Already reeling from its worst economic performance in years, China may see its worst gross domestic product (GDP) growth year this year. With no institutional memory of a competent and comprehensive response to an emergency, Filipinos are praying. It was just unfortunate that the person who is in charge of leading the prayers just left the archbishop’s palace in Manila to assume a greater role at the Vatican. The panic over the 2019-nCoV is such that the Taaal Volcano eruption on January 12, with an economic loss of P6.6 billion, mostly on the already-battered agriculture sector, is already fading from the national consciousness. The body polity could have provided breaks from these spate of calamities with positive news on the economic and governance front. But the start of 2020 delivered not-so-good news. The country’s GDP growth for 2019, a reporting ritual that was duly announced on January 2020, shattered all expectations of sustained great leap forwards. The 2019 GDP, reported at 5.9 percent, was decent by all standards. But it was the lowest in eight years and the government was at a loss for a possible scapegoat. Because the sector that dragged down the GDP growth was agriculture, and it is a sector that the government has written off, neglected, forgotten. On top of the brutal wages of the ASF epidemic, the country’s 3 million small rice farmers have been pushed to desperation by a rice tariff law that has flooded the country with imported rice, at the expense of the paddies tilled for countless generations by small rice farmers. Food imports, not domestic production, have been made the anchor of the country’s food security, the only country in the world that has adopted that policy of unprecedented dumbness and folly. On the governance front, the big news at the start of calamitous 2020 was the report from Transparency International (TI), the institution that ranks the level of corruption in countries. The TI ranked us with the countries prone to corruption, or with long histories of corruption, 113th of the 180 countries ranked, bunched with Zambia, Kazakhstan and the like. Can we get over and reverse this calamitous start? Those who say “We hope so,” say it without much conviction. "
,"February 2, 2020",nCov,We’re lost in a masquerade,Rolly G. Reyes,"ROLLY G. REYES The way it’s going, we will be wearing masks forever to be safe from pollution, volcanic ashes, toxic fumes from forest fires and strange new diseases. It looks like the “NextGen” will quickly evolve into the “MaskGen.” My recent trip to Cebu betrayed a populace that is alarmed, paranoid, restless and confused. I myself did not know when and where to don that seemingly mandatory facial accessory to keep me safe from this notorious strange breakout. The danger seems to lurk everywhere in places where homo sapiens congregate such as in malls, airports, offices, schools, toilets or any public place. Before, the only masked men I know were Batman, Darth Vader, Spiderman, Zorro, the Lone Ranger, the Phantom of the Opera and that oriental sidekick Kato in the short lived “Green Hornet.” Masks were also identified being used by bank robbers, kidnappers and other men of criminal instincts. Due to the rule of law of supply and demand, we now have scarcity of stocks available otherwise procured only by doctors and hospital staff. Bashers blamed the government’s sluggish approach to the problem. They blame the government for not being congenital fortune-tellers or for not having the Nostradamus DNA to foresee the future. Truly, times are changing. Or are we the ones changing the times? Cynics may argue that it is just like marriage, which is destined to be “for better or for worse.” Paranoia of global scale is ominous and may have an apocalyptic impact if mobility is hampered.
Let us step a few kilometers back to fact check this monster. The new virus called 2019 novel coronavirus has been at the forefront of anxieties consuming the international community. But what is coronavirus? Gathering information from medical authorities, it was known to be first identified in the ‘60s. They admitted that they don’t know the origin except for its crown-like shape. Coronavirus can infect both human and animals. It propagates like a common cold and infects others through sneezing, coughing, touching an infected person’s hands or even face. So much for handshake and slapping. Touching doorknobs and plumbing can expose one to possible contamination. By the way, almost everyone gets a coronavirus infection at least once in his lifetime and most likely as a young child. The next question is to determine the symptoms. Experts proclaim that running nose, coughing, sneezing, sore throat and fever are signs worth examining further. In most cases, you would not know whether you have a coronavirus or a different cold-causing virus. Social media is abuzz with precautionary remedies that seem to enlighten or confuse everyone. Untiring circulation of preventive measures ignited bushfires coming from unknown sources. That adage, “An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure,” swims in every corner of screen. Since there is no vaccine yet, it may help to abide with some of some of them. It is quite similar to the steps for avoiding cold. There is no vaccine for coronavirus. To help prevent a coronavirus infection, do the same things you do to avoid the common cold — washing your hands thoroughly with soap and warm water or with an alcohol-based hand sanitizer; keeping your hands and fingers away from your eyes, nose and mouth; and avoiding close contact with people who are infected.
Treatment? Getting plenty of rest and drinking lots of fluids. Current statistics says that the majority of confirmed cases are in China, where it originated. A whooping 9,723 cases were recorded. Another 11 cases were confirmed in 20 countries. These countries include Thailand and Japan with 14 each. All reported deaths have been in China, and include 17 health care workers. Several media outlets are reporting the first two confirmed cases in the United Kingdom in members of the same family. A bit of good news from Nippon.com: “Japan’s National Institute of Infectious Diseases said last Friday that it has succeeded in cultivating and isolating the new coronavirus, first reported in the Chinese city of Wuhan, from a person in Japan who has been confirmed to have the virus. Using the isolated virus, the institute will start work to develop a vaccine and a drug for the coronavirus, as well as a test kit capable of quick diagnosis. It will also offer the isolated virus to researchers and companies, while trying to discover the infection mechanism and promoting research on the toxicity of the virus.” *** A balikbayan friend of mine surprised me by griping about how the we are tackling the building of new airports around the National Capital Region or Metro Manila. Quite surprising because he knows that I am not working for the government, not an engineer nor an urban planner. Well, I have met a lot of those who think they know more than us who were born and grew up in this country. They sneer like they are better than all of us who decided to stay. Our country is not perfect, but other countries are not, either. They sound as if they pay taxes here or dumped huge investments. They think that staying here for a week or two gives then the right to ridicule our system. If they cannot say something nice to our country, I suggest they should just stay in the country that they adore and enjoy the glory of their glutathioned skin. *** Good work, good deeds and good faith to all.

,"February 2, 2020",nCov,Join hands in fighting against the 2019-nCoV epidemic,"Chen Dongxiao, President, Shanghai Institutes for International Studies","The 2019 novel coronavirus acute respiratory disease (2019-nCoV ARD) epidemic has become a common concern of the international community. Since the first infection was diagnosed in Wuhan in December 2019, the novel coronavirus has been spreading at a speed even beyond the expectation of medical experts. In response, the Chinese government mandated a quarantine of the Wuhan city on Jan. 23, 2020; 31 provinces and municipalities, including Beijing and Shanghai, have also taken measures on first-level response to this major public health emergency. The international community has paid close attention to China’s actions to control the epidemic. On the evening of January 30, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the 2019-nCoV epidemic a “public health emergency of international concern.” The actions of the Chinese government and people are key to the global campaign against this epidemic. Why has the Chinese government taken such strong measures as quarantine of Wuhan? How effective are they? Can the Chinese government and people manage to contain the epidemic? What are the short-, mid- and long-term effects of the epidemic on China’s economy? And how can the international community work together to tackle the international public health emergency? To answer these questions, experts from the Institute of Global Governance at Shanghai Institutes for International Studies (SIIS) were convened and jointly completed this report. My colleagues believe that despite the daunting tasks faced by China, such strong measures as quarantine of key areas are still the most effective means to contain the epidemic; otherwise, the whole nation and even the world would be subject to greater public health risks. Notably, public morale has been boosted across the nation in fighting against the epidemic with such measures. Under the leadership of the central government, and with dedicated efforts from local governments and the whole society, the nationwide emergency-management system is beginning to take full effect. Meanwhile, it is believed that at a critical moment for international political and economic dynamics and China’s economic transformation, the 2019-nCoV epidemic will have much negative impact on China’s economy (especially in the short run), as well as on world economy in many ways. However, in the mid- and long-term, China’s economy will manifest strong surprising resilience; with the support of the international community, the Chinese government and people will ultimately conquer the epidemic and China’s economy will remain robust. My colleagues also point out that in the globalized era, such epidemics as 2019-nCoV have become common threats for humanity that demand joint efforts from the whole international community. As WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesuson said at a press conference on January 30, “[T]he only way we will defeat this outbreak is for all countries to work together in a spirit of solidarity and cooperation. We are all in this together, and we can only stop it together… This is the time for facts, not fear. This is the time for science, not rumors. This is the time for solidarity, not stigma.” It is with the same spirits that SIIS experts completed this report on which I appreciate my colleagues’ work very much. Chen Dongxiao

,"February 2, 2020",nCov,Palace: Keep calm,"Catherine S. Valente, TMT","MALACAÑANG on Saturday asked Filipinos to remain calm and not to discriminate out of fear over the existence of the 2019 novel coronavirus acute respiratory disease (2019-nCoV ARD) that originated from Wuhan, China. PANIC ROOM People rush to a medical supply store in Sta. Cruz, Manila as a wave of panic buying sweeps the nation in the wake of the news that the dreaded 2019 novel coronavirus is already here. PHOTO BY RENE H. DILAN Presidential Communications Operation Office (PCOO)  Secretary Martin Andanar made the appeal after the coronavirus outbreak has stoked a wave of anti-China sentiment around the globe, particularly in the Philippines. “We appeal to the public to remain calm, level-headed and compassionate as we all work toward dealing with and containing the threat of the 2019 novel coronavirus spread,” he said in a statement. “As the issue of a viral outbreak affects everyone, let us not engage in discriminatory behavior, nor act with any bias toward our fellowmen. The reality is every one is susceptible to the virus,” Andanar added. The Palace official urged the public “not let fears turn us against one another, especially if these fears are unfounded.” Presidential Communications Secretary Martin Andanar “We must not stigmatize people, especially when they are at their most vulnerable, but emphatize with them instead,” Andanar said. “Our country is working with other countries, their government health agencies and with international health organizations to contain the virus from spreading. Preventing the outbreak of the 2019-nCoV is not something we can do alone,” he added. Discrimination against Chinese tourists has been reported in several countries, amid public fears of acquiring the deadly infectious disease. Still, a temporary ban on all foreigners coming from any parts of China in light of reports that all of its regions have been infected by the 2019-nCoV has been recommended to Malacañang by Senate President Vicente Sotto 3rd. Sotto on Saturday said the restrictions should not only cover Chinese citizens since other nationalities have also been traveling to and from China. Flights from China do not only have Chinese people aboard, there are other nationalities on these flights and they, too, should be barred from entering our country, he added. “The virus does not discriminate whom it will affect. It can affect anyone,” Sotto said. “Our country cannot take this lightly because anyone can catch the virus without them knowing it, like the case in Germany. A traveler from China who did not know that he had the virus infected a German. The government should take all the necessary precautions to ensure the safety and health of our people,” the senator added. Senate Majority Leader Juan Miguel Zubiri also joined the call urging for a wider temporary travel ban covering mainland China. This call coincided with the World Health Organization’s declaration of the novel coronavirus outbreak as a global health emergency. Singapore, Mongolia, North Korea, Pakistan, Italy, Israel, Australia, and the Caribbean countries of Dominica, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago and many others have already banned arrivals from China in light of the international outbreak. “We need to step up our quarantine measures and safeguard our people and put a temporary restriction on entry for all those coming from China to protect our people from the virus. There are confirmed cases all over China, we need to take that in mind. A temporary China-wide travel restriction is a necessary precautionary measure. We already have one confirmed case, after all. We cannot afford more,” Zubiri explained. “I don’t believe that our friendship with China will suffer as they fully understand the need to control the spread of this deadly virus. As a goodwill gesture, we can offer to extend the visa of Chinese visitors already here before the crisis and who don’t want to go home to avoid the catching the disease,” the majority leader said. “As soon as the threat is gone, we will gladly reopen our doors,” Zubiri added. “But until then, the safety of our people should be our priority.” Bayan Muna Rep. Ferdinand Gaite said the temporary ban should cover Chinese vessels entering the South China (West Philippine) Sea because the nCoV could enter through the country’s backdoor. The fast-spreading 2019-nCoV has killed more than 200 people and infected nearly 12,000, the Chinese government announced on Saturday. The disease, which manifests as fever and cough and causes difficulty in breathing, has reached beyond Chinese borders, with confirmed cases in other parts of Asia, North America and Europe. On Thursday, the Philippines confirmed its first case — a Chinese woman from Wuhan, who arrived in the country on January 21. She is currently being treated at the San Lazaro Hospital in Sta. Cruz, Manila. Malacañang on Friday announced a ban on travelers coming from Hubei province, while other countries have completely shut out those coming from all of mainland China. Sen. Christopher Lawrence “Bong” Go, President Rodrigo Duterte’s former top aide, suggested the possibility of imposing a temporary ban on travelers from other affected areas with confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV. “We are not discounting the possibility of temporarily banning the travel of those from other areas who are also affected by the coronavirus,” he said in a statement. “This travel ban should last until there is no more threat to the health and welfare of our people. I support this and other necessary measures to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus in the country,” Go added. The senator said the Duterte administration had taken the threat of the nCoV outbreak seriously and that the President was in constant communication with key officials who are currently assessing the country’s situation. “We will do what is needed to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus. Rest assured that the Duterte administration takes this threat seriously. I am appealing to the public to cooperate with authorities in order to ensure the safety of everyone,” he added. Go said the government was ready to deploy aircraft to ensure the safe return of Filipinos in Wuhan who have signified their intention to go home amid the 2019-nCoV outbreak. “So far. 40 have signified that they want to go home, however, we still need clearance from China. If they are allowed to go out [of China], the government is ready to fetch them… we can send aircraft, the government is prepared to help,” he added. Go said the Philippine government could start repatriation of the Filipinos in Wuhan next week once given permission by the Chinese government. “The government is committed to secure Filipinos who are at risk in areas affected by the virus, but at the same time, ensure that those in the country will not be put at risk,” he added. Needless ban But an opposition lawmaker said Duterte’s travel ban order was unnecessary because the subject area had been locked down. Albay First District Rep. Edcel Lagman suggested that the Philippine government should also ban flights to and from the entire Chinese mainland, including Hong Kong. “The health and safety of Filipinos must be paramount over diplomatic niceties, tourism revenues and income of Philippine airline companies,” he said. He added that the ban must also include the arrival of Chinese and other tourists from China in cruise ships and other vessels. The lawmaker urged Philippine Airlines and the Cebu Pacific to suspend all flights to and from China and Hong Kong. “They should stop servicing selective Chinese destinations and put on hold the current policy of merely reducing flight frequency,” he said. Lagman commended personnel of the Bureau of Immigration for manning airports and seaports despite the hazard of being contaminated with the novel coronavirus. “Recognition must also be given to Filipino medical professionals who risk their own health and safety in ministering to suspected 2019-nCoV carriers,” he said. Concerted effort Andanar said the Duterte administration was already coordinating with other countries and their government health agencies, as well as with international health organizations to contain the 2019-nCoV. “Preventing the outbreak of the 2019-nCoV is not something we can do alone,” the Palace official added. “Let us not resort to panic, sow fear-mongering or spread misinformation. Solidarity, empathy and cooperation are what we need to successfully take actions that will overcome this health concern,” he said. Andanar advised the public not to hoard face masks and create an unnecessary scarcity that may prevent others, including health workers and sick people, from protecting themselves against the virus. He guaranteed that there was a “concerted effort” from government agencies to implement necessary precautionary measures to prevent the spread of the coronavirus to many parts of the Philippines. “With the first case of 2019-nCoV confirmed yesterday (Thursday) and the World Health Organization, having declared the virus as a public health emergency of international concern, we have intensified our preventive and control measures. It is a concerted effort being taken by our different agencies, to ensure that an outbreak is avoided,” Andanar said. Task force vs nCoV According to the PCOO chief, the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) has already advised local government units (LGUs) to create their respective Coronavirus Task Force, which will ensure that local health authorities have the necessary equipment and are trained in the prevention, control and containment of the 2019-nCoV. “The Task Force will ensure that local health authorities have the necessary equipment and gadgets; that local health workers are trained in the prevention, control and containment of the coronavirus; and that those suspected of nCoV are referred and transported to Department of Health-designated coronavirus referral center or hospitals,” he said. Through Memorandum Circular 2020-018, Interior Secretary Eduardo Año cited a provision in the Constitution stating that LGUs are in charge of the promotion of health and safety within their jurisdictions. “As such, they must take the lead in the prevention and control of the coronavirus at the local level,” Año said in a statement. “We need to be preventive now that there is a confirmed 2019 nCoV case in the country. Our governors, city and municipal mayors and DILG regional directors must ensure that the coronavirus will not thrive in their backyards,” he added. Unless properly addressed, Año said the crisis could have “adverse impact” on business productivity, tourism and mobility of people, and could even lead to death. To stop the crises from getting worse, he pointed to the importance of information dissemination to the public as false news could put the public’s health in jeopardy. “In extreme situations, lack of information or disinformation on coronavirus may even lead to social unrest in a community,” Año said.

Lorenzana was asked about such possibility after the Health department’s confirmation of the Philippines’ first case of the 2019 novel coronavirus acute respiratory disease (2019-nCoV ARD) and monitoring of dozens of persons for possible infections. Fort Magsaysay is a military reservation located in Nueva Ecija province, north of Manila, serving as one of key military training areas for soldiers. This military camp also houses the Philippine Army’s 7th Infantry Division, the Army Aviation Battalion and the Special Operations Command. Caballo Island, on the other hand, is located near Corregidor Island, serving as an entrance to Manila Bay. It was used by Filipino peacekeepers from Liberia in 2014 for quarantine because of the outbreak of the Ebola virus at the time. It is currently occupied by the Philippine Navy. PMA off-limits Meanwhile, the Philippine Military Academy (PMA) was closed temporarily to visitors over fears brought by the virus from Wuhan. “[T]he academy, in coordination with the Baguio local government and health authorities, will be temporarily closed to visitors until further notice,” Cpt.

,"February 2, 2020",nCov,2 Chinese patients quarantined in CDO,Cris Diaz,"CAGAYAN DE ORO CITY: Two Chinese were placed in quarantine at a regional government hospital here for testing for possible infection with the deadly 2019 novel coronavirus acute respiratory disease (2019-nCoV ARD). Dr. Jose Chan, medical director of the Northern Mindanao Medical Center (NMMC), said the two Chinese patients were admitted on Friday after showing symptoms of the virus. The doctor added that the samples taken from the Chinese patients were flown to Manila for testing. “The Chinese patients are still undergoing intensive medical assessment to determine if they are infected with the 2019-nCoV,” Chan said. The NMMC has an isolation ward for patients suspected have infectious diseases where they can be attended and meticulously examined and observed by competent medical personnel, he added. The regional Department of Health (DoH) has issued a statement assuring the public that the virus is not an “airborne” virus. Dr. Ian Christopher Gonzalez, head of the DoH infectious disease in Northern Mindanao, said the 2019-nCoV virus is acquired through “person-to-person” only. A “person-to-person” infection means that the virus is transmitted through “droplets” from
sneezing and coughing. Gonzales said the cough droplets travel 1 to 2 meters before dropping to the ground. “Except for an individual with high immune system, a person with a weaker immune system could easily catch the virus within 1 to 2 meters radius,” he added. Gonzales said face mask (surgical mask) was recommended only for individuals with colds and coughs so that they could not infect the persons around them. “There is no need to wear a surgical mask if one has no colds or coughs,” Gonzalez said.

A total of 136,987 close contacts had been traced, the commission said, adding that among them, 6,509 were discharged from medical observation on Friday, with 118,478 others still under medical observation. By the end of Friday, 13 confirmed cases had been reported in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, seven in Macao Special Administrative Region and 10 in Taiwan. China faced deepening isolation over its coronavirus epidemic on Saturday as the death toll soared to 259, with the United States and Australia leading a growing list of nations to impose extraordinary Chinese travel bans. With Britain, Russia and Sweden among the countries confirming their first infections, the virus has now spread to more than two dozens of nations, sending governments scurrying to limit their exposure. The US toughened its stance on Friday by declaring a national emergency, temporarily barring entry to foreigners who had been in China within the past two weeks. “Foreign nationals, other than immediate family of US citizens and permanent residents, who have traveled in China within the last 14 days will be denied entry into the United States,” Health Secretary Alex Azar said. Australia said it was barring entry to non-citizens arriving from China while Australian citizens who had traveled there would be required to go into “self-isolation” for two weeks.
Similar steps have been taken by countries, including Italy, Singapore and China’s northern neighbor, Mongolia. The US, Japan, Britain, Germany and other nations already had advised their citizens not to travel to China. Beijing, which insists it can contain the virus, began to show impatience over the growing ostracism with the foreign ministry calling Washington’s earlier advice against travel to China “unkind.” “Certainly it is not a gesture of goodwill,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Hua Chunying said.
The US emergency declaration also requires Americans returning from the ground zero Chinese province of Hubei to be placed in mandatory 14-day quarantine and health screening for US citizens coming from other parts of China. "

See,"BAGUIO CITY: The weather is pretty cool here as the temperature dropped to 10.6 degrees Celsius (C) — the lowest registered around 5 a.m. on Saturday. The 10.6-C lowest temperature was so far the coldest this year after the temperature dropped to 11.4 C last Thursday and 11.2 C last Friday morning. People from all walks of life enjoy promenading at Session Road, BAGUIO CITY. File Photo Weather specialists from the local office of the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (Pagasa) said the continuous drop in the prevailing temperature in the city was caused by the enhanced northeast monsoon considering the nearing end of the winter season in the North Pole. Pagasa records showed the lowest temperature documented in the city was 6.3 C dating back to Jan. 18, 1961. Health experts warned residents to keep themselves warm by wearing thick clothes to prevent them from contracting illnesses such as coughs and colds or even exposing themselves to the dreaded 2019 novel coronavirus, as cold places are considered as hot spots for the easy spread of viral illnesses. Residents and tourists are advised to stay away from crowded places, and those with fever, cough and colds to stay at home or seek medical attention to prevent them from spreading viral infection. Pagasa weathermen predicted a continuous decline in the prevailing temperature in the city and other elevated areas in the nearby provinces of Benguet and Mountain Province. Warm temperature sets here in March, and the hottest month is April. "

Three local hospitals — Quezon City Medical Center, Rosario Maclang Bautista General Hospital and Novaliches District Hospital — were also included in the task force. “Sisikapin ng iba-ibang departamento na mapigil ang pagpasok ng nCoV sa ating siyudad, ngunit handa rin silang umaksiyon laban dito kung kinakailangan (These departments will work hard to fight against the emergence of nCoV in our city, but they are also ready to act if needed),” she added. Meanwhile, Belmonte slammed the spread of fake news online, claiming cases of nCoV in the city. “We have to call these circulating online reports as fake news. As of now, no one in Quezon City has been tested positive for [the] novel coronavirus,” she said. But Belmonte confirmed that a Filipino couple, with a travel history to China as part of their work as seafarers, went to the Diliman Doctors Hospital (DDH) because of back pain. “The couple has a travel history to China so the Quezon City Health Department, DDH and the Department of Health decided to bring them to the San Lazaro Hospital for extensive check-up, Belmonte said. “The city’s Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Office (DRRMO) assisted in the transfer with its staff wearing full protective suit,” she added. QC DRRMO head Mike Marasigan said the two did not want to ride the ambulance so they used their personal car and were escorted by health officials en route to San Lazaro Hospital, where they were advised to undergo self-quarantine for 14 days after they found no clear symptoms of nCoV. The QCHD had been regularly monitoring the couple’s condition since, according to Belmonte. “Quezon City remains free from novel coronavirus,” she said. The mayor also advised local residents to follow the Health department’s advice on how to prevent the spread of nCoV. These include frequent and proper handwashing, covering of the mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing, washing hands after sneezing or coughing, using alcohol or sanitizer, ensuring that food is well-cooked, and maintaining a healthy lifestyle to boost immunity.
Dr. Esperanza Arias, QCHD head, has oriented medical doctors about nCoV and activated fever lanes in various health facilities. “We have coordinated with [the] DRRMO regarding the transport of patients under investigation (PUIs) and will include coronavirus in our pre-clinic lectures and in their information drive on polio,” Arias said.

Valente, TMT","MALACAÑANG on Saturday asked Filipinos to remain calm and not to discriminate out of fear over the existence of the deadly 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) that originated from Wuhan, China. Presidential Communications Secretary Martin Andanar made the statement after the coronavirus outbreak has stoked a wave of anti-China sentiment around the globe, particularly in the Philippines. “We appeal to the public to remain calm, level-headed, and compassionate, as we all work towards dealing with and containing the threat of the 2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) spread,” Andanar said in a statement. “As the issue of a viral outbreak affects everyone, let us not engage in discriminatory behavior, nor act with any bias towards our fellowmen. The reality is every one is susceptible to the virus,” he added. The Palace official also urged the public “not let fear turn us against one another, especially if these fears are unfounded.” “We must not stigmatize people, especially when they are at their most vulnerable, but emphatize with them instead,” Andanar said. “Our country is working with other countries, their government health agencies, and with international health organizations to contain the virus from spreading. Preventing the outbreak of the 2019-nCoV is not something we can do alone,” he added. Andanar also asked the public not to hoard face masks and create an unneccesary scarcity, that may prevent others from taking precautionary measures to protect themselves. “Let us not resort to panic, sow fear-mongering or spread misinformation. Solidarity, empathy, and cooperation are what we need to successfully take actions that will overcome this health concern,” he added. The fast-spreading 2019-nCoV has killed more than 200 people and infected at least 10,000 as of Friday. The disease, which manifests as fever, cough and difficulty breathing, has gone beyond Chinese borders, with confirmed cases in other parts of Asia, North America and Europe. On Thursday, the Philippines confirmed its first case- a Chinese woman from Wuhan who arrived in the country on January 21. She is currently being treated at San Lazaro Hospital in Sta. Cruz, Manila.

The State Department raised its warning alert to the highest level, telling Americans “do not travel” to China and urged those already there to leave. Hours earlier, the WHO, which was criticized for initially downplaying the virus threat, changed tack after crisis talks in Geneva. BEWARE A worker wearing a protective face mask transfers bags of chemical fertilizer that will be exported at a port in Nantong in China’s eastern Jiangsu province. Persons who have died from the fatal virus has reached 213 and no signs that the number will not increase further. AFP PHOTO “Our greatest concern is the potential for the virus to spread to countries with weaker health systems,” WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said as the emergency was declared. “We must all act together now to limit further spread… We can only stop it together.” Tedros said travel and trade restrictions involving China were unnecessary. But, with the disease spreading to more than 20 nations, authorities, businesses and worried people around the world were taking matters into their own hands. Japan on Friday urged its citizens to avoid non-essential travel to China, following similar warnings by Germany, Britain and other nations in recent days. Those warnings are not as definitive as the US directive against all travel to China. Among the array of other extraordinary containment efforts, many major airlines this week suspended or reduced flights to China. Mongolia also halted cross-border traffic with its huge neighbor and Russia sealed its remote far-eastern frontier. Some countries banned entry for travelers from Wuhan, the city in central Hubei province where the virus first surfaced. Italy and Israel on Thursday barred all flight connections with China. Impoverished Papua New Guinea went so far as to bar all visitors from “Asian ports.” China said Friday it planned to send charter planes to bring back Hubei residents who are now abroad, citing the “practical difficulties” that they have encountered overseas. Those from Wuhan will be returned to their quarantined city, the foreign ministry said. The US reported its first case of person-to-person transmission of the virus on American soil — a man in Chicago who got it from his wife, who had travelled to Wuhan. In a sign of growing global fears, more than 6,000 tourists were temporarily confined aboard their cruise ship at an Italian port after two Chinese passengers fell ill. They later tested negative for the coronavirus. And a pilot union in the US sued American Airlines to demand it halt all flights to China. China has taken extreme steps to stop the spread of the virus, including effectively quarantining more than 50 million people in Wuhan and surrounding Hubei province. But the number of new deaths and cases continues to swell. AFP "

Piad,"THE stock market finished the week in the negative territory again — its worst so far this year — still reeling from the impact of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which continues to spread worldwide and claim more lives. The benchmark Philippine Stock Exchange index (PSEi) fell by 2.60 percent or 191.89 points to close at 7,200.79, while the wider All Shares dropped by 2.28 percent or 100.34 points to finish at 4,292.21. Friday’s index figure is worse than the 2019 low of 7,475.16 last May 16, and the lowest since the 7,221.23 recorded on Sept. 18, 2018. “Local shares ended with heavy losses as the death toll from the coronavirus in China rose and the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the virus outbreak ‘a public health emergency of international concern,’” Regina Capital Development Corp. head of sales Luis Limlingan said. After saying last week they needed more information, the WHO invoked the rarely used designation that experts hope would lead to better international coordination to combat the virus. The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-like disease, which first broke out in the city of Wuhan, in China’s Hubei province last December, already killed at least 200 people and left thousands more ill. China has locked down a swath of its centers, effectively quarantining millions of people in their cities and halting travel around the country. Airlines have begun cancelling or curtailing flights to and from China, and a number of governments are recommending citizens not to visit the East Asian country. On Thursday, the Department of Health reported that a 38-year-old female tourist from Wuhan, now quarantined in an unidentified hospital, had tested positive for the 2019-nCov, making her the country’s first confirmed case. “We may see it continue lower in the weeks to come as investors figure out what to do amid this catastrophe,” AAA Equities head of research Chris Mangun said. On Wall Street, markets were up. The Dow Jones, S&P 500 and Nasdaq rose by 0.44 percent, 0.31 percent and 0.26 percent, respectively. Asian markets mostly mirrored PSEi’s decline.

,"February 1, 2020",nCov,Global emergency on nCoV declared,Associated Press,"GENEVA: World Health Organization (WHO) Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the novel coronavirus outbreak has become a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). WHO’s declaration was made after fatalities from the virus reached 213 as of Friday noon. Speaking at a news conference after a closed-door meeting of the Emergency Committee, he said the WHO disfavors or even opposes imposing travel or trade restrictions on China. nCoV FATALITY An official in full protective suit checks on an elderly man, who collapsed and died on a street near a hospital in Wuhan on January 30, a day before the World Health Organization declared a global emergency amid rising cases of the new coronavirus. In China, nCoV cases have climbed to nearly 10,000 while the death toll reached 213 as of January 31. AFP PHOTO Under the International Health Regulations (IHR), the WHO director-general has the authority to determine that an outbreak constitutes a PHEIC when certain conditions are met. The designation is aimed at mobilizing more international resources to deal with the epidemic. Since the IHR entered into force in 2007, the WHO has made multiple PHEIC declarations. Ghebreyesus noted that Chinese President Xi Jinping personally commands and deploys the prevention and containment efforts. “The speed with which China detected the outbreak, isolated the virus, sequenced the genome and shared it with WHO and the world are very impressive, and beyond words. So is China’s commitment to transparency and to supporting other countries,” he said. “In many ways, China is actually setting a new standard for outbreak response,” he added. That reflects not only China’s high sense of responsibility for the lives and health of its own people, but also its strong support for global disease prevention and control, he said. Ghebreyesus said he believes that China will effectively contain and eventually defeat the epidemic, adding that China’s efforts to combat the disease deserve respect and appreciation, and are worth learning. In fact, many of the prevention and containment measures China has taken far exceed relevant requirements for dealing with emergencies, and the measures China has taken are good not only for that country but also for the rest of the world. Now the situation is still developing and more research is needed, and particularly countries with fragile health systems should enhance their responses, said the WHO chief. That is the main reason behind the PHEIC declaration, he said, adding that considering global health security, it is also a necessary step to achieve a scientific, rational and calm response based on evidence, and to help other countries take scientific, reasonable and appropriate measures to prevent the epidemic. Wu Zunyou, chief epidemiologist of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said the PHEIC declaration is a standard practice of the WHO. “China’s current prevention and control measures are the strictest and very effective. We are confident that we can effectively contain the epidemic and finally overcome it,” Wu said. AP "

The masks have disappeared from shelves in many stores, snapped up by people who want protection from the virus that is transmitted through respiratory droplets. Speaking to reporters at the National Press Club on Friday, Lopez also warned suppliers not to overprice their masks. MASKS IN SHORT SUPPLY A street outside medical stores in Sta. Cruz, Manila gets crowded as people line up to buy stocks of face masks for protection against the novel coronavirus on Friday, a day after the Department of Health confirmed the first case in the country. PHOTO BY RENE H. DILAN “Let’s not panic, in terms of supply. Because if we panic, stores could wind up running out of supplies. These stores are reordering the supplies. But they should also not raise prices, since the cost of production does not increase,” he said. He said surgical masks should be sold at only P8 each, while N95 masks should not be sell for more than P100. Lopez also allayed concerns that some Chinese suppliers were hoarding the masks. “There is nothing to worry about in hoarding. Because there is no reason for them (suppliers) to hoard, because their prices are just the same,” he said. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared a world health emergency as the 2019 novel Coronavirus acute respiratory disease, which started in Wuhan, China, last week has affected all of China and spread to other countries like the Philippines, the United States, Canada and in Europe. The situation has prompted President Rodrigo Duterte to ban travelers from Hubei province and other places in China, Malacañang said on Friday. In a statement, Palace spokesman Salvador Panelo said Health Secretary Francisco Duque 3rd recommended to Duterte denying entry to visitors from infected places in China. “It will last until the threat is over given that that the safety of our countrymen is foremost in the President’s mind,” Panelo said. The Department of Health (DoH) said the 38-year-old Chinese woman infected with the virus came from Wuhan, flew to Cebu from Hongkong via Cebu Pacific, then from Cebu to Dumaguete City before taking a Philippine Airlines flight to Manila. The woman is under isolation at the San Lazaro Hospital in Manila. On Friday, the DoH also announced it was adding an American and a Chinese national to its list of Patients Under Investigation (PUI) for the Wuhan virus. The DoH is monitoring 31 PUIs. Twenty-five of them are under medical confinement, and five have been discharged but under strict monitoring. Cebu Pacific on Friday said it has started contacting passengers who traveled on the same plane with the nCoV positive woman. “We are in the process of contacting passengers seated in the vicinity of the positive NCoV patient and are taking the necessary precautions to inform them so they can have themselves checked in case they show flu-like symptoms,” the airline said in a statement Friday. “The cabin crew and pilots on affected flights have also been informed and show no symptoms of illness,” it added. Sen. Christopher Lawrence “Bong” Go said the President scheduled a meeting next week with medical experts and key government officials to discuss measures to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus. “As part of our precautionary efforts, the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) has earlier stopped the issuance of visas-on-arrival to Chinese nationals. The DFA also eventually temporarily stopped the issuance of visas to travelers from Hubei province, altogether,” Go said. The chairman of the Senate health committee, Go said he would call a hearing on the matter on February 4. “Let us not panic, but at the same time, let us take the threat seriously and cooperate with authorities in order to ensure the safety of Filipinos,” he said. The Department of Education (DepEd) on Friday directed its officials in the virus-affected regions to cooperate with the DoH in tracing individuals who were in contact with and may have been exposed to the confirmed patient during her visit. DepEd said Secretary Leonor Briones has been in direct communication with Duque as well as the health officers in the affected regions and communities visited by the confirmed patient since Thursday night. DepEd said that tracking individuals who were in contact with the patient is “for the benefit not only of our schools and learners but of the communities as well.” The Maritime Industry Authority (Marina) has also mobilized, advising shipowners and operators to take necessary measures to monitor nCoV. The shipowners have been asked to report suspected nCoV cases, install necessary medical equipment, and equip officers and crew onboard ships with full information about the virus. At the Supreme Court, Chief Justice Diosdado Peralta called on all court personnel to observe the proper hand and respiratory hygiene, and safe food practices. “Court personnel are likewise encouraged to wear masks inside court rooms, halls of justice, and judiciary buildings, in the interest of everyone’s health,” Peral said in an advisory on the novel coronavirus for court personnel. Senate President Vicente Sotto 3rd said the travel ban ordered by the President should be for all nationalities. “Lahat ng nationalities (All the nationalities) coming from that area in China, in the meantime. If it gets worse, ban na all coming from countries with nCoV,” Sotto said. He said that even Filipinos who are in Wuhan should be covered by the ban, saying it’s safer for them to stay in lockdown there than come home and be discriminated upon by authorities and even their relatives.

,"February 1, 2020",nCov,Analysts see virus’ impact on economy as minimal,"Mayvelin U. Caraballo, TMT","Amid the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) scare in the country, private analysts have shared the view of the government’s economic managers that the outbreak would only have a minimal impact on Philippine economic growth. Maybank Kim Eng chief economist Suhaimi Ilias said the spread of the virus was likely only in the short term. But he added that an important factor at present “is the constant update[s] by relevant authorities [on] the cases and the measures that have been taken to contain it.” Robert Dan Roces, Security Bank Corp. assistant vice president and an economist, noted the incidence of 2019-nCoV in the country is well-contained “relative to the rest of the countries with infections.” The Department of Health earlier confirmed the first case of the virus in the Philippines, involving a 38-year-old Chinese woman who tested positive for the virus. Despite this case, Roces said the country’s tourism sector would be affected, including airline and other complementary industries. Analysts at ANZ Research said the Philippines was “likely to experience only slightly negative effects.” Ruben Carlo Asuncion, Union Bank of the Philippines chief economist, said tourism connected with the retail and service sectors; and trade, particularly exports, would be the two areas that will be hit by the effects of the 2019-nCoV outbreak. “If this outbreak delivers a severe, but temporary impact, like SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome), the economic impact on the Philippines is very likely to be very minimal,” he added. The Difference Group founder, Dan Steinbock, said it was a challenge to quantify the economic impact of the 2019-nCov on the Philippine economy at present. “The question is whether the government can manage this without overshooting,” he added. Citing Chinese authorities´ draconian measures against the outbreak as an example, Steinbock said he thinks that China is doing only what it can given the situation. The comments from the analysts were consistent with statements of Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez 3rd and Socioeconomic Planning Secretary Ernesto Pernia on Thursday night that the virus would have a short-term effect and would not trigger recession in the country. “I think it’s likely to just have a short-term impact because given the measures being done to minimize the Filipinos incurring the coronavirus, it shouldn’t take long for that to have an effect on the economy,” Pernia said. Dominguez said the public should appreciate China’s response to the outbreak to shorten the potential length and spread of the virus. “One thing we have to appreciate with the Chinese government [is]) they acted very swiftly on this round of these diseases and have been very proactive in the control of this disease. This is much better than what happened during the SARS and the MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus) outbreaks,” he added. The Finance chief said it is too early to tell the impact of the virus scare on the tourism sector, but added that “we’re not going into a recession because of this.” "

Chinese Ambassador to the Philippines Huang Xilian said before his return from China, he met with Xi, Minister of Health Ma Xiaowei and Minister of Foreign Affairs Wang Yi. Huang said Premier Li had also been to Wuhan, the city at the epicenter of the nCoV outbreak, to direct the response. HAND IN HAND Chinese Ambassador Huang Xilian shares updates on the current status of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)outbreak in his hometown. He also handed out N95 masks to members of the media after a news briefing held at the Ambassador’s residence in Makati City on Friday, a day after the Philippines recorded its first 2019-nCoV case.

The ambassador said Beijing was completely committed to transparency, both internally and externally. And they have agreed to work with other countries that need their support. He said Xi and Li agreed that the World Health Organization (WHO) would lead a team of international experts that would visit China to work with the government in learning more about the virus and guide global response efforts. He said there are 6,065 confirmed cases, including 5,997 in China, representing almost 99 percent of all cases worldwide. The outbreak has killed 132 people, all of them in China. Outside China, there are only 68 confirmed nCoV cases in 15 countries, and no deaths. The vast majority of cases outside China have a travel history to China or contact with someone with a travel history to China. There are signs of a few cases of human-to-human transmission outside China, which we are monitoring very closely, Xilian said. But as of Friday noon, the death toll of the nCoV has reached 213 and infected more than 7,700 in at least 22 countries and territories based on WHO figures. Beijing will fulfill its international obligations to address the concerns of the foreigners in the country and to protect their safety, he said. He said the Chinese Embassy in the Philippines was paying close attention to the condition of the Chinese woman in Manila who is the first nCoV case in the country. "
,"February 1, 2020",nCov,DoLE issues guidelines on virus-related absences,William B. Depasupil,"THE Department of Labor and Employment (DoLE) is encouraging employers and business establishments to be flexible and compassionate in granting additional leave with pay to workers who need to take a leave of absence because of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Labor Secretary Silvestre Bello 3rd on Friday issued an advisory setting the guidelines on nCov prevention and control at the workplace, which include provisions for leave of absence, hospital benefits and assistance to be provided by DoLE. “For workers who need to take a leave to take care of their children or parents afflicted or suspected of having 2019-nCoV, or choose to stay away from work on their own accord due to contact with a confirmed or suspected 2019-nCoV to avoid its transmission, employers are encouraged to adopt a flexible and enlightened approach in granting time-off which may include use of leave credits, if there is any,” Bello said. A worker’s leave of absence may be charged to his or her annual or vacation leave credits, depending on company policy or as stipulated in the collective bargaining agreement. Bello said employers could consider granting leave of absence without pay if the worker’s leave credits have been used up, adding “by mutual agreement, employers and workers could also agree on other arrangements for the worker’s leave of absence.” On healthcare benefits, Bello said workers and their dependents infected by the virus can avail of PhilHealth hospital benefits, and that those who contracted the disease in the performance of their duties are entitled to additional benefits under the Social Security System and employee’s compensation benefits under Presidential Decree 626 or the “Employees Compensation Law.” The Labor department also provides assistance to local and overseas Filipino workers in collaboration with the Department of Health, the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration, the Overseas Workers Welfare Administration and the International Labor Affairs Bureau. Employers were also directed to take precautionary measures in the workplace through updated information about the virus, including its transmission, disease outcome, and treatment options, and maintenance of proper hygiene like cleaning the work areas with disinfectant and make sure that water, soap and sanitizer are available in washrooms and toilets. In workplaces where workers could be at risk of infection such as health-care and other frontline services, the employer will take protective measures to avoid, correct or remove such imminent danger.

,"February 1, 2020",nCov,The dive is too deep,Peter Lundgreen,"A lot can be thought and said about the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan, but of course, the first would be sympathy for the people affected by it, one way or another. In this context, considerations in financial markets would quickly feel like a cool contrast to the consequences for the many hit by the virus. In financial markets, it is the cool rational considerations of the economic consequences of such an outbreak that applies — from China’s overall economy to a corporation in a country on the other side of the Earth. The impact of the virus also reminds us about how globalized the world is, as well as how big a market China itself has become, and the impact that the country can generate, even on the largest global companies. The first comments from a number of companies have begun to trickle in, with Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook saying production at the supplier Foxconn’s assembly plants was so far unaffected, but Apple couldn’t rule out an effect on earnings in the first quarter. On the contrary, car production in China is directly affected, as Wuhan has developed into a car manufacturing hub in the last three decades. Chinese car group Dongfeng is headquartered in that city, and foreign car brands, such as Honda, PSA Group and General Motors, produce cars in the area. Total car production in Wuhan and in the Hubei province represents 6 percent of China’s annual automobile output. Hubei has quite a few companies in the manufacturing sector, so I’m convinced that some Western companies are suddenly missing parts from suppliers based in the province. Other examples are Starbucks, which has closed more than half of its 4,300 outlets in China; IKEA, which has closed half of its stores there; and British Airways, which canceled all flights to the country for the next month. It is obvious that the outbreak already has direct consequences at the corporate level, and thus the impact has spread across all stock markets. Based on 2018 data, Hubei represents 4 percent of China’s overall economy. Its gross domestic product growth was at 6.6 percent. According to latest estimates, the population of Wuhan is approximately 7.5 million, making it China’s sixth largest city. The current situation is not only that Wuhan is closed to inbound and outbound traffic, but so are a number of other cities in Hubei. In total, approximately 40 million people in the province alone are affected by the coronavirus; they cannot move in and out of the cities where they live. These are quite significant measures to counteract the spread of the virus. If one imagines that this situation would continue for a while, or worsen, then it will certainly have an impact on Hubei’s economy. I estimate that China’s economy is currently growing by 6 percent a year and Hubei’s economic growth rate roughly follows China’s average. A serious situation in Hubei would probably mean that half of GDP growth would disappear in the first quarter, which would also have a negative effect on the surrounding provinces, where I judge that a similar sum of growth would disappear in case the gravity of the situation continues. If China’s total growth this year is expected to be 6 percent, then an unexpectedly serious situation in Hubei would mean that the country’s total GDP growth in 2020 would decrease from 6 to 5.94 percent, which is hardly measurable. Before Hubei’s direct impact becomes noticeable for China’s overall GDP growth this year, it is my assessment, that the province’s overall economy should be at a standstill for approximately 1.5 months, which is not realistic. Therefore, I argue that, right now, the stock market has priced in an excessive risk premium due to the coronavirus, in global consideration. In China, I understand the stock market fears that consumers would spend less due to the outbreak, so there are likely to be more sell orders when the market opens on February 3. Consumers in the rest of the world are also the backbone of the GDP growth at present, so private consumption is key for the global economic response to the coronavirus, but I do not believe the risk for a global consumption slump is relevant yet, and I still don’t worry if investors should sell the global stock market a handful of percent further down.

Li, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and head of a leading group of the CPC Central Committee on the prevention and control of the novel coronavirus outbreak, made the remarks while inspecting the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). He learned about the scientific research on epidemic prevention and control at the CDC and listened to opinions of medical experts. Disease control institutions should race against time to discover the source and transmission mechanism of the novel coronavirus, research on vaccine development, and provide technological support for improving diagnosis and treatment, said Li. Noting that the situation remains grim and complex, Li hoped the experts will strengthen research and evaluation on the trend of the epidemic, and discover new conditions of the disease to support targeted control of the pneumonia. While demanding the scientific distribution and use of preventive resources, Li also required transparent report of epidemic information. Stressing that the key to winning the battle against the epidemic is to improve the treatment effect and reduce the mortality, Li said vaccines and effective drugs are powerful remedies to the epidemic. Li called for joint research efforts of multidisciplinary experts to expedite the development of easy testing kits, vaccines and effective drugs to fight the novel coronavirus. He stressed reliance on scientific measures to overcome the epidemic. "

This, after the Department of Health (DoH) confirmed on Thursday the first case of the virus in the Philippines. In a statement, Palace spokesman Salvador Panelo said Health Secretary Francisco Duque 3rd recommended to Duterte the imposition of a travel ban on visitors coming from the said areas to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus. “Upon the recommendation of DoH Secretary Francisco Duque , the President has issued a travel ban to Chinese nationals coming from the Hubei province of China where the nCoV originated, as well in other places in China where there is a spread of the disease,” Panelo said. “It will last until the threat is over given that that the safety of our countrymen is foremost in the President’s mind,” he added. Panelo said the President also ordered the DoH “to commence the protocols it has prepared for such an eventuality to contain the disease and neutralize its transmission and spread.” “This raises a serious concern by the administration on the health and safety of our countrymen,” he said. According to Panelo, the Chinese woman afflicted with the dreadful illness came from Wuhan, flew to Hongkong, then to Cebu, then to Dumaguete and finally landed at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport. “She is presently confined at San Lazaro. Per DoH Secretary Duque, the patient is being treated and isolated,” Panelo said. “There is no way that she will transmit the disease to another person as the hospital personnel are protectively dressed and their mouths and noses covered with surgical masks plus their hands covered with globes,” he added. The Palace official then assured the public that every measure was being undertaken by the DoH “to contain the spread of the dreadful virus as well as monitoring and placing in quarantine those showing of symptoms of having nCov.” “We ask our countrymen to follow the advice of the DoH to observe personal hygiene as a preventive measure like regularly washing one’s hands and wearing wearing surgical asks in going around crowded areas,” Panelo said.

,"January 31, 2020",nCov,WHO declares global emergency over China virus,Associated Press,"THE ENEMY This illustration provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in January 2020 shows the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV). This virus was identified as the cause of an outbreak of respiratory illness first detected in Wuhan, China. (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention via AP) GENEVA: The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak sparked by a new virus in China that has spread to more than a dozen countries as a global emergency Thursday after the number of cases spiked more than tenfold in a week. The UN health agency defines an international emergency as an “extraordinary event” that constitutes a risk to other countries and requires a coordinated international response. China first informed WHO about cases of the new virus in late December. To date, China has reported more than 7,800 cases including 170 deaths. Eighteen other countries have since reported cases, as scientists race to understand how exactly the virus is spreading and how severe it is. Experts say there is significant evidence the virus is spreading among people in China and have noted with concern instances in other countries — including the United States, France, Japan, Germany, Canada, South Korea and Vietnam — where there have also been isolated cases of human-to-human transmission. Speaking to reporters in Geneva, WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus noted the worrisome spread of the virus between people outside China. “The main reason for this declaration is not because of what is happening in China but because of what is happening in other countries,” he said. “Our greatest concern is the potential for this virus to spread to countries with weaker health systems which are ill-prepared to deal with it.” “This declaration is not a vote of non-confidence in China,” he said. “On the contrary, WHO continues to have the confidence in China’s capacity to control the outbreak.” A declaration of a global emergency typically brings greater money and resources, but may also prompt nervous governments to restrict travel and trade to affected countries. The announcement also imposes more disease reporting requirements on countries. In the wake of numerous airlines cancelling flights to China and businesses including Starbucks and McDonald’s temporarily closing hundreds of shops, Tedros said WHO was not recommending limiting travel or trade to China. “There is no reason for measures that unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade,” he said. He added that Chinese President Xi Jinping had committed to help stop the spread of the virus beyond its borders. “During my discussion with the president and other officials, they’re willing to support countries with weaker health systems with whatever is possible,” Tedros said. On Thursday, France confirmed that a doctor who was in contact with a patient with the new virus later became infected himself. The doctor is now being treated in an isolated room at a Paris hospital. Outbreak specialists worry that the spread of new viruses from patients to health workers can signal the virus is becoming adapted to human transmission. China raised the death toll to 170 on Thursday and more countries reported infections, including some spread locally, as foreign evacuees from China’s worst-hit region returned home to medical tests and even isolation. Russia announced it was closing its 2,600-mile border with China, joining Mongolia and North Korea in barring crossings to guard against a new viral outbreak. It had been de facto closed because of the Lunar New Year holiday, but Russian authorities said the closure would be extended until March 1. Meanwhile, the United States and South Korea confirmed their first cases of person-to-person spread of the virus. The man in the US is married to a 60-year-old Chicago woman who got sick from the virus after she returned from a trip to Wuhan, the Chinese city that is the epicenter of the outbreak. The case in South Korea was a 56-year-old man who had contact with a patient who was diagnosed with the new virus earlier. Although scientists expect to see limited transmission of the virus between people with close contact, like within families, the instances of spread to people who may have had less exposure to the virus in Japan and Germany is worrying. In Japan, a man in his 60s caught the virus after working as a bus driver for two tour groups from Wuhan. In Germany, a man in his 30s was sickened after a Chinese colleague from Shanghai, whose parents had recently visited from Wuhan, came to his office for a business meeting. Four other workers later became infected. The woman had shown no symptoms of the virus until her flight back to China. “That’s the kind of transmission chain that we don’t want to see,” said Marion Koopmans, an infectious diseases specialist at Erasmus University Medical Center in the Netherlands and a member of WHO’s emergency committee. Koopmans said more information was needed about how the virus was spread in these instances and whether it meant the virus was more infectious than previously thought or if there was something unusual in those circumstances. Mark Harris, a professor of virology at Leeds University, said it appears that the spread of the virus among people is probably easier than initially presumed. “If transmission between humans was difficult, then the numbers would have plateaued,” he said. Harris said the limited amount of virus spread beyond China suggested the outbreak could still be contained, but that if people are spreading the disease before they show symptoms — as some Chinese politicians and researchers have suggested — that could compromise control efforts. The new virus has now infected more people in China than were sickened there during the 2002-2003 outbreak of SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, a cousin of the new virus. Both are from the coronavirus family, which also includes those that can cause the common cold. The latest figures for mainland China show an increase of 38 deaths and 1,737 cases for a total of 7,736 confirmed cases. Of the new deaths, 37 were in Hubei province, of which Wuhan is the capital, and one was in the southwestern province of Sichuan. Outside China, there are 82 infections in 18 countries, according to WHO. China extended its Lunar New Year holiday to Sunday to try to keep people home, but the wave of returning travelers could potentially cause the virus to spread further. China has been largely praised for a swift and effective response to the outbreak, although questions have been raised about the police suppression of what were early on considered mere rumors — a reflection of the one-party Communist state’s determination to maintain a monopoly on information in spite of smart phones and social media. That stands in stark contrast to the initial response to SARS, when medical reports were hidden as state secrets. The delayed response was blamed for allowing the disease to spread worldwide, killing around 800 people. Dr. Jeremy Farrar, director of Britain’s Wellcome Trust, welcomed WHO’s emergency declaration. “This virus has spread at unprecedented scale and speed, with cases passing between people in multiple countries across the world,” he said in a statement. “It is also a stark reminder of how vulnerable we are to epidemics of infectious diseases known and unknown.” AP "
,"January 31, 2020",nCov,It’s here: PH confirms first nCoV case,John Eric Mendoza,"HEALTH Secretary Francisco Duque 3rd on Thursday confirmed the country’s first case of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Duque said a 38-year-old woman from Wuhan, China was found to be infected with the 2019-nCoV after her test results arrived from the Victorian Infectious Disease Reference Laboratory in Melbourne, Australia. The woman, who at present does not show the outward symptoms of the virus, is quarantined in a hospital in Manila. “I assure the public that DoH (Department of Health) is on top of this evolving situation,” Duque said in a press briefing in Manila. “We are working closely with the hospital where the patient is admitted,” he added. The woman, who had a tourist visa, arrived from Wuhan via Hong Kong on January 21. She sought medical help after having coughs on January 25. Director for DoH’s Epidemiology Bureau Chito Avelino said the department had requested for information on the planes that the patient flew in and other pertinent details. What the Health department knows, so far,is that the woman had been to Cebu and Dumaguete City, Avelino said. There is a need to identify the people who sat close to the woman in the plane. Four passengers sat at the front the woman, four at the back, and four on either side. SOLD OUT A man stands near a signage announcing that masks are no longer available at a medical outlet in Manila. PHOTO BY RENE DILAN “Then we will contact them and advise them accordingly,” said Avelino. He also asked the owner of the establishments where the woman stayed to get in touch with the DoH. “We need to identify the employees that were in contact with the patient, so from there we could do the mandatory quarantine to serve them if they manifested any symptoms,” Avelino said. With the discovery of the nCoV patient, Duque recommended restrictions in travelling to China. He advised the public to remain vigilant, avoid crowded places and to wear face masks. “Let us continue to practice personal hygiene and adopt healthy lifestyles,” Duque said. Twenty-nine persons in the Philippines are suspected of being infected with the virus. Eighteen of them are in Metro Manila, four in Central Visayas, three in Western Visayas, and one each in Mimaropa, Eastern Visayas, Northern Mindanao and Davao. Remain calm Malacañang asked the public to remain calm. Secretary Martin Andanar of the Presidential Communications Operation Office gave assurances that the government is on top of the situation. “Relevant health, research and law enforcement agencies are working together to prevent the disease from spreading. DoH is in constant coordination and collaboration with health and research authorities in Australia, Japan and China on implementing necessary undertakings on the matter. In fact, with the help of our counterparts in Japan, we are now capable of detecting and diagnosing 2019-nCoV-infected patients on our own,” he said. The Palace official noted that the government also intensified “containment measures and the necessary precautionary measures are being taken to address this health concern.” “With the continuous inflow of travelers coming from affected areas in China, we will continue to conduct necessary stringent customs, immigration and quarantine measures to prevent the disease from spreading within the country,” Andanar said.
Monitoring The Philippine National Police (PNP) on Thursday said it would assist the DoH in monitoring major entry points in the country. PNP spokesman Brig. Gen. Bernard Banac bared that the PNP Health Service had set up a direct line of communication with DoH. The PNP’s Maritime Group and Aviation Security Group are also standing by to be mobilized “upon receipt of advisory or guidance from the DoH,” he said in a statement. In a related development, Transportation Secretary Arthur Tugade instructed maritime regulators to have stringent monitoring at all seaports, especially those that cruise ships frequent. Transportation Assistant Secretary for Communications Hope Libiran said Tugade issued the directive to the Philippine Ports Authority (PPA) and the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG).
Last Tuesday, the Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority barred cruise liners at the Subic Bay Freeport, on the request of Subic Mayor Jonathan John Khonghun. PCG Commandant Adm. Joel Garcia said he had alerted port state control officers to intensify maritime security in response to the viral outbreak.

The WHO called an urgent meeting for Thursday over whether the viral epidemic should be declared a global health emergency — a designation that can increase international coordination. MASKING UP Pedestrians wait on a sidewalk in Manila shortly after Health officials admitted that the novel coronavirus had reached the country. The announcement prompted a mad rush to drug stores, some of which ran out of protective masks. PHOTO BY RENE H. DILAN In Geneva, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the organization “deeply regrets” its reports last week that referred to the global risk of the outbreak as “moderate” instead of “high.” “I have decided to reconvene the International Health Regulations Emergency Committee on the new #coronavirus (2019-nCoV) tomorrow,” Tedros said on Twitter. Michael Ryan, head of the WHO Health Emergencies Program, told reporters that “the whole world needs to be on alert now. The whole world needs to take action.” Ryan said declaring an international health emergency could streamline the measures taken, stressing that 194 countries implementing unilateral policies was a “potential recipe for disaster.” Deadliest day China reported its biggest single-day jump in 2019-nCoV deaths on Thursday as global fears deepened with more infections confirmed overseas, including three Japanese evacuated from the outbreak’s epicenter. Governments, companies and people around the world were already escalating efforts to contain the illness, which is believed to have emerged from an animal market in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. Many governments have urged their citizens not to visit China, while some have banned entry for travelers from Wuhan. At least 22 countries have confirmed infections, with India and the Philippines reporting their first case on Thursday. Airlines began canceling flights servicing China on Wednesday, and more followed suit on Thursday. Russia said it was closing its far eastern border with China over the outbreak. Beijing has taken extraordinary steps to arrest the spread of the virus, including effectively quarantining more than 50 million people in Wuhan and surrounding Hubei province. The government on Thursday reported 38 new deaths in the preceding 24 hours, the highest one-day total since the virus was detected late last year. All but one of the new deaths were in Hubei. The number of confirmed new cases also grew steadily to 7,711, the National Health Commission said. Another 81,000 people were under observation for possible infection. Massive cities like Beijing and Shanghai were also eerily quiet as countless people followed advice to stay indoor or to at least wear masks when venturing out. Japan and the United States became the first countries to organize airlifts from Wuhan for their citizens. A second US flight is planned in coming days. Australia and New Zealand were among others organizing similar operations. Tokyo on Thursday reported that three people who were aboard the first evacuation flight had tested positive for the virus after landing back home. In one of the most dramatic measures, the tiny Pacific nation of Papua New Guinea announced that no travelers from Asia would be allowed in. "
,"January 31, 2020",nCov,Asian markets fall,Agence France-Presse,"HONG KONG: Asian markets fell on Thursday, with tech stocks and airlines among key losers as the World Health Organization called an urgent meeting on whether to declare a global health emergency over a virus, which has killed 170 people and infected more than 7,700. United States Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said the 2019 novel coronavirus posed a new risk to growth in China and elsewhere. In Asian stock markets, Taipei closed down 5.8 percent on the first day of trade since the Chinese New Year break with Eva Airways plunging 9.9 percent and market heavyweight and key Apple supplier Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing sliding 5 percent. Fellow Apple supplier Hon Hai Precision Industry fell by the daily limit 10 percent after it said most of its manufacturing plants in China would remain closed until February 10. The tech giant, better known as Foxconn, is the world’s biggest contract electronics maker and assembles Apple’s iPhones, as well as gadgets for other international brands. The move will likely impact global supply chains for tech companies that rely on the Taiwan firm to manufacture everything from iPhones to flatscreen televisions and laptops. Foxconn, which employs more than 1 million workers in China, accounts for the most US-bound exports by volume from Hubei province, which is at the epicenter of the virus outbreak. Tokyo closed down 1.7 percent and Hong Kong ended 2.6 percent lower. Japanese automaker Toyota said it would keep its plants in China closed until at least February 9 over concerns about the outbreak. Among other markets, Seoul slipped 1.7 percent, Singapore retreated 0.8 percent and Sydney was down 0.3 percent. European markets took their lead from the Asian losses, with London down 1.1 percent at the open, Frankfurt off 1.4 percent and Paris 1.5 percent lower. “Equity markets remain acutely vulnerable to adverse developments in the Wuhan virus situation,” said Oanda analyst Jeffrey Halley. Uncertainty The Fed held its policy interest rate steady on Wednesday, but was on alert for possible contagion to the domestic and global economies. “There will clearly be implications at least in the near term for Chinese output and I would guess for some of their close neighbors,” Powell told reporters following the Fed’s policy meeting. But “the situation is really in its early stages and it’s very uncertain about how far it will spread and what the macroeconomic effects will be,” he added. “We are very carefully monitoring the situation.” Oil fell following a higher-than-expected jump in US inventory, with Brent down 1.8 percent and the WTI contract off 1.7 percent.

Senators Ana Theresia “Risa” Hontiveros and Francis “Kiko” Pangilinan made the appeal after the Department of Health (DoH) confirmed the first case of nCoV in the Philippines. Senator Christopher Lawrence “Bong” Go said he would recommend to President Rodrigo Duterte such a ban. Hontiveros is proposing a temporary travel ban of at least 30 days. “Our travel ban must firmly include both air and sea travel to prevent a local outbreak. This includes a temporary ban on all cruise ships from docking at any of our ports,” she said. Hontiveros also urged the Bureau of Quarantine (BoQ) to place under mandatory quarantine individuals who have just arrived from China. “This temporary travel ban will give time for our health authorities to set in place all safeguards necessary in case there are more confirmation of the 2019-nCoV presence in the country from those under present surveillance,” she said. Pangilinan wants to “suspend all visas from Wuhan and other parts of China.” “What is the rule for the thousands of Chinese arrivals? Bar the entry of tourists from China while the outbreak is still there,” he said. “Visa upon arrival for the Chinese [visitors] had been suspended. But the tours, delegates, and businessmen, like cruise ships [from China] are still allowed [in the country]. All must be suspended,” Pangilinan said. “Let us fight coronavirus. Let us follow the recommendation of the World Health Organization,” Sen. Mary Grace Poe said. Sen. Richard Gordon said, “Now that the DoH has confirmed the first case for coronavirus in the country, let us all stay vigilant and alert.” “Let us be careful and vigilant. Protect yourself and your family,” Gordon said on Twitter.
Go agreed with the position of the DoH for travel restrictions on Chinese visitors entering the Philippines. He urged the Health department to implement quarantine procedures when necessary and providing regular advisories to guide the public. He said the government was ready to assist Filipinos in Wuhan who are willing to be flown home. The Foreign Affairs department said it had been closely coordinating with the Philippine consulate in Shanghai regarding the Filipinos in Wuhan. Two private charter corporations are willing to fly home Filipinos in Wuhan. Private planes or military planes may be utilized, depending on the final decision. The DFA clarified, however, that Filipinos outside Hubei province may still voluntarily return to the Philippines on their own if they wish to do so. Go said the Senate Committee on Health, which he heads, would hold a hearing on the coronavirus outbreak on February 4. He said that officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA), Department of Health (DOH), CAB and seaport and airport authorities have been invited to attend. Philippine-based carriers are leaving it up to China-bound passengers to take their flights or not. While they do not have direct flights to Wuhan—the Chinese city believed to be where the nCoV originated— Cebu Pacific, Philippines Airlines (PAL), and AirAsia Philippines are giving their flyers the option to refund, rebook, or reroute their trips. Representatives from Cebu Pacific and PAL said Thursday they were still assessing if they would reduce flights to China or close down the routes altogether. “[We] are reviewing our load and operational matters. So far, we’ve offered passengers booked on flights to/from mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau until February 29 the option to rebook, refund or travel fund the value of the ticket, free of charge — to which we’ve seen about 20 percent of total passengers booked avail of any one of these options,” Cebu Pacific spokesman Charo Logarta Lagamon said in a Viber message. Lagamon said Cebu Pacific flies 232 times weekly between the Philippines and Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Xiamen, Shenzen, Hong Kong and Macau, allocating 60,000 seats.
PAL spokesman Cielo Villaluna said in a phone interview the flag carrier had stopped charter flights between Kalibo and China, involving Nanjing, Hangzhou, and Shanghai destinations. Villaluna said PAL flights between Manila and the seven points in China — Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Xiamen, Jinjiang, Hong Kong and Macau — ”remain operational with protective measures in place.” “We continue to monitor developments, day-to-day, week-on-week,” she said. PAL has 69 flights a week to China, involving 18,165 seats, Villaluna said. Philippines AirAsia is also offering refund or rebooking to passengers who have booked flights to Canton, Shanghai, Shenzen, Hong Kong and Macau. WITH LISBET K. ESMAEL  "

Asian markets again fell on investors’ concerns about the economic impact of the SARS-like virus, which has killed at least 170 people as of Thursday. Airlines are either suspending or scaling back services in and out of the East Asian country after cases of human-to-human transmission outside the country were reported. Manufacturers were also cutting back their Chinese operations. The World Health Organization, which initially downplayed the severity of the disease, warned all governments to be “on alert” as it debated on whether to declare a global health emergency.

,"January 31, 2020",nCov,Macau-Lallo flights halted amid nCoV threat,"Leander C. Domingo, TMT","SANTA ANA, Cagayan: Officials of Cagayan Economic Zone Authority (Ceza) on Thursday ordered the suspension of all chartered flights from Macau and other parts of China to Lallo town where CEZA operates the Cagayan North International Airport (CNIA). Secretary Raul Lambino, Ceza administrator and chief executive officer, said the suspension of all Macau/China-Lallo flights was meant to prevent the spread of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) believed to have originated in Wuhan City, Hubei province in China. Lambino said the Philippine registered budget airline Royal Air Charter Service Inc. (Racsi) had been operating the Macau-Lallo route since August last year when the CNIA began its international chartered flights. RSCSI has been transporting mostly Chinese tourists bound for various resorts destinations in the coastal town of Santa Ana. On Wednesdays and Sundays, it also operates a commercial domestic flight between Lallo and Clark, Pampanga. “We have already informed the charterer of Royal Air to suspend its operations until further notice. We cannot simply put to risk the lives of our people in the wake of a global concern against the spread of this deadly disease,” Lambino, also the presidential adviser for Northern Luzon, said. The CNIA is a joint venture enterprise of Ceza with the Cagayan Premium Ventures Development Corp. Lambino said this was Ceza’s effort to attract more foreign tourists to visit several tourism spots in Santa Ana, including the world famous Palaui Island. "
,"January 31, 2020",nCov,Major progress vs virus expected February 8,The Manila Times,"BEIJING: China’s relentless battle against the spreading novel coronavirus outbreak is likely to make marked progress by February 8, Zeng Guang, chief epidemiologist of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, told Global Times Editor-in-Chief Hu Xijin in an
exclusive interview on Wednesday. Considered to have the longest incubation period of 14 days, the deadly virus has pushed China to swing into a national campaign to contain the disease. Wuhan, Hubei Province, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak, implemented a lockdown on Thursday, which very much helped to contain further spread of the virus, Zeng said. While some experts and observers raised concerns over delayed response of the local Wuhan authorities to the virus outbreak, Zeng noted the Wuhan government’s slow action in the initial stage of the epidemic was due to their “lack of scientific recognition” of the deadly virus and “probably some executive issues.” “Nothing will make sense if the scientific standpoint was wrong,” he said. Lack of information and sudden announcement of the city’s lockdown have also sparked heated online discussion triggering panic among the public. Information surfaced online also claimed local authorities detained eight people for spreading the Wuhan pneumonia, considered to be as serious as the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Local authorities in Wuhan and Hubei are under tremendous pressure for not disclosing sufficient public information promptly, in addition to a serious lack of preparedness ahead of the city’s lockdown.

,"January 31, 2020",nCov,Church imposes measure to curb virus spread,"William Depasupil, TMT","The threat posed by the 2019 novel coronavirus has prompted the Catholic Church to lay down measures to prevent the spread of the virus. The Catholic Bishops’ Conference of the Philippines (CBCP) said communion would be received by hand. In a circular to all the dioceses, Fr. Marvin Mejia, CBCP secretary general, said measures are needed to “prevent the acquisition and spread of the disease.” “The communion in the hand [must] be practiced ordinarily to help prevent further fear from people who are reasonably cautious about this matter,” he added. Mejia said other forms of close contact like holding hands during the praying of “Our
Father” and shaking hands during the “sign of peace” would be discouraged. The CBCP urged parish churches to change regularly the holy water vestibules and install “protective cloth” on the grills of confessionals. The CBCP has also released an “Oratio Imperata” for the people who are sick because of the virus and for the prevention of a global outbreak. “We pray for your grace for the people tasked with studying the nature and cause of this virus and its disease and of stemming the tide of its transmission,” part of the prayer read. “Guide the hands and minds of medical experts that they may minister to the sick with competence and compassion, and of those governments and private agencies that must find cure and solution to this epidemic,” it added. The prayer will be recited in all weekdays and Sunday Masses starting February 2. "
