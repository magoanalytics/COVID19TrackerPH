MANILA, Philippines – Philippine Airlines (PAL) terminated some 300 employees, as the company incurs losses primarily due to the travel bans caused by the novel coronavirus.
""The streamlining will strengthen the company in the wake of losses sustained in 2019, aggravated by the ongoing travel restrictions and flight suspensions to areas affected by COVID-19,"" PAL said on Friday, February 28, referring to the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.
The airline said that it implemented a ""voluntary separation initiative"" for long-serving employees and a retrenchment process on Friday.
PAL said that affected employees will receive ""appropriate separation benefits,"" as well as trip pass privileges.
Affected employees will also get career counseling and outplacement support.
""PAL continues to be focused on managing the risks related to the COVID-19 situation, in the interest of public health and safety,"" it said.
Parent firm PAL Holdings earlier told the Philippine Stock Exchange that it registered a total comprehensive loss of over P3 billion in the 1st semester of 2019, a sharp 355% increase from the total loss of P661.6 million during the same period in 2018.
PAL reported consolidated expenses amounting to P77.75 billion in the six-month period of 2019, 3.3% higher than the previous year's total of P75.27 billion.
The novel coronavirus that originated from Wuhan, China, has so far killed over 2,800 and sickened over 83,700 people across the country and worldwide. The World Health Organization already declared an international emergency over the virus.
As of Friday, the Philippines has recorded 3 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus, all of them Chinese. One died, while the other two recovered.
The DOH has also probed 621 patients in the Philippines for possible infection. Of this number, only 30 remain admitted to heath facilities nationwide, while 588 have been discharged. – Rappler.com

The World Health Organization earlier declared the outbreak an international emergency, warning that the novel coronavirus poses a ""very grave threat.""

Photo by Anthony Wallace / AFP 
MANILA, Philippines – The Philippine government is eyeing the repatriation of Filipinos in Macau, Health Assistant Secretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said on Friday, February 28.
Vergeire said in a news briefing that the Inter-agency Task Force (IATF) met to discuss the plan and were reaching out to the Macau government for the repatriation process.
The IATF is also discussing logistical matters, such as what kind of carrier the repatriates would be brought in, if they would travel by air or sea.
Vergeire said that the final decision may be reached after the IATF meeting this weekend.
Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles, an ex-officio member of the IATF, said in a news brieing earlier this week that at least 200 Filipinos in Macau have signified their desire to be repatriated.
Unlike the repatriates from Wuhan, China; and the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan, the DOH said that repatriates from Macau and other countries would not be brought to the New Clark City (NCC) in Capas, Tarlac, for quarantine.
Vergeire said that the Diamond Princess repatriates had a ""special situation,"" because the transmission dynamics are unique on the ship. Since it is a contained place, it is difficult to determine the circumstances of the people on board, so the Philippine government quarantined them in New Clark City where they could be closely monitored.
Since the possible repatriates from Macau were not subject to the same situation, the DOH would only consider them as persons-under-monitoring, subject to home-based quarantine. Vergeire noted that they would be strictly monitored.
The first batch of 49 Filipino repatriates from Hubei province were quarantined in NCC and discharged on February 21.
Four days later, 445 repatriates from the Diamond Princess were brought to NCC. The DOH reported that a total of 5 exhibited symptoms, although two had already tested negative for COVID-19. Three were still awaiting results. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – The Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) is investigating a foreign cargo vessel for allegedly violating the Philippines’ 14-day quarantine rule amid the novel coronavirus outbreak.
PCG Spokesperson Commodore Armand Balilio said that PCG Commandant Admiral Joel Garcia ordered the investigation of the Panama-flagged MV Harmony 6, which arrived at Poro Point in La Union on February 23.
Captain Luu Van Loi, MV Harmony 6 skipper, declared to Philippine authorities on February 23 that the ship left China on February 10, apparently to skirt the 14-day quarantine strictly implemented on ships coming from China and other areas with the coronavirus outbreak. 
The PCG said that based on the initial report, the MV Harmony 6 arrived in Changzhou, China, on February 13 and left that country on February 18. 
“Scheduled to have its next port call at the Port of Poro Point in La Union, Philippines, the crew of the vessel allegedly turned off its Automatic Identification System (AIS) from 19 February 2020 until its arrival in Philippine waters on 23 February 2020,” the PCG said.
The MV Harmony 6 was placed under temporary detention at the anchorage area pending PCG investigation.
“PCG will coordinate with BOQ to identify possible criminal charges if MV Harmony 6 will be found guilty of mentioned violations,” the PCG said.
Under the rule, foreign vessels that came from any country with reported COVID-19 cases should observe a 14-day period from its date of departure to its arrival in Philippines waters, before the Bureau of Quarantine (BOQ) conducts a health inspection on its crew. This is a requirement for the issuance of port clearance.
“However, due to the Captain’s misrepresentation of its date of departure from China, the BOQ team boarded the vessel to conduct the health inspection among its 18 Vietnamese and 5 Indian crew in just 6 days, instead of the required 14-day quarantine period,” the PCG said.
Fortunately, the PCG Command Center, with the help of the National Coast Watch Center (NCWC), managed to alert La Union port authorities about the altered date of departure on February 24, a few hours after the health inspection.
The Philippines has imposed a partial travel ban on China and its administrative regions Hong Kong and Macau to help prevent the spread of COVID-19. 
As of  Friday, the COVID-19 death toll in mainland China stands at 2,788, while there are 78,824 people infected with the virus there. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – The Department of Health (DOH) confirmed on Friday, February 28, that two more repatriates from the coronavirus-hit Diamond Princess cruise ship docked in Japan showed flu-like symptoms.
This brings the number of symptomatic repatriates to 5. Three, not feverish, were reported to exhibit symptoms on Thursday, February 27. However, the DOH announced that 2 of them had already tested negative for the coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The remaining 3 are awaiting results. 
The two new persons under investigation were brought to a referral health facility due to sore throat. Their specimens were collected and sent for testing at the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine.
“While we are still waiting for the other test results, we assure the public that our referral hospitals are well-equipped and prepared to handle COVID-19 cases once they arise. Our health response team at the quarantine facility is being extra cautious to prevent further health risks,” said Health Secretary Francisco Duque III.
Of the 538 Filipinos who were previously quarantined on the cruise ship docked in Yokohama, a total of 445 were repatriated late Tuesday night, February 25. They went through several layers of screening before, during, and after the flight to ensure they were asymptomatic and coronavirus-free.
All the Filipino repatriates from Diamond Princess are subject to another 14 days of quarantine from their arrival in New Clark City.
Eighty Filipino crew members have so far tested positive for COVID-19. These confirmed cases were left behind in hospitals in Japan. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – The World Health Organization (WHO) has cited 9 countries, including the Philippines, that show that the spread of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)  ""can be contained"" after these nations recorded no new positive cases in the past two weeks. 
“The key message that should give all countries hope, courage and confidence is that this virus can be contained. Indeed, there are many countries that have done exactly that,” WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a press briefing on Wednesday, February 26.
“Fourteen countries that have had cases have not reported a case for more than a week, and even more importantly, 9 countries have not reported a case for more than two weeks: Belgium, Cambodia, Finland, India, Nepal, Philippines, the Russian Federation, Sri Lanka, and Sweden,” he added. 
Still, the WHO Director-General clarified that this did not mean that new COVID-19 cases “may not came to these countries, but the cases that made it before have been contained.” 
COVID-19 is the name of the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.
The Philippines has so far recorded 3 confirmed COVID-19 cases, all Chinese travelers  from Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, who came to the Philippines in late January.  
Since then, the country has not reported any new confirmed cases, and no local transmission of the virus as of Friday, February 28.
The Department of Helath (DOH) is probing a total of 621 patients for possible infection, but only 30 remain admitted in hospitals nationwide. The other 588 patients under investigation have already been discharged. 
DOH Secretary Francisco Duque III told Rappler on Friday, February 28, that even with the WHO update served as ""inspiration"" for the Philippine government to remain vigilant in handling the COVID-19 threat.
“This should not be a reason for us to be complacent nor should we put our guards down. We should use this as inspiration to do better [in terms of containing COVID-19],” Duque said in a phone interview. 
A total of 442 Filipinos repatriated from the Diamond Princess  cruise ship earlier this week were on a 14-day quarantine at the New Clark City in Capas, Tarlac.
Another 3 repatriates started showing flu-like symptoms on Thursday, February 27, and were transferred to a hospital outside the quarantine center for further observation. – Rappler.com  "

MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – The Philippines is looking at banning travel to Japan, Italy, and Iran in light of the increasing cases of the novel coronavirus in the 3 countries, Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles said on Friday, February 28. 
In an interview with CNN Philippines, Nograles said that the country's task force is constantly assessing the situations in the 3 countries. ""Ayaw ko pangunahan (I don't want to preempt anything), but obviously the task force is looking at these countries as well,"" said Nograles.
He mentioned the importance of checking the situation in Iran, due to the large volume of Filipinos situated there.
""Hindi natin puwedeng balewalain ang Iran because we still have Filipinos in Iran – more than a thousand na mga kababayan natin ang naninirahan po diyan sa Iran. So tinitingnan din po namin iyan,"" he said. (We cannot brush off Iran because we still have Filipinos in Iran – more than a thousand of our countrymen live there. So we're taking a look at it too.)
The New York Times reported that the number of infections in Iran and Italy doubled in just two days, approaching 900 combined. Seventeen people in Italy died as of Friday, while 26 in Iran died as of Thursday.
Japan lists 214 cases with 4 deaths nationwide. In Yokohama, 538 Filipinos were previously quarantined aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship. Some 445 have been repatriated, while others who were symptomatic or contracted the COVID-19 disease stayed behind.
On Thursday, February 27, the Philippine government banned travel of Filipino tourists to South Korea, and also restricted travelers coming from its North Gyeongsang province. 
Travel ban criteria
In a February 28 press conference, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III enumerated the criteria for the inclusion of countries in travel bans. He said there are 4 factors to consider:

Presence of local transmission in the country proposed to be covered by the ban
Volume of travelers coming into the country
Context and threat based on international health regulations
Health expenditure per capita 

Duque also said they look into a particular country's entry restrictions on people traveling from China. If that country has no full restrictions from travelers from China, then that puts the country at a higher risk. 
The Inter-agency Task Force consider these in deciding if a travel ban would be partial or total. – Rappler.com "

File photo by Valerie Escalera/Presidential Photo 
MANILA, Philippines – House Minority Leader Bienvenido Abante Jr – who was supposed to have an official trip to Saudi Arabia – was barred from entering due to a temporary travel ban imposed on Filipino travelers due to the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) scare. 
But it seems the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) was not aware of the travel restrictions on the Philippines, as Assistant Secretary Eduardo Meñez said they are still getting the “exact details” on the ban as of Friday morning, February 28. 
“We are confirming the exact details of KSA acting’s on COVID restrictions. Thank you for this information about Cong Abante,” Meñez said in a text message to Rappler. 
Saudi Arabia has already banned pilgrims from visiting Islam's holiest sites there in attempt to contain the spread of COVID-19, the disease caused by 2019-nCoV.
According to Abante, he was scheduled speak to several overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) organizations in Jeddah, Saudia Arabia regarding the proposed Department of OFWs. 
He boarded an Emirates flight from the Philippines bound for Saudi Arabia on Wednesday, February 26, with a layover in Dubai. From there, he was supposed to take a connecting flight to Jeddah on Thursday, February 27.
While in Dubai, however, Abante’s airline informed him that he will no longer be allowed to enter Saudi Arabia because its government already barred Filipino tourists from entering due to the 2019-nCoV.  
But Abante thought he would still be able to travel since he had a diplomatic passport with him and was on an official House trip. 
“On Thursday, February 27, I was in Dubai and en route to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia on an official trip when I was informed by our airline that I would not be allowed to board my connecting flight to Jeddah due to sguidelines issued by the Saudi government prohibiting the entry of Filipino nationals possessing tourist visas,” Abante said in a statement.  
“While I am aware that these travel restrictions are in place to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 virus, to my knowledge government functionaries on official trips are not covered by this ban – including myself, as I am a government official traveling with a diplomatic passport and a travel authority issued by the House of Representatives,” he added. 
In the end, Abante was forced to just stay in Dubai for now and is expected to fly back to Manila over the weekend. 
Still, the Manila 6th District congressman understands the precautionary measures that had to be taken by Saudi Arabia to help prevent the spread of COVID-19. 
“Be that as it may, given the threats posed by the COVID-19 outbreak, I understand and respect the precautions being undertaken by governments worldwide to protect their populations from this disease, and trust that our Department of Foreign Affairs will work to clarify matters regarding this unfortunate misunderstanding,” Abante said.  
As of Friday, the Philippines has recorded no local transmission of 2019-nCoV. The 3 confirmed cases recorded in the country were all Chinese nationals, one of whom died while the other two recovered from their symptoms. 
To date, the Department of Health is probing a total of 621 patients for possible infection, but only 30 remain admitted in hospitals nationwide.

The disembarkation of about 240 crew members, including many foreign nationals, is expected to last several days, according to the Japan health ministry.
They will stay at the National Tax College in Wako, Saitama Prefecture, near Tokyo for further monitoring by doctors, and can leave the facility only after testing negative for the virus, the ministry said.

Since the outbreak, which has resulted in 3 confirmed cases and one death in the Philippines, churches have also discouraged worshippers from holding hands during mass.

She was among thousands of people, some wearing surgical masks, who lined up at Baclaran church in Manila for services on Wednesday.
Ash Wednesday marks the beginning of Lent, the run-up to Easter, and includes Catholics having crosses drawn in ash on their foreheads.
The Philippines is overwhelmingly Catholic, with some 80% of its people said to be believers. Its unique brand of the religion also includes gruesome annual re-enactments of the crucifixion of Jesus Christ.
Local church officials have also ""strongly recommended"" that Catholics do not kiss or touch the cross during Good Friday services, which is usually common practice.

MANILA, Philippines – Philippine health officials have stopped tracking down other people who came into contact with the 3 Chinese visitors who tested positive for the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) while in the country in late January.  In a press conference on Wednesday, February 26, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said there would be no more contact tracing efforts in relation to the 3 cases because the 14-day incubation period for 2019-nCoV had long passed, and there were no other confirmed cases being reported so far.
Duque made the statement in response when asked whether the rest of the people who came into contact with the 3 confirmed cases were still the subject of contact tracing. During the briefing, it was learned that the Department of Health managed to trace 67% of these people so far.
Asked if the DOH was still looking for the other people that the 3 Chinese travelers had come into contact with while in the country, Duque said: “Wala na, kasi lampas na lampas ang incubation period natin.... There is no indication of the group or groups that might have been exposed to the 3 Chinese nationals, mukhang walang indication na nagkasakit sila. Kasi kung nagkasakit sila ay dapat nakita na ‘yan sa mga ospital natin,” said Duque.  
(There will be no contact tracing for now because it’s way, way past the incubation period.... There is no indication that the groups that might have been exposed to the 3 Chinese nationals got sick. Because if they did, then our hospitals would have found out already.) 
The DOH chief said the government would instead focus its efforts on strengthening the capacities of health facilities nationwide to prevent the spread of COVID-19 – the disease caused by the novel coronavirus – should another patient test positive for it.
“So doon na lang...level ng gamutan, doon na lang dapat ibuhos ang dapat ang lahat ng dapat isagawa ng DOH (So on the level of treatment, that’s where the DOH should focus its efforts),” Duque said.  
The Philippines has so far recorded 3 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus, all of them Chinese who arrived in the Philippines in January. One died, while the other two recovered. 
The Philippine government came under fire during a Senate hearing on February 4, after it was revealed that there was an apparent lack of communication between the DOH, the Civil Aeronautics Board, and the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines on contact tracing for possible COVID-19 cases.
As of 5 pm on Wednesday, there were 614 patients under investigation (PUIs) in the Philippines for possible 2019-nCoV infection. Of this number, 101 remained in health facilities across the country, while the other 510 were already discharged.

There are at least 84 Filipinos confirmed to have the virus, but all are based outside the Philippines, including two in the United Arab Emirates, one in Hong Kong, one in Singapore, and 80 who were aboard a cruise ship quarantined in Japan.
The World Health Organization earlier declared the outbreak an international emergency, warning that the novel coronavirus poses a ""very grave threat.""
So far, the virus has killed 2,715 and infected more than 77,000 people in China. Cases have been recorded in at least 33 countries. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – The Philippine Stock Exchange index (PSEi) dipped to 6,909 on Wednesday, February 26, its lowest level in more than a year, as the novel coronavirus continued to spread fear among investors.
The PSEi lost 277 points or almost 4% and went as low as 6,879 within the trading day. This is its weakest since November 13, 2018, when it closed at 6,843.
This is also the biggest 1-day percentage drop since January 11, 2016, when it fell by 4.4%.
In an email to Rappler, the PSE said the index lost a staggering P401.5 billion in market value.
All sub-indices were in the red, with industrial and property leading the decline.
The most actively traded companies were Ayala Land (down 6.6%), BDO (down 4.4%), SM Prime (down 2%), SM Investments (down 2.5%), and Jollibee (down 5.7%).
Luis Limlingan of Regina Capital said Philippine shares stumbled as more companies abroad indicated earnings would be affected from the spread of the novel coronavirus.
Limlingan said the next support level is at 6,800. If it breaks that level, the next support would be at 6,600.
A support is a price level where the decline in stock prices is expected to pause as investors start buying the losing shares. As prices drop, demand for the stock increases or stabilizes.
Ayala's Integrated Micro Electronics, which was down by over 8%, has temporarily closed its factories in China due to the outbreak.
SM Malls president Steven Tan said in an ANC interview that their malls in China are like ""ghost towns.""
Fast-food giant Jollibee has temporarily closed 14 of its Yonghe King stores in the Chinese province of Hubei. Wuhan City, the epicenter of the outbreak, is in Hubei.
There were 184 decliners and 27 advancers on Wednesday, while 30 remained unchanged.
Foreign buying stood at P4.47 billion, while foreign selling was at P7.56 billion. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines (3rd UPDATE) – The Philippines on Wednesday, February 26, temporarily prohibited Filipino tourists from traveling to South Korea due to the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) scare.
The Philippine government also banned the the entry of travelers from South Korea’s North Gyeongsang province, which has been grappling with an outbreak of COVID-19, the disease cuased by the novel coronavirus.
“Any travel to South Korea will be temporarily suspended,” Department of Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said in a press conference but added groups of people not covered by the ban.
Duque said permanent residents, overseas Filipino workers with jobs in South Korea, and students based in that country will still be allowed to travel to South Korea, subject to proper precautionary measures.  
Before proceeding to South Korea, those who are not covered by the travel ban will be required to sign a declaration that they know and understand the risks involved in traveling to South Korea.
As of 3:40 pm on Wednesday, South Korea recorded the highest number of 2019-nCoV cases outside mainland China at 1,146. Of this number, 12 died while 22 had recovered from COVID-19.
In the case of the ban on the entry of travelers from North Gyeongsang province, Duque clarified that ""Filipinos and their foreign spouses and children, and holders of permanent resident and diplomatic visas will be allowed entry subject to exiting screening and quarantine protocols.""
Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles said the inter-agency task force decided to impose only a partial travel ban on those arriving from North Gyeongsang because the South Korean government gave its assurance that it will be able to isolate the 2019-nCoV cases there.
""There's an assurance from the South Korean government that they'll be able to contain 'yong problema at isolated, most of the cases are isolated in these two areas, meaning to say mostly Daegu City and Cheongdo county. But in-expand na rin natin [ang travel ban] sa buong province of North Gyeongsang,"" Nograles said.
(There's an assurance from the South Korean government that they'll be able to contain the problem and most of the cases are isolated in these two areas, meaning to say mostly Daegu City and Cheongdo county. But we decided to expand the travel ban to the entire province of North Gyeongsang.
Presidential Spokesperson Salvador Panelo said in a news briefing on Wednesday that the government body on top of COVID-19-related measures would determine the need for an expanded South Korea travel ban.
“The Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases shall conduct a risk assessment of the situation in the aforesaid country within 48 hours to analyze whether it is necessary to expand the travel ban” to cover other parts of South Korea, Panelo said, adding that “strict protocols” will be observed on travelers arriving from areas not covered by the ban.
South Korea is the Philippines' number one source of foreign tourists, followed by China. Earlier this month, the Philippine government imposed a travel ban on travelers from China, Macau, and Hong Kong over the COVID-19 outbreak.
Big question
A big question, however, is how authorities in either country would be able to distinguish travelers who have been to North Gyeongsang, from those who have not. Most flights coming into the Philippines from South Korea take off from Busan, Incheon, or Jeju, with passengers from different areas.
“Hindi ko alam kung paano ang kanilang protocol doon (I don’t know about their protocol there). I will ask them how. Siguro (Maybe) in cooperation with the Korean government because…they’re also trying very hard to contain the spread of the virus so magkakaroon siguro sila ng coordination (they’ will probably have coordination),” Panelo replied.
South Korea has reported more than 1,100 confirmed cases of COVID-19 – the name of the disease  the novel coronavirus, the largest number of infections outside China. There have been 11 deaths from the disease in the country.
The vast majority – 90% – of the recent infections were in Daegu, South Korea’s fourth-largest city and the epicenter of the outbreak, and the neighboring province of North Gyeongsang, Agence France-Presse reported.
In the Philippines, health officials have probed 610 patients for the virus. There had been 3 confirmed cases of infection – all Chinese tourists – of whom one died and two recovered.
A total of 84 Filipinos have contracted the virus outside the Philippines – two in the United Arab Emirates, one in Hong Kong, one in Singapore, and 80 who were onboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan. – Rappler.com "

Before disembarking the plane, the Filipinos were first assessed for possible symptoms of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. They will undergo another health assessment upon arrival at New Clark City.
The Department of Health (DOH) said only those who will show no signs of COVID-19 will be asked to stay at the Athletes' Village for their 14-day quarantine period.
Should a repatriate show signs of the new disease, he or she will be immediately brought to a hospital and isolated from other patients for further observation.
As of Tuesday, a total of 80 Filipinos caught the novel coronavirus while aboard the Diamond Princess, which had been in quarantine since February 4 at the port of Yokohama in Japan following the spread of the virus among the ship's crew and passengers. Ten of them have since recovered and been discharged.
None of these 80 positive cases, however, were included in the Philippine government's repatriation program for now.
There were a total of 3,700 people onboard the ship, including 531 Filipino crew members and 7 Filipino passengers. 
As of Tuesday, the Philippines has recorded 3 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus, all of them Chinese. One died, while the other two recovered.
The DOH has also probed 610 patients in the Philippines for possible infection. Of this number, only 98 remain admitted to heath facilities nationwide, while 509 have been discharged. – with reports from JC Gotinga/Rappler.com  "

MANILA, Philippines – Filipino tracksters continue to gear up for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics despite the threat of the novel coronavirus outbreak.
Pole vaulter EJ Obiena, the first Filipino to qualify for Tokyo, has been mapping out his preparation plans with Ukrainian coach Vitali Petrov which center around competing and training in California, USA and Europe. 
Obiena, who cleared 5.8 meters to punch his Olympic ticket, was slated to see action in the Asian Indoor Championships and the World Indoor Championships in China in March but both events were postponed. 
World Athletics, formerly known as the IAAF, decided to call off both championships due the coronavirus outbreak. 
Obiena and Petrov will unveil their new plans on February 25.
Like Obiena, three-time SEA Games 400m hurdles gold medalist Eric Cray was forced to tweak his plans following the postponement of the events in China and he instead competed in two indoor meets in New Mexico, USA. 
He can make the Olympics by meeting the qualifying standard of 48.8 seconds or by being ranked in the world's top 50 by the end of the qualifying date on June 29.
Cray will be suiting up in several top-notch competitions in the USA in the next 4 or 5 months.
Meanwhile, William Morrison achieved a distance of 20.21 meters in shotput in a meet in Indiana, USA earlier February – a mark that compares favorably with the qualifying standard of 21.1 meters.
In a conversation with Philippine Athletics Track and Field Association president Philip Ella Juico, Morrison expressed confidence in meeting the qualifying standard ""with a lot of hard work and technical adjustments.""
Kristina Knott, who lorded over the 200m sprint in the 2019 SEA Games, was also affected by the cancellation of the events in China. 
The Florida-based runner will compete in the Texas relays before she moves to Orlando and train there until the rest of the outdoor races are confirmed for April and beyond.
Knott will then have stops in San Antonio and Austin in Texas and in Japan and Italy. 
Pole vaulter Natalie Uy, the 2019 SEA games gold medalist and a 2019 Asian Championship bronze medalist, recently set a new Philippine indoor record of 4.25 m. 
Uy participated in the Pole Vault Summit in Nevada and will play in several outdoor events in the months to come. 
Christine Hallasgo, who emerged as the surprise marathon gold medalist in the 2019 SEA Games, proved her victory was no fluke by winning the MILO National Marathon this month in Tarlac City. 
Meanwhile, the rest of the 50-string PATAFA national pool are preparing for regional meets, national championships, and the Philippine National Athletics Championships. – Rappler.com "

SINGAPORE – The Singaporean Ministry of Health (MOH) said the first Filipino novel coronavirus patient is now in stable condition as of Monday, February 24.
His identity remains anonymous due to Singapore's privacy laws.
""We have verified with the MOH that the patient is in stable condition in the hospital,"" said Philippine Ambassador to Singapore Joseph Yap in a media briefing Monday afternoon, February 24.
Yap said the Singapore government has not disclosed the identity of the Filipino. The most that Singapore has relayed to the Philippine embassy is that the Filipino is a male 41-year-old permanent resident of the city-state. The patient does not have a recent travel history to China.
Yap also confirmed that the Filipino is Singapore's Case 89 of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.
The MOH provided information about Case 89 in its novel coronavirus bulletin on Sunday, February 23. Below is an excerpt from the MOH bulletin, as quoted verbatim:
6. Case 89 is a 41 year-old male Singapore Permanent Resident who has no recent travel history to China. He is currently warded in an isolation room at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID).
7. He reported onset of symptoms on 3 February and had sought treatment at two general practitioner (GP) clinics on 3 February, 7 February, 10 February, 17 February and 21 February. He was referred to NCID on 21 February, and subsequent test results confirmed COVID-19 infection on 22 February morning.
8. Prior to hospital admission, he had gone to work at Affinity Equity Partners (S) Pte Ltd (8 Temasek Boulevard) and visited Bishan Community Club (51 Bishan Street 13). He stays at Serangoon Avenue 3.
Travel ban not recommended
Yap said that despite Case 89, he is not recommending travel restrictions against Singapore because the novel coronavirus situation here is improving. Earlier, Philippine Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr also said he is opposing a travel ban to Singapore, citing the city-state's capacity to handle the outbreak.
""I know it's one case that hits close to home because it's a kababayan (countryman) who is ill, but on the other hand, in terms of the bigger picture in the whole of Singapore, I think the situation is better now than it was one or two weeks ago,"" Yap said.
In an earlier phone interview with Rappler, Yap advised Filipinos, ""I think we should just continue to be careful, to be cautious, but there's no reason to be panicking.""
In the first few weeks after Singapore got its first case of COVID-19, the city-state had the highest number of novel coronavirus cases outside China. It has since been overtaken by South Korea and Japan.
Singapore has at least 89 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus, according to data from the Singaporean government as of Sunday evening. Of these cases, 65 contracted the virus in Singapore while 24 got it outside the country.
The Singaporean government said 49 patients have been discharged, 35 are stable, and 5 others remain in critical condition. No one has died due to the virus in Singapore. – Rappler.com "

REMITTANCES. Filipino workers line up to send money to their families. File photo by Pat Nabong/Rappler  
MANILA, Philippines – The Philippine government expects that the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak would only have a ""minimal effect"" on the total cash remittances from overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) by the end of 2020.
Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles said in a press conference on Monday, February 24, that the government foresees a decrease of 0.8 percentage points in total cash remittance growth in 2020 – from the initial projection of 3% to just 2.2% – as an effect of COVID-19, the disease caused by 2019-nCoV.
""Because of this COVID-19 epidemic, we have adjusted our growth projections to 2.2% and now expect $34.2 billion in remittances for 2020. Nevertheless, this shall still breach another record high in overseas Filipino remittances,"" Nograles said.
He said the government had initially expected OFW remittances to reach as high as $34.5 billion by the end of this year. But Nograles said they had to adjust their projections due to the partial travel ban on China and its administrative regions Hong Kong and Macau.
The government has already allowed some 25,000 Filipinos to return to their jobs or homes in Hong Kong and Macau after being stranded in the Philippines due to the travel ban.
Nograles said the existing travel restrictions, however, would not severely affect OFW remittances as mainland China accounts for only 0.1% of total OFW remittances, Hong Kong 2.7%, and Macau 0.4%.
""DOLE (Department of Labor and Employment) also assures us that remittances from other source countries such as the US, UAE, and Saudi Arabia may help compensate for the possible slowdown in remittances coming from China, Macau, and Hong Kong. And we are encouraged by historical data that shows that Philippine remittances have been resilient even in the face of global downtrends,"" added the Cabinet secretary.
In 2019, personal remittances from OFWs reached a record high of $33.5 billion, which is 3.9% higher than the $32.2 billion recorded in 2018.
As of Monday, the Philippines has recorded 3 confirmed cases of COVID-19, all of them Chinese. One died, while the other two recovered.
The Department of Health has probed 609 patients in the Philippines for possible infection. Of this number, 126 remain admitted in heath facilities nationwide, while 480 have been discharged. – Rappler.com "

HANOI, Vietnam – Teacher Brenda* from Baguio City has been waiting for classes to resume after Vietnam’s Ministry of Education and Training (MET) extended the Lunar New Year break due to the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) scare.
“If the forced vacation extends to another week, I’ll just stay home and wait. But if they extend it longer, I’ll start looking for an alternative source of income,” Brenda, 37, said.
Brenda is among the many Filipino English teachers in Vietnam who are losing income since the MET suspended classes as a preventive measure against the COVID-19 pandemic.
The suspension of classes began on February 3. Since then, classes have not resumed, preventing many Filipinos working at English Learning Centers from earning their daily wages.
According to Brenda, her employer cannot pay her for the month of February because the students’ parents asked for a reimbursement of the tuition fee they paid for their children’s English language lessons.
Teacher Mary, 23, from Ilocos Sur, came back to Hanoi after spending the Lunar New Year break in the Philippines. She has been staying with her sister since. She is working in Hai Duong, a province in Northern Vietnam, but she has not yet returned to her workplace because of the class suspension.
“I am not expecting I’ll get paid this month because I did not teach,” she said.
The MET released its directive for a week of cancellation of classes on the first week of February. The second directive was released for the city of Ho Chi Minh on February 14, which stated that classes are cancelled until February 29. The city of Hanoi and 62 provinces were later included in the directive.
Teacher Cecilia, 40, from Mankayan in Benguet, has a full-time contract with a “big” English center. Her school moved some of her classes to an online platform. Her teaching hours are lesser but she will still earn her monthly salary. However, she has to offset her teaching hours once the school resumes its regular schedule.
Both Brenda and Mary are working for “small” English centers and have a full-time contract with their employers.

The three Filipinos, like many other English teachers in Vietnam, are waiting for further announcement from the MET after the Municipal People’s Committee of Ho Chi Minh requested an extension of the school break until the end of March.
This could mean two months of no income for many Filipino English teachers.
Meanwhile, online hubs like Filipino English Teachers in Vietnam and Filipino Expats in Vietnam have offered their help to those greatly affected by the crisis.
On Facebook community pages, Filipinos in different parts of Vietnam wrote they were willing to take in kababayans (countrymen) who are in need of a place to stay while ""this remains unsolved and 'till classes resume.""
Vietnam has recorded 16 cases COVID-19 infection, where 15 have recovered and been discharged from the hospital. Vietnam also closed its borders to China for the meantime.

MANILA, Philippines – Around 400 Filipinos on board the Diamond Princess cruise ship docked in Japan are set to come home on Tuesday, February 25, according to Department of Health (DOH) Assistant Secretary Maria Rosario Vergeire.
Vergeire confirmed the repatriation date on Monday, February 24, after DOH coordination with the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Philippine embassy in Tokyo.
Although over 400 Filipinos requested repatriation, the exact number of repatriates will be known only on Tuesday. Vergeire said they would still be subject to a screening process that would include testing and assessment if they have signs and symptoms of the COVID-19 disease. 
Those who test positive or exhibit symptoms prior to disembarking will be left behind, along with the 59 novel coronavirus-positive crew members in Japan. 
The repatriates will depart on two carriers. While they are on board the aircraft, the DOH will conduct regular monitoring. Those who manifest signs of respiratory illness will be isolated in one area of the plane. The planes are set to arrive at the Clark International Airport, where another layer of screening will be conducted upon landing.
Those who manifest illness will be brought to hospitals, while asymptomatic passengers will be taken to New Clark City in Tarlac for a two-week quarantine period.
""During the 14-day quarantine procedure, 20 medical teams from DOH hospitals will manage the quarantine facility to provide appropriate health services. Patients will be checked twice a day and provided with food and basic provisions,"" the DOH said.
A total of 538 Filipinos had been quarantined aboard the Diamond Princess docked at the port of Yokohama, Japan, since the outbreak of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which infected a total of 763 people aboard the ship.
Left behind for now
The 59 crew members who are COVID19-positive will not be included in the repatriation on Tuesday. They are currently in hospitals in Japan. If they test negative twice within 48 hours and exhibit no more symptoms, then they will be cleared to go home.
The two Filipinos in Japan who previously tested positive but recovered from the coronavirus will not be included in Tuesday's repatriation.
According to Vergeire, the Japanese government assured the Philippine government that the Filipinos who won't be going home yet will be taken care of.
Less than 20 Filipino ship crew members will be left behind, as designated by their employers. 
As of Monday, the confirmed cases in the Philippines has been stable at 3 for the past weeks. One died and two recovered and have been discharged from the hospital. The DOH has probed 609 for possible novel coronavirus infection, but 480 have been released. There remains 126 patients in various health facilities nationwide. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – The Philippine government will not yet impose a travel ban on South Korea, which has so far recorded the highest number of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) cases outside of mainland China.
On Monday, February 24, Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles told Malacañang reporters that the inter-agency task force handling the 2019-nCoV outbreak has yet to talk about possibly restricting travel to and from South Korea.
He said the Philippine government would be relying on existing protocols and recommendations from the World Health Organization (WHO) before imposing another travel ban.
""Sa ngayon wala pang desisyon 'no? Pag-uusapan ito sa task force,"" Nograles said. (Right now there's still no decision on this, okay? The task force will still talk about it.)
There has been a surge of 2019-nCoV infections in South Korea in the past days, with the country recording 763 confirmed cases as of 1:50 pm on Monday. Of this number, 7 people have died while 18 have recovered from COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus. (READ: South Korea on frontline as coronavirus spreads)
Nograles assured the public that none of those who tested positive in South Korea is a Filipino.
""So far, Filipinos there are safe, and I think the South Korean government is also doing everything that they can to contain the epidemic and control the situation,"" said the Cabinet secretary in a mix of English and Filipino.
For now, the Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs has advised Filipinos to ""delay non-essential travel"" to South Korea.
The Philippines is currently imposing a partial travel ban on China and its administrative regions Hong Kong and Macau to help prevent the spread of COVID-19. But the government has already allowed some 25,000 Filipinos to return to their jobs or homes in Hong Kong and Macau after being stranded in the Philippines due to the travel ban. – Rappler.com  "

MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – The number of Filipino crew members aboard Japanese cruise ship M/V Diamond Princess who have been infected with the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has risen to 59 as of Monday, February 24. 
The latest figure was announced by both Health Assistant Secretary Maria Rosario Vergeire and Foreign Affairs Assistant Secretary Eduardo Meñez during the weekly “Laging Handa” press briefing in Malacañang on Monday.  
THe 59 infected cases include two crew members who have already recovered from COVID-19, the disease caused by 2019-nCoV.  
“To date, 59 out of the 538 overseas Filipinos from the cruise ship had been confirmed with COVID-19. Two of the confirmed cases have recovered since isolation and admission [in health facilities],” Vergeire said. 
A total of 538 Filipinos – only 7 of whom are passengers while the rest are crew members – had been quarantined aboard the Diamond Princess docked at the port of Yokohama, Japan, since the outbreak of 2019-nCov, which infected a total of 763 people aboard the ship. 
Over 400 Filipinos from Diamond Princess have already requested to be repatriated to the Philippines. But Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles said their trip back to the country, originally set on Sunday, February, 23, was postponed to sometime this week “out of an abundance of caution to further safeguard the health and safety of our kababayans (countrymen).”
The Cabinet officials did not specify the new flight schedules of the Filipinos to be repatriated from Japan, but the DOH said in a briefing later on Monday afternoon that the repatriation will happen on Tuesday, February 25. (READ: Virus ship crew's families fear for kin as PH evacuation postponed)
None of the 52 positive cases will be allowed to go back to the Philippines, while those that will be allowed to enter the country will be subjected to a 14-day quarantine period at the New Clark City in Capas, Tarlac, the designated national quarantine facility for possible COVID-19 cases.
Meñez also said several Filipino crew members will be asked by their employer, Magsaysay Maritime Corporation, to stay behind to keep the cruise ship running, but only “essential” staff will be asked to work.  
“Actually even before na in-announce ’yong essential crew, I believe over 100 of our crew members nagsabi na rin sila na they were willing to stay behind should it be required by the employer. Pero as the situation developed, mukhang ang [Diamond Princess management] mismo ang nagsabi na titingnan namin kung sino lang ang crew member na essential,” Meñez said. 
(Actually, even before they announced that an essential crew will be needed, I believe over 100 of our crew members already expressed they were willing to stay behind should it be required by the employer. But as the situation developed, it looks the Diamond Princess management itself said they would still have to check who only among the crew members would be considered essential for the operations.) 
As of Monday, the Philippines has so far recorded 3 confirmed cases of COVID-19. One of them died, but the other two recovered and have since been discharged from the hospital.  The Department of Health has probed 609 patients in the Philippines for possible novel coronavirus infection. Of this number, 126 remain admitted in various heath facilities nationwide, while 480 have been released. – Rappler.com "

SINGAPORE – The Philippine government is not implementing a travel ban against Singapore even if close to 90 individuals here, including a Filipino permanent resident of the city-state, have contracted the novel coronavirus.
Praising how the Singaporean government has handled the crisis, Philippine Ambassador to Singapore Joseph Yap said he will not recommend travel restrictions against Singapore. His superior, Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr, earlier said he will also oppose a travel ban against the city-state.
“It’s unfortunate that we have a kababayan (countryman) affected by the virus, but the overall situation in Singapore really, I think, is stable and is in fact improving,” Yap told Rappler late Sunday evening, February 23. (READ: Singapore announces $4.6-billion boost to fight virus)
Yap cited information from the Singaporean Ministry of Health (MOH) that on Sunday there were no new cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, in Singapore. Two were discharged from the hospital on the same day.
This brings to 51 the number of people who have recovered from COVID-19 in Singapore, which has 89 recorded cases of the disease as of Sunday.
“I think whatever protocols and procedures that Singapore has in place, seem to be showing results. If anything, there is even less reason now to have travel restrictions of any kind compared to one or two weeks ago,” Yap said.
He added, “I think we should just continue to be careful, to be cautious, but there's no reason to be panicking.”
What’s at stake
If a travel ban against Singapore is imposed, Yap said that “definitely, it will be very inconvenient for everybody.” 
The ambassador noted that Singapore is one of the Philippines’ top trading partners. Singapore is the Philippines’ top export market in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, and the Philippines’ 5th biggest in the world, according to data from the Philippine embassy. Singapore is also the Philippines’ second largest international investor.
The embassy added that Singapore is the Philippines’ biggest tourist market in ASEAN.
“It’s not as simple as just saying, you know, we’ll ban people for health reasons. We have to seriously weigh the pros and cons, whether the damage will be much more than what we’re trying to prevent,” Yap explained.
Locsin earlier also opposed a travel ban against Singapore, as he tweeted on February 14: “I will not support a travel ban to and from ASEAN Singapore. A ban should hinge NOT on the incidence and number of infections/fatalities but on the demonstrated capability of the state concerned to contain the disease and strictly regulate ingress and egress from its air/seaports.”
The MOH on Sunday informed the Philippine embassy that a male Filipino permanent resident of Singapore contracted the novel coronavirus. Singapore has not disclosed the identity of the Filipino patient, and will only give more information to the Philippine government if the Filipino gives his consent.
Singapore will shoulder the Filipino patient’s hospital bills, as the city-state does with other COVID-19 cases. Yap said the Philippine embassy however is willing to help in reaching out to the Filipino patient’s relatives or flying them into Singapore if needed. 
In the first few weeks after Singapore got its first case of COVID-19, the city-state had the highest number of novel coronavirus cases outside China. It has since been overtaken by South Korea and Japan.
Singapore has at least 89 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus, according to data from the Singaporean government as of Sunday evening. Of these cases, 65 contracted the virus in Singapore while 24 got it outside the country.
The Singaporean government said 49 patients have been discharged, 35 remain stable, and 5 others remain in critical condition. No one has died due to the virus in Singapore.  – Rappler.com "

SINGAPORE (UPDATED) – The Singaporean government is investigating the close contacts of the first Filipino case of the novel coronavirus here, as the patient, whose identity Singapore has not disclosed, did not recently travel to China.
Philippine Ambassador to Singapore Joseph Yap confirmed these details to Rappler late Sunday evening, February 23, as he said the Philippine embassy is ready to help the Filipino coronavirus patient.
""The patient has no recent travel history to China, and they are still investigating his close contacts to find out more about where he could have gotten the virus from,"" Yap told Rappler.
Yap said it is possible that the patient's close contacts are also Filipinos, ""but it's hard to speculate."" He noted that Singapore's protocol for all coronavirus patients here is to trace their close contacts and to test them for the virus, if necessary.
The Filipino ""is now in isolation"" at Singapore's National Centre for Infectious Diseases, said Foreign Affairs Undersecretary Brigido Dulay earlier on Sunday.
It was also on Sunday evening when Singapore's Ministry of Health (MOH) advised the Philippine embassy about the Filipino patient, Yap said.
The most that the MOH disclosed was that the Filipino is a male permanent resident of Singapore, according to Yap. The patient needs to give his consent to the Singaporean government before his identity can be disclosed to the Philippine embassy.
""We do not know the identity because the MOH has not shared it with us for privacy reasons,"" the ambassador said.
Yap said that based on the Singaporean government's protocol, Singapore will shoulder the hospital bills of the Filipino patient and all other novel coronavirus cases. (READ: Singapore announces $4.6-billion boost to fight virus)
But the Philippine embassy can help by contacting his relatives or flying them into Singapore, if needed, using the Philippine government's fund to assist overseas Filipinos.
""We stand ready to render all the assistance that he would need,"" Yap said.
'No reason to panic'
Singapore has at least 89 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus, according to data from the Singaporean government as of Sunday evening. Of these cases, 65 contracted the virus in Singapore while 24 got it outside the country.
The Singaporean government said 49 patients have been discharged, 35 remain stable, and 5 others remain in critical condition. No one has died due to the virus in Singapore.
Singapore now has the 3rd highest number of novel coronavirus patients outside China. The country used to have the biggest number of patients outside China, but South Korea now has at least 602 confirmed cases. Japan has 132.
These figures exclude the 634 patients from the cruise ship Diamond Princess, docked in Japan.
Sought for words of reassurance for Filipinos in Singapore, Yap said: ""My advice is still the same: We should remain calm. Yes, there is one case, but we should continue to remain calm and continue to exercise vigilance. We really should continue to follow the advisories from the Ministry of Health.""
He added that ""the Singapore government has actually been doing a good job in terms of implementing their protocols."" He pointed out, for instance, that the number of novel coronavirus cases has been going down while the number of discharged patients has been going up.
""The trend is positive, and I personally feel that the situation now is more stable than it was maybe one or two weeks ago. I think we should just continue to be careful, to be cautious, but there's no reason to be panicking,"" Yap said. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – The Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) advised Filipinos to ""delay non-essential travel"" to South Korea, as the East Asian country raised its alert level for the novel coronavirus to the highest on Sunday, February 23.
There is currently no ban on Filipinos traveling to South Korea, but the DFA said ""travelers are cautioned to delay non-essential travel to the country as a precaution.""
South Korea reported 169 new infections and 3 more deaths on Sunday, bringing the total number of infections to 602 and the total number of deaths to 5.
South Korea now has the most infections outside of China, aside from the Diamond Princess cruise ship docked in Japan. More than 600 passengers and crew of the cruise ship have tested positive.
The DFA said the Philippine embassy in Seoul is closely monitoring the situation and coordinating with the Filipino community.
""The embassy has not received information that there are Filipinos in South Korea infected by COVID-19,"" said the DFA, referring to the disease caused by the virus.
""Filipinos in South Korea experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 should immediately contact the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention at 1339.""
For emergencies, the DFA said Filipinos in South Korea may also call the Philippine embassy at (+82) 10-9263-8119.
As of Sunday, at least 55 Filipinos have contracted the virus, all based outside the Philippines. Two are in the United Arab Emirates, one in Hong Kong, one in Singapore, and 51 from the Diamond Princess. (READ: Filipino coronavirus case in Singapore didn't travel to China)
In the Philippines, there have been 3 confirmed cases, all Chinese. One of them died, while the other two recovered.

MANILA, Philippines – House Deputy Speaker Johnny Pimentel urged the government to brace for a drop in tourism resulting to loss of thousands of jobs due to the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) that broke out in China, a major market in the Philippine hospitality industry.
“We have to put together a plan to help these displaced workers transition to other jobs,” Pimentel said in a statement on Sunday, February 23.
Pimentel projected the Philippine stands to lose up to 1.2 million Chinese visitors in 2020, primarily because of the travel ban on mainland China. Even if the virus is suppressed and the travel ban lifted, he said “the damage has already been done” and that a rebound would take longer than the country would wish.
Pimentel urged the Department of Tourism (DOT) and the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) to draw up an emergency skills retooling and jobs plan for thousands of workers facing layoffs.
The House leader also reminded the Social Security System to give out P20,000 in unemployment insurance to workers who would be involuntarilty separated.
In 2019, a total of 1,743,309 vacationers from China arrived in the Philippines, according to the DOT.
Aside from China, the Philippines welcomed the most visitors from South Korea (1,989,322 visitors), United States (1,064,440 visitors), Japan (682,788 visitors), and Taiwan (327,273). In these countries, the DOT expects a dip in visits of at least 10%.

MANILA, Philippines – Families of hundreds of Filipino crew members still stuck on board the coronavirus-stricken Diamond Princess cruise ship are increasingly worried for their relatives' health, as the Philippines postponed on Saturday, February 22, a scheduled trip to bring them home.
The vessel, moored off the Japanese coast in Yokohama near Tokyo, has the biggest cluster of coronavirus infections outside the Chinese epicenter, with over 600 cases confirmed among the 3,700 passengers and crew.
While hundreds of travelers have disembarked more than 1,000 crew remain – including over 400 Filipinos whose return on Sunday, February 23, has been delayed until Japan clears them to travel, the Philippines said Saturday.
""[The task force] is adjusting the schedule out of an abundance of caution with a view of safeguarding the health and safety of our OFWs (overseas Filipinos) onboard,"" the health department said in a statement.
Adding to the families' worry, a Philippine foreign ministry official said Saturday 49 Filipinos on board have tested positive for the virus, two of whom were successfully treated and discharged from the hospital.
(READ: Quarantine nightmare still not over for left-behind cruise ship crew)
Norma Fajardo, whose daughter is part of the Diamond Princess security team, said the crew have been well treated and cared for, but she is worried her work makes her particularly vulnerable to the virus.
""We couldn't do anything because she works in security so she has to monitor passengers,"" Fajardo told AFP.
""We're worried. She could get infected anytime,"" she added.
Fajardo said crew who get sick are allowed to rest, but those without symptoms were encouraged to continue working.
Esther Rivera – whose son is a ship photographer – has urged the Philippine government to bring them home.
""I hope they get pulled out from the ship because they are infecting each other there,"" Rivera said.
Once flown home, the repatriated Filipinos will be quarantined for two weeks in a northern Philippine facility previously used to house athletes in the 2019 Southeast Asian Games.
Japan has faced mounting criticism for its quarantine arrangements as passengers disperse across the world.
The cruise ship was quarantined on February 5 – after a passenger who disembarked in Hong Kong tested positive for the virus – but many crew were not isolated because they were needed to keep the vessel running.
Some were preparing food and delivering meals to cabins, leading some critics to charge they were inadvertently spreading the virus throughout the boat.
Princess Cruises President Jan Swartz has written a letter to the crew, saying the firm was ""deeply grateful and incredibly proud of all of you.""
Around 10 million Filipinos work abroad and the money they send home spurs the local economy where many still live in deep poverty despite the country's robust growth.
The government has for decades hailed overseas workers as modern heroes, but advocacy groups have highlighted these Filipinos vulnerability in troubled countries, or during epidemics. – Rappler.com

MANILA, Philippines – The repatriation of Filipinos on a cruise ship in Japan has been tentatively moved to ""early next week"" instead of Sunday, February 23, the Department of Health (DOH) announced.
The DOH said in a statement on Saturday, February 22, that the Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Disease (IATF-EID) ""unanimously resolved"" to move the homecoming date of over 400 Filipinos aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship.
“This is to allow the Japanese health authorities to complete the laboratory testing of the 400-plus Filipino crew members aboard the ship and comply with established Japanese quarantine protocols,” the DOH said.
It added that the task force adjusted the schedule ""out of an abundance of caution with a view to safeguarding the health and safety of our overseas Filipinos onboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship.""
“The Japanese government has ensured that appropriate health services are being provided to affected overseas Filipinos aboard the ship. Our Tokyo Embassy is working closely with the Japanese health and foreign ministry to complete the quarantine protocols for the Philippine Government to repatriate our Filipino crew members as soon as possible,” the DOH said. 
The decision was made a day after two Australians evacuated from the cruise ship  tested positive for coronavirus on their return home, despite being cleared in Japan.
Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr earlier ordered the immediate repatriation of the Filipinos aboard the ship on Wednesday, February 19. This was just hours hours after ship passengers who tested negative for COVID-19 – the name of the disease caused by the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) – following a 14-day quarantine were allowed to disembark.
About 460 to 480 Filipinos were aboard the ship, both passengers and crew members.
 
Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said in an earlier press conference that the repatriation was originally set for Tuesday, February 25, but the DFA moved it to Sunday, February 23, after the Japanese government announced they would close down the cruise ship.
Earlier reports said the 52 Filipinos infected with 2019-nCoV would not be included in the repatriation.
As of Friday, February 21, a total of 634 confirmed cases of COVID-19 was recorded on the Diamond Cruise ship, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Two former passengers died.
Meanwhile, the DOH gave a clean bill of health to 30 Filipino repatriates from Wuhan, China, after a 14-day quarantine at the New Clark City in Tarlac.
 
The DOH said the 10-member Health Emergency Response Team (HERT) from the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) and the DOH, 6 flight crew members, and 3 ground crew operators involved in the Wuhan mission were also declared healthy and showed no signs and symptoms of COVID-19, the name of the disease from infection with nCoV-2019.
The 49 Filipinos were set to leave New Clark City on Saturday.
The Philippines has so far recorded 3 confirmed cases as of Friday noon, with one death and two recoveries. A total of 597 possible cases are currently under investigation. So far, there were no cases of local transmission. – Pauline Macaraeg/Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – The scores of Filipino passengers and crew members of Japanese cruise ship Diamond Princess who were infected by the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) will not be among those to be repatriated to the Philippines on Sunday, February 23.
Department of Health (DOH) Assistant Secretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said they received a report as of Friday morning, February 21, that 52 Filipinos aboard the ship have already tested positive with 2019-nCoV, after 8 new cases were recorded. But she clarified the DOH was still “verifying” the latest figure.
“At gaya po ng ating napag-usapan at napagkasunduan namin [sa Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF)] na wala hong sasama sa repatriation na may sintomas (And just like what we discussed and agreed upon in the Inter-Agency Task Force, none of those who showed symptoms will be repatriated yet),” Vergeire said in a press conference on Friday afternoon.
The DOH official said the IATF handling the coronavirus scare is yet to finalize plans for these 52 Filipinos, but she promised they will “not be left behind.”
“Paguusapan po uli yan sa Inter-Agency Task Force. But as we have heard from the President [Rodrigo Duterte] and even our Secretary [Francisco Duque III], sinasabi lagi no Filipino o wala tayong kababayan na iiwanan. We will not be leaving them behind,” Vergeire said.
(The Inter-Agency Task Force will still have to talk about that. But as we have heard from the President Rodrigo Duterte and even our Secretary Francisco Duque III, they always say no Filipino will be left behind.)
She said that because the 52 cases tested positive for COVID-19 – the disease caused by 2019-nCoV – on different days, there would be separate individual arrangements for their logistical needs. These include different days of stay in the hospital, of discharge, and trips back to the Philippines as well.
About 460 to 480 Filipino passengers and crew members of Diamond Princess are set to be repatriated on Sunday from Yokohama, Japan to New Clark City in Capas, Tarlac, the Philippine government’s designated quarantine facility for COVID-19.
The IATF agreed that the DOH and the Magsaysay Maritime Corporation, the employer of the Filipino crew members, will both primarily shoulder the expenses for the repatriation process.
The DOH will be deploying health personnel to watch over the quarantined Filipinos and will also pay for the costs of their transportation to New Clark City as well as the on-site medical needs of the repatriates, hospitalization expenses through Philhealth, and personal protective equipment (PPE) for the first 5 days of the quarantine period.
The Magsaysay Maritime Corporation, meanwhile, will bear the cost of all transportation expenses of the repatriates from Japan until the completion of the quarantine period, PPE for the remaining period of the quarantine, as well as, food, lodging, personal hygiene kits and disinfectants, waste disposal services, and other incidental expenses of the repatriated crew.
The Department of Transportation will be tasked to bring the repatriates from Haribon Airport in Pampanga to New Clark City in Tarlac. The Overseas Workers Welfare Administration will provide livelihood packages to the repatriates and also pay for their transportation from Manila to their respective destinations after the quarantine period.
Vergeire said the hundreds of repatriates from Diamond Princess are currently being checked for possible COVID-19 symptoms.
Medical teams from the DOH will also test them before they leave the cruise ship and right after they disembark from the two planes that will take them back to the Philippines. 
Just like the 30 overseas Filipino workers repatriated from Wuhan, China – the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak – the second batch of quarantined Filipinos would be subjected to twice-a-day monitoring during their 14-day quarantine at New Clark City.
As of Friday, the DOH has probed 597 patients in the Philippines for possible COVID-19 infection. Of this number, 139 patients are still admitted in various health facilities nationwide, while 455 have already been discharged.
The Philippines has, so far, recorded 3 confirmed cases of COVID-19. One of them died, but the other two recovered and have since been discharged from the hospital.
In mainland China, the new disease has killed 2,235 people and infected a total of 75,466 as of 3:45 pm on Friday. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – The first batch of 49 Filipinos quarantined in New Clark City will now be allowed to go home after showing no signs and symptoms of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). 
In a press conference on Friday, February 21, Department of Health (DOH) Assistant Secretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said they will be holding a send-off ceremony for the 49 Filipinos on Saturday, February 22, the last day of their 14-day mandatory quarantine.
New Clark City in Capas, Tarlac was designated as the country's quarantine facility to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus. The site was first used in December last year as the Athlete's Village of the Southeast Asian Games.
“On February 22, DOH is set to conduct a send-off ceremony for the 30 repatriates and 19 crew members [and members of the repatriation team] at the New Clark City quarantine facility, which marks their completion of the required 14-day quarantine,” Vergeire said.
“All the quarantined individuals have not shown signs and symptoms of fever, cough or sore throat during their 14-day stay. They will now be allowed to go back to their respective homes and places,” the DOH official added.  
Of the 49 repatriates, 30 are overseas Filipino workers who were based in the province of Hubei in China, where COVID-19 – the disease caused by 2019-nCoV – has killed 2,235 people and infected a total of 75,466 as of 3:45 pm on Friday.  
The rest of the Filipinos quarantined in New Clark City include government personnel who were part of the repatriation team, 6 flight crew members, and 3 ground crew operators. (READ: DOLE to assist OFWs repatriated due to novel coronavirus crisis)
“We are glad that our repatriates are all well and safe from COVID-19. Our repatriation mission is not possible without the dedication and cooperation of the entire Inter-agency Task Force for Emerging Infectious Diseases with all its member agencies. We are extremely grateful for the collective effort of the government,” Vergeire said.
This now means New Clark City will have been completely vacated and ready for occupancy by the time the 460 to 480 Filipinos who were quarantined for days inside the Japanese cruise ship M/V Diamond Princess will fly back to the Philippines on Sunday, February 23. 
Vergeire’s updated figure on the second batch of repatriates from Diamond Princess is about 20 to 40 people fewer than Health Secretary Francisco Duque III’s earlier estimate of “around 500.” 
At least 44 Filipino passengers and crew members of Diamond Princess have tested positive for COVID-19, though one case has already recovered from the disease and is the first Filipino to do so.  
Vergeire said the 43 Filipinos who are still COVID-19-positive will not be allowed to go back to the Philippines. 
As of Friday, the DOH has probed 597 patients in the Philippines for possible COVID-19 infection. Of this number, 139 patients are still admitted in various health facilities nationwide, while 455 have already been discharged.  
The Philippines has so far recorded 3 confirmed cases of COVID-19. One of them died, but the other two recovered and have since been discharged from the hospital. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – The Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) confirmed that 3 more Filipinos who were onboard the Japanese cruise ship M/V Diamond Princess were infected with the novel coronavirus.
""Yes, 41 plus 3 new cases. Minus one who has recovered,"" the DFA said in a statement on Thursday, February 20, when asked to confirm if there are additional Filipino cruise passengers who tested positive for the novel coronavirus.
This means there are now 44 Filipinos who got infected with the novel coronavirus after being onboard the Diamond Princess, which had been quarantined in the port of Yokohama, Japan. 
One of the 44, who was the first Filipino reported to have contracted the novel coronavirus, has already recovered from COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. 
Some 500 Filipino passengers of Diamond Princess are set to be repatriated back to the country on Sunday, February 23. 
Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said all of them will be brought to New Clark City in Tarlac to be quarantined for another 14 days. 
Medical personnel from 16 government hospitals across Luzon will be deployed to help oversee the health status of the repatriates during the quarantine period.
As of Thursday, the DOH has yet to report any case of local transmission of COVID-19, although the Philippines has recorded 3 confirmed cases of the new disease. One of them died, while the other two recovered.  
The Philippines has a total of 556 patients under investigtion for the novel coronavirus as of this posting.

MANILA, Philippines – Around 500 Filipinos who were quarantined onboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan due to the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) are set to be repatriated to the Philippines on Sunday, February 23. 
In a press conference on Thursday, February 20, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said the repatriation was originally set for Tuesday, February 25, but the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) adjusted the date after the Japanese government announced it will be closing down the cruise ship.
""The [original] date [was] February 25, [but] it will be advanced to February 23. That's on a Sunday. The exact time is being determined by DFA as they are coordinating the repatriation of not 400 but 500 Filipinos with their counterpart in Japan and with the Ministry of Health, [Labor, and Welfare],"" Duque said.  
Two planes, with a 2- to 3-hour interval between their arrival times, will be flying the Filipinos from Japan to the Clark Air Base on Sunday. From there, the repatriates will be brought to the Athletes' Village in New Clark City in Tarlac, where they will have to undergo another 14-day quarantine period.  
Once the repatriates arrive in New Clark City, at least 549 Filipinos will be quarantined there to be monitored for possible cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by 2019-nCoV.
The first batch of quarantined Filipinos used to work in the Chinese province of Hubei, the epicenter of the outbreak, which has so far killed 2,118 people and infected 74,500 across China.
Duque said the Department of Heath (DOH) will be implementing a 1:1 repatriate-to-room ratio during the quarantine. But passengers with family members will be asked to stay in one room.
The DOH will also be deploying health personnel from 16 government-run hospitals across Luzon to do shifts in New Clark City and watch over the health of the quarantined Filipinos.
Among those to be quarantined are at least 41 Filipinos who were aboard the cruise ship and later tested positive for COVID-19.
Duque said the first infected Filipino to recover from the disease – a crew member of Diamond Princess – will still be subjected to the 14-day quarantine in New Clark City.  
""Oh yes, ika-quarantine din 'yan (Oh yes, he has to be quarantined). Because number one, we don't know much of the virus. We don't know if there's going to be immunity or if there's going to be re-infection,"" Duque said. 
As of Thursday, the DOH has yet to report any case of local transmission of COVID-19, although the Philippines has recorded 3 confirmed cases of the new disease. One of them died, but the other two recovered. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – The first Filipino reported to have contracted the novel coronavirus has recovered from the infection, the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) said on Wednesday, February 19.
He is a crew member of the cruise ship Diamond Princess, which had been quarantined at the port of Yokohama, Japan, for 14 days as the virus infected more than 500 passengers and crew while onboard.
“The Department of Foreign Affairs, together with the Philippine Embassy in Tokyo, is pleased to announce that the first Filipino crew member who tested positive for COVID-19 and was admitted to the hospital on February 5 has been successfully treated and is scheduled to be discharged today, February 19,” the DFA said in a statement.
“COVID-19” is the term for the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.
Forty other Filipino crew members of the Diamond Princess cruise ship are being treated for the novel coronavirus in hospitals in and near the Tokyo Metropolitan Area. Six of them were diagnosed earlier on Wednesday.
The 14-day quarantine imposed on the ship's passengers ended on Wednesday, and authorities facilitated the disembarkation of some 500 passengers who tested negative for the virus.
There were a total of 538 Filipinos onboard the ship, including those who had tested positive for the virus.
The Philippine Embassy in Japan is working with Japanese authorities and the management of Princess Cruises “to finalize the details, logistics, and schedule of the repatriation” of the ship’s Filipino crew members and passengers. They will be flown home “at the soonest possible time,” the DFA said.
The DFA earlier on Wednesday ordered the “immediate repatriation” of Filipinos who were on the Diamond Princess.
As of Wednesday, the COVID-19 global death toll has reached 2,000 – 5 of the deaths outside China. There were more than 74,000 confirmed cases in China alone, and hundreds more reported in two dozen countries.
In the Philippines, there have been 3 confirmed cases – one death and two recoveries of Chinese tourists. A total of 527 possible cases are currently under investigation. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr has ordered the immediate repatriation of Filipinos on the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Yokohama, Japan.
Locsin announced this in a tweet on Wednesday, February 19, hours after ship passengers who tested negative for COVID-19 – the name of the disease caused by the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) – following a 14-day quarantine were allowed to disembark.
""I have ordered our Tokyo Embassy to immediately repatriate our people in the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Yokohoma, Japan,"" Locsin said.
""It’s our duty to take care our overseas Filipinos wherever they are. I want them home now!"" he added.

@DFAPHL I have ordered our Tokyo Embassy to immediately repatriate our people in the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Yokohoma Japan. It’s our duty to take care our Overseas Filipinos wherever they are. I want them home now!
— Teddy Locsin Jr. (@teddyboylocsin) February 19, 2020

As of Wednesday, 41 Filipino crew members of the ship tested positive for COVID-19. Like others on the ship confirmed to be infected with the virus, they were brought to hospitals in Japan for treatment. Including the 41 crew members, there were a total of 538 Filipinos on the ship.
Assistant Secretary Rosario Vergeire said in a news briefing on Wednesday that the Department of Health (DOH) was making all the necessary preparations for the returning Filipinos.
Vergeire said that the DOH was checking hospitals and facilities where the repatriates would be quarantined, in coordination with local governments, but did not specify them.
The Filipinos earlier repatriated from Wuhan in Hubei, China, were brought to New Clark City in Tarlac. The government had also earlier cited the unused drug rehabilitation facility in Fort Magsaysay, Nueva Ecija, as a quarantine site.
'Proper repatriation process'
Vergeire said that Philippine officials have been coordinating with the Japanese government and the cruise ship management since last week to ensure that everything would be in place once the repatriation of the Filipinos begin.
Apparently in response to some views that it was taking the Philippine government some time to repatriate the Filipinos on the ship, Vergeire noted that many things had to be arranged because it involved a large group of over 500 people.
""So ever since last week, our government has already been coordinating with the government of Japan, and also our ministry of foreign affairs nakikipag-usap na po doon. We sat down with the Diamond Princess handler here already to negotiate our terms para makuha na natin kung paano talaga natin gagawin itong pagrerepatriate. So I think hindi naman sa natagalan; ipinoproseso lang nang maayos,"" she explained.
(Ever since last week, our government has been coordinating with the government of Japan, and also our ministry of foreign affairs is also talking with their counterparts. We sat down with the Diamond Princess handler here already to negotiate our terms so we can determine how to carry out the repatriation. So I think it's not that the process was slow; we're just doing this properly.)
Additional quarantine period
Vergeire said that a 14-day quarantine would be strictly enforced on all repatriated Filipinos. When the decision was made to repatriate the Filipinos on the ship, one of the conditions was to conduct an additional quarantine period even though they were already quarantined on the ship, she added. 
“The 14-day period will somehow give us assurance,” the health official said.
The DOH also reported that its supplemental budget request was granted, and that most of the fund would be spent on personal protective equipment for healthcare workers. Vergeire did not disclose the amount, but said the DOH would release the breakdown of this budget in the coming days.
As for the possible procurement of Favilavir, the first anti-novel coronavirus drug approved by China’s regulatory body, Vergeire said it would first have to be endorsed by the World Health Organization and the Philippines' Food and Drug Administration before it can be used locally.
As  of Wednesday, the COVID-19 death toll reached 2,000 – 5 of the deaths outside China. There were more than 74,000 confirmed cases in China alone, and hundreds more reported in two dozen countries.
In the Philippines, there have been 3 confirmed cases – one death and two recoveries. A total of 527 possible cases are currently under investigation. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – Three Cabinet officials, including Health Secretary Francisco Duque III, on Tuesday, February 18, assured the public that it is “safe” to organize and attend public gatherings for as long as people follow the prescribed precautionary measures to protect themselves from the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).
Duque, Interior Secretary Eduardo Año, and Tourism Secretary Bernadette Romulo-Puyat issued the joint statement which is a modification of the Department of Health (DOH) advisory on February 7, “strongly” urging the public to avoid public gatherings to stem the spread of COVID-19, the disease caused by 2019-nCoV.
“The Department of Health (DOH), Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG), and the Department of Tourism (DOT) would like to assure everyone that it is safe to organize and attend public gatherings, meetings, and festivals as long as all precautionary measures identifed by the DOH are observed,” they said in the statement.
The DOH chairs the  Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF) for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases Meeting, while the DILG and the DOT are among its members.

The DOH reminded the public to wash hands regularly and seek medical attention for signs of cough, colds, sore throat, and fever, which are symptoms of COVID-19. 
“All preventive and precautionary measures have been put in place by the national government to contain the spread of the COVID-19,” said Duque, Año, and Puyat.
The Cabinet officials also said the guidelines in “handling guests” in tourism enterprises in the country are being implemented even before the government imposed a now-partially lifted temporary travel ban to and from Hong Kong, Macau, and China, the epicenter of COVID-19 which has so far killed 1,863 people and infected more than 72,300 people there. 
“The safety of the public, especially our tourists and employees in the tourism sector, remains the priority of the Philippine government,” the officials said.
The officials gave the assurance as the government moved to boost domestic tourism especially this summer season, after the COVID-19 outbreak slowed down the influx of foreign visitors, especially those from China.
Puyat had earlier told lawmakers that the Philippines stands to lose P42.9 billion in tourism revenues for the peak months of February to April due to the COVID-19 threat.
President Rodrigo Duterte himself had expressed willingness to be a domestic travel ambassador of sorts, to encourage Filipinos to patronize local tourist spots.
The DOT wants Duterte himself to travel to popular beach destinations like Boracay, Cebu, and Bohol – places frequented by Chinese tourists – to offset the death of foreign tourists. 
As of Tuesday, the DOH has yet to report any case of local transmission of COVID-19, although the Philippines has recorded 3 confirmed cases of the new disease. One of them died, but the other two recovered and had been discharged from the hospital. 
There are currently 49 Filipinos under quarantine in New Clark City in Tarlac, a majority of whom were repatriated from Hubei, China.

MANILA, Philippines – Eight more Filipinos working on the Japanese cruise ship Diamond Princess have contracted the novel coronavirus, bringing the total number of infected Filipino crew members to 35, the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) said on Tuesday, February 18.
On Sunday, February 16, 27 Filipinos were reported as positive for COVID-19, the term for the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.
“The Filipinos who tested positive for COVID-19 were immediately transferred to Japanese hospitals and are now undergoing treatment. The (Philippine Embassy in Japan) constantly communicates with all patients currently confined in Japanese hospitals to ensure their well-being and to provide assistance,” the DFA said in a statement.
The Japanese government is set to announce on Tuesday the disembarkation procedures as the ship’s quarantine period ends.
“The Embassy is coordinating with all relevant Philippine and Japanese government agencies and is meeting with senior management representatives of Princess Cruises to ensure an orderly and safe repatriation of Filipinos once they clear the Japanese quarantine requirements,” the DFA said.
All Filipino passengers and crew of the Diamond Princess who wish to be repatriated will be accommodated by the government, the Department of Health (DOH) said on Tuesday.
“The DOH will follow strict infection control and quarantine procedures to ensure the safety of our repatriates and health workers who will man the quarantine facility,” the Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases said in a statement.
There were a total of 538 Filipinos onboard the Diamond Princess. One of them became the first Filipino case of COVID-19. The ship has been on quarantine at the port of Yokahama since February 5.
On Monday, the DFA said the government sent “care packages” containing toiletries and other supplies to the Filipinos on the cruise ship.
As of Monday evening, Philippine health officials had monitored a total of 521 patients for the novel coronavirus. Only 171 of them remained at hospitals.
The country has had 3 confirmed cases of infection, all of whom were Chinese tourists. There have not been any new confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the Philippines since February 5.

MANILA, Philippines – Filipinos stranded in the Philippines because of the novel coronavirus outbreak are now allowed to return to their jobs in Hong Kong and Macau, the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) and the Deparetment of Health (DOH) said on Tuesday, February 18.
The Philippine government’s Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID) has exempted overseas Filipino workers (OFW) from the two special administrative regions of China from an outbound travel ban meant to prevent the spread of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, which originated from Wuhan City in Hubei province, China.
DFA Undersecretary for Civilian Security and Consular Concerns Brigido “Dodo” Dulay first made the announcement in a tweet on Tuesday afternoon.
""The Task Force also agreed to authorize travel to Hong Kong and Macau for permanent residents of the respective Special Administrative Regions, Filipinos leaving abroad for study, and Overseas Filipino Workers, provided that the travellers sign a declaration signifying their knowledge and understanding of the risks involved,"" the IATF-EID stated in its resolution released by the DOH also on Tuesday.
Some 25,000 OFWs and Filipino residents of Hong Kong had been urging the government to exempt them from the travel ban that has been in force since February 2, after health officials confirmed the first two cases of the virus in the Philippines, and following the death of one of the COVID-19 patients.
Today, DFA Sec Locsin’s advocacy has come true. OFWs returning for work in Hongkong and Macau have been exempted from the outbound travel ban by the IATF-EID, subject to certain procedural formalities. Woohoo!! @teddyboylocsin— Dodo Dulay (@dododulay) February 18, 2020
Several of the stranded OFWs organized themselves into a group called #StrandedPH and launched a social media campaign hoping to spark action on their plight. Members of the group have been interviewed by different news outlets including Rappler, explaining that their prolonged absence could cost them their jobs.
Aware that the ban was meant to protect them from catching COVID-19, the stranded OFWs said they were willing to sign a waiver absolving the Philippine government of any liability should they fall ill upon their return to Hong Kong.
Besides the risk of losing their income sources, some of the stranded Filipinos had invested a lot of money, even accumulated debts, for the opportunity to work in Hong Kong. In the case of Hong Kong residents, some have had to pay for accommodations during their unexpected prolonged stay in the Philippines.
Upon hearing of their exemption from the ban, #StrandedPH group administrator Edward Borja thanked the government agencies and media outlets for the publicity that “paved the way to help the government agencies make a final decision towards lifting the ban.”
“Me, my family, my co-admins and my fellow OFWs are overwhelmed with happiness with this decision by our government. Now we are all just waiting for airlines to reopen flights so we can book right away,” Borja said in a statement.
As of Monday evening, Philippine health officials had monitored a total of 521 patients for the novel coronavirus. Only 171 remained at hospitals. The country has had 3 confirmed cases of infection. There have not been any new confirmed cases since February 5.

MANILA, Philippines – Anticipating billions of pesos in revenue losses in the tourism industry, due to the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) scare, the Department of Tourism (DOT) is recommeding that President Rodrigo Duterte visits popular island destinations to help boost the domestic tourism industry.
DOT Undersecretary Arturo Boncato Jr said on Monday, February 17, they had so far chosen Boracay, Cebu, and Bohol as the initial destinations to be visited by Duterte, who had invited Filipinos to travel with him around the country amid the 2019-nCoV threat.  
“So, [we are doing this] just to arrest and to cushion whatever impact this crisis may bring to the tourism industry. As we see it, it’s still early and, as we all know, we are uncertain as to how long this would go on. And we’d like to have those measures as early as possible addressed,” said Boncato in a press briefing in Malacañang.
The DOT official said they wanted Duterte to begin his tour around the country by end of February or early March to “showcase the sites and attractions” that are popular among tourists. 
“So maaari pong ipapakita natin dito iyong mga pinakasikat na beaches, for example, ano, at saka iyong mga activities na nagbibigay ng mga unique experiences sa mga turista. At malamang ipapakita din natin iyong local communities ’no,” Boncato said. 
(So we can possibly showcase the most famous beaches, for example, and the activities that would give unique experiences to tourists. Of course, we would also feature the local communities.) 
It remains unclear, however, if Duterte himself already agreed to the itinerary. The President is also notorious for skipping pre-scheduled public engagements often due to health-related issues. (READ: LIST: Duterte's skipped events, long absences) 
Tourism Secretary Bernadette Romulo Puyat already told lawmakers the Philippines stands to lose P42.9 billion in tourism revenues for the peak months of February to April due to the COVID-19 threat.  
Boncato also said the DOT also estimates that the country would have a foregone revenue worth P14.8 billion alone following the ongoing travel ban covering China, Hong Kong, and Macau. 
As of Monday, the Department of Health has yet to report any case of local transmission of COVID-19, although the Philippines has recorded 3 confirmed cases of the new disease.

   CEBU CITY, Philippines – The Philippine National Police (PNP) filed charges against an optometrist here in Cebu for allegedly posting on Facebook unverified information related to the novel coronavirus.
According to a statement from the PNP, Josephil Brian Consuelo, an optometrist, erroneously posted on Facebook that a patient under observation had died at the University of Cebu Medical Center.   
No patients under observation in Cebu have died, according to the latest update from the Department of Health. Based on latest figures from the DOH, there are a total of 55 patients under investigation for the virus in the Central Visayas. 
 According to the PNP, Consuelo was arrested last Thursday, February 13.   The Central Visayas' anti-cybercrime unit checked the post and filed charges after finding out the information was false.   Consuelo's post could not be found as of this posting.   
Police Colonel Marlo Castillo, head of the Central Visayas' anti-cybercrime unit, said that the defendant would face the charges.
Castillo said they were in coordination with Cebu province to monitor any information about the virus that could cause unnecessary panic.
""We would like the public to know that spreading fake news and misinformation has equivalent legal consequences,"" Castillo said.
PNP chief General Archie Francisco Gamboa said the police would continue to act against the spread of misinformation amid the ongoing novel coronavirus crisis. 
""Again, we urge the public to refrain posting unverified information that creates panic and confusion and we will file criminal charges to those proven spreading these false reports,"" Gamboa said.   
Consuelo's arrest comes a week after the Cebu Provincial Board passed a resolution against spreading ""fake news"" related to the novel coronavirus. 
The National Bureau of Investigation said they would also go after those who ""peddle coronavirus fake news.""
Currently, at least 28 Filipinos have the novel coronavirus, but are all based outside the country. This includes one in the United Arab Emirates, and 27 aboard a cruise ship quarantined in Japan.

MANILA, Philippines – The Philippine government provided care packages to the 538 Filipinos still quarantined on the Japanese cruise ship Diamond Princess due to the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) scare.
Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) Assistant Secretary Eduardo Meñez said in a press conference on Monday, February 17, this is the initial assistance the Philippine government has provided the Filipinos onboard the cruise ship. 
""The Philippine embassy, as I said, is in constant contact [with them]. We have, through the Japanese government, delivered care packages containing toiletries and non-medical supplies, and are in constant contact with the medical authorities,"" Meñez told reporters in Malacañang.  
Of the 538 Filipinos onboard, at least 27 are confirmed to have COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus. The first case of COVID-19 in a Filipino was confirmed onboard the Diamond Princess. 
The cruise ship has been in quarantine since February 5 at the port of Yokohama near Tokyo following the 2019-nCoV outbreak.
For now, Meñez said it is ""not clear"" to him who is shouldering the medical expenses of the infected Filipinos. But he gave an assurance that the Philippine government would shoulder the costs if the need arises.
""At this point, it is not clear to me whether the medical expenses of those positive, of those identified to be COVID-positive are being shouldered by whom. I would imagine that in the initial case, it would be the Japanese government. But the employer as well will probably have some responsiblity for paying for the medical expenses,"" Meñez said.
""But if in the final analysis, the government needs to pay, the government will step up accordingly,"" he added. 
Asked further if the government would aid the Filipino passengers who would wish to be repatriated from the cruise ship, Meñez said, ""Of course.""

""President Duterte…said China has been kind to us, and we can only show the same favor to them,"" he added.
Malacañang has yet to publicize the letter as of this posting, but Huang said it will be made public soon.
In the forum, Huang defended the Chinese government's response to the viral outbreak amid criticism that it had been negligent in alerting the public during its early stages.
The envoy went on to thank Filipinos and their government for aid and assistance sent to China ""despite the urgent need in this country.""
""Despite their own difficulties,"" the Philippine government sent 42 boxes of relief goods on a chartered flight to Wuhan City in Hubei, China, the epicenter of the outbreak, Huang said.
""In our view, this move is not only material support but more importantly, spiritual inspiration to the Chinese people. That's what we need,"" he added.
Duterte has consistently tried to shield China from criticism. When he first publicly addressed Filipinos about the outbreak on February 3, he chided them for seeking a total travel ban of mainland Chinese. He called it ""xenophobia.""

MANILA, Philippines – Tales of misery continue for more than 25,000 stranded Filipinos who hope to return to Hong Kong for work as the Philippine government remains firm on its ban on travelers coming to and from China, Hong Kong, and Macau.
The Philippine government imposed the travel ban on February 2 as the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak worsened worldwide. 
The virus was discovered in the city of Wuhan in China, prompting the lockdown of several provinces, and several countries' travel ban covering the mainland and its special administrative regions. 
In a unity statement sent to media, a group of Filipino with contracts in Hong Kong appealed to the government to lift the ban as they fear losing their jobs due to their “prolonged absence.” 
The group is composed of foreign domestic workers, skilled workers, and permanent Hong Kong residents. 
“The burden is made heavier by the loans they had to take out to pay for placement fees and other expenses to secure their jobs,” the group said. 
The group added that some Filipino residents also worry about not being able to pay their monthly rent and bills on time. 
“In another category are those who have been raised in Hong Kong and don’t have houses in the Philippines anymore, and are thus forced to pay for accommodation and food [in the Philippines] while waiting for the ban to be lifted,” the group said. 
Edward Borja, 52, who works as a swimming teacher in Hong Kong, said he and his family initially planned to stay in Manila until February 6, but since the ban had been imposed, they could not leave the country. He worries not only about the bills they need to pay in Hong Kong, but he also fears not having an income if they won't be able to return to Hong Kong by March. 
“Ngayon, nakausap ko 'yung employer ko. Ibibigay niya raw ang full salary ko ngayong February, pero kapag tumagal pa kami rito hanggang March, no pay no work na ako noon. This is our struggle now. Paano pa ang hirap na dinaranas ng mga domestic helpers natin?” Borja told Rappler.
(My employer told me that she’d give my full salary for February, but if we can’t return to Hong Kong by March, it will be no work no pay. This is our struggle now. The domestic helpers must be having a harder time.)
Joms Ortega, 33, who works as a child play performer in Hong Kong, initiated the Facebook group #StrandedPH, which has now more than 1,000 members. 
Ortega said they sent a letter to the Overseas Workers Welfare Administration (OWWA) on Monday, February 17, appealing to lift the travel ban so they could return to Hong Kong.
“Pag-uusapan na nila (They will talk about it). There will be a meeting this afternoon and tomorrow. Hopefully, there will be a partial decision by then. But, of course, they can’t promise us anything. We hope this will be fixed in the next few days,” said Ortega. 
Better health care system
The Duterte administration's latest move banning travelers from and to China, Hong Kong, and Macau widens the scope of restrictions that had been put in place aimed at preventing the spread of the virus.
On Friday, January 31, Duterte eimposed a ban on travelers from Wuhan City and Hubei province – the epicenter of the 2019 novel coronavirus – as well as other affected regions of China.
But for Borja, the Hong Kong government is prepared for returning workers in their country. He said the health care system in Hong Kong ensures that “we all get excellent medical care at little or no cost to us, while some of us have private medical coverage that comes with our employment.”
“Dito nga sa atin, nagkakaubusan ng masks, pero kasi 'yung mga companies namin a Hong Kong, binibigyan kami ng masks at ng sanitizers,” said Borja. (Here in the Philippines, there is shortage of face masks, but in Hong Kong, our companies provide us with masks and sanitizers.)
“We don’t worry about our protection. We don’t need to pay anything. The Philippine government could not provide that. I’m not questioning the Department of Health. They’re really good but sa dami ng populasyon ng bansa natin, it’s impossible for them to match that. I feel safer there,” he added. 
The group said they are willing to sign a waiver absolving the Philippine government of any liability if they fall ill upon their return to Hong Kong.
“All we ask is the right to travel back to the city where we live and work,” the group statement read.

There are at least 12 Filipinos confirmed to have the virus, but all are based outside the Philippines, including one in the United Arab Emirates and 11 who were aboard a cruise ship quarantined in Japan.
The World Health Organization declared the outbreak an international emergency, warning that the novel coronavirus poses a ""very grave threat.""
So far, the virus has killed more than 1,660 and infected over 68,000 people in China. Cases have been recorded in more than two dozen countries. – Rappler.com "

AKLAN, Philippines – Malay acting town mayor Frolibar Bautista lifted the border checkpoints on Saturday, February 15, after placing restrictions on travelers who had been to mainland China.
The Malay task force reported a total of 45 foreigners without proper documents of history of travel, while 39 who had shown their passports had been to China within the last 14 days. They were refused entry to Boracay Island.
Executive Order Number 4, issued on February 6 by Bautista, directed health workers and law enforcement units to monitor the entry of any persons, regardless of nationality, before entering the town of Malay and Boracay Island over coronavirus concerns. (PH coronavirus watch: Suspected cases per region, as of February 15, 2020)
Border checkpoints were set up by the task force in Nabas-Malay boundary, barangay Dumlog, and Sitio Bacolod in barangay Caticlan, to check the passports and travel history of visitors.
All persons travelling from or transiting to China and its special administrative regions of Macau and Hong Kong for the past 14 days were temporarily banned from February 7 to 15 out of caution that travellers may be infected with the deadly virus.
Bautista said travellers to Boracay Island would receive further screening in Caticlan port. They would be advised to fill-up health declaration cards and get checked by the personnel there for common signs of coronavirus.
Visitors on roll-on roll-off vessels from Batangas and Mindoro are also required to submit their health declaration cards upon arrival at Caticlan port.
Negative for COVID-19
Meanwhile, 9 persons under investigation (PUIs) in Aklan were discharged from Aklan provincial hospital. The 9 cases had been found |negative for infection of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), according to the Provincial Health Office (PHO-Aklan).
A bus driver who was put in quarantine in Aklan training center in Kalibo, Aklan was also discharged on February 15. The male patient had no travel history to infected countries and had no close contact with confirmed coronavirus patients, but insisted on self-quarantine after experiencing flu-like symptoms.
With the lifting of the Taiwan travel ban, airports and seaports in Aklan are on heightened surveillance to examine passengers in a bid to stop the spread of coronavirus.
Taiwan is the third largest source market of Boracay Island, with 30,624 arrivals last year.
Provincial Health Officer I Dr. Cornelio Cuachon said the provincial inter-agency task force isolation rooms with 12 beds for PUIs in Dr. Rafael S. Tumbokon Memorial Hospital (DRSTMH) in Kalibo, Aklan and the Aklan training center as temporary holding area for persons under monitoring (PUMs).
Augmentation personnel from Department of Health (DOH) are also deployed in airports and district hospitals to help in monitoring coronavirus cases. – Rappler.com "

CEBU CITY, Philippines – At least 25 Filipinos who were quarantined in Busay village in Cebu, after disembarking from their Taiwan flight in Mactan-Cebu International Airport, are now home.
On Tuesday, February 11, 78 passengers were held at the Mactan airport when the Philippines included Taiwan in its temporary travel ban because of the novel coronavirus or COVID-19. They initially refused quarantine.
The 25 passengers were assigned to the provincial quarantine facility in Busay village, while the rest were sent to facilities provided by Cebu City and Department of Health Central Visayas. (READ: Cebu readies another quarantine area amid coronavirus threat)
Those assigned in the Busay quarantine unit complained of the poor facilities such as lack of electricity and running water, as well as, smelly blankets. They also said that they were not provided with bed sheets.
Apart from the 25, at least 5 were from Hong Kong.
Because of the complaints, the Cebu provincial government decided to move them, including those in the Hong Kong flight, to another quarantine facility in Pinamungajan on Friday, February 14.
Still, the 25 passengers from Taiwann opted to go home instead. Of the 25, 21 people went to their residences in Davao while the 4 others went home within the province.
The 4 from Cebu were made to sign a document committing to immediately get themselves checked into a hospital should they feel flu-like symptoms.
As of writing, no one checked in the Busay facility.
Meanwhile, there are 24 people being observed at the provincial quarantine facility in Lahug. They were from Hong Kong and Macau.
The Philippines on Friday lifted the travel ban imposed on Taiwan, after the latter protested.
The chairperson of the Manila Economic and Cultural Office in Taipei warned that Taiwan could cancel visa-free privileges for Filipinos in retaliation to the ban.
Philippine health officials said however that the lifting of the ban has nothing to do with the threat of cancelling the visa-free privileges.
There are 3 confirmed cases in the Philippines, including one death. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – The Philippine government's inter-agency task force (IATF) handling the novel coronavirus crisis has decided on Friday, February 14, to lift the travel ban imposed on Taiwan due to the virus. 
""The lifting of travel restrictions for Taiwan has been agreed by the members of the IATF by reason of the strict measures they (Taiwan) are undertaking, as well as the protocols they are implementing to address the COVID-19,"" Presidential Spokesperson Salvador Panelo said, referring to the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Disease. 
Panelo said the lifting of the ban is ""effective immediately.""
""Accordingly, travel may now be made by any national to Taiwan from the Philippines and vice versa,"" Panelo said.
Malacañang's announcement came 4 days after the Department of Health revealed that Taiwan was covered by the temporary travel ban imposed by the Philippines on mainland China and its special administrative regions to prevent the spread of the virus. 
Last Monday, February 10, Health Undersecretary Eric Domingo said Taiwan was included because the World Health Organization recognizes it as part of China.
Since Monday's announcement, the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in the Philippines has denounced the move, saying Taiwan was ""wrongly included"" in the ban. 
The chairperson of the Manila Economic and Cultural Office in Taipei warned that Taiwan could cancel visa-free privileges for Filipinos in retaliation to the ban. 
But Health Secretary Francisco Duque III, speaking to reporters after the IATF meeting on Friday, said the decision to lift the ban had nothing to do with the threat to cancel visa-free privileges.
""(This is) purely on public health and safety, and of course the need to see whether there is a threat or increased risk if we didn't allow the travel from Taiwan to the Philippines,"" Duque said.
Asked what specific protocols observed by Taiwan made the task force decide to lift the ban, Duque said the DOH would release a more detailed report next week.
But the health chief did imply that one of the reasons was that Taiwan has not yet reported local transmission of COVID-19. Outside of China, Singapore, Japan, Thailand, Hong Kong, Germany, France, Vietnam, South Korea, and Australia have reported local transmission of the disease.
Taiwan, a self-ruled democracy, has found itself increasingly caught up in travel restrictions aimed at China, where the outbreak has killed over 1,380 people and infected over 63,000, as of Friday.
On Friday, Panelo said the inter-agency task force will also evaluate other jurisdictions, including Macau, for possible lifting of the travel ban. 
""We have said from the very start that this (travel ban) will be subject to risk assessment. This has been a temporary ban to begin with, and there hasn't been any decision by the IATF that has been set in stone,"" Duque said. 
Health officials in the Philippines have so far probed 455 patients for the novel coronavirus, including 3 confirmed cases. Two of the cases have since recovered, while one died due to severe pneumonia because of the novel coronavirus. – Rappler.com "

Wondering how you can show your affection on Valentine’s Day amid the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) scare? Let Health Secretary Francisco Duque III count the ways.
Asked during a February 14 press briefing how best to celebrate Valentine’s given the health department’s advisory asking people to avoid crowded gatherings, Duque said, “The best greeting is like this,” then waved his hand in greeting. 
You can also acknowledge the other person by slightly bowing your head and putting your hand to the opposite chest “if you want the Namaste,” the health chief said, referring to a customary Hindu greeting.   
If you want to give your loved one a kiss, it would be best to give them a flying kiss, and this is how to do it correctly, according to the health chief, “When you do the flying kiss, make sure it (your hand) does not touch your lips, and you also don’t talk while you are delivering the kiss.”
Duque had a light exchange with Malacañang reporters amid immense pressure on the health department to level up its response to the new virus. So far, the Philippines only has 3 confirmed cases  and no case of human transmission. One of them died after developing severe pneumonia due to the virus, but the other two recovered from the respiratory disease and have since been discharged from the hospital. 
The virus has killed 1,383 people and infected over 64,400 others, mainly in China. The health department heads the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Infectious Diseases, which leads government efforts to contain the spread of the new disease. 
The task force’s resounding advice to the public has been to practice proper hygiene and coughing etiquette. The virus can be transmitted through respiratory droplets, which means that when an infected person coughs or sneezes, droplets carrying the virus could reach infect other people. 
In the meantime, the task force also recommended a temporary travel ban on travelers coming from mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan. Taiwan has since contested its inclusion, even warning that visa-free privileges for Filipinos there could be suspended due to the ban.  – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – Health Secretary Francsico Duque III said it is premature to assume that the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) crisis is stabilizing as “blindspots continue to characterize the virus.”  
The health chief said this during a Malacañang press briefing on Friday, February 14, discussing the government’s preparedness to respond to the disease, which has killed 1,383 people and infected over 64,400 others, mainly in China.  
Answering questions about whether there are signs that the situation could be stabilizing, Duque said, “I don’t want to be a killjoy, but it’s premature. We’ve seen some initial trending that it’s not consistent. We have to wait for more data to come in and to establish a trending that’s more consistent, whether it’s plateauing or going down. Still, the situation remains fluid.”
For this, the DOH relies on regular risk assessment reports from the World Health Organization (WHO), the UN agency working closely with Chinese authorities to establish more facts about the new virus and the disease it causes. For instance, there are still no conclusive reports to say that 2019-nCoV transmission could be airborne. 
“Blindspots here continue to characterize this virus and the efforts to familiarize ourselves with this virus is ongoing. Science has never been more active than it is today precisely to continue to characterize the very granular aspects of this virus,” the health chief added. 
According to a February 10 Agence France-Presse report, the WHO said there were “tentative signs the epidemic (was) stabilizing” but that there might “be more infections abroad in people who have never traveled to China.” 
So far, local transmission of 2019-nCoV has been reported in Singapore, Japan, Thailand, Hong Kong, Germany, France, Vietnam, South Korea, and Australia. There is no local transmission yet in the Philippines, but Duque said that the government is treating it as a possibility in the Philippines. 
455 patients probed
The health department has so far probed 455 patients for 2019-nCoV in the Philippines as of February 14. Of the 455, 191 remain admitted in hospitals across the country, while 258 have been discharged. 
Of the accumulated total of 455, 386 patients have already tested negative for the virus while 66 cases are still pending test results. 
The DOH on Friday also announced another death of a patient under investigation, but confirmed that the new fatality died due to cardiovascular attack and in fact tested negative for the virus. 
According to the DOH, the patient, a 71-year-old Filipino from La Union who had a history of travel to Taiwan, was admitted to the hospital after “manifesting with coughs.” He died Thursday night, February 13. 
Two other patients being probed for possible 2019-nCoV infection have died from other illnesses. All 3 fatalities subsequently tested negative for 2019-nCoV.
So far, the Philippines has confirmed 3 cases of 2019-nCoV in the country. One of them died after developing severe pneumonia due to the virus, but the other two recovered from the respiratory disease and have since been discharged from the hospital. – Rappler.com  "

City health officials immediately admitted the patient to the isolation room of the James L. Gordon Memorial Hospital here to undergo the mandatory two-week quarantine for travellers who have been to China during their trip abroad.
Mayor Rolen Paulino Jr said the traveller is now being monitored and is listed as Olongapo's first person under investigation for possibly contracting the  coronavirus disease or COVID-19.
Dr. Rodrick Bustamante, head of the city health office, said it was commendable that the patient voluntarily sought the assistance of local authorities upon showing flu-like symptoms.
Bustamante said the patient has undergone test for the COVID-19 virus. He said the results of the test would immediately be made public.
Health officials here have also started contact tracing to find out who were with the patient during the overseas trip. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – Labor Secretary Silvestre Bello III wants the Duterte administration's travel ban on Taiwan, which was imposed due to the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), to be lifted for overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) who wish to return there.
Though confident that the ban will be lifted soon, Bello said on Thursday, February 13, that he has asked the Department of Health (DOH) to exempt OFWs bound for Taiwan.
The DOH leads the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases and, along with agencies like the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Department of the Interior and Local Government, decides on matters like travel restrictions aimed at preventing the spread of 2019-nCoV.
""For those who are affected by the travel ban in Taiwan, we ask for your patience, and in a few days, there will be a review,"" Bello said.
""We are seeking understanding from our OFWs because the implementation of a temporary ban by the DOH is for your own safety as well. We hope for a possible lifting of the ban in a few days.""
In the meantime, the labor department will provide P10,000 in financial aid to OFWs stranded in the Philippines. It will also help OFWs with accommodation and transportation.
So far, the ban is in place for travelers to and from mainland China, its special administrative regions of Macau and Hong Kong, and Taiwan. Only Filipinos and permanent resident visa holders are allowed to enter the Philippines, while Filipinos cannot go to the areas included in the ban.
The DOH admitted that it initially overlooked the ban on Taiwan due to ""confusion"" among involved agencies, but started implementing it the weekend of February 8 to 9.
Taiwan is included in the ban as the Philippines has a One-China policy, meaning it ""respects the position of the Chinese government that there is but one China and that Taiwan is an integral part of Chinese territory."" The World Health Organization also recognizes Taiwan as part of China in its situation reports about 2019-nCoV. 
But Taiwan has since denounced the Philippine government's move, asserting it is not part of China.
There are now concerns that Taiwan may cancel visa-free privileges for Filipinos in retaliation for the travel ban.
So far, the Philippines has 3 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus. They are imported cases, the patients having traveled from China. One of them died, while the other two have since recovered.
As of Thursday noon, the novel coronavirus has killed 1,368 people and infected over 60,300 people worldwide. – Rappler.com

MANILA, Philippines – The Department of Health (DOH) has probed a total of 441 patients for the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) as of Thursday, February 13. 
This is an increase of  33 from the total of 408 the previous day, February 12. 
Of the 441patients, 230 are currently admitted in hospitals, while 206 have been discharged but are still being monitored daily by the DOH in case they develop symptoms. A total of 252 patients have already tested negative for the virus, while 186 samples are still being processed by the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM).

The DOH said there are no longer reports of patients refusing admission to hospitals. It was a problem the agency encountered last week, as at least 10 patients refused hospitalization, citing concerns about expenses. 
The health department assured those being treated in public hospitals that costs will be fully shouldered by the government. Meanwhile, for patients in private hospitals, the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation has an available insurance package for 2019-nCoV treatment.  
So far, there have been 3 confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV in the Philippines. One of them died due to severe pneumonia caused by the virus, while the other two have recovered from the infection and have since been discharged from the hospital.
All 3 are imported cases, as the patients traveled from China already carrying the virus. This means that there is still no local transmission of 2019-nCoV in the Philippines. But the health department said it was prepared in case of an outbreak of local transmission, as the World Health Organization has advised all countries to be prepared. Local transmission outside of China has so far been recorded in Singapore, Japan, Thailand, Hong Kong, Germany, France, Vietnam, South Korea, and Australia.  
The WHO has also said that the new virus constitutes a grave threat to the world, having already killed 1,369 people and infected more than 60,300, mostly in China. – Rappler.com "

'STAY CALM.' President Rodrigo Duterte delivers a taped message on the 2019 novel coronavirus. RTVM screengrab 
MANILA, Philippines – With over 400 persons under investigation for the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) in the Philippines, President Rodrigo Duterte urged Filipinos to trust in government efforts to quell the spread of the virus.
In a taped message aired on Thursday, February 13, Duterte called on Filipinos to “remain calm,” as he gave assurances that officials were working with the World Health Organization and private groups in facing the “challenge and preparing for any eventuality.”
Duterte's message comes nearly two weeks after the Philippines recorded its first confirmed case of the novel coronavirus on January 30. 

“To my fellow Filipinos, I understand that many of you are worried about the world health and the well being of our loved ones. It is normal to feel anxious, concerned, and even afraid,” he said.
“I call on our people to remain calm, vigilant, responsible and I also ask your trust and cooperation, support as we face the challenge. Tayo ay magkaisa (Let us unite) together as one nation, this challenge can be overcome,” the President added.
Apart from this, Duterte gave an update on the current situation of the virus in the country reiterating the findings of health officials that no local transmission has been found in the Philippines to date. He likewise gave a recap of measures taken by the government to address the virus, including the repatriation of 30 Filipinos from China – ground zero of the coronavirus outbreak.
Duterte said the government was ready to bring home more Filipinos from China should they wish to be repatriated.
Meanwhile, he reminded the public to observe good cough etiquette, maintain personal hygiene, and practice frequent hand washing to prevent the spread of the virus.
Slow to act? Duterte earlier got flak for his initial response to the virus, with many saying he was slow to act compared to other leaders who swiftly put in place sweeping restrictions to quell the spread of the virus.
In his initial messages on the coronavirus, Duterte told Filipinos ""everything is well"" in the Philippines and that there's ""nothing really to be extra scared of."" He said public ""hysteria"" over the coronavirus was ""unwarranted"" and that the virus would “die a natural death” as he expressed confidence in medical advances. 
Duterte had also hit xenophobic calls to bar all Chinese from entering the Philippines, saying it was in “bad taste.” He later joked he would “slap” the virus while later saying the government was “on top” of the coronavirus threat.
The Department of Health has confirmed 3 cases of the novel coronavirus in the Philippines. These include the first death outside China – a 44-year-old Chinese man who traveled to the Philippines from Wuhan. The other two cases had recovered from the virus.
Read President Duterte’s full message below:
To my fellow Filipinos,
Today, we face the very grave threat of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 or COVID-19. As of now there are only 3 confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection. None of those infected is a Filipino national. There is no evidence yet of local community transmission here in our country.
The government, together with the World Health Organization (WHO), medical societies and partners in private sectors is addressing the challenge and preparing for any eventuality.
Last Sunday, we repatriated several of our countrymen from the affected areas in China. The government is taking care of them while they are in quarantine.
To our kababayans who remain in lockdown areas in China, I assure you that the government is ready to bring you home if you want. Hindi naman kayo papabayaan.
To my fellow Filipinos, I understand that many of you are worried about the world health and the well being of our loved ones. It is normal to feel anxious, concerned and even afraid.
Maging malinis. Hugasan 'yung kamay frequently, 'yung paulit-ulit. Kung every handshake mo, kung humatsing ka, takpan mo bunganga mo at tingnan mo hindi ka makahawa sa ibang tao. Kung ikaw naman ay may ubo, magmask ka na lang.
Maging maingat at 'yung mga impormasyon na importante na manggaling sa WHO, ay ating pakinggan. At huwag makinig diyan sa mga haka-haka. Sa gobyerno kayo nakatutok.
Nandiyan ang totoo sa gobyerno, wala diyan sa mga taong haka-haka na wala namang ginawa kung hindi manakot para kapwa niya tao.
I call on our people to remain calm, vigilant, responsible and I also ask your trust and cooperation, support as we face the challenge. Tayo ay magkaisa together as one nation, this challenge can be overcome.
Maraming salamat po.

MANIILA, Philippines – Then chairperson of the Manila Economic and Cultural Office (MECO) in Taipei warned on Wednesday, February 12, that Taiwan could cancel visa-free privileges for Filipinos in retaliation for its inclusion in the travel restrictions imposed by the Philippines in relation to the novel coronavirus outbreak. 
MECO Chair Angelito Banayo said Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen met with her Cabinet and ordered that a list of possible retaliatory measures be drafted against the Philippines due to its the travel ban that covers Taiwan, based on Manila's adherence to a one-China policy.  
“Maraming (There are many) possible retaliatory measures.... One possible retaliatory measure is i-cancel ‘yun (they will cancel [visa-free entry for Filipinos]),” Banayo said in an interview with DZMM.
""Posible rin 'yun ang unang hakbang,"" he added. (It could be a first step.)
Taiwan earlier denounced the Duterte administration's move to include it in temporary travel restrictions, saying the Philippine government had ""wrongly included"" it in its ban against non-Filipino travelers coming from China, Hong Kong, and Macau.
The Philippines belatedly clarified that Taiwan was included in its travel ban since the World Health Organization (WHO) recognizes it as part of China.
Taiwan, a self-ruled democracy, has found itself increasingly caught up in travel restrictions aimed at China, where the outbreak has killed more than 1,100 people and infected over 44,600, as of Wednesday. It likewise maintained it is a ""factual error"" for the WHO to regard it as part of China.
""The Philippines should not be misled by WHO's wrong information on Taiwan.... We urge the Philippine government to immediately correct its decision on Taiwan and remove Taiwan from the travel ban,"" the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in the Philippines said in an earlier statement.
Taiwan started implementing a visa-free policy in 2017, allowing Filipinos to enter Taiwan and stay for up to 14 days. It extended the policy until July 2020 as ""a display of Taiwan's amity with the Philippines.""
Duterte to 'review' ban
Responding to Taiwan's protest, Presidential Spokesperson Salvador Panelo said concerns would be relayed to President Rodrigo Duterte, though he maintained the ban was in place as part of efforts to quell the spread of the coronavirus.
""We will relay to the President the request of certain quarters to reconsider the travel ban to Taiwan,"" Panelo told reporters in an interview.
""The reason why we are effecting the travel ban is because we are trying to protect our countrymen from the infected. If there is no infection there, we will give it to the President [to review],"" he added.
Taiwan earlier assured the public it has taken ""all measures needed"" to swiftly contain the spread of the novel coronavirus. As of Wednesday, Taiwan recorded 18 confirmed coronavirus cases.
The WHO earlier declared the outbreak a global emergency, triggering several countries, including the Philippines, to set travel restrictions largely focused on China. – with reports from Agence France-Presse/Rappler.com

CEBU CITY, Philippines – Seventy-eight passengers have been held at the Mactan Cebu International Airport (MCIA) since Tuesday, February 11, for refusing quarantine when they arrived. (READ: Taiwan covered by travel ban due to novel coronavirus – DOH)
The passengers were apparently in the air – or on a quick transit – when the Philippines issued a clarification on Monday, February 10, that Taiwan was among the countries included in the travel ban on China and its special administrative regions due to the novel coronavirus or Covid-19.  
The Philippines and the World Health Organization consider Taiwan as a part of China. Taiwan denounced its inclusion in the travel ban shortly after the announcement, asserting it is an independent state.
MCIA manager Steve Dicdican told reporters in a chance interview, streamed by local newspaper The Freeman, that the passengers were upset when they disembarked from their flight because they did not know about the clarification until they arrived in Cebu.
He said they protested the mandatory quarantine. Another staff member described the passengers as ""enraged."" “This started yesterday (Tuesday), a lot of them were transiting only from Taiwan. They're in the holding room. We're trying to convince them to go on 14-day quarantine,” Dicdican said
 Filipinos are not included in the ban, but in Cebu province, arriving passengers from banned countries must undergo a 14-day quarantine period. (READ: Cebu readies another quarantine area amid coronavirus threat)
 According to Dicdican, majority of them were only transiting in Taiwan. Many of the passengers are also not from Metro Cebu, and outside of areas where Department of Health can inspect if they are qualified for home quarantine.  To be qualified for home quarantine, a Bureau of Quarantine officer has to check if anyone living in the household might be susceptible to catching the virus.
Currently, there is space for 250 in the quarantine facilities prepared by the province of Cebu and the Department of Health.
Cebu is a major tourist destination in the country. All 3 of the confirmed cases of novel coronavirus in the country passed through Cebu en route to other destinations. One of them became the first Covid-19 death outside of China.
There are 54 patients under investigation by the DOH in Central Visayas for possible exposure to Covid-19. 
According to Dicdican, the passengers are being fed by the Cebu provincial government, and none are exhibiting flu-like symptoms.
 The airport has been under a state of emergency since the World Health Organization declared the novel coronavirus an international emergency on January 31.
The airport manager said they would continue convincing the passengers to go under quarantine. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – The Philippines stands to lose at least P42.9 billion in tourism revenues due to the threat of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), Tourism Secretary Bernadette Puyat said on Wednesday, February 12.
During the House hearing on the economic impact of 2019-nCoV, Cavite 7th District Representative Jesus Crispin Remulla asked Puyat how much the Philippines has lost in terms of tourism receipts.
Puyat explained that P42.9 billion ($848.62 million) is the projected revenue loss for February to April this year, as the Philippines banned non-Filipino travelers coming from China, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan.
""P42.9 billion, it's going to be for February, March, and April,"" Puyat said, explaining that it was computed based on the past 3 years' data.
Remulla pressed further, asking how much ""exactly"" has the Philippines lost since the travel ban was enforced.
But Puyat could only give the estimate of P16.8 billion ($332.33 million) for the month of February.
""If we compute the whole of February, it will be P16.8 billion, but we are still halfway. This is only based on our forecast,"" she said.
When it comes to flights, Puyat, citing Civil Aeronautics Board data, said 465 flights have been canceled as of Tuesday, February 11, totaling 101,452 seats.
The Philippines also lost at least 14,211 tourists from 11 canceled cruise calls to various ports in Luzon and the Visayas. (READ: Finance team says PH economy 'can handle' coronavirus effects)
Before the travel ban was enforced, the Department of Tourism (DOT) had projected a total of 795,250 visitors from China, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan from February to April. This is less than 10% of the 9.2 million tourist arrivals targeted for the entire 2020.
But other markets have decreased trips to the Philippines, too, because of the 2019-nCoV threat:

Europe - decreased bookings to the Philippines, some have canceled their trips
United States - reported cancellations in Philippine Airlines flights
Japan - 643 people have reportedly canceled their trips
Korea - 6,576 airline booking cancellations, while 2,368 people canceled package tours
Australia - government encourages domestic travel instead

To recover lost revenues, Puyat said the DOT is working with major airlines to roll out ""more value-added tour packages, discounted accommodation rates, and marked-down prices for domestic flights.""
Puyat added that ""summer packages and multi-destination"" packages will be promoted yearlong in a bid to boost domestic tourism. (READ: Businesses worry more about Duterte gov't than novel coronavirus)
The World Health Organization has warned that the 2019-nCoV outbreak is a ""very grave threat.""
So far, it has killed at least 1,115 people and infected over 45,000, surpassing figures from the SARS outbreak of 2002-2003. – Rappler.com

BAGUIO CITY, Philippines – A 10-month-old baby and her mother are among the 9 persons under investigation (PUI) for the coronavirus in the Cordillera region.  
Amelia Pangilinan, acting regional director of the Department of Health-Cordillera, said on Wednesday, February 12, that the spike in the number of PUI is nothing to worry about as all of them voluntarily brought themselves in as part of “health seeking behavior.”  
Three of the 9 are in Baguio while 3 others are in Abra. The rest are from Mountain Province and Benguet.  
The 5 previous PUI have been discharged. They included a Chinese student who came from a province near Wuhan, the ground zero of Covid-19. 
The infant and her mother just happened to make a stop-over in Hongkong. Many of the 9 also have history of travel to China, Pangilinan said. 
Some of them are domestic help while one is an English teacher in China who happens to be on vacation.  
Cagayan Valley remains to have the most number of PUI in Northern Luzon with 18 and no one discharged yet.  
Pangasinan also had its first PUI, a 28-year-old woman from Lingayen town who went to Taiwan for a vacation.
As of morning of Wednesday, February 12, there are 382 patients under investigation in the Philippines. Of the 3 confirmed cases, one died due to pneumonia, while the two others were discharged – meaning, they tested negative twice already.
Abroad, 6 Filipinos are confirmed to have contracted the virus: one the United Arab Emirates and 5 in Japan.

MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – The Department of Health (DOH) has probed a total of 408 patients for the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) as of Wednesday noon, February 12.
This marks an increase of 26 from the 382 reported on Tuesday, February 11.
A total of 208 have already tested negative for 2019-nCoV, while 197 cases are still pending test results from the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM).
Of the 408 patients under investigation, 238 are currently admitted in hospitals after showing symptoms, while 165 have already been discharged. Health Undersecretary Eric Domingo said none of the symptomatic patients have severe symptoms.

The discharged patients are still under strict monitoring, which means that the DOH communicates with them daily for updates in case they begin to show symptoms.
Domingo also said they have no longer received reports of patients refusing admission. The health official last week disclosed that at least 10 patients refused admission to hospitals, citing concerns about expenses.
The DOH has promised that treatment in public hospitals will be shouldered by the government, and that the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation has launched an assistance package for patients being probed for 2019-nCoV in private hospitals.
Here is the breakdown of patients per region:

Ilocos Region - 5

Still no local transmission
So far, there have been 3 confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV in the Philippines. One of them died due to severe pneumonia caused by the virus, while the other two have recovered from the infection and have since been discharged from the hospital.
All 3 are imported cases, as the patients traveled from China already carrying the virus. This means that there is no local transmission of 2019-nCoV in the Philippines yet, Domingo said. (READ: Time to prepare for possibility of wider coronavirus transmission in PH) 
Local transmission outside of China has so far been recorded in Singapore, Japan, Thailand, Hong Kong, Germany, France, Vietnam, South Korea, and Australia, according to Domingo.
The health official said the DOH and Philippine hospitals are ready for the possibility of local transmission.
""The WHO (World Health Organization) has signified that we should all get ready because they've been seeing it happen in other countries, even in countries that are far [from China]. So all countries must prepare,"" he said.
The DOH is looking to expand laboratory testing for the virus as part of its disease detection efforts. Domingo said the DOH is eyeing 4 subnational reference laboratories connected with the RITM for 2019-nCoV testing. He also said the RITM will readily train private hospitals interested in assisting with disease detection efforts.
The WHO declared the 2019-nCoV outbreak a global public health emergency, warning that it constitutes a ""very grave threat"" for the world. It has killed at least 1,115 people and infected over 45,000, surpassing figures from the SARS outbreak of 2002-2003. – Rappler.com  "

MANILA, Philippines – The Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in the Philippines (TECO) denounced the Duterte administration's move to include Taiwan in travel restrictions imposed over the novel coronavirus.
In a statement on Tuesday night, February 11, TECO said Taiwan was ""wrongly included"" in the ban against non-Filipino travelers coming from China, Hong Kong, and Macau.
""The Republic of China (Taiwan) is a sovereign and independent state. Taiwan issues its own passport and visas and has exclusive jurisdiction over its people and territory. In fact, Taiwan is not, nor has it ever been, part of the PRC (People's Republic of China),"" TECO said.
Taiwan, a self-ruled democracy, has found itself increasingly caught up in travel restrictions aimed at China, where the outbreak has killed more than 1,100 people and infected over 44,600.
The Philippines on Monday, February 10, announced Taiwan was included in a temporary travel ban imposed on mainland China and its special administrative regions since the World Health Organization (WHO) recognizes it as part of China.
The Philippines also observes a one-China policy as stated in the 1975 Joint Communique between the Chinese and Philippine governments, which ""respects the position of the Chinese government that there is but one China and that Taiwan is an integral part of Chinese territory.""
Health Undersecretary Eric Domingo, however, admitted that the inclusion of Taiwan in the expanded ban was not immediately implemented because of ""confusion"" among involved agencies. Implementation for non-Filipino travelers only began over the weekend.
Taiwan maintains it is a ""factual error"" for the WHO to regard it as part of China.
""To confuse Taiwan with China has caused troubles for our side and in the international community,"" Taiwan foreign ministry spokeswoman Joanne Ou said, adding the ""Chinese factor is obvious"" in Manila's decision to include Taiwan in travel restrictions.
""The Philippines should not be misled by WHO's wrong information on Taiwan.... We urge the Philippine government to immediately correct its decision on Taiwan and remove Taiwan from the travel ban,"" added TECO.
Taiwan likewise assured the public it has taken ""all measures needed"" to swiftly contain the spread of the novel coronavirus.
Aside from the Philippines, Italy has banned flights by Taiwanese carriers, Bangladesh has stopped Taiwanese travelers from entering, while Mongolia initially enacted a ban and then said it would review visa applications on a case-by-case basis.

Our region is at a critical juncture in the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak. The majority of cases are still in China, but the virus has now been confirmed in many parts of the world. While we must continue efforts to contain its spread, it is also time that all countries, including the Philippines, prepare for the possibility of wider transmission. (READ: Coronavirus death toll reaches 1,110 – gov't)
There are now some reports of clusters of cases with no apparent link to transmission in China. The latest information suggests that the virus may be more transmissible than early data suggested. This does not mean that the virus will start spreading easily within the Philippines or elsewhere tomorrow, or perhaps ever – of course, we hope that it won’t. But while countries are still working hard on containing the virus, we must be ready in case there is wider spread. This requires action today, because preparation takes time, especially to ensure that the response reaches everyone in all parts of the country. 
Responding to wider transmission would require shifting the focus of activities to protect the vulnerable and minimize the health and social impact. If we don’t prepare now, we will not be able to activate and implement those plans when they are needed. (READ: WHO warns of 'very grave' global virus threat)
For example, in case of wider community transmission, we would need to ensure health facilities can focus on treating the most vulnerable and severe cases. This may mean planning to switch away from medically isolating or quarantining everyone who is infected, to encouraging people with mild illness to stay at home to recover – so that health care facilities do not become overwhelmed. Steps must also be taken to ensure health facilities do not become places that amplify the virus’ spread, infecting staff and other patients. (READ: 382 patients probed for novel coronavirus in PH)
We must also be ready to make a switch away from testing all suspected cases and tracing the contacts of every person who has the virus, to instead applying limited testing capacity to monitor geographical spread and trends – and using this information to inform decisions about the most appropriate public health response.
In addition, we need to be ready to consider the possibility of closing schools or postponing mass gatherings, if necessary, to reduce opportunities for the virus to spread.
I understand why people are worried, as this is a new disease and there is much we still don’t know. The best thing we can do is to be prepared. In addition to those measures governments can take, we all share a collective responsibility to take simple measures to protect not just ourselves as individuals, but our communities, including the most vulnerable. These measures are important in any stage of an outbreak. 
Wash your hands – frequently, and thoroughly. If you are coughing or sneezing, cover your nose and mouth with a tissue or your elbow. Keep your distance – we recommend at least 1 meter – from people who are unwell. If you’re sick, stay home so you don’t risk infecting others – and seek medical care if you have trouble breathing. And please, don’t circulate rumors and misinformation online and to your friends and family. When people have the wrong information, they can make decisions which actually harm themselves, and others.
In addition to looking at the virus’ transmissibility, we are closely monitoring its severity. Of all cases reported in China to date, around 2% of people have died. Outside of Hubei province, the death rate among those infected is around 0.4%.
We must continue to watch the transmissibility and severity of the virus closely and assess the situation as it evolves. In the meantime, we urge countries to prepare. Even if, in the end, there is no need to switch on these measures in response to the COVID-19 outbreak, this is always time and effort well-spent – because it makes us better prepared for the next new disease or outbreak, whenever that may occur.
WHO will continue to support the Philippines and all countries in their preparedness and response efforts. The current outbreak is a test for all of us, but by focusing not only on what confronts us today, but planning ahead for tomorrow, taking steps to ensure preparedness efforts reach every corner of every country, together we will be able to limit the health, social, and economic impacts. – Rappler.com

MANILA, Philippines – President Rodrigo Duterte once again turned to the military when confronting problems faced by the government, saying he would tap uniformed personnel to ensure order in the country in the event the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak becomes a pandemic.
Duterte on Monday, February 10, said he wanted the military and police to instill public order should the spread of the coronavirus worsen. He likewise said that while the government was ""on top"" of the ""idiot"" coronavirus threat, doctors should work double-time to find a cure to the virus.
""Kung sabihin mo na ano, pandemic talaga (If you say it's really a pandemic already), then I will have to utilize for order and obedience of people, the military and the police,"" Duterte said in a speech before local chief executives.
Earlier in his speech, Duterte rejected criticisms his administration was slow to act on the coronavirus and that it lacked the infrastructure to deal with such an outbreak. He cited the expertise and restrictive measures taken by health officials as proof it was dealing with the disease.
Despite this, Duterte continued to downplay the spread of the coronavirus, saying the public would rely on the strength of Filipinos' antibodies to prevent the spread and further contamination from the virus.
""You want to shout to the heavens? Go ahead. Will it prevent the coronavirus from entering the country? Long before the alarm was raised marami nang mga (there were many) Chinese and Filipinos...na pumunta na doon (who went there [Wuhan]. So kung sabihin mo (So if you say) it's a matter of contamination, we will just have to rely on how strong the antibodies of the Philippines are,"" Duterte said.

Duterte also sought to give assurances once more that Filipinos had nothing to worry about as he said the government was ""doing its best"" to respond to the spread of the coronavirus in the Philippines.
""Maniwala lang kayo sa gobyerno (Just have faith in the government), in a crisis involving deaths and getting people sick, we will do our very best,"" he said.
While health officials have given assurances they are closely monitoring suspected novel coronavirus cases in the country, they repeatedly reminded the public to practice good personal hygiene such as frequent handwashing and to seek medical treatment immediately, if necessary.
So far, health officials announced 284 patients were under investigation for the coronavirus in the Philippines.
The Department of Health has confirmed 3 cases of the novel coronavirus in the Philippines. These include the first death outside China – a 44-year-old Chinese man who traveled to the Philippines from Wuhan. The man was the country's second confirmed case of the novel coronavirus, and a companion of the first patient, a 38-year-old Chinese woman, who has since recovered from the virus.
The Philippines' third confirmed case, a 60-year-old woman from China, also subsequently tested negative for the novel coronavirus after a few days in the hospital and has since returned to China.
As of Monday, the novel coronavirus has killed over 900 and sickened over 40,000 globally, with China as the worst-hit country. Meanwhile, at least 3,400 have reportedly recovered. – Rappler.com "

CEBU, Philippines – The Cebu Provincial Board on Monday, February 10, passed on first, second, and third reading an ordinance against the spread of false information regarding the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). 
The ordinance will penalize people spreading false information on social media or text about the disease. The penalties will range from a fine of up to P5,000 or less than one year of jail time.
Residents who see posts online containing fake nCoV-related news or who receive text messages on the 2019-nCoV should pass on their complaints to the Provincial Legal Office.
The ordinance also prohibits and penalizes any misdeclaration of information on Health Declaration Cards which passengers are required to fill in. 
Pertinent information filled in by passengers – such as whether or not passengers have been in China, Macau, or Hong Kong in the past 14 days – will be counterchecked by the Bureau of Immigration upon checking passports. The same penalties for fake news also apply for any falsification in the health cards.
The Office of the Governor cerified the ordinance as urgent.
According to 4th District Board Member Honorable Kerrie Shimura, chairperson on the Committee of Health and Social Services, the ordinance is in line with Executive Order (EO) 5 and 5-A series of 2020, recently signed by Governor Gwen Garcia.
Workers in local government offices violating the protocols provided by the preceding EOs will be dealt administrative disciplinary action, including civil or criminal actions allowed by the Local Government Code.
EO 5 explains the protocols on the travel ban along and the hybrid quarantine system. Filipinos and permanent visa holders from China, Macau or Hong Kong or any country but have been in the enumerated states for the past 14 weeks are given the option to choose to undergo a home-based quarantine or a facility quarantine. EO 5-A, meanwhile, is the protocol for seaports on both passenger and cargo vessels.
Both are preventive executive orders meant to address confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV.
As of Monday, February 10, the number of those who have died from 2019-nCoV has reached over 900. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – The first patient confirmed to have the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in the Philippines has recovered from the infection, the Department of Health (DOH) confirmed on Monday, February 10.  
Health Undersecretary Eric Domingo said that the 38-year-old woman from Wuhan, China, who was the Philippines' first case of the novel coronavirus, has tested negative for the virus twice and ""has in fact been discharged.""
Domingo could not confirm if the woman has already flown back to China since her release from the hospital on Saturday, February 8. 
Before testing negative for the virus, the woman had already been recovering in San Lazaro Hospital and had not been showing symptoms.  
The woman's recovery from the disease means that there are currently no living patients with the virus in the Philippines.  
The woman's traveling companion, a 44-year-old man who also tested positive for the novel coronavirus, died of complications due to severe pneumonia. 
The Philippines' third confirmed case, a 60-year-old woman from China, also subsequently tested negative for the novel coronavirus after a few days in the hospital. She has since returned to China, according to the DOH.  
The third case, Domingo had earlier said, was evidence that ""the virus can be eliminated as immune system mounts response against it.""
But the DOH still urges the public to remain vigilant and practice precautionary measures, as the disease continues to claim lives in China.
As of Monday, the novel coronavirus has killed 910 and sickened over 40,500 globally, with China as the worst-hit country. But at least 3,400 have reportedly recovered. 
As of Monday, the DOH has probed a total of 314 patients for possible novel coronavirus infection. A total of 261 patients under investigation are still admitted to hospitals, while 50 have been discharged. 
Here is the breakdown of patients under investigation per region:

Ilocos Region - 3
Cagayan Valley - 13 
Cordillera Administrative Region - 7
Central Luzon - 41
Metro Manila - 115

Only one person died due to the novel coronavirus in the Philippines, but it marked the first death due to the virus outside China. Two other patients under investigation, who both tested negative for the virus, died due to other illnesses, 
The Philippine government has imposed a temporary travel ban to mainland China and the special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau in an effort to curb the spread of the virus.
Some 30 Filipinos from Hubei province, the epicenter of the outbreak, were also repatriated on Sunday, February 9, and are currently under quarantine in New Clark City in Capas, Tarlac. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – Four more Filipinos aboard a cruise ship quarantined off Yokohama, Japan, tested positive for the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).
""The 4 Filipinos, who are all crew members, are among the 6 newly confirmed cases of the virus since the vessel was docked...on February 4,"" the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) said in a statement on Monday, February 10.
The total number of infected Filipinos on the Diamond Princess cruise ship is now at 5, with one other crew member earlier confirmed to have the virus. They are being treated in hospitals in Japan.
Dozens of other people aboard the Diamond Princess have also tested positive for 2019-nCoV.
The Japanese government quarantined the cruise ship after an 80-year-old passenger who departed from Hong Kong was found to have the virus. The ship, carrying some 3,700 passengers and crew, is anchored off a pier in the Kanagawa Prefecture capital.
The DFA earlier said 538 Filipinos were onboard the Diamond Princess.
The agency again assured the public that the Philippine embassy in Tokyo is ""closely coordinating with Japanese authorities, and is in constant communication with the Filipinos still onboard [the cruise ship], to provide them all possible assistance.""
As of Monday morning, the novel coronavirus has killed 908 people and infected over 40,000 people across 26 countries.

MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – Labor Secretary Silvestre Bello III said that financial and employment assistance will be readily available for overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) repatriated from novel coronavirus-hit areas such as China, Hong Kong, and Macau. 
Bello said the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) is ""ready with its reintegration program,"" which will consist of immediate financial assistance, as well as help with employment and livelihood opportunities. 
Repatriated OFWs will receive at least P20,000 from DOLE. ""When they come here, no questions asked, as long as they're an active member of the Overseas Workers Welfare Administration, we give financial assistance,"" Bello said.  
The labor secretary added that repatriated OFWs who choose to remain in the Philippines will get livelihood assistance from DOLE. The labor department will also assist those who end up seeking jobs abroad anew.
""We have been busy establishing labor relations with countries such as Canada, Russia, Czechoslovakia, Croatia, even China (for this purpose),"" Bello said. 
OFW parents can also apply for scholarships for their children. ""This is a long-term assistance,"" the labor chief added. 
So far, a total of 30 Filipinos have been repatriated from Hubei province in China, the epicenter of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak. 
They are now under a 14-day quarantine period at the Athletes' Village in New Clark City. None of them showed symptoms of the 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease, according to the Department of Health (DOH).  
It remains unclear whether there will be a second batch of OFWs to be repatriated and quarantined, but the Department of Foreign Affairs said it would be ready to assist them should they express interest in returning to the Philippines. 
The interagency task force on emerging infectious diseases led by the DOH is also mulling the expansion of the novel coronavirus travel ban from just mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau, to include Taiwan.
According to Bello, there are at least 120,000 documented OFWs in Taiwan.
""You can expect to add maybe another 20,000 of undocumented OFWs,"" he said. 
The DOH said the the decision will be finalized Monday, February 10, after a meeting of the task force. 
Under the current ban, all non-Filipinos traveling from China and its special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau are barred from entering the country. Travelers coming from transit points in Hong Kong are covered by the travel ban as well. Likewise, Filipinos are barred from traveling to China, Hong Kong, and Macau. 
DOLE had already said OFWs affected by the travel ban will be given P10,000, as well as assistance with accommodation and transportation from the government. The same benefits would be extended to OFWs affected by a travel ban to Taiwan, if imposed. 
Bello said that as of Monday, there are about 3,500 returning OFWs stranded in the Philippines due to the travel ban. He said that the number could rise to as high as 10,000 to 15,000. 
Department of Foreign Affairs Undersecretary Ernesto Abella said officials will reach out to the employers of the affected Filipinos to explain the government's ban.
""The consulates through POLO (Philippine Overseas Labor Office) will contact their employers and explain the situation to them,"" he said.
So far, the Philippines has 3 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus. They are imported cases, the patients having traveled from China. One of them died, one is recovering in a hospital, and the other already tested negative for the virus after a second round of tests.

MANILA, Philippines (5th UPDATE) Thirty Filipinos returned from China’s Hubei province, the epicenter of an outbreak of the deadly novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), are now back in the Philippines on Sunday morning, February 9.  
In a press statement, the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) said the repatriated Filipinos on the chartered flight which ""landed at the Haribon Hangar in Clark Air Base included 29 adults and one infant.""
Also quarantined are two individuals from the Philippine consulate in China who handled the repatriates' documents, said the Department of Health (DOH).

The DFA called for the repatriation of Filipinos in China on January 28.
However, only 30 returned to the Philippines, from the earlier announced 56, because of some circumstances on the ground.
One family, said the DFA, ""had a change of heart."" Some Filipinos there also cited the government's travel restrictions on flying back to China as their reason for staying behind, added the DFA.
Asked if there would be a 2nd batch of repatriates, the DFA said it depends on the demand. ""Also, please be reminded that the repatriation was organized mainly for the Filipinos and their families in Wuhan or Hubei because of the existing lockdown where they couldn’t move even if they wanted to.""
Levels of screening
In a separate statement, the DOH explained that the repatriates underwent 3 levels of screening before they were able to fly back home:

Only asymptomatic individuals, or those who do not show symptoms, were allowed to board.
During the flight, they were closely monitored for any symptoms.
Upon landing, they were checked again for symptoms.

Officials from the DFA and the DOH earlier said the 30 would be brought to the New Clark City Athletes’ Village and will be quarantined for 14 days, alongside the team assigned to repatriate them. 
Health Undersecretary Gerardo Bayugo said in a briefing on Sunday afternoon that ""no contamination"" happened and no one showed symptoms at the airport.
""So all the people who were repatriated are now safe and resting in the quarantine facilities in New Clark City,"" he said.
The DOH Central Luzon Center for Health Development has declared code blue for hospitals and health facilities in the region to immediately address medical needs of the repatriated Filipinos.
""If an individual, during his or her stay in the quarantine facility, suddenly shows signs and symptoms, the DOH had deployed medical teams to immediately assess and facilitate transfer to [a] hospital for close monitoring,"" added the DOH.
How the quarantine will work
Upon landing, the repatriates disembarked at the hangar, and not the passenger area, of the Clark International Airport. They will be transferred directly to the quarantine facilities at the Athletes’ Village.
There, they will each be given their own room. Medical staff will be on hand round the clock to monitor their health. Support staff will mostly be working in a separate building from the repatriates in quarantine.
The repatriates will be allowed to use mobile phones mainly to stay in touch with their families and relatives. The facility will have Wi-Fi.
The team of government representatives left Clark at 10:15 pm on Saturday, February 8, on a chartered flight from the Royal Air Charter Service, arriving in Wuhan Tianhe International Airport early morning on February 9.
In a statement on Sunday, Presidential Spokesperson Salvador Panelo said the safety of Filipinos here and abroad ""continues to be the paramount concern"" of the government.
""Let us pray for our fellow countrymen, as well as [for] the members of the repatriation team...that they do not show any symptom of having caught the virus,"" he added. – with reports from Janella Paris and Sofia Tomacruz/Rappler.com "

Of the 3 confirmed 2019-nCoV cases, the first patient, a Chinese woman, already tested negative for the virus after the most recent tests by the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine. The DOH said she was well and no longer showed symptoms.
The second patient, the first patient’s partner who traveled with her to the Philippines from Wuhan, China, died of complications due to the novel coronavirus. His was the first death due to the virus outside China.
The third patient has since returned to China after a second round of tests showed her negative for 2019-nCoV.
Outside the Philippines, two Filipinos were reported to have contracted 2019-nCov: one is based in Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates, and the other, a crew member of a Japanese cruise ship.
On Saturday night, the Philippine government sent a chartered flight to Wuhan, China, to repatriate at least 26 Filipinos from Hubei province, the epicenter of the 2019-nCoV outbreak.

MANILA, Philippines – The government on Saturday, February 8, started repatriating Filipinos from China’s Hubei province, the epicenter of the outbreak of the deadly novel coronavirus.
The first batch of at least 26 repatriates are expected to arrive at Clark International Airport in Pampanga at around 5 am on Sunday, February 9, and will then be brought to the New Clark City Athletes’ Village where they will be quarantined for 14 days, officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) and the Department of Health (DOH) said in a media briefing on Saturday evening.
A team of 8 representatives from the government were to depart from Clark at 10:15 pm on Saturday on board a chartered flight from the Royal Air Charter Service, and were expected to arrive at the Wuhan Tianhe International Airport at 1:15 am on Sunday.
The team consists of 3 officials from the DFA Office of the Undersecretary for Migrant Workers’ Affairs (OUMWA), and two doctors, two nurses, and one medical technologist from the DOH.
They will assist the repatriates and give them medical screenings during the 3-hour flight back to Clark onboard the same chartered plane.
Two officials from the Philippine Consulate General in Shanghai, China, accompanied the repatriates while waiting at the airport in Wuhan.
The members of the repatriation team from the DFA and DOH, and the flight crew will also be subjected to the 14-day quarantine, the officials said.
There were more than 40 people on the repatriation flight’s manifest but only 26 of them were at the airport as of 8 pm on Saturday, when the officials gave the media briefing. Only 10 more were expected to show up, but the repatriation team “will wait until the last minute,” said DFA-OUMWA Undersecretary Sarah Lou Arriola.
The others may have decided to stay behind or could not make the 10-hour trip to the airport in Wuhan, Hubei’s capital city. Still others may have problems with their visas or were caught up in cases that prevent them from exiting China, Arriola added.
The repatriates will be monitored throughout the flight home and be subjected to 3 levels of medical screenings, said DOH Undersecretary Dr. Gerardo Bayugo.
Upon landing, the repatriates will disembark at the hangar, not the passenger area, of the Clark International Airport. They will then be transferred directly to the quarantine facilities at the Athletes’ Village.
There, they will each be given their own room. Medical staff will be on hand round the clock to monitor their health. Support staff will mostly be working in a separate building from the repatriates in quarantine.
The repatriates will be allowed to use mobile phones mainly to stay in touch with their families and relatives. The facility will have WiFi connection.
Among the repatriates is an infant, Arriola said. Fearing stigma, they asked the DFA not to disclose their identities to the public.
The Philippines has had 3 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus, of whom one died on February 1. Philippine officials have so far placed a total of 267 people under a probe for the virus.
At least 722 people have died from the virus in China while more than 34,000 have been infected, according to the latest official figures.

PANIC BUYING. People look at the empty shelves at a local supermarket in Singapore after panic buying swept through the city after the government raised the alert level for a deadly novel coronavirus in Singapore on February 8. Photo by Roslan Rahman/AFP 
SINGAPORE – Philippine Ambassador Joseph Yap urged Filipinos to stay calm but vigilant after Singapore raised its disease alert level a notch higher to “code orange” due to the novel coronavirus threat.
“My personal appeal to all our kababayans (countrymen) is to stay calm, do not panic, but be vigilant. It is likely that the spread of the virus will get worse before it gets better,” Yap told Rappler on Saturday, February 8.
Yap said around 200,000 Filipinos work in Singapore – 40% as household service workers and 60% as service workers and professionals.
“I would like to emphasize that code orange encourages us to cancel or defer large-scale gatherings, avoid crowded places, and adopt heightened measures to prevent infection. Let us all do our share and contribute to the overall efforts of the Singapore government to address the problem,” the ambassador added.
Code orange refers to the 3rd highest level in Singapore’s 4-tier color-coded system for disease outbreaks, which Singapore developed after it battled the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003.
Under the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (Dorscon) of Singapore, code orange means that “the disease is severe and spreads easily from person to person, but the disease has not spread widely in Singapore and is being contained.”
Excluding the 64 novel coronavirus cases aboard a Japanese cruise ship, Singapore has the highest number of novel coronavirus cases outside China, based on data from the World Health Organization (WHO) as of Friday, February 7. No deaths linked to this virus, however, have been reported in Singapore.
China has at least 31,211 of the 31,481 novel coronavirus cases around the world. At least 637 people have died in China due to the novel coronavirus, while one has died in the Philippines.
Panic buying in Singapore
Singapore’s declaration of code orange on Friday prompted locals to rush to groceries and hoard vitamins, sanitizers, tissue papers, and instant noodles just hours after the announcement.
Many Singaporeans compared the panic buying to the “zombie apocalypse,” which, according to them, is typical of their “kiasu” culture – a fear of losing out in this highly-competitive country.
The panic buying worried the Singaporean government enough to issue an advisory against it on Friday. “Be responsible and do not hoard items. Panic and over-buying supplies will deprive others who really need these things,” the Singaporean government said.
In a video message on Saturday, Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong warned Singaporeans: “Fear can do more harm than the virus itself. It can make us panic, or do things which make matters worse, like circulating rumours online, hoarding face masks or food, or blaming particular groups for the outbreak.”

Singapore raised Dorscon code orange after a few of the 33 novel coronavirus positive cases in the country have been found to have neither links to previous coronavirus cases nor recent travels to China.
Does code orange mean the Philippines will also regulate travel by Filipinos to and from Singapore, as the Philippines did with mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau? The Philippines recently banned Filipinos from traveling to mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau, while requiring Filipinos coming from these areas to quarantine themselves for 14 days.
Yap said the embassy defers to the Philippine national government on any possible travel ban to and from Singapore.
“However, if our opinion is requested by Manila since we are more aware of the situation here in Singapore, we would suggest that there is no need for a travel advisory at this time. While there is some community spread of the virus, the spread of the virus is still very limited at 33 as of last count, and the well-organized efforts of the Singapore government to contain it, which to me are highly remarkable, should minimize the chances of widespread infection,” Yap said.
Read our full Q and A with the ambassador below:
RAPPLER: How prepared is the embassy to deal with possible coronavirus cases among the Filipinos here in Singapore?
AMBASSADOR YAP: The best preparation we are doing is basically information drive, that is to ensure that the reminders and advisories of both our government and the host country on preventive measures are properly cascaded to all Filipinos in Singapore.
Every day, the Ministry of Health (MOH) of Singapore gives updates on the status of the host government’s efforts to contain the spread of the virus. We are encouraging all our kababayans here in Singapore to do their share by keeping themselves updated and by doing their part to contribute to the overall efforts to stop the spread.
The Embassy issues regular advisories and updates to the Filipino community through its website and facebook page.
RAPPLER: What coordination is the Philippine embassy here making, if any, with the Singaporean government to protect our Filipino workers here, especially domestic helpers?
AMBASSADOR YAP: I share your particular interest in the safety of our domestic workers. But remember that the virus does not discriminate against anybody. so our reminders are directed to all our kababayans here in Singapore.
Before the Ministry of Health convened a meeting with the members of the diplomatic corps last Wednesday, we already made arrangements with them to inform us immediately if any Filipino national is confined for the 201-nCoV infection. I personally met with a Ministry official on 3 February to formally convey our request and get some updates on Singapore’s efforts to contain the spread of the virus and establish lines of communication.
The reminders and guidelines issued by the Ministry of Health of Singapore are applicable to all foreign workers, Filipinos included: observance of good personal hygiene, being socially responsible, monitoring of personal health condition, and now deferment or cancellation of large-scale events.
The Embassy has also coordinated with the MOH to ensure that our front line Filipino medical personnel are properly protected in the performance of their work. We have received the assurance of MOH that all necessary precautions and protocols are in place to protect all medical staff.
Another request we conveyed to the Ministry of Health is to inform us (Philippine Embassy) immediately if any Filipino national has been infected and confined so that our Assistance to Nationals SOP can be activated, which involves coordination with the family of the infected individual and monitoring of his or her health condition.
We will respond according to the needs of the affected individual and in coordination with the host country.
Internally, the Embassy has already organized ourselves. We have established a Task Force that is in charge of the action plans to deal with the problem.
RAPPLER: Is the Philippine government considering a travel ban to and from Singapore given the declaration of code orange? Why or why not?
AMBASSADOR YAP: Every country makes a decision on such a matter on the basis of its national interest. We leave it up to our national government officials to make a decision on this. However, if our opinion is requested by Manila since we are more aware of the situation here in Singapore, we would suggest that there is no need for a travel advisory at this time. While there is some community spread of the virus, the spread of the virus is still very limited at 33 as of last count, and the well-organized efforts of the Singapore government to contain it, which to me are highly remarkable, should minimize the chances of widespread infection. Therefore, the current situation does not require such an advisory at this time.
RAPPLER: What safety tips or perhaps words of assurance can you give our kababayans as Singapore is under code orange?
YAP: My personal appeal to all our kababayans is to stay calm, do not panic but be vigilant. It is likely that the spread of the virus will get worse before it gets better. The Singapore Government and the MOH are on top of the situation. They have a multi-ministry task force that is coordinating the response of Singapore to this virus. They are very well organized and they have the added advantage of having gone through the SARs outbreak.
Let us religiously observe the guidelines of the host government, particularly in relation to the monitoring of our personal health, good personal hygiene and tips on how to avoid getting the virus.
I would like to emphasize that code orange encourages us to cancel or defer large-scale gatherings, avoid crowded places, and adopt heightened measures to prevent infection. Let us all do our share and contribute to the overall efforts of the Singapore government to address the problem
To those who want to know more about the overall picture of the virus spread in Singapore, we encourage you to visit the MOH website: www.moh.og.sg or you can email us (atnsgpe@gmail.com) or you call us through our hotline: 9072 2797

MANILA, Philippines – Zambales Governor Hermogenes Ebdane said provincial health officials were currently monitoring a patient who shared he had traveled together with two patients in the Philippines earlier confirmed to have the 2019 novel coronavirus.
In a statement, Ebdane said the patient ""voluntarily reached out to the DOH [Department of Health], divulging a history of travel together with the two Chinese patients who were tested and confirmed to be positive for the virus.""
The patient has been confined at the Ramon Magsaysay Memorial Hospital since Thursday, February 6, and was among persons under Investigation by health officials.
Ebdane said that the patient, who remained in isolation, was assessed to be ""well and stable, exhibiting no pertinent symptoms such as fever, cough, or difficulty breathing.""
He added the hospital sent the patient's specimen samples to the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine to confirm if the patient had the coronavirus.
The latest in the Philippines. Philippine authorities said they were monitoring 215 persons for the novel coronavirus as Saturday, February 8. 
So far, the Department of Health has confirmed 3 cases of the novel coronavirus in the Philippines, including the first death outside China – a 44-year-old Chinese man who traveled to the Philippines from Wuhan. The man was the country's second confirmed case of 2019-nCoV, and a companion of the first patient, a 38-year-old Chinese woman.
As of Saturday morning, February 8, the novel coronavirus has killed 720 people and infected over 34,000 people across 26 countries.

AKLAN, Philippines – A multi-agency task force has put in place strict and intensified border checkpoints when entering Boracay Island in an effort to prevent the spread of the 2019 novel coronavirus.
Acting Malay town mayor Frolibar Bautista asked law enforcement agencies and health personnel to enforce travel restrictions on visitors who have recently travelled to China, Macau and Hong Kong.
There are no longer direct flights from Wuhan, China and other cities in mainland China to Kalibo International Airport, but authorities will continue to expand health screenings of travelers, not only in local airports.
In Executive Order No. 004 series of 2020 issued on Thursday, February 6, Bautista suspended the entry of all travelers with travel history from China and its special administrative regions for the past 14 days.
The Philippine National Police, Philippine Army, Philippine Coast Guard, Bureau of Immigration and the Bureau of Quarantine are also directed to coordinate with the Malay Municipal Health Office (MHO) and Municipal Tourism Office to check incoming travellers at Malay’s seaports, airport and roads.
What to expect. On February 7, Friday, 3 border checkpoints, located within the two kilometer radius of Caticlan port, were set up in the barangays of Union (Nabas) and Caticlan (Malay) near Nabas-Malay boundary, in barangay Dumlog in mainland Malay and Sitio Bacolod in Barangay Caticlan to monitor and identify people who may have coronavirus symptoms.
The new measure to operate border checkpoints in all entry points to Malay, Aklan and Boracay Island would be the first line of defense against individuals who experienced flu-like symptoms of the contagious disease.
Meanwhile, Foreigners and local tourists arriving through Kalibo and Caticlan airports, northern Antique and Iloilo, ports of Caticlan and Alegria (Buruanga) via roll-on, roll-off vessels from Batangas and Mindoro, and motorized pumpboats from Romblon would also be screened for signs of fever and cough.
Aside from this, handheld thermometers were also operational in border checkpoints where inbound travelers to Boracay Island would be required to present their passports for verification. Health personnel and law enforcers were also wearing surgical face masks for their protection.
If a traveller shows symptoms, MHO workers will perform a more detailed medical assessment, and the traveler is taken to a hospital for further care.
No coronavirus cases. So far, there have been no reported coronavirus cases in Malay, Aklan and Boracay Island, according to task force deputy information manager Madel Joy Tayco.
The local task force on coronavirus said some 180 persons were under monitoring (PUMS) in Boracay Island as of February 7.
MHO and the task force have been cooperating closely with hotels and establishments to ensure public safety and health of residents and other visitors, and have been keeping a close watch on PUMs in the island.
Tayco also reiterated the importance of proper hygiene and hand washing to prevent infection of coronavirus which has caused deaths and illnesses worldwide. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – The Department of Health (DOH) is now probing 215 persons for the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in the Philippines as of Friday noon, February 7.
The latest figure was higher than the 178 reported the previous day, February 6. Of the 215, 185 are admitted to hospitals, 17 have been discharged, while 3 have died, two of whom due to causes other than the novel coronavirus. 
Health Undersecretary Eric Domingo said that the latest death of a patient under investigation was confirmed Thursday, February 6.
The patient, a Chinese male whose age was not disclosed, died of ""underlying restrictive lung disease."" The DOH had earlier reported the death of a patient under investigation, but for preexisting medical conditions unrelated to the novel coronavirus (READ: TIMELINE: The novel coronavirus epidemic) 
Of the 215 patients, a total of 48 already tested negative for the virus. At least 127 test results are still pending as of this posting. 
So far, there are 3 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus in the country.
The first patient already tested negative for the novel coronavirus in the latest round of tests of the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine, but another test with negative results is needed before she can be discharged from the hospital. Domingo said she is well and no longer showing symptoms. 
The second patient, her partner who traveled with her to the Philippines from Wuhan, China, died of complications due to the novel coronavirus. His death marked the first death due to the virus outside China.
The third patient has since returned to China after a second round of tests showed she was already negative for the novel coronavirus.  
Domingo disclosed that 9 patients under investigation have refused to be admitted to hospitals. He said the DOH is working with local authorities to convince them to get admitted.
According to Domingo, some have refused admission due to anxieties over hospital expenses. He said they can rest assured that expenses for the novel coronavirus treatment will be shouldered by the government. 
The increase in the number of patients under investigation came after the DOH tracked down all 441 contacts of the first two confirmed cases. The couple, who was traveling from Wuhan, China, went to Cebu and Dumaguete City before seeking medical help in Manila. 
Of the 441 contacts, 32 are included in the 215 being probed by the DOH, while 203 are under home quarantine as they showed no symptoms. 
Domingo said 206 of the contacts have yet to be interviewed by the health department's Epidemiology Bureau due to erroneous contact details. Health officials are coordinating with local authorities in Cebu and Dumaguete City to get in touch with them. 
Below is the breakdown of patients per region:

Ilocos Region - 3
Cagayan - 4

Repatriation efforts
Repatriation efforts for the 45 Filipinos who had expressed desire to be brought home from Hubei province in China are underway, with the Department of Foreign Affairs personnel coordinating with Chinese authorities for the necessary clearance.
Once in the Philippines, the returnees will be quarantined in the Athletes' Village in New Clark City in Capas, Tarlac. 
They are expected to arrive on Sunday morning, February 9, but the date is not final as the Philippines has yet to get clearance from the Chinese government for repatriation. 
Efforts of the government's interagency task force on the novel coronavirus have also been met with resistance from the Capas local government, who said they were not consulted by the agencies involved that the quarantine area will be in their community. 
""DOH did not at all involve Capas LGU in its last-minute decision for New Clark City to be used as quarantine zone,"" Capas Mayor Reynaldo Catacutan said in a statement Friday.
But in an interview with CNN Philippines, the town's vice mayor admitted that the New Clark City is under the jurisdiction of the Bases Conversion and Development Authority, which offered the facility to the DOH for use in its quarantine procedure. 
Domingo said the DOH has since reached out to the local government of Capas. He said that repatriates will be isolated and not affect any member of the community. 
He reiterated that Filipinos who are cleared by the Chinese government for repatriation will first undergo screening by Chinese health officials before boarding the chartered plane that will take them to Clark. They will then undergo another screening by DOH personnel before takeoff. If they show symptoms in China, they will be sent to Chinese health facilities for treatment.

,"February 06, 2020",nCov,"Camiguin restricts entry of travelers from China, Hong Kong, Macau over coronavirus threat",Bobby Lagsa,"
 
CAGAYAN DE ORO, Philippines – Camiguin Island will now restrict the entry of foreign tourists with travel history to China, Hong Kong, and Macau in the last 3 months as a precautionary measure against the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). 
With summer just around the corner, Camiguin is expecting an influx of tourists, from 50,000 per month to a peak of 80,000 during Holy Week.
Camiguin Governor Jurdin Jesus Romualdo on January 31 issued Executive Order (EO) No. 5, which requires every tourist to disclose their travel history in the last 3 months prior to their arrival in the island.
The EO was issued days earlier than the national government's expanded ban on travelers from the 3 countries.
Tourists from other countries who merely had a layover in China, Hong Kong, and Macau will also not be allowed to enter the island. According to the governor, they simply followed the President's order not to allow even those with a layover in China to enter the country.
Romualdo said that they have deployed screeners in Camiguin Airport and two ports to individually interview foreign tourists about their travel history.
In January, a tourist in the island was put in isolation and considered a person under investigation for the novel coronavirus. The tourist tested negative for the virus.
There were at least 130 Chinese tourists in Camiguin in the last week of January.
""The province of Camiguin is one of the tourist destinations in the Philippines, making the introduction of the disease in the province a high probability,"" Romualdo said.
He said they cannot take chances in allowing tourists with travel history to the 3 countries.
The island province also created a novel coronavirus task force to implement measures that will prevent the virus from entering the island.
""It is important that precautionary measures and protocol are established to monitor the presence of the disease and make a timely response if it arises,"" Romualdo said.
Romualdo said they instructed and trained hotel staff to report tourists suspected to have the novel coronavirus to the Camiguin Provincial Health Office and the Camiguin General Hospital. They also asked hotels to refund accommodation bookings made by Chinese tourists even before coming to the island.
""We have met with hotel operators and asked for their cooperation,"" Romualdo said.
EO covers residents, too
The EO also covers residents in the island who have travel history to China, Hong Kong, and Macau.
""This requirement is also mandatory to every resident of Camiguin who has [traveled] to places where [the] novel coronavirus has been proven to exist,"" the EO stated.
It requires residents with travel history to undergo a medical check-up.
Romualdo said the government can prosecute any person found to have willfully hidden such required information when demanded. The person shall be subject to investigation and applicable criminal prosecution.
Meanwhile in Cagayan de Oro City, Mayor Oscar Moreno thumbed down a proposal to put a business park on lockdown following hearsay of Chinese residents who supposedly have the novel coronavirus.
Earlier this week, Councilor George Goking proposed that the city's 2019-nCoV task force order a lockdown on the Alwana Business Park in Barangay Cugman. Some Chinese citizens working in Cagayan de Oro City are living in the business park's residential buildings.
A fake news circulated this week that there was a Chinese who died in one of the hotels because of the novel coronavirus. The City Health Office and the Department of Health conducted an inspection and found nothing.
""The task force did not really push through with the idea due to legal implications,"" Goking told reporters here.
Goking said that he would request it if the Alwana Business Park management refuses to cooperate with government agencies who may be conducting an ocular inspection there.
Moreno said he will not be restricting the movement of people and vehicles in and out of the complex just because Chinese nationals are living there.
""Just because they are Chinese, [does not mean] we have to look at them differently,"" Moreno said in a radio interview.
""You don't order [a] lockdown simply because of the race issue. It's not doable. What we need is simply communication, and, of course, they have been very cooperative. Let's not jump to conclusions just because they're Chinese."" Moreno added.
The novel coronavirus that originated from Wuhan, China, has so far killed 564 and sickened over 28,000 people across the country and worldwide. The World Health Organization already declared an international emergency over the virus.

MANILA, Philippines – The Department of Health (DOH) on Thursday, February 6, confirmed that the 45 Filipinos to be repatriated from Hubei province in China – the epicenter of the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak – will be quarantined in New Clark City's Athletes' Village in Tarlac. 
Health Secretary Francisco Duque III inspected the facility on Thursday morning and said that the place is ready to house the returning Filipinos, who are expected to arrive early Sunday, February 9.
Upon arrival, the overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) from Hubei will immediately be counted as patients under investigation, of which there are 178 as of Thursday. (READ: 'Novel coronavirus' or 2019 nCoV: What we know so far)
Two buildings in New Clark City, which was used during the 2019 Southeast Asian Games, will be used for quarantine – one for asymptomatic patients and the other for those who develop symptoms.
There will also be a polyclinic in the facility, where returnees who develop symptoms throughout the 14-day quarantine period will be brought and treated. The two buildings will be cordoned off from the rest of New Clark City, according to Duque. 
Contact with the outside world will be minimal, Duque said. Patients will only be allowed to communicate with their families over the internet. 
The health chief also said that medical staff from 5 nearby hospitals will alternate shifts to tend to the returnees. 
""We will be providing the needed medical logistics including hygiene kits, disinfectant solutions, transportation, and other things that will be needed in the quarantine process,"" he added.  
How repatriation will work: According to Foreign Affairs Undersecretary Brigido Dulay, Filipinos who are cleared by the Chinese government for repatriation will first undergo screening by Chinese health officials before boarding the chartered plane that will take them to Clark. 
If they are found with symptoms by Chinese health officials, they will not be allowed to come back home to the Philippines. Instead, they will be brought to hospitals in China for treatment and observation. 
If they don't show any symptoms, they will be allowed to board the plane, where 5 DOH personnel will check them for symptoms a second time. If they are absolutely not symptomatic, they will be allowed to fly home to the Philippines. Otherwise, they will be treated in Chinese health facilities.
Upon arrival in Clark, they will again be checked for symptoms. Those who have fever, coughs, and colds will immediately be brought to the facility's polyclinic and be isolated from the rest of the returnees who show no symptoms. 
According to Dulay, a team from the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) in Wuhan, China, is already working with Chinese authorities to secure the necessary permits for the repatriation.  
""Today we already have our DFA team inside Wuhan City and they are there working on the ground preparing for the repatriation of our OFWs. They are on the ground and they're taking the risk,"" Dulay said.  
He also revealed that 4 of the 45 Filipinos who want to be repatriated have problems with their immigration status, which means it remains uncertain if they will be able to come home on Sunday. 
After the quarantine period, the returning OFWs will be assisted by the Overseas Workers Welfare Authority for employment concerns, the DOH and the DFA said.
The novel coronavirus that originated from Wuhan, China, has so far killed 564 and sickened over 28,000 people across the country and worldwide. The World Health Organization already declared an international emergency over the virus.

LEGAZPI CITY, Philippines – Albay's famed Magayon Festival has joined the list of the country's tourist-magnet events scrapped because of health fears caused by the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).
Albay Governor Al Francis Bichara announced the cancellation of the month-long Magayon Festival Wednesday, February 5, during a meeting with all department heads of the provincial government at the Governor's Guest House.
The Magayon Festival is held every April in honor of the Bicol Region's iconic Mount Mayon.
""We need to avoid events that will draw in crowds,"" said Dorothy Colle, provincial tourism officer.
As of this posting, there are still no recorded incidents of nCoV infections in the Bicol Region.
In the same meeting, Bichara approved Albay's purchase of 4 thermal scanners to identify people with fever and other flu-like symptoms.
These thermal scanners will be placed at the Legazpi City Domestic Airport, Legazpi City Grand Bus terminal, malls and a a still unspecified public place.
The Provincial Government of Albay  advised the public to practice proper hygiene to prevent the spread of  infections. It also advised anyone showing symptoms of the virus such as coughing, sneezing, having hard time to breathe and respiratory ailment, toseek medical doctors and to do self-quarantine.
Isolation hospitals
The Department of Health in Bicol designated 3 government hospitals to be used in case of an nCoV outbreak in the province. These are the Bicol Regional Training and Teaching Hospital in Albay, Bicol Medical Center in Naga City and Bicol Sanitarium in Cabusao, Camarines Sur.
Dr. Ernie Vera, DOH Bicol director, said during the Regional Disaster Risk Reduction Management Council meeting held at the Office of Civil Defense Wednesday, that all referrals for suspected nCov patients will be referred to these hospitals.
The BRRTH, BMC and Bicol Sanitarium hospitals passed through the medical examination of Regional Epidemiology and Surveillance Unit (RESU) of Department of Health regional office here.
Vera said that BRTTH would admit persons under investigation (PUIs) for the virus from the provinces of Albay, Sorsogon, Masbate and Catanduanes; while the Bicol Medical Center will take PUIs coming from the provinces of Camarines Sur and Camarines Norte.
The Bicol Sanitarium would be the alternative facility in case of th high number of PUIs in the two identified government referral hospitals.

MANILA, Philippines – Rapid test kits that could expedite the process of confirming 2019 novel coronavirus cases in the Philippines need to be validated first by the World Health Organization (WHO) before use, the Department of Health (DOH) said.
As of Wednesday, February 5, the WHO has not validated a single rapid test kit for use of laboratories, according to Health Undersecretary Eric Domingo. This effectively means that no test kit has yet been approved by the Philippines' Food and Drug Administration (FDA). 
""There are actually test kits available, you can probably buy them online, but the WHO has not yet validated any test kit,"" Domingo said. 
Right now, the WHO-approved protocol is ""still the long laboratory test"" done by the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM), according to the health official. 
Currently, the RITM is running tests with primers from a referral laboratory in Japan, of which it has a limited supply. The DOH had initially sent samples to a referral laboratory in Australia to confirm the presence of the novel coronavirus – a process that took more than 48 hours.
With testing capacities in place locally, results can be expected within 24 to 48 hours. Rapid test kits would expedite the process of confirming novel coronavirus cases, making it more efficient for the government to perform disease detection.
""WHO told us that they're validating a test kit right now, and it might take one to two weeks before they come up with the recommendation,"" Domingo added. 
Scientists at the University of the Philippines' (UP) National Institutes of Health said on Tuesday, February 4, that they had developed test kits for the novel coronavirus and would release them next week to the RITM for validation. 
Domingo said that WHO also told the UP institute to send them the kits for validation. ""Once it's validated and it is very clear that it is accurate, then it can be used,"" Domingo said. 
While there are no commercial test kits cleared by the FDA for use as of Wednesday, infectious disease expert Edsel Salvana said that the FDA can fast-track the verification of such products in times of health emergencies.
Salvana also stressed that it is important for the RITM to test the validity of such kits first to ensure their efficacy.
""We don't want false positive and false negative results,"" he said. 
More persons in the Philippines are expected to be probed for the novel coronavirus after the DOH expanded its criteria for monitoring. 
It had initially screened only people coming from Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the outbreak, but has since expanded it to cover the rest of China. The DOH is now monitoring even asymptomatic people traveling from China.  
As of Wednesday noon, February 5, there are 133 patients under investigation for the novel coronavirus, 3 of whom tested positive. The virus has killed 492 and infected 23,939 across China and 24 other countries. (READ: First nCoV-related death outside China as patient dies in PH)

She added that a number of PHAP partner companies in Southeast Asia have commercially available test kits that have passed regulations in their own countries, though she did not reveal what these companies were and how many. 
She said, however, that PHAP would make sure that prospective test kits go through proper FDA screenings before being used locally. 
As testing capacities are being improved, medical experts like Edralin and Salvana echoed advisories from the DOH and WHO to remain calm and practice proper hygiene.

The Japanese government quarantined the Diamond Princess cruise ship after an 80-year-old passenger who departed from Hong Kong tested positive for 2019-nCoV.
The ship, carrying some 3,700 passengers, was prevented from sailing and is anchored off a pier in the Kanagawa Prefecture capital.
The Japanese Health Ministry said 10 individuals were later found to be infected, including 9 passengers and a crew member. All would be transferred to a health care facility for treatment.
Carnival Japan Incorporated, operator of the Diamond Princess, said the 10 infected include 3 Japanese, 3 Chinese, 2 Australians, an American, and a Filipino.
The DFA confirmed a Filipino was indeed among those who tested positive for the novel coronavirus. This marked the first confirmed case of 2019-nCoV in a Filipino.
The DFA gave assurances that the Philippine embassy in Tokyo is in ""constant communication"" with the remaining Filipinos on the ship.
The agency added that it is closely coordinating with Japanese authorities to provide all possible assistance to the Filipinos.
""The Philippine embassy in Tokyo is closely and actively monitoring the welfare of Filipinos onboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which is currently docked off the port of Yokohama, Japan, under a quarantine implemented by the Japanese government,"" the DFA said.
As of Wednesday morning, the novel coronavirus has killed 492 people and infected over 23,000 people across 25 countries.
The World Health Organization declared a global health emergency over the outbreak, which has prompted countries such as the Philippines and the United States to impose strict travel restrictions. – with reports from Kyodo News/Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – The provinces of Pampanga and Iloilo designated their respective isolation facilities Wednesday, February 5, in preparation for the possibility of a 2019 novel corona virus (nCoV) outbreak in the areas. 
In Pampanga, the  Bureau of Quarantine of the Clark International Airport (CRK) said the provincial government provided additional personnel to help monitor arrivals. The BOQ would train the new manpower on how to identify suspected cases of nCoV from arriving passengers.
Pampanga Governor Dennis Delta Pineda also said they were providing a 40-foot aluminum container van that would  be used as an isolation area for suspected nCoV 2019 positive passengers going through Clark airport.
Mabalacat City Mayor Crisostomo Garbo said they would  provide two ambulances for the Clark airport.
Iloilo isolation hospitals
Meanwhile, in Iloilo, the provincial government has designated the Dr. Ricardo Y. Ladrido Memorial District Hospital (DRYLMDH) in Lambunao town as the facility for the confinement of identified persons under investigation (PUI). PUIs are those who are manifesting flu-like symptoms.
Hospital Management Office Chief Dr. Cynthia Cabangal-Ng said DRYLMDH has has 6 isolation units and is capable of providing extension rooms.
“If ever there will be a spillover, we can possibly transfer all patients of Lambunao to other district hospitals. Lambunao will then be dedicated to PUIs only,” she said.
She added that the hospital personnel who will handle the patients will undergo training on self-protection.
But Dr. Cabangan-Ng said the province remains coronavirus-free.
Iloilo Governor Arthur Defensor Jr said the provincial government was also purchasing protective gears for hospital personnel, as well as, additional thermal scanners.
Defensor also appealed for donations of hospital equipment from the private sector. – Rappler.com "

FIGHT VS FAKE NEWS. The police joins the campaign against misinformation on the 2019 novel coronavirus. PNP file photo 
MANILA, Philippines – The Philippine National Police (PNP) is citing a repealed Marcos-era decree in its fight against fake news peddlers in the wake of misinformation and panic amid the global outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).
In a statement on Wednesday, February 5, the PNP announced that they would join the lookout for sources of false information. They cited two laws as basis:

Presidential Decree 90, which bans unlawful rumor-mongering and spreading false information;
Unlawful means of publication and utterances under Article 154 of the Revised Penal Code in relation to Republic Act 10175 or the Anti-Cybercrime Law

Rappler has sought comment on the possible oversight, but the PNP's spokesman has yet to reply as of posting.
The first problem: Presidential Decree 90 has been voided 34 years ago by former president Corazon Aquino after the ouster of the dictatorship of Ferdinand Marcos. “[I]nstead of promoting the said objective, the aforesaid issuances in effect paved the way for violations of the freedom of expression of the people,” Aquino said in Executive Order No. 65, which repealed the Marcos decree.
The second problem: It is unclear whether those who share fake news will be punished too. The Supreme Court has declared as unconstitutional the provision of the Cybercrime Law that punishes aiding and abetting crime, or in this context, sharing fake news.
Justice Secretary Menardo Guevarra did not directlty address questions about this, saying that law enforcers would first need to scout for a “malicious scheme” or “pattern” of the act. – with a report from Lian Buan/Rappler.com

FREEDOM OF SPEECH. Justice Secretary Menardo Guevarra defends his order of investigating 2019-nCoV fake news saying the freedom of speech has limitations. File photo by Angie de Silva/Rappler 
MANILA, Philippines – Justice Secretary Menardo Guevarra on Wednesday, February 5, defended his department order to investigate fake news on the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), saying there are ""limitations to the constitutional right"" to free speech. 
""I expect that freedom of speech issues will be raised, but as lawyers we all know that there are limitations to this constitutional right, including the greater interest of the public,"" Guevarra said in a message exchange with reporters on Wednesday.
Guevarra signed on Tuesday, February 4, Department Order No. 052 that tasked the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) to investigate and prosecute ""alleged deliberate spread of misinformation and fake news"" about the 2019-nCoV, even though there is no law in the Philippines that defines and punishes ""fake news.""
Pressed for a law that would cover this order, Guevarra said that if technology would be used, it would be ""appropriate charges under the Revised Penal Code in relation to the cybercrime prevention law.""
Cybercrime and warrantless arrest
The Supreme Court has declared as unconstitutional the provision of Republic Act No. 10175 or the Cybercrime Prevention Act that punishes aiding and abetting crime, or in this context, sharing fake news.
Guevarra did not categorically answer whether those who share fake news would be punished, saying the NBI ""will scope the field first and see if there's a malicious scheme or pattern somewhere.""
""No further comments for now,"" Guevarra said.
Guevarra was asked whether there is a possibility of a warrantless arrest because Rodel Jayme, the web administrator who was accused of uploading the Bikoy narcolist videos, was arrested without a warrant on the basis of a cybercrime investigation. 
The Department of Justice (DOJ) upheld the warrantless arrest, citing ""hot pursuit."" Jayme was eventually charged of inciting to sedition.
""It will all depend on the factual circumstances,"" said Guevarra.
Free speech
Law professor Ted Te said the department order ""directly contradicts freedom of expression,"" citing the decision of the High Court in Chavez vs Gonzales that declared as unconstitutional a government press release against the publication of the ""Hello, Garci"" tape.
That decision, as in other decisions on free speech, said government regulations that restrict free speech must have a compelling state interest. One of the tests to determine this is the presence of a clear and present danger to the public. 
Guevarra said the clear and present danger is ""causing undue panic and alarm in part, but also undermining government efforts for a unified and coordinated approach to a common threat that affects us all.""
Te said that the DOJ must give the NBI clear guidelines on what to define as fake news.
""The DOJ and the NBI have their own cybercrime experts. I suppose they’ll scope the field first and see if there’s a malicious scheme or pattern somewhere,"" said Guevarra.
Guevarra said ""Malacañang had nothing to do"" with the DOJ order. – Rappler.com "

CORONAVIRUS SCARE. Lawmakers want to augment the Department of Health's budget in 2020 to help buy face masks and protective equipment against the novel coronavirus. File photo by Ben Nabong/Rappler 
MANILA, Philippines – Two ranking lawmakers are now proposing to give at least a P2-billion supplemental budget to the Department of Health (DOH) to purchase surgical masks and personal protective equipment (PPE) amid the ongoing threat of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). 
On Tuesday, February 4, House committee on health chair Angelina Tan filed House Bill (HB) No. 6166 seeking P2.04 billion for the DOH, while House committee on ways and means chair Joey Salceda's HB No. 6177 pegged the amount at P2.24 billion. 
Salceda's HB No. 6177 explicitly said P2.04 billion would primarily be used to buy surgical masks and PPE for the following:

P945,000 for persons under investigation by the DOH
P9.45 million for health care workers
P2.025 billion for the PPE of health care workers
P4.522 million for 40 Filipinos to be repatriated from China

Another P20 million would be allotted for the hazard pay and benefits of epidemiologists on the frontlines of fighting the new disease.
Tan's HB No. 6166 was more general, as its Section 1 states the proposed supplemental budget would be for ""augmenting the budget for the health system response"" of the DOH. 
But in her media statement on Wednesday, February 5, Tan said the P2.04 billion is the ""estimated amount needed to buy additional surgical masks and personal protective equipment over the next 3 months.""
She previously sought just a P1-billion supplemental budget for the DOH to help fight the coronavirus threat.
HB No. 6166 would require the DOH to submit a report to the Senate committees on finance, and health and demography as well as the House committees on appropriations and health to give a detailed account of how the supplemental budget would be used.
But World Health Organization country representative to the Philippines Rabindra Abeyasinghe already said they are not recommending the use of surgical masks for the general public amid the 2019-nCoV scare.
He said it would be ""preferable"" if the masks were instead reserved for high-risk individuals and health workers. 
President Rodrigo Duterte also said the public ""hysteria"" over the new disease is ""not needed,"" though he also said the government is set to procure face masks for Filipinos amid the ongoing shortage in the market.
As of Wednesday afternoon, the Philippines has recorded one death due to 2019-nCoV, the first Chinese to die from the new disease outside of China.
This 44-year-old Chinese man is one of 3 confirmed coronavirus cases in the country along with a 38-year-old woman, with whom he traveled from Wuhan, and a 60-year-old woman, who also came from Wuhan.
The DOH is currently monitoring 133 patients for possible 2019-nCoV.
Globally, the coronavirus has already infected 23,939 people and killed 492.

CORONAVIRUS MONITORING. Background photo by Louie Lapat/Rappler 
KALIBO, Philippines – Around 350 Chinese tourists in Boracay Island are being monitored by a local task force of Malay, Aklan to control the spread of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). 
Deputy task force information manager Madel Joy Tayco said the Chinese nationals arrived in Boracay Island before the government issued a directive for the temporary banning of foreigners and Filipinos coming from China and its special administrative regions of Macau and Hong Kong.
The number of persons for monitoring in Boracay Island has dwindled from a high of 2,000 tourists after direct flights to and from mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau were cancelled. 
“The tourists with travel history to China were cleared by Bureau of Quarantine (BOQ) in local airports...it is now our task to monitor and manage them based on the guidelines of the World Health Organization and Department of Health until they leave Boracay Island,” said Tayco, also working as Nurse II of Municipal Health Office (MHO) of Malay, Aklan. 
Contrary to.media reports, the Chinese tourists are persons for monitoring and not persons under investigation (PUIs) with no flu-like symptoms associated with the Wuhan coronavirus. The disease, as of February 5, has killed at least 490 people.
Tayco clarified the Chinese nationals were closely monitored in their hotels in coordination with hotel nurses and medical team, and not isolated in the island by health authorities.
“The monitoring of these foreigners include the checking of body temperature and other symptoms like difficulty of breathing and cough, which are done twice a day. So far, wala naman silang signs or symptoms,” she stressed.
On January 28, MHO Malay also started an information education dissemination campaign with resorts, hotels, schools, and other establishments to prevent the possible transmission of virus.
“We aim to educate and inform the public in Malay, Aklan, especially Boracay Island about the novel coronavirus and how they could protect themselves,” Tayco added.
As this developed, Provincial Health Officer I Dr. Cornelio Cuachon, Jr. identified Gov. Corazon L. Cabagnot Tourism and Training Center in Old Buswang, Kalibo, Aklan as a temporary holding facility for inbound travelers from China, Macau, and Hong Kong to undergo a 14-day quarantine period.
The Aklan training center was recommended by BOQ and the provincial inter-agency task force. The facility earlier handled 11 Chinese nationals on January 25 to monitor their conditions.
They were spending their vacation in Boracay Island when the Provincial Health Office-Aklan was alerted by DOH after four of them had close contacts with a coronavirus patient in Hong Kong.
The foreigners - 7 adults and 4 children - returned home on January 31 to Chengdu, China via Kalibo International Airport.
As a precautionary measure, BOQ and DOH personnel also conducted mandatory thermal scans of domestic tourists coming from Cebu, Manila and Clark to Kalibo International Airport and Caticlan airport in Malay, Aklan.
Health declaration cards are also collected and checked by health authorities for every incoming travelers. (READ: Philippines confirms 3rd case of novel coronavirus)

""We deem it prudent to avoid situations where the health and safety of our cadets, PMA alumni, and their families are put at risk,"" said Lorenzana.
Magalong, who is a member of PMA Class of 1982 denied there was  lockdown.

MANILA, Philippines (6th UPDATE) – The Department of Health (DOH) on Wednesday, February 5, reported the Philippines’ 3rd confirmed case of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).
Health Undersecretary Eric Domingo said that a 60-year-old woman from Wuhan, China, tested postive for 2019-nCoV. She traveled from Wuhan through Hong Kong and arrived in Cebu on January 20, and headed directly  to Bohol.

Domingo said that on January 22, the woman consulted a private hospital after developing fever and colds, and was admitted to a  hospital in Bohol.
Several samples were taken from the woman on January 23 and January 24. The latter samples were sent to the Victorian Infectious Disease Reference Laboratory in Australia and the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM).
Domingo said that the Victorian Infectious Disease Reference Laboratory sent back the test results on the January 24 samples on January 29, and RITM on January 30 – both came out negative.
With her test result for 2019-nCoV negative, the woman was discharged from the hospital 9 days after admission and was allowed to travel back to China on January 31.
Domingo said that the RITM later ran tests on the first sample taken from the woman on January 23 after it became capable of testing samples for 2019-nCoV. 
Domingo said that on February 3, RITM notified the DOH that the January 23 samples tested positive for 2019-nCoV. This showed that the woman was able to mount immunity against the virus by the time the January 24 samples were taken. 
Asked why it took the DOH two days to report the third confirmed case, Domingo said: ""We found out evening of February 3, and yesterday we were at the Senate. As you well know, the secretary was there the whole day, so we couldn’t have a press conference yesterday."" 
He added that the the DOH's regional office in Central Visayas was immediately notified and that they were able to begin contact tracing on Tuesday, February 4.
""Before we announce it, we make sure the regional office and the local government units already know,"" Domingo said.
The first two 2019-nCoV cases in the country were a couple who traveled to the Philippines from Wuhan, China, the center of the outbreak. The man died on February 1, the first death due to the virus outside China.
133 cases probed
The DOH said it is now probing a total of 133 patients for 2019-nCoV. 
As of February 5, 115 patients are admitted to hospitals, while 16 were discharged but were being contacted by DOH surveillance officers daily for updates on their symptoms. Two patients under investigation have died, one of whom tested negative for the virus and died due to other complications.
The DOH added that 63 of the patients under investigation are Filipinos, 54 are Chinese, and 16 other foreign nationals. Of this number, 32 traveled from Wuhan, China, while others came from Hong Kong and other parts of China.
The DOH also confirmed that health workers are included in the 54 Filipino patients under investigation.

Drilon said the 43-year-old patient, who came from Taiwan, tested negative in the confirmatory test conducted by the RITM.
He said the patient was set to be discharged from the government hospital.
Drilon added that two more persons under investigation were still confined at the hospital's Emerging Infectious Disease Facility, awaiting for the laboratory results from RITM.
In a statement, AirAsia said it was working closely with the government, especially the DOH, after it was confirmed that the Philippines’ 3rd case of 2019-nCoV took an AirAsia flight from Cebu to Shenzhen, China, on January 31.
“AirAsia is ready and willing to provide relevant documents to the DOH, including the flight manifest and available contact details of guests on board the flight, given the urgency of this situation. The operating flight crew have also been quarantined in compliance with the Philippine government’s travel ban,” it said.
“All AirAsia aircraft undergo disinfection procedures according to prescribed protocol,” the airline added.

MISPLACED PRIORITIES? DOH Secretary Francisco Duque lll skipped the House hearing on the novel coronavirus on February 5, 2020 to inspect a quarantine facility in Nueva Ecija. File photo by Darren Langit/Rappler 
MANILA, Philippines – Visibly upset legislators told Health Secretary Francisco Duque III he needs to get his priorities in order after he failed to attend a House hearing on Metro Manila’s response to the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). 
On Wednesday, February 5, Muntinlupa Representative Ruffy Biazon called out Duque for begging off from attending the House committee on Metro Manila development’s hearing to inspect a quarantine facility in Fort Magsaysay in Nueva Ecija.
Duque went to Fort Magsaysay on orders of President Rodrigo Duterte. The facility in the military reserve will serve as a quarantine area for Filipinos set to be repatriated from China on Saturday, February 8.
""Pakiparating po kay Secretary Duque: Ayusin ho niya ang kanyang priorities (Please tell this to Secretary Duque: He should get his priorities straight),"" Biazon told heads of various DOH bureaus present during the hearing. 
“So I guess this shows the type of priorities that the Secretary has. As the overall in-charge of handling this crisis, I believe he should have been there. Hindi ‘yong pag-iinspekto na lang ng mga kuwarto (He should not just spend time inspecting rooms). So to the DOH, we appreciate your presence but I am very sure there will be questions here that you wouldn’t be able to answer,” he added.
A few minutes later, Biazon recalled the Senate hearing on Tuesday, February 4, which revealed an apparent lack of communication between the DOH, and the Civil Aeronautics Board and the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines on contact tracing for possible 2019-nCoV cases.  
Duque had even threatened to fire “incompetent” officials from the DOH’s Epidemiology Bureau. But for Biazon, no one is to be blamed but the health secretary himself. 
The Muntinlupa congressman cited Republic Act No. 11332 or the “Mandatory Reporting of Notifiable Diseases and Health Events of Public Health Concerns Act,” which gives the DOH chief the power to “declare epidemics of national and/or international concerns except when the same threatens national security.” 
“Itong krisis na hinaharap natin sa kalusugan ng mga Pilipino, siya ang incident commander. Sa kanya manggagaling ang kautusan. Lahat ng ahensiya – DFA (Department of Foreign Affairs) and others – mapapasailalim sa kanya. Kaya ito ho tayo nababahala kung ano ba ang priorities dito sa pag-attend sa problemang ito,” Biazon said. 
(He is the incident commander of this crisis involving the health of Filipinos. The orders should be coming from him. All agencies – including the DFA and others – would fall under him. That's why we are concerned over his priorities in attending to this problem.)
Manila 1st District Representative Manuel Lopez, House committee on Metro Manila development chair, agreed with Biazon. 
“We would not like to lambast the Secretary...pero ang nais lang po namin ipaalam sa kanya [ay] baka nakakalimutan niya ang paalala namin kung anu-ano po ang kapangyarihan na binigay po sa kanya ng Republika ng Pilipinas (But we want to remind him that he may be forgetting the powers given to him under the Republic of the Philippines),” Lopez said.
Duque had already appeared before the House during the question hour in the plenary session on January 29. But only a few lawmakers lined up to interpellate the DOH chief, excluding Biazon and Lopez. 
As of 9 pm on Tuesday, the Philippines recorded one death due to the 2019-nCoV, the first to die from the disease outside of China. 
This 44-year-old Chinese man is one of two confirmed coronavirus cases in the country along with a 38-year-old woman, with whom he traveled from Wuhan via Hong Kong, to the Philippines.
The DOH is currently monitoring 105 patients for possible 2019-nCoV. Of this number, 91 were still in hospitals while 12 had been discharged.
Globally, the coronavirus has already infected 23,939 people and killed 492, as of Wednesday morning.

This means that if you bought stocks at the start of 2020, priced at almost 7,800 each, you have lost over 8% of your investments.

While the stock market is not totally indicative of the economy’s health, it does tell quite a lot about business sentiment. So far, it seems that sentiment does not go with some of the numbers.
Analysts and even the government’s economic team have all been somewhat unanimous in saying that while the impact of the novel coronavirus is hard to price in, the economy, so far, can take the hit.
The Philippines is also a domestic consumption-driven economy, which means that the economy is not very reliant on trade to grow. Trade-driven economies like China have taken a direct hit on both the lingering trade war and the spread of the coronavirus.
So why are investors still fleeing the Philippines?
It seems that more than the virus, businesses are getting more worried over the political climate under the Duterte administration.
“Investors are definitely worried and they are waiting for decisive action from the government to contain the virus. But remember this is not the only thing that investors are worried about, there's lots of domestic developments too,” said Jun Calaycay, chief of research of Philstocks.
With no clear gameplan and a credible, assuring tone in containing the virus, the business community is more jittery.
Business as usual?
Strictly looking at the numbers and somewhat excluding all other factors, the Philippine economy is perceived to be surviving the novel coronavirus.
All the market experts and economists whom Rappler was able to interview agree that the economic impact is ""minimal,"" provided that the situation does not escalate further.
Carlo Asuncion, Unionbank's chief economist, said that the tourism and trade sectors will be the most affected.
""In 2010, the PSA [Philippine Statistics Authority] put the average foreign tourist spend at $84/day, and last year, tourists visiting from China were approximately about 1.5 million. Thus, the Philippines may stand to lose a minimum of $126 million worth of foreign tourist spending this 2020 as the coronavirus scare continues to sow fear in the short-term,"" Asuncion said.

""People-movement-related businesses may also lose in the short-term as people tend to stay rather than roam around risking unnecessary exposure to the largely unknown disease.""
If the novel coronavirus delivers a “severe, but temporary impact” or an outbreak lasts 6 months, Unionbank’s economic research unit expects Philippine full-year economic growth to decline at least 0.3% to at most 0.8% in 2020. 
Calaycay added that while the overall economy remains robust, he warned that flight restrictions and cancellations have a ""spillover effect."" 
""It does not end in flights and tourism. There are jobs not necessarily related to these sectors but are dependent or somewhat connected to them, so we need to watch out for that as well,"" Calaycay said.

Meanwhile, ING Bank Manila chief economist Nicholas Mapa noted that the warm ties between the Philippines and China mean that Duterte also inherits Beijing's problems.
""When China sneezes, the Philippines catches a cold and picks up a cough given recent developments in economic ties,"" Mapa said.
China is currently the Philippines' top trading partner. Exports to China from January to November 2019 improved 6.3% to $8.8 billion, from $8.3 billion during the same period in 2018, according to PSA. Over 56% comprised electronic parts.
Mapa estimated losses to hit as high as $600 million due to the slowdown in tourist arrivals, effectively hitting overall consumption from retail sales, restaurants to hotels. (READ: Duterte expands ban on travelers from China, Hong Kong, Macau over coronavirus fears)
""Another possible hit would be the restricted movement of Chinese to and from the mainland, with POGO [Philippine offshore gambling operators] workers not able to return or incomes curtailed by the slowdown in business,"" Mapa said.
Meanwhile, Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation economist Michael Ricafort noted that consumers can expect lower oil prices due to the coronavirus outbreak.
He noted that global crude oil prices have already declined to a new 3-month low, which is already lower compared to the levels during the US-Iran tensions in early January 2020. The decline is due to the anticipation for lower global oil demand for oil especially in China, which is the world’s biggest oil importer.
While economists have estimated the impact to be minimal so far, the novel coronavirus scare is fueling the business community's jitters.
""For as long as uncertainty hangs over the Philippines, we can expect anxiety to weigh on the economy the same way a cold or cough curtails all of us. For the most part, we can still operate as business as usual, albeit stopping from time to time to wipe our noses or cough into a tissue,"" Mapa said.
Uncertainty
The presence of the novel coronavirus in the Philippines comes at a time where Duterte has weaponized contract reviews, seen by some as a move to favor allied businessmen. 
The elite, not used to attacks by a strongman, were quite unsure about how to handle such a scenario they never saw coming.
Duterte's rants against Ayala-led Manila Water and Manny V. Pangilinan's Maynilad has sent stock prices so low, the market has not seen such prices in over a decade.
Earlier this week, investors were somewhat given a boost when Enrique Razon, a perceived ally of Duterte, took a slice or 25% of Ayala's Manila Water. After the announcement, euphoric investors pushed stock prices back in the green.
""Yes, it somewhat calmed down the market. But it is still bad for the business environment overall. Does this mean that the whole contract review is all over? It does not feel right,"" said an analyst who requested anonymity.
The business community is also awaiting the fate of the Lopez's ABS-CBN, as well as keeping a close eye on the economic impact of Taal Volcano, and the reported cases of African swine fever outside Luzon.
Prior to these negative developments, the Duterte administration has already started to show signs of having difficulty attracting investors.
Foreign direct investments (FDIs) fom January to September 2019 posted $5.1 billion only, down nearly 37% compared to the $8.1 billion recorded in the same period in 2018. This brings the net FDI inflows for the 9-month period to only $5.12 billion down by nearly 37% compared to the $8.11 billion recorded in the same period in 2019. (READ: [OPINION | Point of Law] Challenges in business that cannot scare us)
Hot money or portfolio investments also showed weakness, as it saw a net outflow of $1.9 billion last year, according to the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas. This is a turnaround from the inflows of $1.2 billion in 2018. The BSP projected portfolio investments to register inflows worth $8 billion last year.
How soon can we see the impact of all these uncertainties? 
University of Asia and the Pacific economist Victor Abola said in a recent press briefing that in general, there is a ""lag"" before the real impact of uncertainties can be felt.
""Real effect can be felt after a year or so. For the current year, plans are there already and people will not stop executing plans because of certain negative actions,"" Abola said.
After missing its growth targets and struggling to attract more investors, the government now has the additional task of stemming the domino effect that the new virus has triggered. – Rappler.com "

CEBU CITY, Philippines – Cebu Governor Gwendolyn Garcia signed an executive order Tuesday, February 4, placing this province under a state of preparedness because of the threat of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) and designating 4 public facilities to be used as quarantine areas.
As part of this levelled up preparation the provincial government has identified the Eversly Child Sanitarium in Consolacion, Cebu, as the primary public facility where all Filipinos coming from  mainland China and the special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau will be committed to undergo a mandatory 14-day quarantine.
Aside from Eversly, the other quarantine facilities tapped by the provincial government are the Mandaue General Hospital, the New Life Facility in Pinamungajan town, and the Women and Children Development Center in Lahug, Cebu CIty.   All in all, the 3 facilities could handle up to 250 people.
 These facilities were set up when Cebu was planning to quarantine all passengers coming in from mainland China, even before President Rodrigo Duterte ordered a travel ban last week.
Also an author of Garcia's resolution was 4th District Provincial Board Member Kerrie Shimura, the Chairperson of the Committee on Health and Social Services.
“There is a clear and present danger of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus entering Cebu that warrants an immediate need for the implementation of measures to prevent its entry while establishing protocols for the quarantine of infected individuals in case entry;” the resolution read. The declaration empowered local government Disaster Risk Reduction Management offices to take actions to minimize the adverse effects of a recognized danger.  
At least 4 of the 31 patients under investigation by the Department of Health for the coronavirus are from the Central Visayas.   
The Cebu provincial government is also preparing protocols for home quarantine for arriving Filipinos.    The process for home quarantine was still being discussed with the local government units and Philippine National Police. 
""We have not established the protocols on homestay, we will have to bring them directly straight to the Eversely facility,"" Garcia said.
""Right now, we need to know where are their homes… we need to identify what times these are so that the mayors themselves will also be on board including the barangay kapitan,"" she added.The first death due to the coronavirus outside of China happened in the Philippines. The tourist came from Wuhan City to the Philippines via Dumaguete and Cebu. The Epidemiology Bureau of the DOH has found a total of 74 contacts the couple interacted with in Cebu and Dumaguete As of Tuesday, February 4, the DOH was looking into 80 people for 2019-nCoV. This includes 2 confirmed cases and 68 others who were still confined in hospitals, while 10 who have been discharged but are still being monitored. Of these, 48 samples are awaiting confirmation for the 2019-nCoV, while 30 have tested negative.– Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – Scientists at the National Institutes of Health of the University of the Philippines (UP) Manila said they have developed a test kit that would help the Department of Health (DOH) confirm more cases of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in the country.
The test kit will be released next week for evaluation of the DOH, said scientist Raul Destura during a Senate hearing assessing the government's response to 2019-nCoV on Tuesday, February 4.
""Hopefully by next week, it will be ready for the DOH to verify and validate before they give their recommendation for use in the country,"" Destura said.
He added that UP scientists developed the test kit after Chinese scientists released the whole genome sequence of the virus to the public.
The test kit would allow the DOH to more rapidly detect the presence of 2019-nCoV in samples taken from patients ""under investigation"" or observation, which are now at 105.
Currently, the DOH is using the primer it had acquired from Japan, which allows its research arm, the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine, to determine ""within 48 hours"" whether samples are positive for 2019-nCoV.
""[What we're using is] like a code that more or less it will guide us to identify [the virus]. This is exactly the virus that's similar to the one in Wuhan,"" Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said.
But the primer is not yet commercially available, making it difficult for the DOH to acquire it in big batches.
World Health Organization country representative to the Philippines Rabindra Abeyasinghe said several research groups around the world are still racing to develop rapid test kits for the virus.
""Test kits will not be completed for about another week to 10 days, after which we have agreed that we will provide the test kits to the Philippines and other member states that are at risk,"" he said.
Senators on Tuesday criticized the DOH for apparent lapses in leadership especially in its protocols for contact tracing. In about a week, the health department has only traced 17% or around 50 of the 331 people who came into contact with the Philippines' two confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV.
Duque blamed the lapses on incompetent individuals in the DOH's Epidemiology Bureau. He also promised ""aggressive contact tracing"" which would involve police.
As of Tuesday, the virus has infected more than 20,000 and killed over 400, nearly all in China. (READ: World currently 'not in a pandemic' of China virus – WHO) – Rappler.com

NEGROS ORIENTAL, Philippines – Negros Oriental Governor Roel Degamo issued an executive order (EO) suspending classes in all levels in public schools from Wednesday, February 5, to Friday, February 7.
This is part of the precautionary measures of the provincial government to contain and mitigate the spread of the deadly novel coronavirus, the governor said in his EO issued Tuesday, February 4.
The governor also said that private schools may suspend their classes in their respective schools at their own discretion. 
Silliman University in Dumaguete City had earlier announced that its classes from preschool to senior high school will be conducted online starting February 5.
Five individuals in this province who came in contact with the two confirmed cases of novel coronavirus in the Philippines were placed under quarantine at a hospital after they exhibited flu-like symptoms.
Another 25 persons were also being monitored after they came in contact with the two confirmed patients, a Chinese couple. They were also required to be quarantined for 14 days.
The driver of the tricycle hired by the Chinese couple is now being assessed by health authorities in Negros Oriental, Provincial Information Officer Bimbo Miraflor said.
He ferried the couple to a resort in Dauin town.
He was also advised to place himself in quarantine and avoid close contact with family members, neighbors, and friends.
He will also receive financial assistance worth P5,000 from the provincial government, according to Miraflor. 
The Philippines' health department confirmed the second case of the novel coronavirus in the Philippines on Sunday, February 2. Both confirmed cases traveled to the Philippines from Wuhan, China.
The second patient died on Saturday, February 1 – the first death recorded outside China. 
The novel coronavirus that originated from Wuhan, China, has so far killed 426 and sickened over 20,000 people across the country and worldwide. The World Health Organization already declared an international emergency over the virus. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – The Department of Health (DOH) is now probing 105 persons for the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) as of noon on Tuesday, February 4. 
This is up from the 80 initially reported by the DOH at the Senate hearing on the government’s response to 2019-nCoV earlier on the same day. 
Most of the patients under investigation are being observed in Metro Manila, where 36 patients are being probed. This includes the Chinese couple from Wuhan, China, who were the first two confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV in the Philippines. One of them eventually died due to severe pneumonia resulting from the virus, which has killed over 400 people and infected over 20,000 people in 25 countries, mostly in China.

Here is the breakdown of cases per region:

Calabarzon - 4
Mimaropa - 4
Western Visayas - 10
Central Visayas - 16
Eastern Visayas - 3
Northern Mindanao - 5
Davao region - 6

Of the 105, 91 are currently admitted to hospitals while 12 have been discharged but are under strict monitoring. Strict monitoring means that the the DOH’s epidemiology bureau checks up on them daily for symptoms.  
Health Secretary Francisco Duque III also told reporters after the Senate hearing on Tuesday that the DOH is verifying a third possible case of 2019-nCoV, but said more details would be revealed on Wednesday, February 5.  
The increase in cases being probed comes as the criteria for probing expanded to persons coming not just from Hubei province but also from all of mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau. 
Duque also said the increase was “due to the strengthened surveillance system and contact tracing of the Epidemiology Bureau,"" but the Tuesday Senate hearing revealed lapses in the DOH’s protocols, particularly in contact tracing. 
The health chief said that that he would hold officials in the DOH’s epidemiology bureau accountable for their incompetence in dealing with the urgent health crisis. – Rappler.com  "

MANILA, Philippines – Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said “heads will roll” in the health department’s Epidemiology Bureau as a Senate hearing revealed gaps in its work identifying people who possibly came in contact with patients who tested positive for the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). 
Speaking to reporters after the Senate hearing on the 2019-nCoV on Tuesday, February 4, Duque dodged criticisms of his “failure of leadership” and said that the problem was “within some of the operating units of the Department of Health (DOH).” 
The epidemiology bureau of the DOH monitors the spread of infectious diseases, the latest of which is the emerging 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease. The bureau is also supposed to take the lead in contact tracing, or tracking down people who have interacted with those positive for the virus. This included co-passengers on the flights they were on, as well as personnel in establishments and hotels they went to.  
“I've always assumed that they already have the competence, that they already know what they're doing, and that they are familiar with the protocols,” he said, adding that it is not his job to “get into operational details.”
“The secretary of health orchestrates everyone. When you orchestrate an ensemble, I am not going to get somebody to teach him to play the violin, I already expect him to know how to play the violin as the orchestrator. It is not a failure of leadership. It is probably a question of incompetence on the part of some of those who form part of the orchestra,” Duque added.
Senators took turns grilling Duque on the issue of contact tracing, which is crucial in quelling the spread of the virus, which has killed over 400 people and infected over 20,000 people in 25 countries, mostly in China. 
The lawmakers pointed out the apparent lack of communication between the DOH and the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) and the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP).   It was revealed in the hearing that the government has reached out to only 17% or around 50 of the 331 passengers who may have come in contact with the country's first two confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV.
Duque said that Cebu Pacific and Philippine Airlines, whose flights the carried the two confirmed cases, provided the DOH redacted flight manifestos, withholding the passengers' contact information. But airlines invoked the Data Privacy Act. 
But CAB and CAAP said it was unlikely that airlines would do this given the circumstances.
“We need to assess (the epidemiology bureau) for their competencies for that particular job. We will have to assess them right now. We will convene the epidemiology bureau to really find out,” Duque said. 
Duque also said “aggressive contact tracing” would begin Wednesday, February 5. Upon the recommendation of Senator Ronald dela Rosa,  the police would now be involved  in the process of finding people who were possibly infected. “We need to talk to PNP to tell us exactly the cooperation that is needed, the coordination that is needed on the ground level when the contact tracing ought to be done,” Duque said. 
As of Tuesday, February 4, the DOH was probing 80 people for 2019-nCoV. This figure included the 2 confirmed cases, 68 others who were still in hospitals, and 10 who have been discharged but are under monitoring. Of these, 48 samples are awaiting confirmation for the 2019-nCoV while 30 have tested negative. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – Justice Secretary Menardo Guevarra on Tuesday, February 4, ordered the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) to go after peddlers of fake news involving the 2019 novel coronavirus or the 2019-nCoV.
""The NBI, through Director Dante A. Gierran, is hereby directed and granted authority to conduct an investigation and case build-up on the alleged deliberate spread of misinformation and fake news about the 2019-nCov ARD and false reporting of 2019-nCov ARD (Acute Respiratory Disease) cases and, if evidence warrants, to file the appropriate charges against persons found responsible thereof,"" Guevarra said in Department Order No. 052 signed on Tuesday.
But what law covers fake news, if there is no law that defines and punishes it?
As of posting, Department of Justice (DOJ) Spokesperson Undersecretary Markk Perete was unable to name a specific law that can potentially cover fake news in the context of the 2019-nCov. 
""We cannot, at this point, speculate on the charge/s as these will depend on the evidence gathered during the investigation process,"" said Perete.
""Laws exist to ensure, among others, public order and safety. Upholding such laws becomes even more important when circumstances that agitate the public emerge,"" Perete added.
The anti-fake news bill, introduced by Senate President Vicente ""Tito"" Sotto III, will empower the DOJ to take down websites it deems to contain fake news. The Human Rights Watch has slammed this bill for infringing on the right to free speech.
Sotto himself peddled fake news on Tuesday when he showed at a Senate hearing a video of 2019-nCov conspiracy theories, which Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr dismissed as the ""craziest video.""
Will Sotto be investigated too?
""All leads will have to be considered, including those presented at the Senate,"" Perete said.
Free speech
The Legazpi City police filed on Tuesday a complaint for alarm and scandal against a vlogger who pulled a prank by laying down and acting sick in front of Yashano Mall in the city's port district on Sunday afternoon.
Will the right to free speech protect people in this case?
""Persons who unnecessarily aggravate such agitation through actions violative of our laws cannot be allowed to unjustly claim protection under the basic guarantees of our Constitution. To hold otherwise will invite chaos and disorder,"" said Perete.
Law professor Ted Te, however, said Guevarra's department order ""directly contradicts freedom of expression.""
Te cited the 2008 Supreme Court case Chavez vs Gonzales which declared as unconstitutional the press release of the National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) warning against the publication of the ""Hello Garci"" recording. The Supreme Court said the press release constituted prior restraint.
""Alarms and scandals is a felony; the Department Order deals specifically with 'fake news' and makes it a basis for case build-up, possible arrest and prosecution. This directly contradicts freedom of expression,"" Te said.
Perete denied that the department order restrains free speech, saying it does not restrict action.
""It merely directs the NBI to investigate certain acts already committed, and if warranted, to file the appropriate complaint before the proper body,"" said Perete.
Can the Cybercrime Law kick in for ""fake news"" posted online?
""While Cybercrime Law specifically mentions 'content-based restrictions' it does not specifically refer to spreading 'fake news,'"" said Te. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – As the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak continued to stir public concern, Senate President Vicente Sotto III showed a conspiracy theory video that  claimed the coronavirus to be a form of ""biowarfare"" developed by the United States against China.
Sotto used his question time at a Senate hearing into the Philippine government's measures against the novel coronavirus to play the video that he said his office had received, saying it was among his and other senators' ""concern.""
""Mr Chair, I will not ask any questions. Instead I would like to focus on the concern, of my concern and some other members of the Senate and of course our people – of the unknown origin [of the novel coronavirus] as quoted by the WHO. Meron tayong kasabihan eh (We have a saying). If you want to defeat an enemy, know the enemy. Ano ba itong virus na ito (What is this virus all about)?"" Sotto said on Tuesday, February 4.

Before playing the video, Sotto called the report ""somehow very interesting, if not revealing"" as he called on those present to pay close attention to it.
The video, which cited no official information or sources and was already debunked by experts, suggested Western countries ""developed"" the coronavirus as biowarfare against China in an effort to stop its rise as a global power. The theory has been debunked by experts.
'Craziest video.' After playing portions of the video, Sotto then asked Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr for his comments on the video. Sotto did not ask for the opinions of health officials such as Health Secretary Francisco Duque III or WHO country representative Rabindra Abeyasinghe who were at the hearing.
Locsin said it was an example of the ""craziest video"" he has ever seen and proceeded to debunk its contents and said it was illogical for the coronavirus to be created as a biowarfare weapon.
The DFA chief pointed out information presented in the video clashed with other supposed reports it showed, saying, ""In this video, there are the suspects: China inflicting it on itself – 99% of infections are all Chinese so why would they do that?""  
Locsin added, ""Again, [the claim is] this is a plan of the US and the West to destroy China by first destroying itself. This is really clever, so I don't know if you can believe this.""
Responding to this, Sotto said though he and others in the Senate were ""not prepared to take the content of the video hook line and sinker,"" and it was ""best"" officials were ""aware"" of what is being spread about the virus.
Dangerous fake news.  At the start of hearing, Senator Christopher ""Bong"" Go, chairman of the Senate committee on health and demography, cautioned the public against spreading fake news during the outbreak, saying fake news peddlers should be ""quarantined."" 
""'Yung mga panay dada naman diyan para makapagsalita, mga bashers sumasakay sa sitwasyon para sa pansariling interes, mga tao gusto lang magdulot ng panic ang mga nagpapakalat ng fake news, kayo ang dapat maquarantine para di makahawa,"" said Go.
(Those who want to just say something, bashers who are riding on the situation for their own self-interest, people who want to cause panic and spread fake news, you should be the ones quarantined.)
With the outbreak of the coronavirus, false news and misinformation have mushroomed online, prompting medical experts to warn that these were not only false but dangerous.
""Fake news in a health setting is dangerous. Fake news in an emergency public health situation is deadly so it's very, very important we only consume verified sources of news,"" said infectious disease expert Dr Edsel Salvana in an interview with ABS-CBN News. (LIST: Where to get official, reliable info on novel coronavirus)
In fact, the World Health Organization and medical experts previously explained what they know so far about the 2019 novel coronavirus: that it is from a family of coronaviruses that can cause illnesses ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome. (READ: FAQs: Ano-ano ang alam natin tungkol sa 2019 novel coronavirus?)
The new coronavirus was also believed to have originated in a market in Wuhan City, China, where wildlife was sold and sanitary conditions subpar.
In defense of China. While talking about the video showed by Sotto, Locsin praised and defended China's handling of the coronavirus outbreak even as China's top leadership itself had admitted ""shortcomings and difficulties"" in government response and handling of the outbreak.
Locsin believed China's handling of the coronavirus outbreak further cemented the country as a global power for effectively handling the disease.
""This disease is only proving the resilience and strength of China. In 10 days they have built a massive containment facility. That only shows that...this challenge will not weaken China but will strengthen it in the eyes of the world as a power that just cannot be defeated even by nature,"" he said.

In a phone interview with Rappler, Legazpi City acting police chief Lieutenant Colonel Aldwin Gamboa confirmed that they had filed a case on Tuesday afternoon accusing the man of violating Article 155 of the Revised Penal Code, which bans inappropriately causing alarm and scandal.
Gamboa said the man apparently laid down and acted sick in front of Yashano Mall in the city's port district on Sunday afternoon, but ended up causing unnecessary panic.
There's no arrest yet: Gamboa clarified that the man who pulled the apparent prank has not been arrested as they have not secured an arrest warrant.
If the case prospers, the man could be imprisoned from 1 to 30 days, or could be fined at most P200.

,"February 04, 2020",nCov,Senate hearing bares gaps in PH contact tracing for novel coronavirus,Janella Paris,"
HEALTH CHIEF. Health Secretary Francisco Duque III attends the Senate hearing on the Philippines' preparedness on the 2019 novel coronavirus on February 4, 2020. 
MANILA, Philippines – The Department of Health (DOH) has only contacted 17% or around 50 of the 331 passengers who may have come in contact with the country's first two confirmed cases of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), revealing gaps in the government’s protocol for tracking down potentially infected persons. 
Health Secretary Francisco Duque III made the statement in a Senate hearing on Tuesday, February 4, after Senator Nancy Binay asked for a  progress report on DOH efforts to track down passengers on the same flights as the couple from Wuhan, China, one of whom became the first person to die of the virus outside China.  (READ: TIMELINE: The novel coronavirus epidemic)
“I’ll be the first one to admit, it’s not easy to do this,” Duque said, referring to contact tracing, during the Senate hearing on the Philippine government's preparedness against the 2019-nCoV attended by a number of Cabinet officials led by Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea.
The Philippines' 2019 nCoV cases – a 38-year-old woman and 44-year-old man – traveled from Wuhan via Hong Kong, and from there took a Cebu Pacific flight to Cebu, then later another Cebu Pacific flight to Dumaguete.  Days later, they a took Philippine Airlines flight to Manila. They were both admitted to the San Lazaro Hospital in Manila upon arrival but the man died nearly a week later, on February 1.
Senators took turns grilling government officials on the issue of contact tracing, which is crucial in stemming the spread of the dread virus, which has killed over 400 people and infected over 20,000 people in 25 countries, mostly in China.
Senators noted the apparent lack of communication between the DOH and the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) and the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP) regarding contact tracing.
“Nakakalungkot na parang hindi kayo nag-uusap (It's disappointing to see that it seems you haven’t been speaking to each other). Secretary Duque, you could have coordinated with CAAP and CAB if you are having these difficulties,” said Binay.
Though Cebu Pacific and Philippine Airlines had both released statements about cooperating with the health department’s Bureau of Quarantine (BOQ) and providing the necessary flight manifest data, Duque said airlines had shared flight manifests but had “not been sharing contact details of passengers and invoking confidentiality.”
“They are invoking Data Privacy. This is rather strange, in this urgent situation, I do not understand why this is the case. But I think this has to be investigated,” Duque said.  
But CAB Executive Director Carmelo Arcilla said airlines would readily give such information under current circumstances. “In my experience, the experience of our office, they would be willing to share it, especially during an event like this,” he said. 
CAAP General Manager Eddie Monreal said, “People, as long as you tell them the flight number, I’m sure, if they were on board, they would also volunteer themselves, so I don’t see a reason why the airlines would withhold the names.” 
Monreal added that only the passengers who occupied the 4 seats in front, 4 seats behind, 4 seats to the left, and 4 seats to the right of infected people – not all plane passengers – have to be contacted, as planes have hospital-grade HEPA filters, which clear the air of airborne particles and viruses.  
But Duque also admitted that there might be a “lack of transparency on the part of some (DOH) people.” Visibly flustered, Duque said, “In all of our meetings, there have been no indications raised to me that this has been a problem.” 
Senator Francis Pangilinan said of the apparent lapse, ""When only 17% of those passengers have been contacted since this issue erupted, I don’t think it’s only a failure of communication, I think it is also a failure of leadership on the part of the health department.""
The DOH had said since the confirmation of the first 2019-nCoV case in the Philippines on January 30 that it was on top of identifying people the patient interacted with, as well as the establishments that she went to and employees she had been in contact with. So far, it has established 8 of these people as persons under investigation, meaning they showed symptoms of respiratory illness. 
As of Tuesday, February 4, the DOH was probing 80 people for 2019-nCoV. This figure includes the 2 confirmed cases, 68 others who were still in hospitals, and 10 who have been discharged but are under monitoring. Of these, 48 samples are awaiting confirmation for the 2019-nCoV while 30 have tested negative. – Rappler.com  "

MANILA, Philippines – The Senate committees on health and demography and finance on Tuesday, February 4, hold a hearing to discuss the government’s preparedness to respond to the 2019 novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV threat, which has been declared a public health emergency of international concern by the World Health Organization.
The Philippines has so far confirmed 2 cases of 2019-nCoV, one of whom died due to pneumonia as a result of being infected by the virus. Currently, the Department of Health (DOH) is investigating 78 other patients who have shown symptoms of respiratory illness and have had history of travel to Wuhan, China, the outbreak’s epicenter.
The government has also imposed a temporary travel ban to and from mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau. The government is also seeking to repatriate the over 300 Filipinos in Hubei province, where Wuhan is. Have these measures been enough? – Rappler.com

AKLAN, Philippines – The impact of the coronavirus outbreak on Boracay's tourism industry could be worse than the Boracay closure.
Peter Tay, liaison officer to Boracay for the Chinese Embassy in the Philippines, expressed fears that travel restrictions could further hurt tourism businesseses and tourist spending. 
 
""It is going [from] bad to worse. When the Boracay closure happened, you could look forward [to the] October 26 re-opening. Itong situation ngayon, hindi natin alam when it will end, (We don't know when this current situation will end),"" Tay said on a Radyo Todo Aklan interview on Monday, February 3. 
On Sunday, February 2, President Rodrigo Duterte restricted the inbound travel of foreigners from China and its special administrative regions to the Philippines, and required Filipinos and those holding permanent resident visas to undergo a 14-day quarantine. (READ: China coronavirus death toll rises to 425 – gov't)
The directive, however, didn't mention how long the temporary ban would last. 
Carriers including Philippine Airlines, Cebu Pacific, Xiamen Air, China Eastern Air, OK Air, and Air Asia have suspended or canceled flights to and from China, Macau, and Hong Kong. (READ: Traveling amid coronavirus outbreak? Here's what you need to know)
Almost 60% of island hopping and water sports activities, as well as majority of vendors, tattoo artists, and beach masseuses will be affected by the temporary ban. Chinese restaurants owners have decided to close shop, while hotels across the island have recorded cancelations. 
The island – which saw 434,175 Chinese tourists, or 50% of its 865,419 foreign visitors, last year – is usually packed with travelers during the peak season of January to May. 
“We were caught by surprise, but we have to accept that this is actually happening. No hard feelings. I am more concerned [for] the livelihood  of the local workers affected by the situation,"" Tay added. 
As a precaution, Tay also encouraged hotel workers to visit hospitals or medical care facilities if they experience coughing and difficulty in breathing.
Meanwhile, acting Malay town mayor Frolibar Bautista said he will no longer declare a temporary ban on tourists from China and its special administrative regions in the area since President Duterte already issued a directive. 
Boracay hasn't come to complete standstill, however, as the island continues to accommodate Koreans, Taiwanese, and tourists from long-haul destinations.

HEALTH PRECAUTIONS. Metro Manila commuters wear face masks as protection from the novel coronavirus on February 3, 2020. Photo by Jire Carreon/Rappler  
MANILA, Philippines – President Rodrigo Duterte on Monday, February 3, said the government would procure face masks for Filipinos as stockpiles of surgical face masks were depleted amid fears over the spread of the 2019 novel coronavirus.
Duterte made the announcement after holding a meeting with Cabinet members regarding the Philippine government's response to the novel coronavirus outbreak.
""Is government doing something to buy more, to protect more? Yes we are doing it (procuring masks). We are not just sitting down here. We have resources coming,"" Duterte told reporters in a press briefing in Malacañang on Monday night.
Panic buying. After the Department of Health confirmed the first case of coronavirus in the Philippines on January 30, Filipinos raced to drugstores to purchase face masks out of fear of contracting the virus.
In areas such as Cebu City, suppliers were forced to ration masks while pharmacies implemented a ""one box per person"" policy to prevent hoarding. In Metro Manila, individuals likewise emptied pharmacies' and medical supply stores' shelves of masks, prompting the police to deploy personnel to manage crowds.
This came despite the World Health Organization saying that masks are not needed by healthy people with no respiratory symptoms.
Downplaying outbreak. Meanwhile, Duterte downplayed the spread of the novel coronavirus to the country, saying the public's ""hysteria"" over the virus was unwarranted.
""This coronavirus is scaring people all over. The response of the people from the initial reports of the coronavirus was almost hysterical when there was really no need for it, actually,"" Duterte said.
""Why do you have to be hysterical? Why don't you just go to the hospital and have yourself treated?"" he added.
So far, the Department of Health has confirmed two cases of the novel coronavirus in the Philippines. On Monday, health officials said they were also monitoring 80 persons under investigation for the virus.
The Philippines recorded the first death due to the novel coronavirus outside China in a 44-year-old Chinese man who traveled to the Philippines from Wuhan. The man was the country's second confirmed case of the novel coronavirus, and a companion of the first patient, a 38-year-old Chinese woman.
As of Monday, the virus has killed 362 people and infected over 17,000 people worldwide. – Rappler.com

CORONAVIRUS RESTRICTIONS. President Rodrigo Duterte reiterates travel restrictions against non-Filipinos coming to the country directly from China, Hong Kong, and Macau as the novel coronavirus spreads. Malacañang photo 
MANILA, Philippines – President Rodrigo Duterte on Monday, February 3, rejected calls for the Philippine government to bar all Chinese from entering the country as he hit the display of xenophobia against Chinese amid the global spread of the 2019 novel coronavirus.
Duterte made the statement Monday night, addressing calls online that supposedly urged the Philippine government to bar all Chinese from entering and send those in the country back to China.
""If the question is if I will bar Chinese from entering, the answer of course is no. That is an utter disrespect to a human being.... This mentioning [of] the Chinese and blaming them is xenophobia,"" Duterte said in a press conference Monday night.
""Stop this xenophobia thing,"" he added.
Duterte said calls to have Chinese in the Philippines return to China were ""a case of bad taste."" He sought to remind Filipinos that Chinese were not at fault for the emergence of the disease, which could have propagated in other places. (READ: Robredo urges Filipinos to respect Chinese amid coronavirus spread)
""It happened in China – at least the first [case] – but that is not the fault of anybody. Not of the Chinese, not the Filipinos, not of anyone,"" he said.
The President then urged the public to ""remember"" the thousands of Filipinos who are in China, saying countries should help one another take care of its citizens.
""We have many Filipinos in China. Even if we have none, we are a community of nations, we cooperate. China has been kind to us, we can only show the same,"" Duterte said.
Travel restrictions. The Philippine government on Sunday, February 2, implemented a ban against non-Filipinos coming to the country directly from China, Hong Kong, and Macau in an effort to quell the spread of the virus.
The restrictions, Duterte said, do not cover Chinese who hold valid Philippine visas and are coming from other countries outside China. 
Aside from this, the Philippines also temporarily stopped issuing visas to travelers from China, Hong Kong, and Macau, while immigration officials suspended the visa upon arrival mechanism for Chinese tourists and businessmen.
Asked if the government is considering expanding travel bans to include other countries with confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus, Duterte said the Philippines would follow the advice of the World Health Organization (WHO).
""They (WHO) have all the inputs and they would know what to do...we go by the regulations that will be given out by the WHO. We cannot act on our own,"" he said.
Travel bans, though, were imposed even if the World Health Organization warned that closing borders was likely ineffective in halting transmission of the virus. 
Slow to act? Duterte has been criticized for being slow to act on the novel coronavirus compared to other countries which swiftly put in place sweeping restrictions to quell the spread of the virus and informed the public of such measures.
Despite this, the President said ""everything is well"" in the Philippines and that there's ""nothing really to be extra scared of.""
""It will die a natural death, ito matatapos rin ito (this too shall pass), will it worsen in the meantime? Maybe.... [But] the progress of medical science now is far different than the yesteryears,"" Duterte said as he expressed confidence that health experts would find a ""solution"" to the novel coronavirus. 
While health officials have given assurances they are closely monitoring suspected novel coronavirus cases in the country, they repeatedly reminded the public to practice good personal hygiene such as frequent handwashing and to seek medical treatment immediately, if necessary.
So far, the Department of Health has confirmed two cases of the novel coronavirus in the Philippines.
These include the first death outside China – a 44-year-old Chinese man who traveled to the Philippines from Wuhan. The man was the country's second confirmed case of the novel coronavirus, and a companion of the first patient, a 38-year-old Chinese woman.

BACOLOD, Philippines – At least 5 individuals were quarantined at a hospital in Negros Oriental while two others were quarantined at another hospital in Bacolod City after exhibiting flu-like symptoms.
The Department of Health (DOH) on Sunday, February 2, confirmed the second case of the novel coronavirus in the Philippines. Both confirmed cases traveled to the Philippines from Wuhan, China.
The second patient, who was the traveling companion of the first confirmed case, died on Saturday, February 1 – the first death recorded outside China. The DOH is currently monitoring 80 patients for possible infection.
The 5 persons being monitored in Negros Oriental came in contact with the two confirmed cases, who both had a travel history to Dumaguete City.
Provincial Information Officer Bimbo Miraflor, in a press conference on Monday, February 3, said swab samples were already taken from the 5 individuals – a plane passenger, two hotel employees, and two from a resort – and were sent to the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine for tests.
Miraflor said two of these persons have fever, while the others have cough and sore throat.
He said another 25 individuals who came in contact with the two confirmed cases were also being monitored. Although they were not exhibiting flu-like symptoms, they were required to be quarantined in 14 days. 
Negros Oriental Governor Roel Degamo instructed the Provincial Social Welfare and Development Office to assist those who were identified to have direct contact with the two confirmed cases. The provincial government will provide them P5,000 assistance as they will not be able to work while under quarantine.
The provincial government again called on those who came in contact with the two confirmed cases to visit or present themselves to the Provincial Epidemiology and Surveillance Unit or the Negros Oriental Provincial Hospital. 
Due diligence
Meanwhile, Negros Occidental Governor Eugenio Jose Lacson announced on Monday that two patients were also quarantined in a hospital in Bacolod City.
The suspected patients are a 43-year-old Canadian who came from Taiwan, and a 12-year-old Filipino who traveled from Macau, China, and Hong Kong. 
Lacson said the Canadian was admitted to a hospital on Friday, January 31, adding that a private hospital initially refused the admission of the patient.
The Filipino was admitted to a hospital the following day, February 1, he said.
Lacson said the patients did not travel together.
He called on the public not to panic. ""We're debating [whether] to announce this or not, but it is not fair [if we will not announce it].... I can't just keep it from the public. Because of due diligence, we monitored two persons under investigation,"" he said.
""We don't want to create a scare. It's good [that we know] because they are now being quarantined,"" he said.
Lacson said the results will be out in 48 hours, and that the provincial government will continue to trace those who had direct contact with the patients. He also advised them to submit to the quarantine procedure.
He stressed that there is still no confirmed case of the novel coronavirus in Negros Occidental.
Lacson said the provincial government will reactivate its Provincial Infectious Disease Action and Control Committee to curb the possible spread of the virus.
Lacson also called on private hospitals to be prepared.
""I hope, if there is a need for them to admit a patient with suspected symptoms, just in case, I hope these private hospitals will be willing to treat these patients,"" he added.

MANILA, Philippines – Overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) affected by the temporary travel ban to mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau will receive assistance in the form of cash, accommodation, and transportation from the government. 
The Overseas Workers Welfare Administration (OWWA) said in a Monday, February 3, memorandum that it would provide P10,000 to each OFW supposed to travel back to mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau, but was instead stranded in Manila airports after the announcement of a travel ban to and from the said areas affected by the 2019 novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV outbreak. 
Aside from cash, they will also be accommodated in a OWWA halfway house. The agency will pay for their travel back to their provinces of origin. OWWA said OFWs may avail of the assistance from OWWA officers at the aiports or through the OWWA hotline at 1348.
Though they have no precise numbers, the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) estimated that around 300 OFWs were stranded in Manila airports on Monday, February 3, after the travel ban was imposed. Most of them were bound for Hong Kong and Macau, DOLE added.  
Malacañang had initially announced a travel ban to and from Hubei province, whose capital is Wuhan, ground zero of the outbreak. (READ: PH expands visa suspension for travelers from China, Hong Kong, Macau)
But the travel ban was expanded Sunday, February 2, to cover all of mainland China and the special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau, shortly before the Department of Health (DOH) announced the second case of 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease in the country. 
The ban means that all non-Filipinos traveling from China and its special administrative regions would be barred from entering the country. Travelers coming from transit points in Hong Kong will be covered by the travel ban as well. Likewise, Filipinos would be barred from departing for China, Hong Kong, and Macau. 
Airlines have also followed suit, with several flights to the 3 areas canceled in an effort to contain the spread of the virus.
The Philippines also temporarily stopped issuing visas to travelers from China, Hong Kong, and Macau.

As of Monday, the virus has killed at least 360 people, including one in the Philippines. As of 12 pm on Monday, there are a total of 27 patients under investigation in the National Capital Region..
President Rodrigo Duterte expanded the Philippine government's ban on travelers, covering any person coming directly from China, Hong Kong, and Macau within the last two weeks. 
Here is how LGUs in Metro Manila are preparing for possible new cases of the highly infective virus.
Quezon City
Quezon City Mayor Joy Belmonte is set to inspect 3 government-run hospitals – Quezon City Medical Center, Rosario Maclang Bautista General Hospital, and Novaliches District Hospital – for their readiness in the event of more 2019-nCoV cases.
The 3 hospitals have been equipped with the necessary safety equipment, such as an isolation tent, to take in people suspected of carrying the virus. The tent would allow patients to be isolated from other hospital patients.
These hospitals are also part of the task force for monitoring and responding to the virus.
Private hospitals have also been briefed with regard to the protocols in handling suspected nCoV patients.
Further, 80 frontline responders and logistics personnel of the Quezon City DRRMO were trained on the proper use of personal protective equipment, proper handling of patients, and proper disposal and disinfection of equipment.
Quezon City Health Department Head Dr. Esperanza Arias has also oriented doctors on the virus and activated fever lanes in multiple health facilities to expedite the response to 2019-nCoV concerns.
Quezon City residents may contact the city's 122 hotline for information on nCoV.
Parañaque City
According to Parañaque City Health Office head Olga Virtusio, all medical officers have already been informed about the virus, and hospitals have already prepared for isolation of persons under investigation. 
Virtusio said that while they have a makeshift tent, they are lobbying for another isolation tent of better quality.
She added that triaging is already in place as well. Triage involves the assessment and immediate isolation of carriers of 2019-nCoV away from other patients, according to the World Health Organization. 
Moreover, information on the virus is being printed for dissemination, said Virtusio. 
Pasig City
In a Facebook post, Pasig City Mayor Vico Sotto said that a quarantine tent has been set up at the Pasig City General Hospital for those with symptoms of the flu.
In addition, Sotto said healthcare professionals in the emergency room are implementing the triage algorithm of patients with suspected nCoV infection.
Further, infrared thermometers have been turned over to the Department of Education-Pasig, to be distributed to 44 public schools. The thermometers will be used at the entrances of schools starting Monday to check if students have a fever.

The measure must be able to go through 3 successful readings in the House and in the Senate before it can be transmitted to Malacañang for President Rodrigo Duterte's signature.

Only Filipino citizens and permanent resident visa holders are exempted from the ban.
""We implement the directive to the letter. What we are looking at is not the nationality, but where they came from,"" Sandoval said.

Epidemiology Bureau Director Ferchito Avelino said that 8 of the new cases being monitored are people who came in contact with the couple from Wuhan, China, who were the first positive cases of 2019-nCoV in the Philippines. The 8 people showed signs of coughs and colds, according to Avelino. 
Avelino added that the Epidemiology Bureau has found a total of 74 contacts the couple interacted with in Cebu and Dumaguete. They have been advised to go on home quarantine and are discouraged from interacting with other people within 14 days. 
The increase in cases being probed comes as the criteria for probing expanded to persons coming not just from Hubei province but also from all of mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau. 
Health Francisco Duque III also said the increase was “due to the strengthened surveillance system and contact tracing of the Epidemiology Bureau,"" but this is amid criticism that the health department has been very late in its response to the virus that has claimed more than 360 lives and sickened 16,823 as of Februrary 3.
Lawmakers, as well as the public, had been calling for a travel ban on all of mainland China even before the first case of 2019-nCoV was confirmed in the Philippines, but their calls were met with the president’s statement saying a ban would imperil economic and diplomatic relations with China.
Duterte finally answered the call for a ban on travelers from mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau, on the same day that the DOH announced the first 2019-nCoV-related death in the Philippines – the first one outside of China. 
The DOH continues to urge the public to remain calm and practice proper hygiene and coughing etiquette to prevent infection. It also calls on the public not to hoard surgical masks, as they are only needed by people showing symptoms. The DOH is asking that they be reserved to ""people who need them most, especially medical personnel.""
Duterte is set to meet with the DOH and other medical experts on Monday to discuss government response to the disease. Health officials are looking at two military facilities as possible quarantine areas for Filipinos returning from Wuhan, China, Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana said on Saturday, February 1. These sites are not final, Duque said, but they will be discussed in Monday's cabinet meeting. The Department of Foreign Affairs said that 42 Filipinos have so far requested for repatriation from Wuhan, the epicenter of the viral outbreak. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – About 300 Chinese were left stranded at several terminals across the country, following the Philippine government's sweeping travel restrictions imposed amid the global spread of the 2019 novel coronavirus.
Bureau of Immigration Spokesperson Dana Sandoval disclosed this during a press briefing at Malacañang on Monday, February 3, adding the number included Chinese who wished to return home to China after trips to the Philippines.
""Three hundred Chinese nationals are stranded...because most airlines cancelled their flights [to China],"" Sandoval said.
Apart from the 300 Chinese, Sandoval said other foreigners were also stranded at several terminals, though most have been able to depart as of Monday.
In limbo. The Duterte government on Sunday, February 2, implemented an entry ban against non-Filipinos coming to the country from China, Hong Kong, and Macau. Government authorities have likewise barred Filipinos from leaving the country to travel to China and its special administrative regions.
The sweeping travel restrictions have prompted airlines to follow suit, with several flights to China, Hong Kong, and Macau cancelled in an effort to quell the spread of the coronavirus.
What will happen to Chinese nationals? Sandoval gave assurances affected Chinese who were stranded in the country will be able to return home as the Chinese embassy has pledged to send an aircraft to fetch their nationals stranded in the Philippines.
She likewise urged the public to refrain from unnecessary travel and to bear with government restrictions in the meantime.
The Philippines joined a growing list of countries that have put in place temporary but sweeping travel restrictions on travelers coming from China within the last two weeks. Such bans followed the health officials' announcement that the coronavirus spread to the Philippines and the World Health Organization's (WHO) declaration the outbreak as a global emergency.
Despite this, the WHO warned that closing borders was probably ineffective in halting transmission and could accelerate the virus's spread. Travel restrictions, they added, could also slow the arrival of assistance and support for the management of the virus.
As of Monday morning, February 3, the virus has killed 360 people and infected over 17,000 people worldwide. – Rappler.com

MANILA, Philippines – Vice President Leni Robredo on Sunday, February 2, urged the public not to resort to discrimination against Chinese in the Philippines amid fears over the global spread of the 2019 novel coronavirus .
Robredo said doing so would be ""wrong"" as it was akin to subjecting Chinese nationals , who likewise suffered from the virus, to further difficulty while already being on the frontlines of the infection.
Robredo sought to remind Filipinos that Chinese were not at fault for the emergence of the disease and that the public should focus on battling the virus rather than discriminating against others.
""Lahat naman ginagawa para mahanapan ng lunas iyong sakit na ito. Pero ang pakiusap lang po natin...huwag namang huhusgahan iyong lahat na mga...Chinese citizens, iyong lahat na mga bumibisita dito sa atin. Iyong sa atin po, tama na nag-iingat tayo, tama na temporarily suspended iyong mga flights. Pero ito po, walang iisang may kasalanan tayo, kaya tayo, magtulungan"" Robredo said.
(We're doing everything necessary to find a cure for this disease. What we're asking is do not judge all Chinese citizens in the Philippines. It's okay to be cautious, it is good were being careful, it is right that flights have been temporarily suspended. But this (virus) is not any one person's fault so we should help one another.)
""Hindi po nakakatulong iyong pagbabatikos, hindi po nakakatulong iyong paghuhusga sa iba pang mga nakakasalamuha natin, kasi pare-pareho lang naman po tayo,"" she added. (READ: Racism more dangerous than novel coronavirus – FilChi business group)
(It does not help to ridicule and judge others who we encounter because we're all the same.)
Robredo's reaction to government measures: Meanwhile, the Vice President said the Duterte administration's ban on travelers coming directly from China, Hong Kong, and Macau was a ""welcome development,"" though she lamented restrictions should have been taken sooner.
Robredo likewise downplayed calls for her to lead the country as she urged the Duterte government to take swift precautions against the spread of the coronavirus in the Philippines.
Robredo was referring to a Twitter poll where respondents said they wanted her to lead the country following dissatisfaction over the government's current handling of the situation.
""Iyong solusyon hindi naman ganoon. Pero ang solusyon, mas maging swift lang sana, mas maging aggressive iyong response ng gobyerno, kasi natatakot iyong tao, eh.... Hindi naman natin sinasabi na walang ginagawa, pero hanggang kasi hindi alam ng tao kung ano iyong ginagawa, iyong takot nandoon, eh,"" Robredo said.
(That's not the solution. The solution is to act swiftly and aggressively because the public is worried.... We're not saying the government isn't doing anything but until Filipinos know what is being done, the fear is there.)
Robredo urged President Rodrigo Duterte to publicly address the Filipino people when making statements, saying the public was only looking for assurances the government was taking all necessary steps to protect them.
""Alam natin na very popular si Pangulo, na kapag siya iyong mag-assure sa mga kababayan natin na lahat ginagawa ng pamahalaan, tingin ko hindi ganoon kagrabe iyong takot, eh,"" Robredo said.
(We all know the President is very popular so if he assures our countrymen that the government is doing everything it can, I don't think people will be as scared.)
The latest in the Philippines. Health officials on Sunday confirmed the second case of coronavirus in the country.
The patient, who already died, was said the be the companion of the Philippines' first confirmed case, according to health authorities. Both patients travelled to the Philippines from Wuhan, China.
The patient's death marks the first confirmed death outside of China due to the coronavirus. The WHO stressed, though, the case was not a ""locally-acquired"" as the fatality came from Wuhan.
Robredo reminded the public to practice proper personal hygiene and urged Filipinos to stay calm amid the spread of the coronavirus. 
As of early morning Sunday, February 2, the virus has killed 304 people and infected over 14,000 people worldwide. – Rappler.com

CEBU CITY, Philippines – As fear of being infected with the coronavirus grips Metro Cebu, drugstores here are forced to ration surgical face masks to meet the high demand.
Pharmacies are implementing a ""one box per person"" policy in the purchase of face masks to prevent hoarding.
  During a meeting on Friday, January 31, Cebu City Mayor Edgardo Labella requested the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) to monitor prices of face masks and to also sanction those who are hoarding these.  David Tumulak, chairperson of the City Council Committee on Disaster Risk Reduction and Management,  said that pharmacies caught selling overpriced masks will be charged with violating the Consumer’s Act and the Disaster Risk Reduction Law for hoarding. 
He said 7 pharmacies here are now being investigated for allegedly overpricing the masks.
An official statement by DTI representative Dinah Gladys Oro said there should not be a shortage of face masks in Cebu City as supplies for the Central Visayas region directly arrive here from the National Capital Region (NCR).
The DOH-Central Visayas Center for Health Development said face masks were not the only means to prevent respiratory tract infections. DOH said individuals can have good health through proper rest, diet, proper handwashing and cough etiquette. (READ: Novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV: What we know so far)
Department of Health Central Visayas Director Jaime Bernadas said that the 38-year-old Chinese national from Wuhan, who was the first confirmed patient of the coronavirus in the Philippines, had been in Cebu for only 3 hours as a transit passenger. 
“What we need to do is to be vigilant and to be healthy so we are not susceptible to the virus,” said Bernadas.
The World Health Organization declared the outbreak an international emergency. The death toll is currently at 212 as of Friday, January 31. 
The DOH recommended the use of face masks for those who are sick to help contain spreading the virus. For those going to crowded places and have pre-existing conditions, face masks may help prevent infections. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines– The Federation of Filipino Chinese Chambers of Commerce and Industry Incorporated (FFCCCII) cautioned the public not to resort to racism as the novel coronavirus spreads worldwide, adding that discrimination is more dangerous than the disease.
“Spreading fake news and racist, xenophobic messages can be more dangerous than the virus itself due to their negative effects of causing confusion, fears, rancor and instability,” FFCCCII said in a statement on Saturday, February 1.
The business chamber also reminded Filipinos that China is an important economic partner of the Philippines for a thousand years.
“In fact, we should give moral support and encouragements to China in their valiant efforts to contain this ailment,” FFCCCII said.
The group said it plans to donate a million or more face masks to Filipinos, although the World Health Organization already said that masks are not needed by healthy people with no respiratory symptoms. (READ: FAST FACTS: What's next after novel coronavirus declared an int'l emergency?)

MANILA, Philippines – Adamson University (AdU) drew flak online after it released a memorandum on Friday, January 31, directing Chinese students to observe self-quarantine for two weeks as a precautionary measure against the 2019 novel coronavirus (nCoV). 
This memorandum was released a day after the Department of Health (DOH) confirmed the first case of nCoV in the country – a 38-year-old woman who came from virus epicenter Wuhan and traveled to Cebu and Dumaguete before she was admitted to a government hospital in Manila.
Issued from the Office of the President of Adamson University and posted online by the AdU Student Government, the memorandum stated that this decision was made “to ensure a healthy and virus-free environment.” 
“Thus, we have made a decision that all Chinese students, both graduate and undergraduate, observe self-quarantine starting today until February 14, 2020,” the statement reads.
  
It added that Chinese nationals are advised to postpone all transactions inside the university for the stated period of 2 weeks. 
It also urged professors and students to maximize use of the e-learning system so as not to hamper the continuous delivery of learning for the affected students. 
Meanwhile, local students and all other students will continue with their classes.  
Racism? 
But Filipinos on social media aren’t pleased with the safety precaution ordered by Adamson University to its Chinese students. 
Some of them pointed out how this decision from the University stirred racist attacks on Chinese nationals. 
 




  
Nearly 10,000 people have been infected in China and new cases were found abroad, with more than 20 countries now affected by the disease. (READ: FAQs: Ano-ano ang alam natin tungkol sa 2019 novel coronavirus?)
Why not include travel history?
Some netizens also questioned the memorandum for singling out Chinese students and not the others with a travel history to the affected countries. 
  
  
  
Better communicated
Others defended the university saying that the memorandum was intended for good. Some said that the use of words in the memo should be phrased better. 
  
  
  
  
Soon after the memorandum posted online went on fire, the university apologized to the public. It also made clarifications to its earlier memorandum. 
“The Memorandum modifies the previous one released, and we apologize for the misimpression it may have created,” the statement reads. 
 
It clarified that those ""who travelled to and from countries with confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV, including China and/or Hongkong, within the last month, or who may have in close contact or had exposure to a potential source of infection during their travel abroad” were ordered to observe self-quarantine and seek medical attention for at least 2 weeks. 
It further noted that Chinese students and guests who were not limited by the conditions earlier stated, were not included in those directed to undergo the self-quarantine advisory and would be allowed to enter the campus, as opposed to their earlier statement. 
The university also assured its community that it was working its best to ensure the health and safety of everyone. 
The 2019-nCoV that originated from Wuhan, China, has so far killed 213 and sickened nearly 10,000 people across the country and worldwide. The World Health Organization already declared an international emergency over the virus.

AKLAN, Philippines (UPDATED) – Authorities are monitoring two persons in Dr. Rafael S. Tumbokon Memorial Hospital in Kalibo, Aklan to minimize any chance of exposure to 2019 novel coronavirus acute respiratory disease (2019-nCov ARD).
The first is a 23-year-old flight attendant who came from Wuhan, China on January 21 where she developed cough after 3 days. The cabin crew of that same flight was quarantined in a private isolation room since Thursday, January 30.
Wuhan is considered the epicenter of the 2019-nCov ARD outbreak.
The second, a 17-year-old male Chinese tourist, was also referred by a local hospital in Boracay Island to the Aklan provincial hospital after experiencing flu-like symptoms.
Meanwhile, a flight attendant from Palawan with travel history in Taiwan and Shanghai, China, however, denied she was quarantined in Aklan provincial hospital. She said she was in the hospital to get her medical clearance on January 31, Friday.
On January 28, 3 foreigners were discharged from the Aklan provincial hospital after the results of their tests for the 2019-nCov came out negative.
Provincial Health Officer I Dr. Cornelio Cuachon, Jr. said seaports and airports in Aklan were on heightened alert to step up precautions for the deadly and highly-contagious Wuhan coronavirus. PHO-Aklan was also closely coordinating with Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP) and Bureau of Quarantine (BOQ) to check incoming travelers from other countries.
Kalibo airport manager Eusebio Monserate, Jr said passengers flying to and from Shanghai, Tianjin, Fuzhou, Chengdu, Peking, Nanjing, Hangzhou, Changsha and Wuhan in China on February 1 were affected by the indefinite cancellation of flights.
""Magiging drastic ang pagbaba ng numero ng flights at arrivals ng visitors natin in Kalibo airport. Lahat ng flights to China are suspended until further notice,"" he added.
(The number of flights and arrivals of visitors in Kalibo airport will go down drastically. All of the flights to China are suspended until further notice.)
Monserate said the cancellation of around 20 commercial flights was a precautionary measure to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus, which has killed 213 people in mainland China.
Amid the coronavirus outbreak in Hubei province, the Aklan Medical Society urged the public on January 31 to observe good personal hygiene and stay healthy at all times to contain the 2019-nCOv ARD.
The common symptoms of coronavirus include breathing difficulties, cough and cold, fever and shortness of breath.
Meantime, the 11 Chinese tourists under medical observation in Kalibo, Aklan returned to China on January 31. They boarded a China Eastern Airlines plane around 2:40 pm, Friday, in Kalibo International Airport to take a four-hour flight en route to Chengdu, China.
Cuachon said the tourists were fit to travel to China after they secured medical clearances from attending doctors.
""They had no flu-like symptoms and they will be closely monitored also in China,"" he added.
The foreigners, who were spending their vacation in Boracay Island, were tracked down by health authorities. Four of them had close contacts with a coronavirus patient in Hong Kong.
On January 24, the Chinese tourists – 7 adults and 4 children – were admitted in Aklan provincial hospital in Kalibo, Aklan. The Chinese nationals were asked to stay in the Gov. Corazon L. Cabagnot Tourism and Training Center in Old Buswang, Kalibo since January 25 for medical observation for 10 to 14 days even without flu-like symptoms.
However, the anxiety of parents and students had grown after health authorities in Aklan confirmed 11 tourists have been isolated. The 'virus scare' also prompted the suspension of classes near the Aklan training center on January 29. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – Health officials are looking at two military facilities as possible quarantine areas for Filipinos returning from Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the outbreak of the novel coronavirus, Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana told reporters on Saturday morning, February 1.
Department of Health (DOH) officials visited the naval station on Caballo Island in Manila Bay on Friday, January 31, and will visit the Drug Rehabilitation Center in Fort Magsaysay in Nueva Ecija on Saturday, Lorenzana added.
In November 2014, the naval station on Caballo Island, near Corregidor Island and a part of Cavite City, served as a quarantine area for least 133 Filipino soldiers who were United Nations Peacekeepers. They had then just arrived in the Philippines after a mission in Liberia amid an outbreak of the Ebola virus in West Africa. None of the peacekeepers tested positive for Ebola.
Meanwhile, the drug treatment and rehabilitation center in Fort Magsaysay was built in late 2016 to house up to 10,000 drug dependents who were expected to surrender to the government in its “war on drugs.”
However, the facility has been mostly vacant, as most illegal drug users who surrendered to authorities were placed on community-based rehabilitation.

CEBU CITY, Philippines – Cebu’s annual water shortage could make the potential novel cornavirus (nCoV 2019) outbreak difficult to control, the World Health Organization (WHO) Philippines told Rappler on Friday, January 31.
“Water shortages affect the spread of the pathogenic organisms, such as bacteria and viruses, because lack of water will limit handwashing and compromise the cleaning and sanitation of health care facilities,” the international health body said in a statement. 
WHO Philippines was responding to our question about the impact of water scarcity, particularly in Cebu, on efforts to combat an outbreak of the 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease.    The Department of Health also recommends frequent hand washing and “good hygiene” to combat the spread of the virus. (READ: Novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV: What we know so far) “It is important that communities and health workers have access to safe and adequate water at all times to protect them from the spread of infection,” the WHO said.Water crisisSince the mid-2000s, however, Metro Cebu, an area where over 2.5 million people live, has been grappling with prolonged rotating water interruptions.   Periods of no water flow can last longer hours and affect more barangays going into the summer months, when there is little to no rainfall.  But even during the most recent rainy season, barangays across Metro Cebu experienced long water interruptions in their homes.  A resident of Barangay Kamputhaw in Cebu City told Rappler through direct message that the village often only gets water between 12 am and 5 am daily, but sometimes for less time than that.  Cebu City resident Jann Banguis sent a video to Rappler of Kamputhaw residents lining up with buckets to get water from a truck.

JM dela Mer of San Isidro, Talisay City, said his barangay currently only gets water from 4 am to 6 am daily.A resident of Barangay Luz in Cebu City reported not having water flow entirely since Thursday, January 30.  The WHO said lack of water would threaten infection prevention and control measures and “will have an impact on health.”   In the summer of 2019, over 30 barangays in Metro Cebu experienced up to 22-hour water outages because both the Jaclupan and Buhisan dams in Metro Cebu had completely dried up. (READ: 22-hour water interruptions expected as Jaclupan dam dries up)  Mayor Edgar Labella met with heads of regional government agencies on Friday to assist the city in planning its response to a potential outbreak.   Much of the discussion was focused on the quarantine of possible virus carriers, making sure hospitals were equipped to deal with patients infected by the virus, and the supply of masks.  Multiple attempts to reach Labella to ask if water distribution or sanitizer supply plans were part of the discussion went unanswered. But he is scheduled to discuss the water crisis in a public forum at the Cebu City Sports Complex on Monday, February 3. More water sources to open In January alone, the Metro Cebu Water District (MCWD) announced 15 separate water interruptions for different barangays.
MCWD spokesperson Charmaine Kara Rodriguez said the supply deficit is currently at 10,000 cubic meters per day, with a total production of 223,000 cubic meters per day. The total demand for water in Metro Cebu was an average of 500,000 cubic meters.   “Supply problems were experienced this month in areas due to leaks, non-operation of wells due to power outages, and maintenance of MCWD facilities,” Kara explained.
She said, however, that new wells scheduled to open in February and March should help add to the daily output of water production.   Additional water supply from Pilipinas Water Resources Incorporated in Mambaling is expected to add 5,000 cubic meters per day, while water sourced from Danao City is expected to add an additional 10,000 cubic meters per day.  But even with the additional sources of water, the supply would still be producing only 47% of total water demand in Metro Cebu.
The MCWD, however, acknowledged that the amount of rainfall that will come in the summer months to replenish the water supply in the Buhisan and Jaclupan dams is unpredictable. While they recognized the important of water in combating the spread of viruses, they still encouraged the public to practice water conservation in their homes.
“MCWD is advising the public to use water wisely so everyone can enjoy it. Let’s conserve where we can so we will have enough supply even during the summer months.” Kara said.   
From 2016 to 2019, Cebu City and the Province of Cebu had declared a state of calamity on diffent occasions due to drought, brought about by El Niño.  When water supply is low, the MCWD said they could deliver water to barangays where there is no service. The water district spokesperson said coordination for water deliveries would be done through the barangays and local government units.The World Health Organization declared the outbreak an international emergency. The death is currently at 212 as of Friday. After the first case of nCoV-2019 was confirmed in the Philippines – a woman who traveled to Manila via Cebu and Dumaguete – President Rodrigo Duterte imposed a ban on travelers from the Wuhan City, the epicenter of the outbreak. The ban includes flights from the rest of Hubei province, China. This would last until the 2019-nCoV threat was over. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – Several schools took extra precautionary measures Friday, January 31, to protect its employees and students from the 2019 novel coronavirus (nCoV).
This move to prevent the spread of the virus came a day after the Department of Health (DOH) confirmed the first case of nCoV in the country.   
Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said that the confirmed patient was a 38-year-old woman who came from virus epicenter Wuhan and traveled to Cebu and Dumaguete before she was admitted to a government hospital in Manila. (READ: FAQs: Ano-ano ang alam natin tungkol sa 2019 novel coronavirus?) 
Close coordination 
In a statement, the Department of Education (DepEd) said that it was in close coordination with DOH officials to implement health guidelines in schools, particularly on decisions for  lockdowns in specific communities. It also urged the schools to cooperate with DOH.
Currently, its efforts are focused on promoting awareness and precautionary measures in schools and their immediate communities, using the information materials from DOH.
“We will consolidate available information from official sources, and discuss further actions, measures and mechanisms for readiness and response,” DepEd assured. 
As of Friday, January 31, DOH added that the number of patients being monitored for 2019-nCoV climbed up to 31 from the 29 people cited by the DOH on Thursday. 
Of the 31, 25 were admitted to hospitals, 5 had been discharged but were still being strictly monitored, and one – a man with a preexisting illness – died but it had yet to be determined if he also had 2019-nCoV.
Due to the increasing number of confirmed cases and deaths, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared an international emergency over the deadly novel coronavirus that killed 212 people and infected over 8,000 worldwide as of early Friday, January 31.  
Reducing the risks
Meanwhile, to reduce the risk of infections, schools in Metro Manila and in some provinces took on the necessary steps to promote the antiseptic technique among students and employees. 
It provided hand sanitizers and rubbing alochol at the entrance of the building and in various counters inside the campus. 
According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), practicing hand hygiene is a simple yet effective way to prevent infection. 
Temperature checks were also done at school entrances.
Face masks were also given to students in some public schools. In Araullo High School for example, face masks were distributed to the students by the Manila City local government. 
According to the Philippine Society for Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (PSMID) and Philippine Hospital Infection Control Society (PHICS), face masks or surgical masks are designed to protect users from droplets and splashes that might cause possible infection. 
Both groups also reminded the public that masks are always worn colored side out.

MANILA, Philippines – Philippine Airlines (PAL) and Cebu Pacific said on Friday, January 31, they had pulled out the planes that were boarded by the Philippines' first novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) patient.
The two airlines issued separate statements on Friday, a day after the Department of Health confirmed a 38-year-old woman as the country's first case of 2019-nCoV. The woman, who also visited Cebu and Dumaguete before heading to Manila, took Cebu Pacific flights on January 21 and a PAL flight on January 25.
PAL said it placed two pilots and 4 cabin crew under quarantine. Meanwhile, the cabin crew and pilots on affected Cebu Pacific flights were also informed about the development, but Cebu Pacific said they showed no symptoms of illness.
Cebu Pacific said the planes that the nCoV patient boarded had been pulled out and disinfected. It said it was also implementing the following preventive measures:

Cleaning and disinfection of aircraft between flights
Ensuring that employees, frontline personnel, and cabin crew wear face masks while on duty
Providing face masks to passengers who show symptoms of illness
Isolating passengers who manifest symptoms of illness in empty rows inside the aircraft during the flight
Coordinating with health authorities in the event that there are passengers suspected of carrying the virus for immediate turnover and further observation

PAL said it was conducting these preventive measures:

Intensive cleaning and disinfection of aircraft used on routes to and from China
Assigning specific aircraft to be used only on China routes, arranging for these aircraft to park at designated remote areas of the Ninoy Aquino International Airport
Filtering of cabin air using special filters and air circulation systems that constantly refresh air on board and filter most coronaviruses
Thermal scanning of all arriving passengers; contributing thermal scanners to domestic airports which may not have the latest facilities
Ensuring the use of face masks by cabin crew and providing face masks to passengers upon request
Adjusting inflight service on China flights
Conducting information campaign at airports and onboard flights
reporting medical concerns in coordinating with health authorities and BoQ

The airlines also tracked down the passengers who might have come into contact with the woman who took flights on both airlines.
In coordination with the DOH and the Bureau of Quarantine, the two airlines informed the patient's co-passengers about the confirmed case so they could have themselves checked. The BoQ will handle the medical observation of the concerned passengers and airline crew.
""We are also working to trace any onward journeys made by these passengers and crew on other flights, in case there is a need for BoQ to contact other people for precautionary medical observation,"" PAL said in a statement on Friday.
Cebu Pacific has reduced its flights between the Philippines, mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau.
PAL is set to reduce flights between Manila and mainland China by more than 50%, starting February 1. PAL has canceled all charter flights from China and has also prohibited accepting passengers from the Hubei province of China.

The World Health Organization declared the outbreak an international emergency, as the death toll climbs to 212 as of Friday. In the Philippines, President Rodrigo Duterte imposed a ban on travelers from Wuhan City – the epicenter of the outbreak – and the rest of Hubei province, China, which would last until the 2019-nCoV threat was over.
The Department of the Interior and Local Government also urged local government units to create their respective coronavirus task force, and to cooperate with the DOH in contact-tracing individuals who encountered the confirmed 2019-nCoV patient.
Health officials advised the public to practice proper hygiene and coughing etiquette, including constant washing of hands and coughing into the crook of the elbow. ('Novel coronavirus or 2019 nCoV: What we know so far) – Rappler.com

MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – The Department of Health (DOH) said on Friday, January 31, that it was monitoring 31 patients for the 2019 novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV.
The latest number is up from the 29 people cited by the DOH on Thursday, January 30.
The DOH said the new patients, admitted to hospitals in Metro Manila and Eastern Visayas, were a Chinese and an American. They traveled separately and came from different regions in China, said Epidemiology Bureau Director Ferchito Avelino. (READ: ‘Novel coronavirus' or 2019 nCoV: What we know so far)
Of the 31, 25 were admitted to hospitals, 5 had been discharged but were still being strictly monitored, and 1 – a man with a preexisting illness – died but it had yet to be determined if he also had 2019-nCoV.
The cases being investigated are in the following regions:

Metro Manila - 19
Mimaropa - 1
Western Visayas - 3
Eastern Visayas - 2
Central Visayas - 4
Northern Mindanao - 1
Davao - 1

Contact tracing
Health officials announced the latest number of PUIs a day after the Philippines confirmed its first case of 2019-nCoV, a 38-year-old woman who came from virus epicenter Wuhan and traveled to Cebu and Dumaguete before she was admitted to a government hospital in Manila to be isolated. 
The DOH said it had begun contact tracing or tracking down people who were on the same flight as the patient Once identified, they would also be isolated and monitored. 
The Philippines' first nCoV patient took a Cebu Pacific flight from Hong Kong to Cebu, a CebGo flight from Cebu to Dumaguete, and a Philippine Airlines flight from Dumaguete to Manila, the DOH said. The DOH said the airlines were cooperating with them.
The DOH said it was also in the process of identifying people other people the patient might have interacted with. This would include finding personnel in hotels and other establishments that the patient went to and putting them under monitoring, but not isolation. 
“We are doing this carefully so we may release the proper advice to the contacts. We don’t want them to hide,” epidemiology bureau head Avelino said.  
Travel ban 
Amid the scare, President Rodrigo Duterte banned travel from Wuhan City and the rest of Hubei province. The Department of Foreign Affairs also said it would repatriate Filipinos in Hubei starting next week. 
The inter-agency task force headed by the DOH was set to meet on Friday to discuss a possible expansion of the travel ban to other regions in China with high incidences of the disease, especially after the World Health Organization declared an international emergency over the deadly novel coronavirus from China.
“What we want is to see the magnitude of cases in (other provinces)…. We’re thinking of setting it to at least 100 cases (before we impose a a ban),” said Health Undersecretary Eric Domingo, adding that they were coordinating with WHO for guidance on the matter.  
Lawmakers had called for a travel ban on all of China and not just Hubei province amid fears of more cases reaching the Philippines. 
As of early morning Friday, January 31, the virus has killed 212 people and infected over 8,000 people worldwide. – Rappler.com

COLD HUNTERS. Tourists enjoy the cold weather at Northern Blossom Flower Park in Atok Benguet. Photo by Mau Victa/Rappler

BAGUIO CITY – Usually cold weather is most welcome here in Baguio. 
But when the temperature dipped to 11.2 degrees at 5 am Friday, January 31, it was met with more anxiety than excitement.
It is the coldest temperature for Baguio this year. Last January 4, the temperature dipped to 11.4 degrees.
In the higher reaches of Benguet, the cold reached 10 degrees, this does not even include the wind chill factor which can bring the cold down to 5 degrees.
If the tailend of amihan or easterly winds is at its last blast, the weather might still get colder.
Last year, it reached its coldest at 9.8 degrees on January 28.
This may be good for the cold hunters. But with the first victim of coronavirus in the Philippines identified last Thursday, January 31, and persons under investigation reaching 53, the cold is actually bad news.
Cold weather is known to serve as an ideal ground for viruses like the common cold and the flu. These viruses  have achieved the ability to spread between people, as they are more stable in cold air, and low humidity helps them to “float” for longer. 
Cold weather also decreases the bodily defenses, allowing viruses to enter the body with ease.
But so far, Baguio is safe from the dreaded coronavirus.
Department of Health-Cordillera (Kagawaran Ng Kalusugan - Cordillera) Infectious Disease Cluster Head Dr. Jennifer Joyce Pira said that there are no persons under investigation (PUI) with regards to the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).
Pira said the DOH-CAR only monitored an individual who arrived from Guangzhou, China but has no history of travel to Wuhan, China and without any known contact with a confirmed 2019-nCoV case. The person also has no known contact with individuals with severe acute respiratory illness or sick animals.
She said that although the individual and two of his roommates are under quarantine, they are all doing well and show no signs of illnesses.
The DOH-CAR stressed that there are no cases of 2019-nCoV in the Cordillera region to date. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – A day after the Department of Health (DOH) confirmed the Philippines' first case of novel coronavirus, the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) called on all local government units (LGUs) to create their respective task forces to help contain the spread of the virus.
""All LGUs nationwide are advised to create their respective task forces to implement DOH protocols and guidelines and extend full cooperation to the DOH and other government agencies to meet the world health emergency,"" DILG Undersecretary Jonathan Malaya said in a statement on Friday, January 31.
Malaya said Interior Secretary Eduardo Año was prompted to give the directive after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared an international emergency in relation to the novel coronavirus outbreak that has killed 212  people in China alone as of Friday.
The DILG said the task force will be led either by the governor or the mayor, who will ensure that local health personnel have the necessary equipment and protective gear.
The task force will also handle the referral and transport of constituents suspected of  2019-nCoV infection to a DOH-designated hospital.
Local chief executives,  in coordination with the DOH, are also expected to train health workers on 2019-nCoV prevention, containment, and control. LGUs must also conduct information campaigns on the virus in their areas.
The DILG said that LGUs hosting international airports must coordinate with the Bureau of Immigration and airport authorities to ensure the implementation of quarantine procedures. 
LGUs are expected to cooperate with the DOH in the latter's contact-tracing of individuals who encountered a confirmed 2019-nCoV patient.
""The mayor should immediately inform the DOH should there be reasonable basis to place an individual under quarantine. The DOH needs the support of all LGUs in this important matter and local and police authorities should extend all possible assistance in this regard,"" Malaya said.
On Friday, the WHO declared a public health emergency of international concern, citing ""potential for the virus to spread to countries with weaker health systems.""
In the Philippines, President Rodrigo Duterte imposed a ban on travelers from Wuhan City – the epicenter of the outbreak – and the rest of Hubei province, China, which would last until the 2019-nCoV threat was over.
Other countries have taken their own precautionary measures to stem the disease. Russia had shut its border with China and would stop issuing electronic visas to Chinese nationals. A number of airlines had either halted or reduced flights to China.
The public is advised to practice proper hygiene and coughing etiquette, including constant washing of hands and coughing into the crook of the elbow. ('Novel coronavirus or 2019 nCoV: What we know so far) – Rappler.com "

BATANGAS, Philippines – Vice President Leni Robredo urged President Rodrigo Duterte’s administration to take “immediate action” on recommendations to impose a travel ban on all tourists coming from mainland China as the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a global health emergency  on the novel coronavirus or 2019-nCov.
On Friday, January 31, Robredo said the government should not waste time in ensuring Filipinos are safe, especially after the World Health Organization declaring an international emergency over the deadly new disease. 
“Wala na tayong panahon para sa mahabang usapan. Buhay ng tao ang nakasalalay kaya agarang aksyon, tamang impormasyon at mabilisang desisyon ang kailangan,” the Vice President said.
(We should not waste time by holding long discussions. The lives of people are at stake here, so immediate action, the right information, and fast decision-making are needed.)
As of Friday, the number of confirmed deaths from the coronavirus outbreak has risen to 212  after worst-hit Hubei province reported 42 new fatalities. (READ: What we know so far on the novel coronavirus)
Robredo cited several recommendations to respond to the new disease, including a temporary travel ban on all Chinese mainlanders as well as putting in place the necessary support system for Filipinos in areas with recorded cases, including possible evacuation procedures.
“Bawat minutong ipapagbukas pa ang pag-aksyon sa mga rekomendasyong ito, lalong nailalagay sa panganib ang kapakanan at kalusugan ng ating mga mamamayan,” Robredo said. 
(Every minute we spend delaying actions on these recommendations means further risking the well-being and health of our people.)
What now?
Philippine lawmakers have already urged the government to issue a temporary travel ban to and from China. The country has only temporarily stopped issuing visas to travelers from Hubei, China, the epicenter of the novel coronavirus that has so far killed 212 people there.
The government is calling for the repatriation of Filipino workers in China. On Thursday, January 30, the governor of Iloilo province called on Cebu Pacific airline to stop its flights from Hong Kong to the province's international airport. Boracay Island is considering  a ban on tourists from China. 
But WHO's emergency committee, an advisory body of international experts, said in a statement that evidence had shown that restricting movement of people and goods during public health emergencies ""may be ineffective and may divert resources from other interventions."" 
""Further, restrictions may interrupt needed aid and technical support, may disrupt businesses, and may have negative effects on the economies of countries affected by the emergencies,"" the committee said.
Asked about the proposed travel ban involving China, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said on Wednesday, January 29, that it would be “very tricky” if the Philippines only imposes it on the neighboring giant, as other countries have recorded cases of the novel coronavirus as well.
A day after Duque’s statement before the House, he confirmed the country’s first case of the 2019-nCov: a 38-year-old Chinese national who flew to Cebu, then Dumaguete in the Philippines from Wuhan City, Hubei’s capital. 
She was later admitted at a government hospital in Manila on January 25, though she was no longer showing symptoms. 
Robredo said on Friday that this health crisis means Filipinos need, now more than ever, a government that would prioritize health.
“Sa panahon ng krisis, dapat makaasa ang taumbayan sa kanyang pamahalaan na walang aaksayahing oras para unahin ang kanilang kapakanan,” she said.

'MINIMAL' ECONOMIC EFFECT. Chinese nationals arriving from Guangzhou are seen wearing face masks at the arrival area of the Ninoy Aquino International Airport in Pasay City. File photo by Ben Nabong/Rappler 
MANILA, Philippines – The government's economic managers are confident that the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) scare would have a minimal impact on Philippine growth.
Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III downplayed the possible effects of the 2019-nCov on the economy, saying that the Philippines has not been widely affected by the virus. (READ: Philippines confirms 1st case of novel coronavirus)
""We are a big enough economy that can handle this thing. We are not going into recession because of it,"" Dominguez said.
Socioeconomic Planning Secretary Ernesto Pernia, meanwhile, said the effect on tourism would be ""short-term.""
The Philippines has so far suspended visa upon arrival for Chinese tourists and businessmen, and temporarily stopped issuing visas to travelers from the Chinese province of Hubei. Wuhan, the city where the virus originated, is in Hubei.
There are strong calls to impose a temporary ban on all travel to and from China.
While the Philippine officials said the health scare would not make much of a dent in the economy internally, they acknowledged that it could be among the external factors that may affect growth in the medium term.
The economic team, composed of Dominguez, Pernia, and Budget Secretary Wendel Avisado, met on Thursday to discuss the country's economic performance and to ""forge a strategy"" to achieve the gross domestic product (GDP) growth target of 6.5% to 7.5% in 2020.
Aside from the 2019-nCov, the economic team identified the slowdown in global economic growth, lackluster recovery in trade, protectionist policies, and volatile oil prices, among others, as possible primary downside risks externally.
On the domestic front, the economic team said natural hazards, African swine fever, water supply disruptions, slow implementation of infrastructure projects, and policy ""uncertainties"" – such as the delayed passage of tax reform packages – could hinder the economic growth trajectory in the medium term.
They also said that the implementation of the Supreme Court ruling increasing local government units' share of national taxes may hinder growth, citing inefficient spending by LGUs.
Because of the risks, Dominguez said infrastructure agencies should accelerate the implementation of priority projects.
He added that the agriculture sector should grow at least 2% annually. In 2019, agriculture posted the slowest growth among major sectors at 1.5%.
Digital trade, speeding up the rollout of the 3rd major telecommunications player, and addressing regulatory issues in the e-commerce industry, among others, were seen as part of strategies to address the risks to economic growth.
The Philippines missed its GDP growth target in 2019, growing by 5.9% – the slowest in 8 years.
The economic team largely attributed that to the delayed passage of the national budget, which had stalled infrastructure projects. – Rappler.com "

On Thursday, January 30, Filipinos expressed their dismay over the Philippine government’s refusal to ban travels to and from mainland China. This, after the Department of Health (DOH) confirmed the Philippines’ first case of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).
During the House of Representatives’ question hour on Wednesday, January 29, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III explained that the government is not yet considering imposing a travel ban on tourists coming from mainland China because “confirmed cases are not limited to China.”
“If we do this, then the concerned country – China in this case – might question why we’re not doing the same for all other countries that have reported cases of the new coronavirus. It’s very tricky… but we commit to take this into consideration,” Duque said. 
Netizens slammed the decision, saying that the government’s actions – or the lack of which – would kill Filipinos faster than the virus could.

MANILA, Philippines – As the Philippines confirmed its first case of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), senators are urging the government to issue a temporary travel ban to and from China.
In separate statements, Senate President Pro-Tempore Ralph Recto, senators Risa Hontiveros, Joel Villanueva, and Christopher ""Bong"" Go supported the call.
Hontiveros proposed a temporary travel ban of at least 30 days on all individuals traveling from China, as well as travellers who passed through China within the past two weeks.  (READ: ’Novel coronavirus’ or 2019 nCoV: What we know so far)
""Our travel ban must firmly include both air and sea travel to prevent a local outbreak. This includes a temporary ban on all cruise ships from docking at any of our ports,"" Hontiveros said.
Recto questioned why the Philippines has yet to implement a travel ban, saying that Hong Kong, a special administrative region of China, had already announced plans to slash cross-border travel.
""I think it is time to put a temporary 'Do not enter sign' on our doorstep for visitors from China. Let us explain to them that we are not permanently closing our doors. This is not a permanent Great Wall. This is only during the duration of the coronavirus crisis,"" Recto said.
""If many of their (Chinese) people are not allowed to travel from Point A to B in China, then why are we allowing travel from most points in China to all points in the Philippines?"" Recto added.
The Senate president pro-tempore said that this was not an issue of racism.
""There is no hint of racism or xenophobia in this policy. This is an assertion of the national wellbeing. And an acceptance of the fact that our defenses and capacity to respond to a health emergency is not that strong,"" Recto said.
Go, meanwhile, said that he supports the call for a travel ban but will wait for the recommendation of health officials. Go, the Senate health committee head, will hold a hearing on the novel coronavirus on Tuesday, February 4.
""Antayin lang natin ang kanilang rekomendasyon. Kung sakali, pabor ako diyan para maiwasan po itong pagkalat. (Let's wait for their recommendation. If ever, I am in favor of this call to prevent it from spreading),"" Go said in an interview with Radyo Pilinas.
Deployment to China
Villanueva, the Senate labor committee chairperson, urged overseas Filipino workers to postpone their deployment to China to minimize the risk of getting affected.
For those already in quaratined areas in China, Villanueva said: ""Please follow the health protocol being observed in the area. Help our diplomatic staff there by notifying your status so that every Filipino is accounted for.""
Villanueva also urged the Department of Labor and Employment to issue a labor advisory that would remind private companies of their obligations with labor standards, particulary the Occupational Safety and Health Standards law.
""Our labor officials should seize the moment to reiterate that the health and safety of our workers must be of paramount concern to employers. Our OSHS law states this principal clearly and unequivocally,"" Villanueva said.
Health Secretary Francisco Duque III on Thursday, January 30, announced the first confirmed case of 2019-nCoV in the country. The patient is a 38-year-old woman who traveled from Wuhan, China, the ground zero of the outbreak, via Hong Kong, on January 21. 
The virus has claimed 170 lives in China and infected thousands of people in that country alone.  Travel to and from Wuhan had been restricted, as the government halted the issuance of visas to travelers from Hubei province.
The Philippines on Tuesday, January 28 had already suspended visa upon arrival for Chinese visitors due to health threat. The Civil Aeronautics Board had also suspended all airline operations between Wuhan and any destination in the Philippines. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – The Philippine Stock Exchange index (PSEi) continued to slip on Thursday, January 30, as concerns surrounding the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) lingered globally.
The bellwether PSEi lost over 69 points or 0.9% and fell to 7,392. This is the PSEi’s new one-year low since December 26, 2018. 
Net foreign selling at the local stock market stood at -$10.1 million after the -$6.9 million registered on Wednesday, January 29.

The peso also weakened to P50.96 to $1 on Thursday, the weakest in a week and among the weakest in 3 weeks.
Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation chief economist Michael Ricafort attributed the depreciation to ""increased global risk aversion"" of investors to most Asian currencies due to the novel coronavirus cases.
Ricafort said the following businesses are likely to take a hit due to the coronavirus scare:

Travel
Tourism
MICE (meetings, incentives, conventions, exhibitions)
Airlines
Hotels and accommodation
Leisure
Entertainment
Gaming and casinos
Restaurants
Catering
Retail trade

However, Ricafort noted that the Philippine economy is less dependent on foreign tourism as the main source of economic growth. 
""Thus, the adverse effects of any slowdown in tourism business due to the coronavirus, especially if temporary and eventually contained, could have less or minimal impact on the local economy or GDP (gross domestic product) growth compared to other ASEAN or Asian countries that are more dependent on tourism and exports as major contributors to their respective economies or GDP,"" Ricafort said.

MANILA, Philippines (3rd UPDATE) – The Philippines on Thursday, January 30, confirmed its first case of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).
The Philippines' first 2019-nCoV patient is among the 29 people monitored by the Department of Health (DOH), Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said in a news briefing on Thursday.  (WATCH: DOH updates on 2019 novel coronavirus) 
Duque said the patient is a 38-year-old woman who traveled to the Philippines from Wuhan, China, via Hong Kong on January 21. She is currently in a government hospital, where she was admitted on January 25, but was no longer showing symptoms.
DOH Epidemiology Bureau Director Ferchito Avelino said authorities would check the establishments that she went to and trace employees she had been in contact with.
The samples from the Chinese woman was among the 6 sent to the Victorian Infectious Disease Reference Laboratory in Australia for testing earlier this week. The 5 others tested negative. 
Succeeding tests for 2019-nCoV will now be done by the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM), as the DOH has already acquired the necessary test kit for the procedure, the results of which may be available within 24 hours of testing.
Wuhan is the epicenter of the outbreak that had claimed 170 lives in China and infected thousands of people in that country alone. Other confirmed cases have been reported in several countries. (READ: ’Novel coronavirus’ or 2019 nCoV: What we know so far)
Travel to and from Wuhan had been restricted, as the government halted the issuance of visas to travelers from Hubei province. 
Duque said on Thursday that he would recommend that travel restrictions be expanded in light of the first confirmed case. The Inter-agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases would meet on Friday, January 31, to discuss other government measures. 
'Stay calm'
The Philippine health chief appealed for sobriety amid the country's first case of 2019-nCoV.
“I assure the public that the Department of Health is on top of this evolving situation. We were able to detect the first confirmed case because of our strong surveillance system, close coordination with the World Health Organization and other national agencies,"" he said.
""I advise the public to stay calm and be vigilant at all times,"" Duque added.
The 29 patients under investigation are in the following areas:

Metro Manila - 18
Cental Visayas - 4
Western Visayas - 3
MIMAROPA -1
Eastern Visayas - 1
Northern Mindanao - 1 
Davao - 1

Of these patients, 23 were admitted in hospitals, 5 were discharged but remained under strict monitoring, while 1 died of pneumonia on Wednesday, January 29, at the San Lazaro Hospital but was still being tested for the 2019-nCoV virus.
Health officials reminded the public to practice proper hygiene and constant washing of hands, as well as proper coughing etiquette or coughing into the crook of the elbow, amid the virus scare. They also reassured the public that DOH hospitals, with their respective isolation areas, were ready to respond to the disease.  – Rappler.com

MANILA, Philippines – Health Secretary Francisco Duque III confirmed that the Department of Health (DOH) now has the capability to test samples for the novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV, no longer needing to send them to Australia for confirmation.
The primer needed to identify if suspected cases are positive for 2019 nCoV have been acquired from Japan, Duque said during a question hour before the House of Representatives on Wednesday, January 29. (WATCH: House question hour with health chief Duque on novel coronavirus)
The primer will allow the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM), the health department’s research arm, to determine ""within 48 hours"" whether samples from persons under investigation are positive for 2019-nCoV, which has infected over 6,000 in China and beyond, and killed over 130 in China, most of them in the city of Wuhan.
Initially, the RITM could only test samples for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the coronaviruses that caused outbreaks of SARS or severe acute respiratory syndrome and MERS or Middle East respiratory syndrome. 
The DOH had been sending samples to the Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory in Melbourne, Australia, prior to the acquisition of the 2019-nCoV primer. Duque said the 2019-nCoV primer would cut testing time “by 50%.” 
The Australian laboratory is currently processing 6 samples from the Philippines for 2019-nCoV, the results of which are expected either by Thursday, January 30, or Friday, January 31. All samples after these will be tested by the RITM.
What’s the latest on 2019-nCoV? The DOH confirmed on Wednesday, January 29, that a man under investigation for 2019-nCoV died early that day of complications due to pneumonia. (READ: 'Novel coronavirus' or 2019 nCoV: What we know so far)
The 29-year-old was a man from Yunnan, China, and had “many swollen lymph nodes,” renal warts, and was tested for HIV. The hospital director of San Lazaro Hospital in Manila, where the patient had been admitted since Monday, January 27, said the man tested positive for HIV. The DOH said it would still run tests on samples collected from the deceased patients to confirm if he had 2019-nCoV. 
Meanwhile, the government temporarily stopped issuing visas to travelers not just from Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, but also Hubei province on Tuesday night, January 28. The Department of Foreign Affairs also said it would assist all Filipinos in Wuhan who wish to be repatriated. So far, two have come home and are under self-quarantine, the DOH confirmed. 
The DOH also met with all regional health directors on Wednesday to discuss local response to the emerging threat. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – A man who was among those being monitored for the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in the national capital died of complications due to pneumonia, the Department of Health (DOH) said on Wednesday, January 29. 
San Lazaro Hospital Director Edmundo Lopez said in a news briefing that the 29-year-old man from Yunnan, China, died early Wednesday morning but stressed that he was not yet a confirmed case of 2019-nCoV. Tests would still be conducted on samples to be taken from him.
""Cause of death is pneumonia.... The patient was seen with various symptoms upon admission,"" Lopez said, when asked to confirm if one of the patients under investigation had died.
Lopez said the man was admitted to San Lazaro Hospital in Manila on Monday, January 27. Upon admission, Lopez said the man had ""many swollen lymph nodes,"" renal warts, and was tested for HIV. He said the patient ""tested positive"" twice for HIV during the initial and confirmatory tests. (READ: ’Novel coronavirus’ or 2019 nCoV: What we know so far)

PROTEST. Residents and local leaders ask the Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority to temporarily ban the arrival of cruise ships in Subic. All photos from Randy Datu/Rappler 
ZAMBALES, Philippines – The Subic tour of cruise ship MV World Dream was canceled due to intense pressure from residents and local leaders for the Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority (SBMA) to temporarily stop accepting cruise ships amid the novel coronavirus scare.
The cruise ship from China arrived in Manila on Tuesday, January 28, and its 778 passengers were ""authorized to travel"" by the Bureau of Quarantine.
Scheduled to arrive in Subic on Wednesday, January 29, the ship instead decided to cancel its arrival and head back to Hong Kong.
In a January 28 letter, Olongapo Mayor Rolen Paulino Jr urged SBMA Chairman and Administrator Wilma Eisma to ""temporarily stop accepting cruise ships until the (novel coronavirus) threat has been controlled.""
He cited the ""uncertainty and lack of information"" on the novel coronavirus, the virus that originated from Wuhan, China, and has so far killed at least 106 and sickened thousands across China and several other countries. 
Paulino also noted that ""infected persons do not manifest any of its symptoms until much later.""
He said temporarily stopping cruise ships from docking in Subic ""would not be unprecedented considering that various cities worldwide have implemented lockdowns in response to this disease.""
'Loss of income'
The night before, Eisma issued a statement that said, ""I have personally discussed the Subic situation with Health Secretary Francisco Duque today and confirmed to him that safety protocols are in place at the Port of Subic.""
""He advised that there is not a need just yet to stop the entry of cruise ships in Subic in view of established safety measures in the Freeport,"" she added. 
The SBMA initially highlighted the supposed loss of income that could occur if the arrival of cruise ships was rejected, but this only angered residents even more.
""As an emerging cruise ship destination in Southeast Asia, Subic expects to be adversely affected by this ongoing health emergency,"" Eisma earlier said. 
Eisma was also in the habit of asking SBMA employees to physically welcome passengers of cruise ships at the dock upon their arrival, but none were willing this time. A rumor even circulated that SBMA tourism employees would not report for work if the cruise ship was allowed to dock. 
On Tuesday, as the uproar from residents and Subic workers grew, Paulino pleaded with Eisma to ""please err on the side of caution and put primacy in the health and safety of the residents and workers of SBFZ (Subic Bay Freeport Zone) and the city and municipalities surrounding it.""
Subic Mayor Jonathan John Khonghun also sent a letter to Eisma, saying ""let us join hands to be more cautious, giving priority to the health and safety of the people in our locality.""

Backlash
It was also reported that tourism establishments in the Subic Freeport were pushing behind the scenes and working with the Subic Bay Freeport Chamber of Commerce to temporarily suspend the arrival of cruise ships.
Robert Gonzaga, president and CEO of Subic Bay Marine Exploratorium Inc (SBMEI), said in a statement: ""The SBMA has issued guidelines on how to deal with this, but they should do more to address the core issue of a temporary ban on cruise ship visits. For our part, we will refuse access to our park to cruise ship visitors if they do not comply with SBMA guidelines, and our [government's] health and safety policies."" 
SBMEI is the corporate owner and operator of Ocean Adventure, Adventure Beach Waterpark, and Camayan Beach Resort and Hotel – top attractions in the Freeport.
Gonzaga said that more important considerations should be prioritized over short-term income.
""We have put in place several measures to protect our guests, as well as our employees, from any health risk associated with the coronavirus. We want to reassure the public that safety comes first, last, and always for SBMEI,"" he added.
The backlash to Eisma's stance on the issue culminated in a rally in front of the main gate of the Subic Freeport, where about 200 residents and Freeport workers brandished signs that read: ""No to cruise ships in the meantime,"" ""Konting malasakit naman SBMA,"" and ""Mas mahalaga ba ang kita kesa sa kaligtasan ng mamamayan ng Olongapo?""
While the rally was ongoing, cheers went up as news broke that the MV World Dream has decided to cancel its visit to Subic.
For her part, Eisma immediately took to Facebook and posted a statement saying, in part, that the cruise visit ""has been canceled by Genting Cruise Lines, the operator of the cruise liner, in face of the circumstances on the ground.""
She said that the Subic Bay Freeport community can ""breathe a sigh of relief in the outcome that, we hope, is acceptable and satisfactory to all.""
Despite this announcement, however, the SBMA is still silent on whether or not a temporary ban on cruise ships is already in place in the Subic Bay Freeport. 
Among the groups that exerted pressure on the SBMA were Batang Gapo People's Organization Incorporated, Olongapo City local government units, Aeta leaders, all 17 barangay captains, and other people's organizations.
""Why would we put ourselves in harm's way if we can prevent it? If in their own country, they have already implemented a lockdown, why can't we do the same here?"" Barangay Gordon Heights Captain Priscilla Echie Ponge, one of the 17 barangay captains, said. – Rappler.com "

AKLAN, Philippines – Eleven Chinese tourists – 7 adults and 4 children – tracked down in a resort on Boracay Island are under medical observation by the Provincial Health Office (PHO) of Aklan for possible exposure to the novel coronavirus. 
Four of them were in close contact with an infected coronavirus patient in Hong Kong, Provincial Health Officer I Dr. Cornelio Cuachon Jr said on Tuesday, January 28.  
The 11 Chinese nationals from Hubei province were supposed to spend a one-month vacation in Boracay when Hong Kong authorities alerted the Philippine health officials to conduct intensive contact-tracing. Hubei has been on lockdown, limiting the movements of some 60 million people, since the new coronavirus broke out in its capital city of Wuhan last December.  
The tourists traveled from Hong Kong to Kalibo via Manila on January 22. Seven other Chinese people were traced by health authorities in close contacts with the 4 Chinese tourists in Boracay Island. 
It was not immediately known if the 4 Chinese who were in close contact with a confirmed case in Hong Kong were the family who landed in Manila on January 22 via Cebu Pacific, and which the Bureau of Immigration was supposed to have already tracked.  
The patients were transported to Kalibo town on Friday evening, January 24, for medical observation.  
They are staying in hotel rooms at the government-run Governor Corazon L. Cabagnot Tourism and Training Center in Old Buswang, Kalibo Old Buswang, Kalibo for the next 14 days. 
Cuachon emphasized there is still no confirmed cases of 2019-nCov in the province of Aklan and in the Philippines.   
""They had no flu-like symptoms, no cough or fever. They are made to stay at the training center because they might be at risk of hospital acquired-pneumonia if we admitted them. The 4 Chinese tourists had close contacts with one confirmed coronavirus patient in Hong Kong. The 7 other Chinese who are with these 4 in Boracay are also under medical observation,"" Cuachon said in a mix of English and Filipino. 
“We are monitoring them every day. After the 14-day incubation period, they will be allowed to go back to China, with the help of the Chinese embassy, and will have to cut short their vacation in Boracay,” Cuachon added. 
3 earlier patients discharged 
Meanwhile, the 3 patients were discharged from isolation rooms at the Dr. Rafael S. Tumbokon Memorial Hospital (DRSTMH) in Kalibo were discharged by attending doctors on January 28. 
A 6-year-old boy initially admitted in the Dr. Ciriaco H. Tirol Hospital in Boracay Island was referred to the Aklan provincial hospital on January 23 for exhibiting flu-like symptoms. 
Cuachon said the child, who had a history of travel to Wuhan in Hubei province, yielded negative results on coronavirus infection, based on tests conducted by the Philippines Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM). 
“He had influenza, not novel coronavirus,” Cuachon said. 
Sample specimens were also taken from two female siblings, aged 8 and 6, from Shanghai, China, who had been admitted to the Aklan provincial hospital on January 26. These were sent to RITM for confirmatory tests. 
In efforts to keep coronavirus from spreading, PHO-Aklan is coordinating with the Department of Health and the Bureau of Quarantine in monitoring the arrival of passengers in ports and airports in the province.
Cuachon urged the public to avoid contact with farm and wild animals, going to crowded places, and contact with sick individuals.  
On Saturday, January 25, Aklan health authorities sent back to Wuhan 80 Boracay-bound tourists. They were part of the group which left the epicenter city a few hours before it was locked down by Chinese authorities. 
Since December 2019, the Wuhan coronavirus has been reported in China, France, Australia, Vietnam, South Korea, Singapore, Nepal, Germany, Japan, Macau, Thailand, Taiwan, Malaysia, Canada, Hong Kong, United States, and Sri Lanka.
The World Health Organization said the common symptoms of novel coronavirus include cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties, and fever. – Rappler.com

MANILA, Philippines – The Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) will ""support"" the Philippine National Police in enforcing the lockdown of Metro Manila that will begin at midnight on Sunday, March 15.
An effort to prevent the novel coronavirus from spreading further, the so-called ""community quarantine"" of the capital region may last until April 14, although the government said it may be lifted earlier if the need for it dissipates.
On Saturday afternoon, hours before the start of the lockdown, the AFP shared these videos of its Joint Task Force-National Capital Region (JTF-NCR) rehearsing their procedures in inspecting motorists at checkpoints. One of the videos shows how they would respond to a person who might resist being barred from either entering or leaving the metropolis. (READ: LIST: Who can cross into, exit Metro Manila during coronavirus lockdown)
""This is how it will look like when the community quarantine is implemented for the passenger bus and private vehicles when they enter the borders going to Manila. So we recommend that it is better if they will follow the sitting capacity of the bus on their every journey to avoid stalling at checkpoints,"" said AFP JTF-NCR spokesperson 1st Lieutenant Arrianne Bichara.

In this third video, soldiers demonstrate how they would prevent a person from trying to dodge a checkpoint.

The military task force ""will strictly impose protocols."" Civilians who have a fever or show other possible symptoms of the virus, or those who have no urgent business in Metro Manila will be prohibited by troops from proceeding.

,"March 14, 2020",nCov,[OPINION] Notes from a supermarket on the last day of freedom,Marguerite de Leon,"
 
I write this just minutes after returning from the supermarket. We had headed there to buy ingredients for dinner – just one dinner, tonight’s dinner, just enough sinigang for two – but knew full well the bedlam we were about to face.  
Since last week, and more so now that the coronavirus-borne lockdown is hours away, supermarkets and pharmacies across Metro Manila have been choked with panic-buyers, hoarding canned goods and packed snacks, whole liters of disinfectant and alcohol, and, inexplicably, rolls and rolls and rolls of toilet paper.  
The end times, it seems, asks for maximum absorbency.  
But it’s important to note that we had headed to Rustan’s Supermarket at Shangri-La Plaza mall, a high-end grocery catering to gated village residents and expats (we are neither, but it was the nearest spot to us at the time, and we are admittedly middle-class enough to get by). 
A study in contrasts 
It’s already unnerving to be in any kind of supermarket at the peak of a panic pandemic, but there’s something particularly sinister in the air when you know a lot of the people in these aisles will head back in cars to comfortable homes, to pantries that were full to begin with, to lives where money trouble means a failed business investment and not an empty wallet and a chorus of grumbling stomachs. 
There was a part of me that wanted to stand in front of the checkout aisles and shout at all the folks nursing their loaded carts: “STOP IT! STOP BEING SO SELFISH! Andaming nagugutom sa mundo! I don’t care if you’re just looking out for your family! You should look out for EVERYONE! What the hell are you going to do with all that tuna? How much toilet paper does your ass need? Why can’t we all just calm the fuck down and stop pretending the outdoors is a nuclear hellscape? (READ: [OPINION] Let’s not forget the poor during the coronavirus pandemic)
But there was a part of me – a huge part of me – that also wanted to grab as much food as I could carry before the next wave of Valle Verde titas could get to them.
And it wasn’t exactly because I felt pressured by the chaos, but because I knew what these hoarders were fearing the most. 
The blind leading the blind 
It wasn’t the virus. That was the least of people’s worries. There was something far worse, and that was the crippling uncertainty stretched out before them for who knows how long – an uncertainty over an uncertainty – because we have government officials who would rather baby an old man who literally cannot express a series of coherent thoughts, and were not fit for their positions to begin with, as they were chosen by said old man for their loyalty and not their competence. (READ: IN PHOTOS: Mass exodus before Metro Manila 'lockdown')
And now the rhythm of our lives is at their mercy. And we don’t know what that will mean for us. We don’t know what will come of all this. So we default to thinking only of ourselves, and avert our thoughts and consciences from the poverty and injustice that surrounds us, because it is the only thing we can do in a country that, frankly, has never truly protected any of us from harm. 
And that makes us horrible people. And we are aware of that, and accept that, unconsciously or not.  
So while I was standing there amid empty shelves, staring at the last two cartons of eggs just waiting to be snatched in rabid triumph, I was trying not to cry. 
Because this uncertainty, this chaos, and this selfishness, I realize, is nothing new to any of us. It has always been here, has spread far and burrowed deep, has been a grave illness whose cure we have yet to discover. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – Labor groups have slammed what they called inadequate government measures to cushion the impact of the novel coronavirus outbreak on workers' livelihood and income.
In a statement on Saturday, March 14, the Bukluran ng Manggagawang Pilipino (BMP) said the recommendation of the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) to reduce work hours and work days through the enforcement of a rotational workforce would hurt no-work-no-pay workers the most.
They also chided Trade Secretary Ramon Lopez for suggesting that workers who live outside the region should just rent a place in Metro Manila.
BMP called such measures ""inconsiderate, grossly anti-poor, and arithmetically improbable.""
""To take away our measly incomes for an entire month or ask us to make good with so little is already lethal if not fatal to our well-being,” said BMP vice president Dominic Dilao.
DOLE had recommended the flexible work arrangement in preparation for the Metro Manila lockdown which begins on Sunday, March 15. 
Malacañang had clarified that those who have work in Metro Manila are exempted from the travel restriction, but they would have to present a valid work IDs or to proof of employment. 
DOLE said in a new guideline on Saturday that manufacturing, retail and service establishments are ""advised"" to stay open during the lockdown, but they must observe social distancing and other safety and health measures.
The BMP said this could potentially expose workers to the new coronavirus, as many factories have poor sanitation, and with no running water.
The BMP demanded employers to provide free testing kits to their workers. The Department of Health (DOH) said that the COVID-19 test kit developed by scientists from the University of the Philippines (UP), which gives faster results and are cheaper, may be rolled out on Monday, March 16.
“We have toiled so much and are solely responsible for the profits and success of companies, it's about time we are paid back as part of our fair share of the pie during these trying times,” said Dilao.
No word from management
Labor group Trade Union Congress of the Philippines (TUCP) said workers, both unionized and non-unionized, have come to them complaining that their company managements have yet to issue coronavirus protocols.
""Rank-and-file employees wonder why their employers delay or ignore discussions about workplace policy toward a likely lockdown,"" said TUCP president Raymond Mendoza. 
In the DOLE guideline, those who will file for leaves of absence over COVID-19 would lose actual leave credits.
Mendoza said DOLE must hold a dialogue with workers to come up with beneficial policies.
""The DOLE must step in and not allow dissension swell among the ranks. They must push the employees and employers formulate viable and acceptable mechanics unique to their industry and line of business in keeping productivity competitive without diminution of wages and benefits on the part of workers,"" Mendoza said.
Unemployment benefit
Meanwhile, Surigao sel Sur 2nd District Representative Johnny Pimentel said those who have been retrenched because of the economic impact of the coronavirus may avail of the unemployment insurance benefit by the Social Security System (SSS).
SSS can provide a one-off unemployment insurance benefit that's equivalent to his or her average monthly salary. (FAST FACTS: What is the SSS unemployment benefit?)
“The financial aid may not be much, but it will help. And the benefit is a handout. It is not a loan. The laid off worker does not have to pay it back,” Pimentel said.
Pimentel said this covers even overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) – particularly those working at cruise ships – whose contracts were cut short because of the coronavirus pandemic. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – The UST Junior Growling Tigresses and the Adamson Lady Baby Falcons have been declared co-champions in the inaugural UAAP Season 82 girls basketball tournament on Saturday, March 14. 
This comes after the release of a league memorandum terminating all ongoing or pending high school tournaments following the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdown of Metro Manila.
Led by MVP Cris Padilla and Mythical Team members Kat Agojo and Abegail Amdad, Adamson forced a winner-take-all finals contest after taking down UST, 79-74, in Game 2 last Monday, March 9. 
That same day, the Nazareth-NU Bullpups escaped the incoming league suspension by downing the FEU-Diliman Baby Tamaraws for the boys' title and a rare 16-0 season sweep.

MANILA, Philippines (3rd UPDATE) – The Department of Health (DOH) at 9 pm, Saturday, March 14, announced 13 additional confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus in the country, bringing the total number of cases to 111.
Like in its earlier reports, the DOH said: ""The details of these new cases are currently being validated by our teams and will be provided to the public as soon as the information is available and verified by the Department. In addition, we are also verifying reports of additional cases."" 
The DOH also said that the Rizal Medical Center in Pasig City reported that some of its personnel were exposed to the coronavirus.
""DOH is still verifying data on the exact figures and the updated conditions of the health workers,"" it said.
Health Assistant Secretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said during the press conference on Saturday that they are enforcing strict infection prevention and control procedures in hospitals, including the Philippine Heart Center.
Vergeire said that these hospitals would continue operating.
""'Yung operations ng ating ospital, hindi dapat matigil (Hospital operations must continue),"" she said. 
Death rate 
Eight people have died in the Philippines, so far.
Vergeire said those who died were patients who were considered as most vulnerable because of their age and preexisting illnesses.
""Sila po 'yung mga matatanda, elderly, at 'yun pong mga may underlying condition, maliban sa COVID-19 gaya ng diabetes, sakit sa puso, high blood, cancer, 'yung mga umiinom ng gamot na nakakababa ng resistensya,"" said Vergeire. 
(These are the elderly and those with underlying conditions like diabetes, heart ailment, high blood pressure, cancer and those who take medicines that weaken one's immunity.)  
Vergeire also reacted to Senate Majority Leader Juan Miguel Zubiri's call for the DOH to ""try drugs already in use"" by countries like South Korea, which the senator linked to lesser death rates.
""We now have one of the highest death rates of COVID-19 cases in the region at almost 10%.... Try the drugs already in use by Thailand, Korea, and India where it seems to be working and they have lessened their death rates,"" said Zubiri.
Vergeire said these drugs must undergo stringent regulatory examinations, since their purpose was not originally to treat the novel coronavirus. There is no known cure for the new virus yet.
""Kailangan nating malaman na ito'y magiging safe and effective kapag ginamit natin ito sa ating mga kababayan duon sa paraan other than the original intention of the medicine (We must know if it will be safe and effective if our countrymen use it for a purpose other than intended),"" said Vergeire.
As for the University of the Philippines (UP)-developed test kits, Vergeire said they are constantly following up with the reference laboratories to begin the rollout.
""So ngayon ang last process ay vinavalidate na po ito ng ating reference laboratory sa Pilipinas, pag nakatapos na po tayo niyan, maaari na po nating gamitin (We are now at the last process which is the validation of the reference laboratory in the Philippines, and once that's done we can begin using it),"" said Vergeire.
Self-quarantine
The DOH said that people who will be travelling from Metro Manila, even those without symptoms, should undergo strict home quarantine for 14 days.
""Travelers from NCR who are out of the region will be considered as Persons Under Monitoring (PUMs),"" said the DOH.
Those travelling from Metro Manila with symptoms such as fever and respiratory symptems are considers Persons Under Investigation (PUIs), and they are advised to seek medical attention from a health facility.

AKLAN, Philippines – The overseas Filipino worker listed as the first person under investigation (PUI) in Aklan on possible coronavirus infection was placed in home isolation and closely monitored by a barangay health response team here, the Provincial Health Office (PHO-Aklan) said.
The seafarer voluntarily approached a doctor in Kalibo, Aklan for check-up on March 12 because he was experiencing mild symptoms of possible coronavirus infection.
Provincial Health Officer I Dr. Cornelio Cuachon, Jr said the PUI, had a travel history to a country with confirmed cases of COVID-19, the sickness caused by the novel coronavirus.
The patient was advised to go on home quarantine under close monitoring by the Municipal Health Office.
Specimen samples from the person were extracted and forwarded to Department of Health (DOH) regional office in Iloilo City, which will endorse this to the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) in Muntinlupa City for testing. 
The quarantined person will be checked regularly for 14 days before the task force will issue a medical certificate based on the protocols set by the Department of Health.
Cuachon clarified only the RITM had the facilities to test samples from persons under investigation.
PUIs are patients with symptoms of cough, shortness of breath, fever, cold and difficulty of breathing within 14 days from exposure, closed contact or exposure to a confirmed case and with travel history to countries with local transmission in the last 14 days.
Cuachon added they also established COVID fast lanes in the parking area of Aklan provincial hospital compound in Kalibo, Aklan for patients with flu-like symptoms. Isolation rooms were also set up for PUIs at Dr. Rafael S. Tumbokon Memorial Hospital to protect the public’s health.
He also reminded the public to be always vigilant and observe proper hygiene, particularly the correct coughing etiquette and washing of hands to prevent infection.
Aside from the new PUI, at least 50 persons are also being monitored (PUMs) continuously by Barangay Health Response Emergency Teams (BHRET) and the provincial COVID task force.

BACK ON PRIMETIME. 'On The Wings of Love' is among the programs that are coming back on air as production for new shows are postponed. Screenshot from ABS-CBN 
MANILA, Philippines – ABS-CBN on Saturday, March 14, announced a new lineup for its primetime block after deciding to stop the taping of all its teleseryes. The announcements were made in compliance with government guidelines for a Metro Manila lockdown to manage the coronavirus outbreak.  
""Starting 16 March 2020, we are bringing back our classic teleseryes and airing iWant original series in lieu of our current primetime shows,"" the media giant said in a statement.
Here's the list of programs that will temporarily replace the shows in the primetime lineup:  

Pamilya Ko will be replaced by the heartwarming series 100 Days to Heaven starring Coney Reyes, Jodi Sta. Maria, and Xyriel Manabat.
FPJ’s Ang Probinsyano will be replaced by the phenomenal inspirational series May Bukas Pa starring Zaijian Jaranilla.
Make It With You will be replaced by the hit romantic series On The Wings of Love featuring Nadine Lustre and James Reid.
A Soldier’s Heart will be replaced by the mystery thriller I Am U, an iWant original series topbilled by Julia Barretto, from March 16 to 20.

""We assure our viewers that the changes are only temporary. We will resume our regular programming when conditions improve and the safety and welfare of our people will not be compromised,"" ABS-CBN added. 
Primetime TV series in the Philippines, typically called ""teleseryes,"" are usually filmed as the series progresses. Sometimes, that means the taping for an episode is done just a day – and sometimes hours – before an episode airs on television.   
Metro Manila will be on lockdown beginning March 15, as part of government's response to the global pandemic. The lockdown includes the restriction of movement, including the restriction of inbound and outbound domestic travel to Metro Manila, with some exemptions. Government has also discouraged or banned huge gatherings. Local government units in the megacity are expected to impose curfews in their respective areas. 
ABS-CBN and its rival, GMA 7, had earlier announced a temporary stop to the admission of live studio audiences for several of its shows. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – The Philippines on Saturday, March 14, modified a blanket travel ban earlier imposed on countries with confirmed localized transmissions of the novel coronavirus, restricting it to travelers coming from Iran and Italy.
This backtracks from President Rodrigo Duterte’s earlier announcement that the Philippines would be banning travelers coming from all countries with confirmed localized transmissions of the novel coronavirus.
Duterte's statement caused confusion among countries and prompted some Philippine embassies to issue advisories on the sweeping restriction.  
In a memorandum signed by Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea on Friday night, March 13, and shared with media on Saturday, the new travel restrictions cover only Iran and Italy.
This will be in addition to the existing travel ban for Filipino tourists and non-Filipinos coming from mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, as well as North Gyeongsang Province, including Daegu City and Cheongdo County, in South Korea. 
Medical certificates
Unlike earlier travel bans imposed by the Philippines, the new restrictions do not prohibit the entry of travelers coming from Iran or Italy.
Instead, travelers coming from these countries will be required to present medical certificates which certify they have tested negative for COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.  
Medical certificates will need to be issued by “competent medical authorities” within 48 hours before their departure. 
Exempted from the restrictions are Filipino citizens, permanent resident visa holders, and holders of diplomat visas issued by the Philippines. Foreign spouses and children of Filipino citizens will also be allowed to enter.  
Why Iran and Italy only? Iran and Italy are among the countries hit hardest by the coronavirus disease outside China. 
The two countries account for the second and third largest number of cases in the world.  
As of Saturday in Italy, over 17,000 people have been infected with the disease while the death toll surpassed 1,200 people. Meanwhile, Iran recorded over 11,000 confirmed coronavirus cases and over 500 deaths.  
Thermal screening: Department of Foreign Affairs Assistant Secretary Eduardo Meñez clarified to reporters on Saturday that ""all travelers, regardless of origin will be questioned if thermal screening process is triggered.""
He advised all foreigners coming into the Philippines through Metro Manila to land in airports outside the capital region if their final destination is outside the region.
Duterte earlier declared domestic land, air, and sea travel will be prohibited as Metro Manila is place on lockdown or “community quarantine” from Sunday, March 15 to April 14. 
As of Saturday, the Philippines has recorded 64 confirmed coronavirus cases. The confirmed cases included 6 deaths. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – To prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus in the Philippines, President Rodrigo Duterte ordered the temporary lockdown of Metro Manila which will last from Sunday, March 15, until April 14.  
Referred to as a ""community quarantine"" by government and health officials, the move limits the movement of people going in and out of the mega-city and puts in place stringent protocols on social distancing.  
A curfew in the capital from 8 pm to 5 am will begin on Sunday. Metro Manila mayors are also asking malls to close starting Sunday.
Domestic land, air, and sea travel to and from Metro Manila will be prohibited as a general rule.  
A memorandum signed by Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea, by order of Duterte, on Friday, March 13, and shared with media on Saturday, clarifies the conditions of the lockdown and lists exceptions to the general rule.
Who can and can’t cross into Metro Manila?
THOSE WHO CANNOT ENTER METRO MANILA:  

Persons with ""high risk"" of infection

They include those 60-years-old and above, individuals immunocompromized or with co-morbidities, and pregnant women. 
Experts earlier warned these individuals are more vulnerable to the coronavirus if they do not take extra caution to avoid those infected or sitauations that may put them at risk. 
THOSE WHO CAN TRAVEL TO AND FROM METRO MANILA: 

Workers

Under a general community quarantine – where the movement of people is limited to work and accessing basic necessities – Malacañang said all workers, whether employed or self-employed, will be ""provisionally allowed to travel to and from"" the capital region. 
Individuals will need to present proof of employment and/or business at border checkpoints. 
This will provision may be subject to review and changed by the Inter-Agency Task Force formed to combat the coronavirus if needed.  

Passengers with international travel

All departing passengers will be allowed to transit through Metro Manila, though they must present proof that they have confirmed international travel within 12 hours of entering the capital region.  
This does not apply to areas where current travel restrictions are in place such as mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, where Filipino tourists are barred from traveling to. Filipinos are also restricted from traveling to North Gyeongsang Province, including Daegu City and Cheongdo County in South Korea. 

Cargo

Malacañang said cargo to and from Metro Manila will go unhampered. 
Malacañang listed specific individuals exempted from the domestic travel ban. These people will be allowed to enter and exit Metro Manila:  

Health workers
Authorized government officials 
Persons traveling for medical or humanitarian reasons
Persons transiting to airports for travel abroad 
Persons providing basic services and public utilities 
Essential skeletal workforce (in government offices) 

OTHER MEASURES TAKEN UPON EXIT: All persons granted entry and exiting Metro Manila will be checked for signs and symptoms of the coronavirus at exit checkpoints, Malacañang said.  
They will be issued “appropriate certification” by health authorities, which will endorse to local government units outside Metro Manila that they are safe to exit. 
Those who exit the capital region will need to undergo a 14-day home quarantine, which will be monitored by their respective local government units.
As of Saturday, the Philippines has recorded 64 confirmed coronavirus cases. The confirmed cases included 6 deaths. – Rappler.com "

CORONAVIRUS CONCERNS. Few shoppers are seen at the Greenhills Shopping Center on March 9, 2020. Photo by Inoue Jaena/Rappler 
MANILA, Philippines (4th UPDATE) – All Metro Manila malls and other establishments have been asked to stop operations on the eve of the  30-day lockdown of the national capital region that begins on Sunday, March 15, to stem the spread of the novel coronavirus.
San Juan Mayor Francis Zamora said Metro Manila mayors made the collective call as he read a resolution approved by the Metro Manila Council (MMC) on Saturday, March 14.
The MMC “strongly recommend to all Local Legislative Councils of the NCR to issue ordinary ordinances for the temporary close of malls and establishments of the same kind, except those offering essential services (i.e groceries, supermarkets, pharmacies, restaurants with home deliveries, and establishments offering medical services) from 14 March 2020 until 13 April 2020, subject to day-to-day evaluation and other exemptions that their city or municipality may enact.""
The MMC has among its members all Metro Manila mayors and lawmakers and some Cabinet members.
Ahead of the issuances of the local ordinances, Ayala Malls announced that it would close all its malls in Metro Manila at 7 pm on Saturday, and would adjust mall hours starting Monday, March 16, at Greenbelt 1 (10 am to 8 pm) and Greenbelt 2, 3, 4, and 5 (11 am to 8 pm) until further notice.
SM Supermalls announced adjusted mall hours – from 11 am to 7 pm beginning Sunday, March 15. 
Meanwhile, the Department of Tourism (DOT) urged local governments to “to clarify the guidelines of the curfew so that public and tourism stakeholders are guided accordingly and that the best interests of everyone concerned are considered.” 
""We urge the LGUs to possibly consider that establishments, such as, but not limited to restaurants, hotels, groceries, convenience stores and drugstores, which operate longer than the recommended curfew period, be allowed to operate on a limited scale, as this is to the public's interest,"" the DOT said in a statement on Saturday.
""These establishments must be given sufficient lead time to prepare their personnel as well,"" it added. – Rappler.com "

DRY RUN. Manila police hold a dry run of the metro-wide lockdown on March 13, 2020 
MANILA, Philippines (3rd UPDATE) – Metro Manila would be placed under curfew from 8 pm to 5 am, after Local Legislative Councils in the capital region pass the needed curfew ordinances to enforce it, the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) said.
DILG Undersecretary Jonathan Malaya said on Saturday, March 14, that the ordinances were expected to be passed on Monday, March 16.
Malaya made the clarification in response to reporters' questions on Saturday, March 14, after Metropolitan Manila Development Authority General Manager Jojo Garcia said in a news briefing that the curfew would coincide with the region-wide lockdown and begin on Sunday, March 15.
""The legal basis for the curfew are the ordinances, and the mayors agreed to issue these on Monday,"" Malaya said.
Garcia said that the Metro Manila Council (MMC), which has among its members the 17 Metro Manila mayors, approved the curfew proposal to be imposed beginning Sunday. He said the curfew imposition is meant to keep people at home instead of just hanging out in public places, which would defeat the purpose of the lockdown. (READ: What we know so far: The Metro Manila coronavirus lockdown)
During the news briefing with the MMDA, San Juan Mayor Francis Zamora read the resolution passed by the MMC, but the resolution did not cite any dates for the start and end of the curfew imposition, apparently since this would depend on when the ordinances are passed.
“Mayors of NCR, acting in unity with the National Government, in order to preserve and protect the lives and health of their constituents, do hereby declare and promulgate, acting as one body in the Metro Manila Council, STRONGLY RECOMMEND to all Local Legislative Councils of the NCR to issue ordinances for CURFEW from 8:00 pm to 5:00 am subject to their necessary guidelines as they deem necessary,” read the resolution.
Exemptions
During the same Saturday briefing, Interior Secretary Eduardo Año said the curfew ordinances will ban ""non-essential movements, and that exemptions include workers and ""essential"" movements of supplies and medical teams.
Año said people would be exempted from the curfew if they had to work, if they are seeking medical help, and if they are buying food, supplies, and other essentials.
He urged religious groups who hold ceremonies during the proposed curfew hours to adjust their schedules.
He added that imposing curfew was a necessary measure to prevent the rise of coronavirus cases.
Responding to questions, Año said anyone found during curfew hours would be asked to go home, and if they refuse, they would be arrested. 
""Ganoon lang kasimple (It's that simple),"" Año said. 
During the briefing, the MMC also passed a resolution urging LLCs to pass ordinances ordering the temporary closure of malls to help stem the spread of the disease. 
As of March 13, the Philippines reported a total of 98 confirmed cases. On March 14, the Department of Health said that there are already 8 dead from the confirmed cases.

MANILA, Philippines (4th UPDATE) – The Department of Health (DOH) on Saturday, March 14, confirmed that two more COVID-19 patients died in the country.
The latest DOH confirmation raises to 3 fatalities Saturday, and 8 in the country to date.
The DOH said it would provide more details about the latest deaths as soon as they receive the information. 
Earlier Saturday, a Filipino patient in Mindanao succumbed to the disease.  (READ: Coronavirus patient in Mindanao was a resident of Pasig City)
""PH40 expired late evening of March 13 from Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome due to Severe Pneumoria with concomitant Acute Kidney Injury,"" the DOH said in a press statement on Saturday morning.
""Patient was admitted at the Northern Mindanao Medical Center last March 3 after onset of symptoms last February 24,"" it added.
PH40 was the first COVID-19 patient of Mindanao. He was a Pasig resident who had no history of travel abroad. 
DOH Northern Mindanao (Region 10) Director Adriano Suba-an had earlier said that the patient was a 54-year-old male, a resident of Pasig City since 2017 who went to Cagayan de Oro to return to his home in Lanao del Sur.
He was confined in a hospital in Iligan City prior to the NMMC in Cagayan de Oro. 
The Philippines has 64 COVID-19 cases as of Thursday. 
Burial
Suba-an said on Saturday that Mindanao's first coronavirus victim would be buried according to his religious beliefs.
He said the  DOH regional office coordinated with the family of the patient ""for an immediate burial"" on Saturday.
Suba-an said that for bodies infected with virus, the DOH recommends cremation but in the case of PH40, health officials met with members of his family on a proper burial that still followed their religious and cultural beliefs without risking anyone's health.
He noted that PH40's remains were sealed in a body bag right away to avoid the spread of infection.
""The decision of the family is for the burial, there are practices in their direct burial practices that is   contrary to our guidelines that cannot be done like the washing of the body, family members attending, that we coordinated and negotiated that that cannot be done,"" Suba-an said.
""I think that they have a belief such as Darurah like what is not allowed can be done if the situation warrants  it,"" he added.
Darura is an Islamic concept for ""necessity"" that can justify even violating explicit prohibition.
Suba-an said that they were coordinating with the city government on the burial of PH40 on Saturday or if the family would decide to bring his remains to his hometown in Marawi City. She said that either way, PH40 would be buried in close coordination with the DOH.
Dr Jose Chan, director of the Northern Mindanao Medical Center (NMMC) Director where PH40 was confined, said that the wife and daughter of  the victim where in quarantine and understood that they could not attend the burial ceremony.

""The results of the tests for COVID-19 conducted on President Rodrigo Duterte and I turned out negative. We are fit and healthy to perform our duties,"" Duterte's former aide and now Senator Bong Go said in a statement on Friday, March 13.
Duterte underwent tests for the disease on Thursday, March 12, after several of his Cabinet members, including officials in his inner circle, announced they would isolate themselves after coming into contact with a confirmed COVID-19 patient. 
Before taking the test, Presidential Spokesperson Salvador Panelo gave assurances that the President was not showing symptoms of the disease and was only getting tested as a precautionary measure to ensure he was ""fit and healthy to perform"" his duties.
Experts earlier said that older adults with preexisting health conditions – particularly those over 60 – should take extra precautions against the disease as they were more vulnerable to the coronavirus.
Duterte, who is 74 years old, is considered highly at risk for the disease. Duterte had claimed on several occasions that he suffered from a slew of medical conditions that include myasthenia gravis, Buerger's disease, Barrett's esophagus, and ""spinal issues,"" among others.

DOH Secretary Francisco Duque III has already deployed surveillance teams to work with the concerned local government units to trace all the individuals with whom the new positive cases made contact.  
Duque said data they have gathered so far shows that the most vulnerable to COVID-19 are the elderly, with average age of 66, and those with preexisting medical conditions like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, chronic lung disease, and immunosuppression.
""Hinihikayat namin ang mga immunocompromised at may umiiral ng kondisyong pangkalusugan na mas maging maingat at umiwas sa matataong lugar at mga pagtitipon,"" DOH Secretary Francisco Duque said in a a statement.
(We urge everyone who is immunocompromised and who has exisiting health conditions to be more vigilant and avoid public spaces as well as mass gatherings.)
Anyone who has information that can help the contact tracing activities may call the DOH hotline at (02) 8-651-7800 local 1149-1150. 
Of the 64 COVID-19 cases recorded in the Philippines so far, 5 have died. Four of the deceased patients are Filipinos, while one is a Chinese who came from Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the outbreak that has infected more than 134,000 people and killed over 5,000 worldwide. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – It's the reciprocity rule, according to Pasig Mayor Vico Sotto. What goes around comes around.
Urging citizens to desist from hoarding rubbing alcohol, hand sanitizers, and other disinfectants, Sotto warned that the practice may actually cause the novel coronavirus to spread faster.
""Babalik din po sa atin 'yon. Kapag hindi nakapag-sanitize 'yung ibang tao, eh 'di baka lalong kumalat 'yung virus,"" he told reporters as he led the distribution of disinfectant kits to leaders of Pasig's barangays. (It will come back to us. If other people are unable to sanitize, then the virus might spread even further.)
The Pasig government gave out a total of 500 sets of disinfectant kits that include sprayer canisters, chlorine tablets, hazmat suits, face shields, goggles, boots, and nitrile gloves to its 30 barangays. The number of each items in each set was proportionate to each barangay's population.
The city's professional response team demonstrated the proper use of the equipment to the barangay representatives who were charged to routinely disinfect common areas in every neighborhood.

4-day workweek for city employees
The local government started spraying disinfectant in the city's public areas earlier this week. With classes suspended, all 45 public schools in Pasig were disinfected by the end of Friday.
Places most frequented by people, such as the city hall and the public market, are disinfected daily. The wet market will remain open, Sotto emphasized, but the dry goods bazaar on the market complex's third floor has been closed temporarily.
To decongest the city hall to give room for ""social distancing,"" it will be open for frontline services and transactions from Monday to Saturday, but its employees will only work 4 days in a week.
A numbering system limits the volume of people doing business inside the city hall at any given time.
All big events and gatherings in the city are canceled.
5 cases of infection
Pasig has had 5 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus, one of whom, an 88-year-old woman with a preexisting medical condition, died on Thursday, March 12.
Sotto called for calm and urged people not to panic.
""From the patients who were positive with COVID-19, we conducted extensive contact tracing, and our contact tracing has been very successful,"" Sotto said.

The hospital released a statement confirming the report, adding that 5 cases of persons under investigation or PUIs were also admitted in the hospital.
""The public is advised that JBLMGH is implementing enhanced surveillance mechanisms and strict temperature and symptom monitoring to all individuals prior to entry in the hospital,"" said Dr. Monserrat Chichioco, JBLMGH chief.
The hospital is designated by the Department of Health to treat possible cases in Central Luzon of COVID-19, the sickness caused by the novel coronavirus.
Chichioco said a shortened visitation hour, which 3 pm to 4 pm, was also implemented in the hospital.
The two cases here were the first recorded COVID-19 cases in Pampanga.
As of Thursday, the Philippines has recorded a total of 52 positive cases of COVID-19, including the 5 patients who died.

MANILA, Philippines – The local bourse saw one of its most volatile trading days on Friday, March 13, as the novel coronavirus continued to send jitters over the trading floor. 
The Philippine Stock Exchange index gained 1% and closed at 5,793. Climbing back to the green zone, however, was quite a roller coaster ride.
The PSEi slid over 10% during the morning session, declining to a new low of 5,097 and triggered another circuit breaker or a 15-minute trading halt.
“Panic sellers turned into bargain hunters after triggering circuit breakers early in the session that temporarily halted trading for the second time in this week,” said Luis Limlingan of Regina Capital.
Traders also attributed the recovery to the order of Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III, instructing the Government Service Insurance System and Social Security System to buy stocks and support the market.

MANILA, Philippines – Agriculture Secretary William Dar assured the nearly 14 million residents of Metro Manila that there is enough supply of food, as the capital prepares for the lockdown or so-called “community quarantine” due to the novel coronavirus starting March 15.
At the same time, Dar said on Friday, March 13, that the lockdown is also an “opportune time” for residents to consider gardening or aquaculture in their “respective backyards, verandas, roof tops, and designated areas in the barangay, school or community.”
The Department of Agriculture is still finalizing its food resiliency action plan.
Dar said the plan includes strategic positioning and efficient distribution of basic food commodities, including the monitoring of suggested retail prices in public markets in Metro Manila.
Agriculture Undersecretary Ariel Cayanan reiterated that movement of agricultural goods will not be affected.
Cayanan said that the agency is considering implementing ""fast lanes"" for vehicles carrying agricultural products.
Panic buying
""We call on the general public to buy only their daily or weekly food requirements and refrain from overstocking or panic buying,"" Dar appealed on Friday, March 13. (READ: Hoarding, overpricing would lead to criminal charges, warns DTI)
Current rice inventory at various National Food Authority warehouses nationwide is good for at least 80 days and will be further augmented by the incoming palay harvest this current dry season, providing additional stocks for another 2 to 3 months.
About 929,358 metric tons (MT) of rice will be made available for Metro Manila for the next 9 months. 
The Department of Agriculture estimated demand in Metro Manila to be over 26,000 MT. Over 55,000 MT would come from Cagayan Valley and Central Luzon.
Dar also assured Metro Manila residents that other basic food items like pork, chicken, eggs, other poultry products, fish, vegetables, fruits, sugar, cooking oil, and other coconut by-products are sufficient.
The agency also reminded retailers of suggested retail prices of the following commodities:
Pork- P190/kilo 
Chicken- P130/kilo
Tilapia- P120/kilo
Galunggong- P130/kilo
Sugar (brown)- P45/kilo

MANILA, Philippines – PLDT said on Friday, March 13, that it expects a greater need for bandwidth as companies and schools switch to work- or study-from-home arrangements amid the novel coronavirus threat. 
PLDT spokesperson and head of public affairs Ramon Isberto assured their customers that they have more than sufficient capacity for the additional load the company expects, and said they would be providing a speed boost for fiber customers in Metro Manila, Rizal, Bulacan, Laguna, and Cavite so that the minimum speed will be 25Mbps.
The company expected the technical preparations to be finished next week. By then, users would be able to expect the speed boost. ""That should be enough to serve the needs of several simultaneous users in the household,"" Isberto said. 
In the US and in Italy, telcos AT&T and Vodafone have announced that they will lift their data caps until April 2020. PLDT will not need to as their plans have no data caps. 
For their prepaid fixed wireless service, PLDT said it would extend its current promo to April that would double the data load of their P199 prepaid data pack from 12GB to 24GB.
PLDT's wireless subsidiary Smart will provide free mobile access to key government websites such as the Department of Health's NCOV tracker, the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRMMC), and Philippine Information Agency.

According to Belmonte, barangays have the task of setting up isolation rooms, disinfecting their areas, monitoring persons under investigation (PUIs) and persons under monitoring (PUMs), and training response teams in their respective communities. 
""It is very important that they are empowered, that I give them all the necessary support that they need to be able to carry out this very sensitive, but important task,"" Belmonte said.

MANILA, Philippines – The Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) urged all Filipinos with non-essential trips to refrain from traveling to Israel, following the Middle Eastern country’s travel restrictions imposed in light of the novel coronavirus outbreak.  
The DFA on Friday, March 13, issued the advisory in light of additional travel requirements imposed by Israel. 
The DFA said this included measures requiring Filipinos, who have essential trips to Israel, to obtain clearance from the Israeli Ministry of Interior. This can be done through the consular section of the Embassy of Israel in Manila, prior to their departure.
The consular section of the Israeli embassy can be contacted through their website at +630288839500 or through their Facebook page. 
The DFA advised the public to refrain from going to the Israeli embassy itself as it is not admitting visitors to help quell the spread of the virus.  
The DFA earlier told all Filipinos to postpone upcoming trips to the Holy Land “until further notice” as the Israeli government is implementing measures to restrict all travels to Bethlehem from Israel. 
As of Friday, Israel recorded 131 confirmed coronavirus cases. There were no deaths in the country yet.

BACOLOD, Philippines – The city government of Bacolod has suspended the graduation and moving-up ceremonies for all levels of public and private schools here due to the threat of the novel coronavirus disease COVID-19.
Bacolod City Mayor Evelio Leonardia signed the executive order on Thursday, March 12, after a series of meetings and consultations with school, health, police, social services, and disaster risk reduction officials.
“It is with a heavy heart to make this decision but with the present circumstances, it is the most prudent thing to do,” the mayor said.
In the order, he said it is imperative that the city implements urgent and critical measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
He noted that President Rodrigo Duterte had earlier declared a state of national health emergency. 
“We call it suspension because it might be normalize,” he said.
Moreover, the mayor also issued another executive order implementing heightened precautions against COVID-19 for daycare centers and supervised neighborhood play in the city to safeguard health and safety of the children by shortening their classes, which is until Friday, March 13. 
Classes in all levels in public schools and private schools in this city will also be until March 20 and 27, respectively, he said.
“We will end the school year earlier so that pupils and students can observe social distancing measures to avoid contamination and spread of the virus,” he said.

MANILA, Philippines – Food and Drug Administration (FDA) officer-in-charge Eric Domingo clarified the novel coronavirus test kits developed by University of the Philippines (UP) scientists will not yet be available for the public to buy by Monday, March 16. 
By then what would happen is just the field testing for the UP-National Institute of Health’s (UP-NIH) 2019-nCov detection kits so the government can determine the validity of results, Domingo said in a phone interview with reporters on Friday, March 13.
Domingo said specimens will be used on the locally-produced detection kits for testing, after which results will be confirmed through gene sequencing at the Philippine Genome Center. 
Results of the UP-NIH test kits will also be compared with the findings of the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine, the only laboratory in the country accredited thus far by the World Health Organization (WHO) to test 2019-nCoV samples.
“‘Yung field testing nga nila kasi kailangan munang i-test sa actual test tapos i-va-validate nila ito, titingnan nila ang resulta kung comparable doon sa kanilang ginagamit mula WHO. At the same time, titingnan din natin kung very accurate saka i-ko-confirm by gene sequencing,” Domingo said.
(The results of the field test will have to be validated and compared to the results of the current test kits they are using from the WHO. At the same time, we’re also going to confirm if the results are very accurate through gene sequencing.) 
“At 'pag nakumpleto na ‘yung datos, at mapakita na talagang very valid na ang test na ito, saka siya i-ro-roll out na maaari na iyan, puwedeng gamitin sa mga pasyente at puwede na siyang gamitin sa ibang mga laboratory,” the FDA chief added. 
(Once we complete the data and determine that the tests are very valid, then that's the only time we can roll it out among patients and let other laboratories use it.) 
The FDA has so far issued only a certificate of exemption for field testing to the UP-NIH test kits. A certificate of product registration is the document needed for its commercial use, when the public can purchase the test kits on their own. 
Still, the UP-NIH scientists’ invention gives hope to Filipinos as the number of positive cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by 2019-nCoV, continues to rise at 52 with 5 fatalities. 
This new test kit is capable of detecting in just two hours the presence of 2019-nCoV in samples taken from patients under investigation. It will be reportedly priced at P1,320, or 6 times cheaper than its foreign counterpart, which costs around P8,500. 
On Friday, Domingo also told the public not to buy any home test kits being sold online, as these are still unregistered and have no FDA approval. – Rappler.com "

CAVITE, Philippines – Primary and secondary public schools in the province of Cavite will shorten the current academic year, while graduation ceremonies are “temporarily on hold for all levels.”  
Cavite Governor Jonvic Remulla made this announcement through his Facebook page on Friday afternoon, March 13, after meeting with district superintendents of the Department of Education (DepEd).  
The governor called for meetings as the number of coronavirus infection cases continued to rise in the country – among them, a man from Imus, Cavite – and President Rodrigo Duterte had ordered a lockdown of Metro Manila, which shares a border with Cavite to its south. 
The announcement was made while students had just wrapped up a week of class suspensions. Last week, amid the discovery of more cases of the coronavirus diseases in the National Capital Region, the governor followed the President’s course of action, ordering all classes in the province canceled. 
To finish their academic requirements sooner, kindergarten and Grades 1 to 12 students in Cavite public schools will have to take their final exams in batches for 3 days next week: 

Wednesday, March 18: Grades 4, 5, 6, 11, 12
Thursday, March 19: Kindergarten and Grades 1, 2, 3, 7, 8
Friday, March 20: Grades 9, 10

Social distancing, as advised by health authorities, will be observed during the exams. 
“One meter distance from each student will be observed. That is why we staggered the exam dates to one day per grade, so that the school rooms will be distributed accordingly,” Remulla said. 
Private schools, however, “will have to use their discretion regarding their school calendar adjustments,” the governor added.
DepEd officials gave assurances that they would sterilize the classrooms before the exam days, Remulla said. 
On Friday, Remulla also said classes in the undergraduate and graduate programs of universities in Cavite will suspended. This is to allow university officials to meet with the governor and determine any adjustments in the academic calendar. – Miriam Grace A. Go/Rappler.com  "

MANILA, Philippines – The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Friday, March 13, warned the public against buying home test kits for the novel coronavirus being sold online, as none of these products had been registered and tested by the regulatory agency.
Health Undersecretary Eric Domingo, FDA officer-in-charge, issued the warning in a news briefing on Friday after the FDA received reports that unregistered home test kits supposedly to check for infection with COVID-16, were being sold online.

“Gusto lang naming ipaalam sa publiko na sa ngayon, wala pang registered na testing kit para dito sa COVID-19. So kung anumang binebenta diyan, nakikita nilang mga advertisement, o makikita nila online, ito pong mga produktong ito unregistered,” Domingo said in a phone interview with reporters.
(We just want to let the public to know that for now, there are no registered testing kits here for COVID-19. So if you see anything being sold out there, any advertisements, or any posts online, these products are unregistered.)
The FDA chief said that since the unregistered test kits are untested, the accuracy of their results are questionable.
“Ang babala lang natin, kahit po gamitin ‘nyo ito, hindi naman natin alam kung valid at acceptable ang mga resulta na ito at kung sino naman pong doktor ang maniniwala sa resulta ng mga ito at gagamitin siya to manage a patient. So baka masayang lang ang pera ninyo,” Domingo said. 
(We are just warning that even if you use this, we don't know if the results are valid and acceptable and if any doctor would even believe in the results to manage a patient. So you would just waste your money.)
Currently, there are only two types of test kits in the Philippines that have been approved by the FDA – the sophisticated machine at the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) that takes 24 to 48 hours to confirm a 2019-nCoV case and the new and much faster test kits developed by the University of the Philippines-National Institute for Health (UP-NIH). 
The FDA had issued a certificate of exemption for the UP-NIH test kits, which means that starting March 16, the test kits can be used for field testing coupled with gene sequencing at the Philippine Genome Center. 
The results of this field testing will determine if the UP-NIH test kits will get a certificate of product registration from the FDA – the document needed to allow the mass use of these kits. (READ: #SalamatUP: Netizens laud U.P. scientists for developing coronavirus test kits)

(Once we complete the data and determine that this test is very valid, then that's the only time we can roll it out among patients and let other laboratories use it.)

MANILA, Philippines – The Philippine National Police (PNP) will arrest people who will violate the planned lockdown of Metro Manila, National Capital Region Police Office (NCRPO) Director Major General Debold Sinas said on Friday, March 13.
In defending arrests, Sinas said police cannot let trespassers go without punishment if they violate the government's effort to contain the virus. So far, the government has floated exempting only workers, people seeking medical help, and the media from travel restrictions.
The NCRPO is studying filing a case based on violation of the Revised Penal Code aside from violation of the quarantine law.
There is no lockdown yet. This comes after President Rodrigo Duterte announced that Metro Manila will be locked down beginning Sunday, March 15. In making the announcement, Duterte said the lockdown will be enforced by the police and the military.
It is unclear how this will be enforced since as of Friday afternoon, Duterte has not released an executive order or a memorandum circular as basis for the lockdown. This also means that without clearer guidelines and an executive order, these arrests remain unenforceable.
Government officials concede that some questions from citizens who work outside Metro Manila but live in the metropolis, or even live outside but work inside have to be addressed, along with questions about what constitutes mass gatherings.
Sinas said police will be closing down small roads while establishing checkpoints along major roads and highways. He also said the composition of personnel in these checkpoints have yet to be decided by the Inter-Agency Task Force on the coronavirus outbreak.
As of Friday, March 13, the country has recorded 52 confirmed coronavirus cases. The confirmed cases include 5 deaths. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – The military will not be involved in defining the looming lockdown of Metro Manila over the novel coronavirus, and will only help the police in enforcing it, the country’s national defense chief said on Friday, March 13.
This, as members of the Cabinet rush to draft guidelines to define the parameters of the “community quarantine” President Rodrigo Duterte ordered over the capital region on Thursday night, March 12.
Duterte had said he would rely on the police and military to enforce the “lockdown,” and urged the public to “just obey them.”
On Friday, Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana clarified that “the military will not be involved in the determination of the guidelines to enforce the restricted movement. It is the PNP (Philippine National Police). The military will just be in the support role as they do not have police powers.”
“The AFP (Armed Forces of the Philippines) shall assist the PNP in implementing the community quarantine in certain areas, and will help ensure the availability of units and personnel, critical logistics and supplies, as well as emergency medical teams, among others,” Lorenzana said in a statement.
Throughout the lockdown, the Department of National Defense (DND) will maintain a “skeletal civilian workforce” to operate its frontline services and other “critical office functions.”
The DND ordered its civilian bureaus – the Philippine Veterans Affairs Office, the Office of Civil Defense, the National Defense College, and the Government Arsenal – to maintain workforces to make sure frontline and essential services continue, such as the processing of veterans’ claims, and production of ammunition and other combat materiel.
In an earlier statement, the AFP said it was “ready to assist” the PNP in enforcing the lockdown.
“Our different units were earlier directed to prepare their contingency measures to make this possible without compromising our peace and security operations,” said AFP chief of staff General Felimon Santos Jr.
“This includes the availability of units and personnel, emergency medical teams, availability of critical logistics and supplies, and preparation of personal protective equipment for soldiers and other personnel who will be tapped to assist the PNP,” he added.
AFP Joint Task Force National Capital Region spokesperson 1st Lieutenant Arianne Bichara said plans were on hand and details were “being ironed out” for implementing the lockdown.
The unit is requesting additional personal protective equipment for troops waiting to be deployed, Bichara added.
The “community quarantine” is expected to be enforced for a month, from March 15 to April 15, but it may be lifted anytime if it is no longer needed, the government said.
Travel to and from Metro Manila will be restricted, including domestic and international flights. Classes are suspended, while work in public and private offices are to drawdown to require a minimal workforce. – Rappler.com "

HOW IT WORKS. Maria Carmen Ocampo, Manila Health Technology Inc. sales manager shows a sample of the UP-developed COVID-2019 rRT-PCR Detection Kit at a press briefing held at the Philippine Gerome Center at the UP Diliman in Quezon City on March 12, 2020. Photo by Darren Langit/Rappler  
MANILA, Philippines – One of the ways to slow down the spread of the pandemic COVID-19 is to detect it early and fast to enable professionals to provide proper treatment and trace how it might have spread soon enough.
Scientists at the University of the Philippines (UP) have developed a novel COVID-19 detection kit that could help slow down the spread of the disease and at the same time empower hospitals across the country to test suspected patients earlier and better.
In a press conference at the Philippine Genome Center (PGC) in UP Diliman, Quezon City, PGC deputy executive director and COVID-19 test kit lead developer Dr Raul Destura explained that after the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) greenlighted their field validation studies, his team intends to deploy the test kits soon to the respective hospitals across the country.
Among the hospitals that have agreed to be part of the field validation studies are the Philippine General Hospital in Manila, The Medical City in Pasig City, Vicente Sotto Memorial Medical Center in Cebu City, and the Southern Philippines Medical Center in Davao City.
Before a product such as the detection kit labeled as GenAmplifyTM COVID-19 rRT-PCR (rapid reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction) Detection Kit can be commercialized, it has to undergo two tests: the laboratory performance testing and the field validation study.
Destura and his team have finished the laboratory performance testing and proceeded to apply for a certification for field validation from the FDA.
However, the FDA opted to give the team a Certificate of Exemption in lieu of a product certificate of registration so they could proceed with the field validation studies. The field validation studies are an important phase in testing a medical technology such as the GenAmplifyTM kit as it helps the researchers understand the behavior of the test kit in different locations.
""Ang pagdevelop ng technology kasi may proseso iyan. Hindi p'wedeng bara-bara, hindi p'wedeng shortcut. Our intention is to protect the public by developing the technology na may mga criteria na dapat sundin,"" said Destura, adding that it will take them 2 to 3 weeks to complete the sample size they need to carry out a diagnostic clinical sensitivity testing, the final phase before they could take the product to market.
 
(There is a process in developing a technology. We can't take a shortcut. Our intention is to protect the public by developing the technology with a set of criteria that has to be followed.)
The goal of this phase is to validate the ability of the test to correctly identify those patients with the disease.
All patients who will be tested using the GenAmplifyTM kit will still be tested using the internationally-acquired COVID-19 test kits currently being used by the government. At the same time, the samples will also undergo genome sequencing at PGC to verify the results obtained using the kits.
 Genome sequencing
""The purpose of this is to protect the public. I know we need it very badly. But we have the moral responsibility to make sure that the technology we're putting out there na gawa ng Pinoy, gawa ng Pinoy para sa lahat at para sa buong mundo ang kalidad (that is made by Filipinos for everyone and for the whole world is high-quality technology),"" Destura said.
The GenAmplifyTM kit uses the same PCR technology as with other diagnostic kits for other diseases like HIV and hepatitis. Hospitals categorized as tertiary care centers in the Philippines have the capability to use PCR technology.
However, not all hospitals can acquire the GenAmplifyTM. Once commercialized, the institute requesting for the kits must adhere to certain criteria such as the biosafety level of their laboratories to ensure that they will be able to use them.
Destura also explained the procedure for using the test kit:

Two types of swabbing are done: nasopharyngeal brushing (done through the nose) and throat swabbing (done through the mouth).
The samples obtained are placed in a (viral transport media) solution and placed in a sealed container to avoid contamination.
The samples are brought to the laboratory with classification of safety of at least Biosafety Level 2. These laboratories have biological safety cabinets with controlled air to ensure the safety of the medical technologist when opening the sample.
RNA material is then extracted from the vials of samples obtained.
The RNA material is then mixed with the COVID-19 kit and amplified using the PCR machine.
The PCR machine then analyzes the virus content of the sample and prints out a result saying if the sample is negative or positive from COVID-19. The result is expected to come out within one and a half hours.

PCR testing, like the method used in the GenAmplifyTM, is one of the known ways of detecting COVID-19. Similar tests kits have been developed in South Korea, China, and the United States. Other countries employ other methods such as nucleic acid tests and antibody tests (drawing blood samples).
Destura noted that one of the main purposes of developing GenAmplifyTM and deploying them in hospitals across the country is to empower hospitals to be their own testing centers.
""Ang point kasi ng deployment is ma-create 'yung environment of testing doon sa lugar nila para may empowerment mechanism ang technology. Kasi if we will go for centralized testing, 'yung logistics talaga is crazy. So kung i-empower natin ang lahat ng ospital who [have] been doing PCR for years, basically, magiging mas malaki 'yung reach,"" said Destura.
(The point of the deployment is to create an environment of testing in their areas for empowerment mechanism and technology. Because if we will go for centralized testing, the logistics will really be crazy. If we empower all hospitals who have been doing PCR for years, basically, we will have greater reach.)
Meanwhile, Philippine General Hospital Director Dr Gerardo Legaspi said that the test kit is a huge help for health care workers as well.
""Ang COVID-19 test will greatly help us in rationalizing. Ibig sabihin, maibibigay natin ang atensiyon sa mga nangangailangan ng atensiyon, at maadvise-an natin ang mga pasyente na hindi naman kailangang nasa ospital,"" Legaspi said.
(The COVID-19 test will greatly help us in rationalizing. Meaning, we will be able pay attention to those who need attention, and we can advise patients who don't need to be hospitalized.)
""Kung available ang test, hindi na kailangang maghintay nung mga malalalang mga sakit kasi nakikita sa buong mundo na maaaring hindi kailangang lahat ng sintomas ay lumabas at 'di lahat ay kailangan lahat ng factors ay nasasabi para kailangang mag-positive or mag-negative. So, sa pagka napaigi ang pag-screen ng mga pasyente, maaaring iwasan ang pagkalat nito,"" Legaspi added.
(If the test is available, we don't need to wait for severe symptoms, because as seen worldwide, it's possible that not all symptoms will manifest, and not all factors need to be stated to be positive or negative. So, with better screening of patients, we can avoid the spread of this disease.) – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – Students in Metro Manila whose classes have been suspended for nearly a month will have the option of taking their final exams online, or having their grades from previous semesters averaged for their final mark. 
Department of Education Undersecretary Alain Pascua said these were the two options being considered for students who will be affected by class suspensions in Metro Manila that will last from Sunday, March 15 to April 12.  
During a Malacañang briefing on the government’s response to the coronavirus outbreak, Pascua said students only had two weeks left of school, one of which was supposed to be their final examination week.  
How it will work: Pascua said DepEd would first be releasing an order with a “transmutation formula” for schools to implement when grading affected students. 
The formula will include computing students’ grades from the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd quarters, as well as their remaining standing in the 4th quarter to come up with their final class standing.  
If students are not satisfied with their final average derived from the formula, they will have the option to take online exams. 
The online exams will be administered through the ""DepEd commons,"" an online platform where lessons can be accessed by students and teachers. 
""Isa ito sa mga gagawin ng DepEd dito sa Kamaynilaan on the assumption na ang Kamaynilaan ay 98-99% dito ang penetration ng cellphone at ang penetration ng Wi-Fi or internet,"" Pascua said. 
(This is one option DepEd is taking in Metro Manilla, on the assumption that Metro Manila has a 98 to 99% penetration rate for cellphones, internet, or Wi-Fi.) 
The same measures will also be available for areas where there are class suspensions outside Metro Manila.  
If classes not suspended: Pascua said social distancing measures will likewise be in place in schools were classes are not suspended. 
This will be done by having students take their exams on a “staggered” basis, which means they will only be allowed in school when they are scheduled to take their tests. 
And after that? As for graduations, Pascua said graduation rites outside Metro Manila have been scheduled for April 13 to 17, or after the suspension period to be safe. 
In Metro Manila, Pascua said DepEd was still discussing a possible period for rescheduling.  
The Philippines has so far 52 confirmed coronavirus cases. The confirmed cases include 5 deaths. – Rappler.com

MANILA, Philippines – Several commuters complained of limited entry to Metro Rail Transit Line 3  stations on Friday morning, March 13, as the MRT3 management conducted a dry run of social distancing on the train to prevent the spread of COVID-19.
In a Twitter post, MRT3 said that it was ""already implementing"" social distancing in its stations and trains, following the order of President Rodrigo Duterte on containing the novel coronavirus outbreak.
Responding to reporters, MRT3 Director for Operations Michael Capati clarified that what happened at the stations on Friday morning was merely a ""simulation.""
""This is just a simulation in preparation for social distancing while we are waiting for the official guidelines,"" Capati said in a mix of Filipino and English.
The Philippines declared a ""community quarantine"" – which in effect is similar to a lockdown – in Metro Manila from March 15 to April 14 to contain the spread of COVID-19. The government has yet to finalize the guidelines on this. 
As of Thursday, the Philippines had 52 coronavirus patients, mostly in Metro Manila. Five of the COVID-19 patients died, 3 of them just on Thursday, when Duterte approved the resolution on the lockdown and other recommendations of the Inter-Agency Task Force on COVID-19.
Commuters have posted photos of their morning commute on Twitter, showing train coaches that were not packed, contrary to their usual experience.

The following piece was written on March 11, a day before President Rodrigo Duterte announced that Metro Manila would be placed on lockdown to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus. 
This country needs a surgical knife to avert a looming epidemic of unimaginable proportions. The National Capital Region (NCR) is densely populated. It might cause a centrifugal spread of the coronavirus – from NCR to peripheral areas. Worse, the DOH has already recorded its first coronavirus cases in Dumaguete and Cagayan de Oro City. 
We need to act given rising cases, and we have not seen the peak of this disease yet. 
A proactive lockdown of NCR is needed for our weak healthcare system to stop an epidemic, given the shortage of testing kits, face masks, and healthcare staff in our hospitals. 
Furthermore, there are many vulnerable Filipinos. More than 7 million are over 60 years old. 25 million have hypertension, 6 million are diabetic, and scores are in need of dialysis.   
There’s no systematic plan of when a city should close schools, when they should tell businesses that they have to telework, when they should close movie theaters and cancel large gatherings. But we must discuss the scenario with the agencies concerned. (READ: Questions Filipinos are asking about the coronavirus lockdown)
Yes, people get afraid when they see that powerful governments – South Korea, China, Italy – lock down millions of people. These governments have more resources, and yet they seem to be overly fearful. But self-preservation is a natural reaction to a genuine crisis. (READ: Every government for itself? Virus poses difficult dilemmas)
South Korea has carried out more than 190,000 tests as part of a free nationwide screening program, and managed to record its lowest number of daily confirmed cases of the virus in weeks. (Sadly, we are not in the same caliber as the Koreans in terms of technology, funding, and discipline.)
A lockdown is going to be unpopular, I know. The drastic measures include blanket travel restrictions, a ban on all public events, the closure of schools and public spaces, and the suspension of religious services. But how do we solve with urgency given the situation that we have now?  
The health crisis can lead to an economic crisis if we do not think ahead and decide with sense of urgency. Our new plan has to be more aggressive now.  
However, these are only symptoms of the real problem.
True leaders accept personal responsibility, and do not obsess themselves over past failures or wrong results in their original plans.  
True leaders go only where their better selves are willing to tread. That’s where our leaders' own values come in. They must want to do something with their power, and not just be powerful. – Rappler.com

CEBU CITY, Philippines – Governor Arthur Yap announced on Friday, March 13, that Bohol will be under ""community quarantine"" from March 16 to 20 even if no confirmed COVID-19 cases have been recorded in the province.
Yap announced in a livestreamed press conference that he signed on Friday morning the executive order on the community quarantine which will take effect at 12:01 am on March 16.
He said the quarantine was meant to better prepare Boholanos in fighting the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.
""To help us organize into work teams, we need time to meet and to divide ourselves among the mayors, the local officials, national and local agencies,  and civic, business and religious organizations. For that to happen, I am declaring a community quarantine of the island of Bohol within 48 hours of the signing of the EO. That day will be from midnight of Monday, up to Friday,"" he said.
Yap clarified that Bohol will be on community quarantine and not on lockdown as those who wish to leave Bohol can do so for the duration of the quarantine period, but the province will not allow the entry of any visitors during that time.
“A lockdown means nobody comes in and out,” he added.
Yap said that the 5-day quarantine will be a a “dry run” to see how prepared the province is for a possible outbreak. As of Friday, Bohol had no confirmed cases but had two persons under investigation (PUIs)
Yap said he had identified two places with a total of 120 beds to accommodate those who need to g into quarantine – the old Tagbilaran airport and the annex in the Bohol Provincial Capital Building.   
The Barangay Health Response Teams and the province’s Tarsier 117 emergency response teams will also be on full-alert for reports of anyone needing to be placed under monitoring.  While the quarantine will only last for 5 days, the province may extend it as needed, Yap said.
 Yap is the latest local official to declare a quarantine in his area, following President Rodrigo Duterte's decision to put Metro Manila on 30-day lockdown beginning March 15. (READ: Metro Manila to be placed on lockdown due to coronavirus outbreak)
Mayor Kit Nieto has placed Cainta, Rizal – where 3 confirmed COVID-19 cases were recorded – under community quarantine starting March 15.
The resolution of the Inter-Agency Task Force on COVID-19 Duterte approved on Thursday allows the declaration of province-wide quarantines, but only when there are at least two positive coronavirus cases living in different municipalities, component cities, or independent component cities in the province.  
As of March 12, 52 persons were under investigation for possible COVID-19 infection in Central Visayas. The first case in the region was confirmed in Dumaguete City,  a municipal councilor who had returned from a conference in Manila.

DIPOLOG CITY – The National Historical Commission of the Philippines (NHCP) has closed to the public indefinitely the Rizal National Shrine, the biggest tourist drawer in nearby Dapitan City.
Dapitan's economy is largely driven by tourism, but local officials are implementing the preemptive measure despite the heavy financial costs as a preemptive measure to stop the spread of the novel coronavirus.
“Right now, Dapitan has no COVID-19 infection. we are implementing precautionary measures anyway,” said City Information Officer Randy Cabasag.
COVID-19, the sickness caused by the novel coronavirus, was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. 
Meanwhile, Bishop Severo Caermare of the Diocese of Dipolog  called for “calm, prayers” but be “cautious” as the entire diocese joined in the fight against the onslaught of the novel virus.
The Diocese of Dipolog has ecclesiastical jurisdiction over the province of Zamboanga del Norte.
There is no confirmed COVID-19 infection in Zamboanga del Norte, but restrictions and precautions against the disease have been strictly implemented.
 
In neighboring Dipolog, the 15 teachers, learners and a supervisor who visited South Korea last February ended their 14-day self-quarantine March 12 with no symptoms of COVID-19.
Meanwhile, Dakak Park and Beach Resort in Dapitan is hardest hit by the pandemic scare as its number of guests have declined sharply. There have been no foreign tourists arriving in over a month,
“We are now relying on local tourists. Anyway the sun is one of the best shield against COVID-19 than night life,” says Chembeelyn Alpeche-Balucan, Dakak corporate lawyer. “But we have to reduce work days per week and those in the management have salary cuts.”
As the residents brace to prevent COVID-19 from entering the province, Bishop Caermare through a pastoral letter released March 13 also announced steps to be implemented, including the draining off of holy water in founts at church entrances.
During mass, refrain from holding of hands while singing The Lord’s Prayer; to bow instead of shaking hands during the “kiss of peace”; to receive communion through their hands ,and those who are ill are advised to hear mass on television or radio.
If mass goers have to cough, the bishop said they have to cover their mouth with handkerchief or with their arms.
The traditionally popular kissing, touching or wiping of handkerchief on images are also discouraged.
The bishop is yet to issue guidelines on how to observe the coming Holy Week, which traditionally draws huge crowds in processions and masses. – Rappler.com "

SINGAPORE – The Singaporean government cautioned its nationals on Friday, March 13, against traveling to the Philippines and other countries that have exported cases of the novel coronavirus to Singapore.
At least 4 Filipinos who tested positive for COVID-19 in Singapore recently traveled to the Philippines. One of them, who is linked to another coronavirus patient, is classified by Singapore as an imported case.
At least 7 of Singapore’s 187 coronavirus cases are Filipinos. (READ: Coronavirus sa Singapore: Tips para sa mga Pilipino)
This precaution against trips to the Philippines is not as strong as the city-state’s advisory to defer all non-essential trips to Italy, France, Spain, and Germany, but it reflects growing concern about imported coronavirus cases from Singapore’s neighbors. 
The World Health Organization on Wednesday, March 11, declared the novel coronavirus disease called COVID-19 as a pandemic.
Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong announced on Thursday night, March 12, that he was ruling out a lockdown of the city-state even as Singapore would tighten precautionary measures against COVID-19. 
“In light of the rapid spread of the virus across Europe, the Ministry of Health (MOH) advises Singaporeans to defer all non-essential travel to Italy, France, Spain, and Germany,” the ministry said in a press release Friday. 
The ministry added that it maintained the earlier advisory to defer all travel to China’s Hubei province, from which the new coronavirus was said to have originated, and to defer non-essential travel to the rest of mainland China, Iran, Japan, and South Korea.
“Singaporeans are also advised to exercise caution when traveling to all countries affected by COVID-19, especially those which have exported cases. These include our neighboring countries, like Indonesia and the Philippines, and those further afield, like the United Kingdom. The global picture is evolving, and there could be other countries that may be affected,” said the MOH.
The MOH said that as of Friday, the following countries have exported coronavirus cases to Singapore: China, France, Germany, Italy, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, the Philippines, the United Kingdom, and the United States. 
Other measures implemented by Singapore include a ban on all new visitors with travel histories to Italy, France, Spain, and Germany within the last 14 days. The prohibition begins at 11:59 pm on Sunday, March 15, and covers visitors seeking to enter or transit through Singapore.
Social distancing
The Singaporean government also required the deferral or cancellation of all ticketed sports, cultural, and entertainment events that have 250 or more participants. 
If tickets had already been sold, “organizers must demonstrate that satisfactory precautionary measures have been put in place before they can proceed.”
For religious services and other private functions, Singapore has advised organizers, among other things, to “reduce the scale of events to below 250 participants where possible.”
Singapore also recommended that participants in such mass gatherings be seated one meter apart.
In line with the government’s precautionary measures, the Roman Catholic archbishop of Singapore, William Goh, on Thursday withdrew his earlier plan to resume Masses in Singapore. He cited the WHO’s declaration of COVID-19 as a pandemic. 
Muslim authorities in Singapore also decided to close all mosques in the city-state for disinfection for 5 days starting Friday. This was after Singaporeans attended a mass event in Kuala Lumpur where a number of participants tested positive for COVID-19. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – Government agencies will continue to provide “frontline services” even if President Rodrigo Duterte suspended work in the executive branch in Metro Manila to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus disease called COVID-19.
Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles made the announcement on Friday, March 13, saying the government will continue to work despite social distancing measures implemented to combat the coronavirus. 
“Yung frontline services po ng gobyerno ay tuloy-tuloy pa rin po (The government’s frontline services will continue),” Nograles said at a Malacañang briefing on the government’s response to the outbreak. 
Nograles said government agencies have been directed to implement skeletal staffing and consider telecommuting options for the duration of work suspension in Metro Manila which will last from Sunday, March 15 to April 12. 
The details of skelatal workforces – such as how many workers this will entail and who will be included – will depend on each agency, Nograles said. What’s imperative, he added, is that services will continue uninterrupted while measures to prevent the spread of the coronavirus are in place. 
What this includes: Under Republic Act No. 9485 or the Anti-Red Tape Act of 2007, “frontline services” is defined as the following: 
“The transactions between clients and government officers “involving applications for any privilege, right, permit, reward, license, concession, or for any modification, renewal, or extension of the enumerated applications and/or requests which are acted upon in the ordinary course of business of the agency or office concerned.”
Why this matters. Concerns over functions of government services were among the several questions raised after President Rodrigo Duterte delivered a briefing on government’s response to the coronavirus crisis on Thursday night, March 12.

While work in the executive branches will be suspended, health and emergency will remain in full operation.

President Rodrigo Duterte said on Thursday that as provided in the Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF) resolution that he had approved, local chief executives can announce municipality or city-wide quarantines when there are at least two positive coronavirus cases living in different barangays. 
Under the resolution, Metro Manila will be on 30-day lockdown beginning March 15. Nieto said he has followed the date set by the government for the localized quarantine, and indicated that it would also last for 30 days, or until April 14.
“March 15 po magkakabisa ang deklarasyong ito. Sasabay na natin sa petsa na itinakda ng ating Pangulo,” the Cainta mayor said. 
(This declaration will take effect on March 15. We will follow the dates set by the President.)

In another Facebook post on Friday, March 13, Nieto outlined measures the municipal government is taking before the quarantine takes effect:

Senior citizens will be provided with vitamins to help protect them against COVID-19.
The town-wide cleansing of public streets will continue, including misting and spraying activities.
The purchase control team of the Business Permits Office will go around Cainta to stop residents from panic-buying in groceries.
The municipal government will continue giving bottles of rubbing alcohol for those who need it.


Nieto said no stores wiould be shut down during the entire quarantine period in his town. All public events in Cainta are also canceled until the quarantine is lifted. – Rappler.com "

For most of us in Corporate Philippines, life goes like clockwork and often for good reasons. Being creatures of habit and natural allocators, we have most likely optimized our routines so as to allot a bigger slice of our finite 24 hours for things that makes us feel alive – relationships, hobbies, and interests. If this intentionally designed daily grind machine is threatened with even the slightest disruption, we are quick to deter, dismiss, downplay, or ignore.
Until we can no longer.
When initial reports of the coronavirus flooded everybody’s newsfeeds back in January, my “doomsday prepper” wife promptly took her action, starting with ordering the reusable face masks I am wearing today. She restricted her activities, pulled back on socials, and withdrew our daughter from Sunday school, resorting to live streaming Sunday worship services instead.
As a good husband who chooses his battles, I complied. But in my mind: ""The virus is far away from here, the sea should stop it the way it stopped the bubonic plague on European shores. Of all places in the globe, the virus surely can’t get to a certain Pasig City.""
That was, until last Monday, when I dropped off my wife for the office as usual. I marveled at the eery fact that only St. Luke’s thick walls were standing between me and the virus, which was at that moment probably just some 200 meters away. Earlier I passed by TriCity Medical Center, closer to home, where there were two other cases. The official tally of the DOH quickly rose from 4 to 24 to 33 as of March 10. Now it has everybody’s attention.
We are naturally uncomfortable with two things: change and uncertainty. The coronavirus is pressing these two down hard on us all.  We are now forced to change the routines we have diligently nursed all this time. While it is still in my power to decide to wear a face mask or not, there are some things that we can’t help but act in accordance with.
The menial ones are less important but irritating. The badminton courts religiously graced by my group have now started to refuse entry. The gardening raid scheduled one weekend had been canceled, and our weekly grocery is now taking twice as much time due to longer lines from panic buying.
Then comes the tougher bit to members of the workforce. Companies started to break off teams into smaller units and scatter them across several locations as a business continuity contingency. In case a part of the team gets infected or has to be quarantined, there would still be a functioning unit somewhere. That means I would have to report in a location outside my route. (READ: Depth of economic slowdown depends on response – IMF)
Fortunately, working from home, previously frowned upon, is now being invoked by the few capable offices such as my wife’s, so I don’t have to go way off as much just to drop her off. My sister who took time off from her UAE job will have to self-quarantine first for two weeks when she returns there, at her own expense, before she can finish the remaining one month of her contract.
The business shakedown is very real. There are few businesses, especially the small ones, that can stay solvent longer than the scare of the virus. For instance, people I know from the hospitality industries are now forced to only take 3 shifts a week instead of the usual 5, as tourism grinds to a halt. Executives are forced to take their vacation leaves to help meet the quarterly targets that cannot be helped operationally.
The decrease in economic activity seems to have rattled investors also, whose pendulum has swung from the optimistic January where it valued PSEI an all-time high of 9078.37, to the pessimistic outlook now, where it is valued at 5,946.66 – slashed by an astounding 33%. (By the way, this is the best time to buy stocks.) (READ: Global stocks suffer historic rout, shrugging off central bank steps)
Businesses are still trying hard, though. In Makati, Landmark, SM, and Rustan’s are simultaneously holding ""sales"" to stimulate consumption and purchases. It will be a sort of natural selection in the businesscape. Allow the scare to go on long enough and only the businesses with adequate capital and little debt will be able to see the end of the tunnel.
While change is inconvenient and nagging, it is not as wearying as uncertainty. It then becomes a test of stamina. How long can you wear the face mask (if you are on the camp that believes it helps)? How long can you stay away from the malls? How long can you keep your hands away from your eyes, nose, and mouth? How long can you keep a dispersed team safe and functioning?
My solution is to once again build a routine around it. Find a less crowded marketplace and carefully source groceries from there. Then prepare food at home for the day’s intake – not just lunch, but also breakfast, snacks, and dinner, so you won’t have to go anywhere else. Wear the mask when traveling from home to office. Alcohol down upon arrival at the office, and at home go straight to the bath before your toddler's hugs and kisses. Keep your hands in your pockets as much as you can. And pray, pray and pray!
An ounce of prevention is not worth a pound of cure. An ounce of prevention is not worth a ton of cure.

MANILA, Philippines – Just hold it for a month, the government is telling couples whose wedding plans may be affected by a looming lockdown of Metro Manila aimed at preventing the spread of the novel coronavirus.
Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles and Trade Secretary Ramon Lopez admitted there were no particular guidelines yet for weddings. But because the guiding principle of the lockdown is “social distancing,” couples should consider postponing weddings until after April 15, or else cut the number of guests, the two Cabinet members said in the Laging Handa media briefing on Friday, March 13.
The lockdown order bans mass gatherings of people, which may include weddings.
“Prohibited po. Pasensya na po (It’s prohibited. I’m sorry). They’ll have to…” Nograles failed to finish his sentence as the briefing room broke into laughter.
Lopez said the Cabinet should include weddings when they draft guidelines for the lockdown later in the day.
“Hindi ho mapipigilan ang pag-ibig. Bawasan na lang nila ‘yung guests…makakatipid pa sila (There’s no stopping love, They should just cut back on the guests…they’ll end up saving money),” Lopez suggested.
Depends on the size of the room
Because social distancing means people staying at least one meter away from one another, couples should decide the number of guests based on the size of the hall where they plan to hold the ceremony and the reception, Nograles said.
“An informal estimate would be 50 guests, but it really depends on the size of the room,” he added.
And if the idea is to keep each other at least an arm’s length, “Paano magki-kiss yung couple? Paano yung distansya nung couple?” Nograles jested. (How can the couple kiss? How about the couples’ distance?)
In the time of the coronavirus, love must prove itself ""timeless and boundless,"" Nograles said. 
“What is one month’s postponement for love?”
Force majeur
Lopez looked at the more practical concern: what about those who’ve placed reservations at hotels and restaurants, and have already made down payments?
“Dapat ho may refund, kasi force majeur po ‘yon. So huwag sila matakot,” the trade secretary said. (They should be refunded because that’s force majeur. They shouldn’t worry.)
If the establishments give them a hard time, couples may file a consumer complaint with the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) through its hotline 1384.
The DTI will take the customers’ side and ensure they get their refund, Lopez said.

In a statement on Friday, March 13, Quezon City Mayor Joy Belmonte provided guidelines on what the city's different sectors should do during the lockdown.
The immediate response of the city government was to continue citywide disinfection, including the closure of public spaces such as parks, covered courts, buildings, and other facilities. 
In an interview with ANC, Belmonte said that they would also intensify contact tracing.
""In the past, while we would contact-trace close contacts and relatives of those who are positive, now we would like to require that these positive patients would recall every single person they have had contact with for the past week, and all of these individuals we would require to be quarantined,"" Belmonte said.
To augment quarantine facilities, Belmonte said empty buildings would be converted into isolation rooms to accommodate people who might be placed under quarantine. 
Persons under investigation and persons under monitoring within the city are also being monitored continuously.
The city government was also implementing a 4-day workweek for local government employees  to continue service delivery.
Barangay officials and policemen will be monitoring public spaces strictly, covering malls, computer shops, and community spaces. Belmonte also asked all barangays to have isolation rooms.
Meanwhile, the private sector was encouraged to implement flexible work arrangements to mitigate the risk of infection. They were also told to monitor the health of their employees.
Retail and commercial establishments must sanitize facilities regularly and keep transactions orderly, equitable, and fair. Belmonte also asked these establishments to ensure that supplies are ""democratized"" among shoppers to prevent hoarding and panic buying. (READ: Hoarding, overpricing would lead to criminal charges, warns DTI)

MANILA, Philippines – Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles on Friday, March 13, assured the public that the transport and supply of basic necessities and essential goods into Metro Manila will continue unhampered despite a lockdown of the mega-city.
Nograles said the Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF) on Emerging Infectious Diseases will likewise be drafting guidelines on how this will take place specifically, given that domestic land, sea, and air travel will not be allowed to and from the Metro Manila starting Sunday, March 15. 

""We would like to stress that the transport of goods to Metro Manila from the provinces and vice-versa will remain subject to guidelines. This means that residents of NCR should not worry about the supplies of produce, foods, and other goods in our markets, groceries, and retailers,"" Nograles said at a Malacañang briefing on the government measures against the coronavirus outbreak. 
Nograles made the announcement the morning after President Rodrigo Duterte delivered a briefing on measures taken to combat the coronavirus crisis in the Philippines. 
With assurances goods will remain available to residents of Metro Manila, Nograles appealed to the public to refrain from panic buying and wiping store shelves. 
 ""Ulitin natin, huwag po tayong maghoard…. 'Di po tao mauubusan. Tuloy-tuloy po ang supplies natin dito sa Metro Manila,"" he said. 
(We repeat, please do not hoard…. We will not run out (of goods). Supplies will continue to be transported to Metro Manila.) 
Duterte earlier declared “community quarantine” measures will be imposed on the entirety of Metro Manila starting midnight of Sunday, March 15. It will last until April 14.   
The measure was imposed to prevent the further spread of the novel coronavirus disease called COVID-19.
Nograles said details of how this will be enforced will still be drafted by the IATF during its scheduled meeting later on Friday. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – Trade Secretary Ramon Lopez on Friday, March 13, said that informal sector workers, who are generally not registered to do business in Metro Manila, should sell outside the capital region in the meantime.
At the Laging Handa press briefing in Malacañang, Lopez was asked what would happen to informal sector workers, when the government implements the impending precautionary lockdown of Metro Manila against the spread of the coronavirus disease.
According to Lopez, it's either they register as informal sector members or they sell outside Metro Manila. (READ: What you need to know about PH's informal sector workers)
""I-encourage na lang natin sila na either magregister sila or 'do'n na lang sila sa lugar nanggagaling, 'wag na pumasok sa Metro Manila. Kasi 'yung general princple po, sabi na nga ng ating CabSec (Cabinet Secretary), talagang ma-minimize 'yung movement,"" Lopez said.
(We encourage them to either register or just do business where they are from and not enter Metro Manila. Because the general principle, as mentioned by our CabSec, is to minimize the movement.)
Lopez said that informal sector workers are not registered in LGUs, in general.
""Generally speaking, pagka-informal sector, 'pag sila mismo ang negosyante, do'n na lang sila sa ibang lugar muna na lang magnegosyo, 'wag na lang sa Metro Manila. Hindi naman sila registered eh. Technically, puwede silang magnegosyo kahit saan,"" Lopez said.
(Generally speaking, for informal sector workers, if they are the seller, it's better if they do business in other places in the meantime, and not in Metro Manila. They are usually not registered. Technically, they can do business anywhere.)
But Lopez qualified that some informal sectors are indeed registered in some local governments, so they will still be allowed entry for business.
""Kaya dapat magregister sila. Tapos gano'n na rin sa workers na 'yon kasi importante may ID eh. Kasi limit talaga natin 'yung movement within one month,"" Lopez said.
(It's really important that they register. It's important for the workers to have an ID. Because we are really limiting the movement within one month.)
The Philippines declared a ""community quarantine"" – which in effect is similar to a lockdown – that will be restricting land, air, and water travel from Metro Manila to any point of the country from March 15 to April 14.
Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles said that the lockdown of Metro Manila can be lifted anytime the Duterte government sees it fit, or be extended if needed.

MANILA, Philippines – The impending precautionary lockdown of Metro Manila against the spread of the novel coronavirus can be lifted anytime if the Duterte government sees it fit, Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles said on Friday, March 13. It can also be extended if needed.
""The suspension of domestic travel will be reviewed on a daily basis, and may be lifted earlier if the situation allows it, or extended further if the situation requires it,"" Nograles said during a briefing in Malacañang.
Why does this matter? President Rodrigo Duterte announced on Thursday night that the lockdown will last from March 15 to April 14, basing on the resolution of the Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF) on the coronavirus outbreak.
The evaluation will be based on the spread and containment of the coronavirus in the region of more than 12 million people.
The exceptions: According to Interior Secretary Eduardo Año, workers from the provinces will be allowed to come in and out of Metro Manila as long as they present their IDs or proof of working in the National Capital Region.
Other exceptions to the lockdown will be fleshed out, Nograles said, during the meeting of the IATF after the Palace briefing. President Duterte earlier said he will issue an executive order to provide an enforcible basis for the IATF's resolution. – Rappler.com "

AKLAN, Philippines – The Boracay Inter-Agency Tak Force (BIATF) has decided to cancel the LoveBoracay 2.0 celebration and other scheduled crowd-drawing events in light of possible person-to-person transmission of the novel coronavirus.
The cancellation comes in the wake of Executive Order No. 18 issued on March 12 by Aklan Governor Florencio Miraflores scrapping large gatherings in public places including the 64th Aklan Day festivities to reduce risk of exposure to the coronavirus.
So far, as of March 12, Aklan has no recorded case of COVID-19, the sickness caused by the coronavirus. There are also no positive cases of transmission of the virus here.
The other events in the island resort that were scheduled for April 26 to May 2 but now shelved are:

Skim Boarding Contest,
Pinta Layag,
Local Kite Boarding and Wind Surfing Tournament,
Drone Film Festival,
Water Festival,
National Life Guards Olympics,
Beach Futsal and Volleyball,
Aklan Hammock Festival 3.0,
Sabor Boracay,

Boracay Clean Up,
and Toy Boat Racing.

 “Once this health pandemic is over, they agreed to hold the events even better as planned... we hope the full cooperation of everyone to safeguard the well-being of the whole Boracay community,” said BIATF deputy ground commandeer Al Orolfo.
The governor signed the EO No. 18 after a meeting on March 9 with the Aklan Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases.
Miraflores said travellers coming from affected countries to Aklan are also advised to undergo home care quarantine if they develop symptoms. All bus terminals, department stores and malls are directed to conduct health screenings with handheld thermal scanners and to provide hand sanitizers to passengers and customers.
The governor said the measures are being put in place to tackle the threat of coronavirus to the health and safety of residents and the communities.
In other developments, the deadly impact of coronavirus has gripped health authorities in the Philippines with 52 new infections as of March 12. In Aklan, no confirmed cases or people tested positive of the killer infection.

MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – Batangas province reported on Friday, March 13, its first two confirmed cases of the COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.
According to the Batangas Public Information Office, the two cases are from Batangas City and are currently isolated in a medical facility in Metro Manila.
Earlier on Friday morning, Governor Hermilando Mandanas confirmed the first case of COVID-19 in the province, advising Batangueños to take preventive measures against the virus.
“Tayo sa Batangas ay kakayanin ang [mga] sakuna na ito, kapares na rin ang ginagawang pangangalaga dahil naman sa pagputok ng Taal Volcano at pagsisimula ng African Swine Fever sa bayan ng Laurel,” Mandanas said.

On Thursday night, March 12, President Rodrigo Duterte announced that Metro Manila – a region of over 12 million people – will be placed on lockdown for at least a month to contain the spread of the virus in the country.
The announcement came shortly after the President declared that the alert level for the coronavirus has been raised to its maximum level of Code Red Sublevel 2.
“Ang lalawigan ng Batangas ay hindi lang sapat sa pagkain, tayo rin po ang inaasahang mag-supply ng tilapia, baboy, manok, baka, at iba pang pagkain pang araw-araw hindi lamang sa Metro Manila kundi sa iba pang bahagi ng Pilipinas,” Mandanas said.

To ensure the safety of students, Mandanas has also suspended classes in all levels, public and private, in the province starting today, March 13, until March 31.
“Ang kapakanan ng ating mga ka-lalawigan ay lalo nating itataguyod lalo na ang ating mga kabataaan.

MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – A Filipino diplomat at the Philippines’ Permanent Mission to the United Nations tested positive for COVID-19, said to be the first known coronavirus case at the UN in New York.
Department of Foreign Affairs Assistant Secretary Eduardo Meñez said this on Friday, March 13, when asked to confirm a Reuters report that a diplomat from the Philippine mission to the UN tested positive for COVID-19. 
""Yes, one of our diplomats at the Philippine Mission to the UN in New York has tested positive for COVID,"" Meñez said in a text message.
""The necessary health and safety protocols have been implemented,"" he added.
In a statement on Friday, March 13, the Philippine Mission to the UN said Deputy Permanent Representative Kira Azucena informed other UN missions about the development on Thursday and notified the UN medical director’s office and the New York City health department. The latter advised them to ""self-isolate.""
""As of today, the Philippine Center in New York housing the Philippine Mission is on lockdown until further notice and its employees have been instructed to self-quarantine and to seek medical attention should they develop the symptoms,"" it said.
The mission said the staff, who was diagnosed with COVID-19 on Thursday, ""is in good condition.""
""She last visited the United Nations last Monday, March 9, for about 30 minutes – from 12.50 to 1.20 pm. She was asymptomatic then,"" it said.
""The following day, Tuesday, March 10, she came down with flu-like symptoms and, in accordance with the Mission’s office protocol, did not report for work that day and saw her doctor. She tested positive for flu and was prescribed Tamiflu. She got the call today that she tested positive for COVID-19,"" it added.
The Philippine mission said it was closely coordinating with the New York health department.

Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr also commented on the case through Twitter on Friday, in response to a Reuters reporter who tweeted about the report.
""The infected is doing well; she's young, spritely, smart and taking some doctor prescribed meds. Thank you. I just talked to Kira,"" he said, referring to Acting Philippine Ambassador to the UN Kira Azucena who is in charge of the diplomat.
Locsin said the Filipino diplomat came from Florida before going back to New York. 
At least 103 Filipinos abroad have contracted the virus.

MANILA, Philippines (3rd UPDATE) – Leaders of the Catholic Church, the predominant religion in the Philippines, suspended Masses in parts of Metro Manila starting Saturday, March 14, after the Duterte government announced it is placing the capital region on lockdown due to the novel coronavirus.
Masses have been suspended in the following parts of the Philippines’ capital region: Manila, Makati, Pasay, San Juan, Mandaluyong, Pasig, Taguig, Pateros, Parañaque, Las Piñas, Muntinlupa, Quezon City, and northern Caloocan City. 
The Archdiocese of Manila has suspended public Masses for 7 days starting Saturday, according to its temporary head Bishop Broderick Pabillo on Friday, March 13.
The Archdiocese of Manila covers the cities of Manila, Makati, Pasay, San Juan, and Mandaluyong.
His directive does not apply to other dioceses or Catholic territories in Metro Manila, each of which has its own bishop.
Later on Friday, the Diocese of Cubao, which covers the southern part of Quezon City, also announced the indefinite suspension of Masses starting March 14.
The decision was made by Cubao Bishop Honesto Ongtioco, who meanwhile allowed the diocese's priests to say Masses in private and to air these via livestream.
Pasig Bishop Mylo Hubert Vergara also suspended public Masses in his diocese starting March 14. The Diocese of Pasig covers Pasig, Taguig, and Pateros.
The Diocese of Parañaque, led by Bishop Jesse Mercado, meanwhile said there will be no public Masses from March 15 to 21. This diocese covers Parañaque, Las Piñas, and Muntinlupa.
The Diocese of Novaliches, which covers the northern parts of Quezon City and Caloocan City, has had no public Masses since Friday. The suspension will last until April 12, said Novaliches Bishop Roberto Gaa. 
In a pastoral letter on Friday, Pabillo cited the government’s decision to raise Code Red Sublevel 2, the highest alert level for disease outbreaks, in the Philippines’ capital region.
“We are enjoined to avoid large gatherings of people to avert the further spread of the virus. We heed this call not with panic but with care for charity to others and the common good,” said Pabillo.
“Hence in the Archdiocese of Manila I dispense all the faithful from the obligation of going to Mass this Sunday. There will be no public celebration of the Holy Mass and no public activities in all the churches in the Archdiocese for 7 days, starting Saturday, March 14, till Friday, March 20,” the bishop added.
This is the first time in recent history that Masses have been suspended in a major part of the Philippines, a predominantly Catholic country.
Roughly 8 out of 10 Filipinos belong to the Catholic Church, and Sunday Masses have been part of Filipinos’ lives for centuries.
The suspension of public Masses is one of the major disruptions caused by the government’s lockdown of Metro Manila, which lasts from March 15 to April 14. 
Metro Manila is a region of more than 12 million people, but this number swells to up to 15 million at daytime, when Filipinos from nearby provinces such as Laguna and Bulacan flock to the metro to work. 
While Masses are suspended in the Archdiocese of Manila, Pabillo advised Catholics to watch online Masses on church-run stations Radio Veritas and TV Maria, and on the social media pages of Quiapo Church and other Catholic churches. 
Pabillo also called for the tolling of church bells at noon and at 8 pm every day, from March 14 onwards, to call on Catholics to pray to fight the coronavirus. 
“In the spirit of Lent let us accompany our prayer with acts of penance and charity,” Pabillo added. “Let not fear run our lives. Hence we avoid panic buying. We should not consider only our needs but also the needs of others.” – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – The Philippine National Police (PNP) has placed its cops in Metro Manila, Central Luzon, Calabarzon, and Bicol on full alert beginning Friday, March 13.
The PNP Directorate for Operations issued the order citing President Rodrigo Duterte's declaration of a public health emergency in the country and the ""community quarantine"" of Metro Manila from March 15 to April 14, to stem the COVID-19 outbreak.
After Duterte announced the lockdown, Interior Secretary Eduardo Año said cops would enforce it through checkpoints. The Armed Forces of the Philippines, meanwhile, is on standby to augment police forces.
Placing cops on full alert means that their vacation leaves are canceled and that they would have to work overtime. The PNP earlier banned foreign travel for cops to prevent them from getting the novel coronavirus abroad.
National Capital Region Police Office Director Major General Debold Sinas earlier said at least 40,000 cops would be deployed to enforce the Metro Manila lockdown.
Duterte approved the resolution of the Inter-Agency Task Force on the coronavirus crisis on Thursday night that recommended, among others, that Metro Manila be placed on a 30-day lockdown, but the Presdient said he would issue an executive order to make sure  that the recommendations are followed. Agencies have yet to issued their respective memoranda on how to enforce the resolution. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – A staff member of the Printing Service office in the House of Representatives tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.
House Secretary-General Luis Montales sent a message to House employees late Thursday night, March 12, saying he “received word that a staff from Printing Service tested positive for COVID-19.” 
The patient has not traveled to any country with COVID-19 cases nor has the patient made contact with a confirmed case.  
The patient had been in and out of the hospital since last year due to various ailments and was recently confined for community-acquired pneumonia. The patient last reported for work in the House on March 3.
It is still unclear, however, if the Printing Service office staff member is already part of the 52 positive cases already confirmed by the Department of Health (DOH) as of Thursday evening. 
All personnel from the Printing Service office, as well as all other employees and House members with whom the patient made contact, will be undergoing quarantine.  
At least 3 lawmakers and one House official confirmed to Rappler on Friday, March 13, that Montales had sent the message, where the House Secretary-General said it is the “DOH [that] will make the official announcement. “ 
Rappler already sought Montales for comment, but he has yet to reply as of posting time. The office of Speaker Alan Peter Cayetano also said to wait for the DOH’s announcement. 
The Senate is currently under ""restricted access"" after a resource person in a March 5 hearing tested positive for COVID-19. This prompted several senators, House members, and Cabinet officials to undergo self-quarantine.
President Rodrigo Duterte already declared a state of public health emergency and raised the Code Red Sublevel 2 in the country due to the COVID-19 outbreak, which has killed 5 so far in the Philippines.
Metro Manila will be put on a month-long lockdown starting March 15, while classes and government offices will also be suspended. – Rappler.com "

PUBLIC ADDRESS. President Rodrigo Duterte addresses the public about the novel coronavirus in a live broadcast on March 12, 2020. Behind him are Armed Forces of the Philippines chief General Felimon Santos Jr (R) and Army chief Lieutenant General Gilbert Gapay (L). Screencap from RTVM 
When President Rodrigo Duterte addressed the nation in a live broadcast on Thursday night, March 12, the master shot showed Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) chief of staff General Felimon Santos Jr in the background to his left, and Philippine Army chief Lieutenant General Gilbert Gapay to his right.
Wider shots taken from other angles showed other members of the uniformed services seated in array along the walls of the cavernous Malacañang hall from where the President spoke.
It was clear right away that what he was going to announce will involve government muscle, and indeed Duterte then ordered a lockdown of Metro Manila to prevent the novel coronavirus from spreading further.
It was hardly a surprise for people in the metropolis. Leaked copies of the unsigned order went viral earlier in the day, and they headed to supermarkets and drugstores to stock up on food and supplies, anticipating that lockdown.
In fact, people have been “panic buying” ever since the first local transmission of the virus was reported over the weekend.
By the time the President addressed the public two hours behind schedule on Thursday night, the number of cases had exceeded 50.
Reassurance?
If the goal was to reassure the public that things were under control, then it was Duterte himself who painted a grim picture of what the lockdown could lead to – not because the police and military were involved, but because of what he imagined he would need them to do if worse comes to worst.
“Mayroon po kami, itong Inter-Agency Task Force, kasali na ang military pati police, kasi kailangan namin ang tulong nila kung sakali man lalala talaga ‘to,” he said. (We have this Inter-Agency Task Force, now including the military and police, because we need their help in case this really gets out of hand.)
“Maybe this would create a public disturbance, disorder, pero ang tingin ko hanggang diyan lang naman (but I think that’s all) because I know you want to follow because you want to help everybody including yourself and your family,” he also said.
Midway into the broadcast, Duterte got more vivid:
“I do not want anybody interfering in your enjoyment as a citizen of this republic. Ayaw ko na masita kayo ng police pati ng military (I don’t want you to get accosted by the police or the military). It could be messy kasi yung mga iba sa inyo, soplado (because some of you are snooty). And these police and military, they have their orders to enforce.” 
“So that if you are in this category of a, grupo kayo tapos pag malapit, yung social distancing is no longer obeyed, and you, you are violating the rules, and if you insist, it is one of just mere confrontation to something like disobedience, which is punishable under the Revised Penal Code,” Duterte said, describing an imagined tussle between civilians and law enforcers.
“Kung makipag-away ka…baka masuntok mo o ano (If you pick a fight…you might hit them or something), then it becomes an assault on an agent of a person in authority. In which case, from a simple violation of a rule, it will now ripen into a crime that is punishable by law and you can go to prison. That’s the problem.”
So just do what the police or military officer tells you, to stay out of trouble, Duterte concluded.
On the defensive
Then he went on with the broad strokes of the lockdown: classes suspended, government and private offices to wind down operations, no outsiders coming into the metropolis unless necessary, restrictions on domestic and international travel.
Again, Duterte went on the defensive:
“But it’s a lockdown. There is no struggle of power here…. It’s just a matter of protecting and defending you from COVID-19. That’s about it. It has nothing to do with the power of the military nor the power of the police nor my power and these guys beside me. It’s just an issue of protecting public interest and public health. ‘Yun lang (That’s it).”
Saying he did not have enough military and police personnel to cover every inch of the country, Duterte planned to enlist barangay captains to help enforce the lockdown.
At this point, the picture was clear, and again, the President defended his vision:
“Hindi ito martial law. It is not a martial law. It’s not even something extraordinary. But what is sought to be solved here is the, again, walang iba (nothing else) except to fight the virus and to exact compliance.”
“Mas mabuti talaga yung maniwala kayo (You’re better off believing),” he added.
‘Total breakdown’
The Philippines had its first confirmed case of the virus on January 30. Containing the virus is difficult, and even countries with efficient governments and health care systems are struggling to quell it. Naturally, Filipinos are afraid.
Somehow, Duterte sensed that his military approach to the matter was adding to that fear.
Military presence is a touchy subject among Filipinos still traumatized by martial law under Ferdinand Marcos, the dictator who cracked down on all dissent and criticism through intimidation, torture, and murder, as he and his cronies ransacked the public treasury.
More recently, Mindanao just came out of two-and-a-half years of martial law following the terrorist siege of Marawi City in May 2017. It was a time of heightened tension as police and military went after extremists and communist rebels in a region long battered by armed conflict.
In so-called “imperial Metro Manila,” where people are more used to relative order and comfort, the idea of a lockdown might be alarming to some.
But for Duterte, it is the only way to fix the problem and already, he anticipates a “total breakdown.”
“Because in a total breakdown, I would need their help to carry on with the governance…. Do not try to play with ‘martial law-martial law, military.’ Pero ang sa totoo (But the truth is), in a total breakdown, public disturbance…. It’s always the military who keep things in the country in order,” he said.
He explained further:
“To do that, if things deteriorate, I said, the military and the police will maintain order. Kaya nga tawag diyan (That’s why it’s called), peace and order. There has to be peace, and that peace, nakalagay na (has to be), orderly. There has to be order in the country and that is all.”
From these words, the nation is expected to draw a sense of security and assurance that the situation will not devolve into chaos. Otherwise, they know what course of action the President has in mind. – Rappler.com "

AKLAN, Philippines – Aklan Governor Florencio Miraflores issued an order on Thursday, March 12, to cancel or postpone all public events and large community gatherings amid rising cases of the coronavirus disease in the country. 
Although there are no positive cases in Aklan, a tourist destination, Miraflores said added measures were needed to safeguard residents in the province, as recommended by Aklan’s Inter-agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases on March 9.
Miraflores also cancelled activities lined up for the 64th Aklan Day celebration on April 25. He said this was to reduce the risks of community transmission of the virus.
He signed Executive Order 18 on March 12, directing big transportation companies to check the body temperature of passengers at their terminals with handheld thermal scanners. Malls, department stores, and other establishments are required to provide hand sanitizers to their customers. 
The order is effective immediately and enforceable within 45 days.
The governor also cited the public health emergency proclamation of President Rodrigo Duterte on March 8 and the code red alert issued by the Department of Health.
For now, health authorities also advise Aklanon residents arriving at or returning to Aklan from affected countries to observe home care quarantine, monitor symptoms, and coordinate with health response teams in the barangays. 
The Provincial Health Office earlier reported 82 persons under monitoring and 9 persons under investigations in Aklan from January 17 to March 12. All 9 cases were discharged from the Aklan provincial hospital after they tested negative for the virus, according to results from the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine. – Rappler.com

MANILA, Philippines – As he was set to address Filipinos amid the growing novel coronavirus crisis in the Philippines, President Rodrigo Duterte on Thursday, March 12, spared some time to praise Chinese President Xi Jinping. 
“You know President Xi Jinping for all of his goodness to us, wrote me a letter and said that he is willing to help. All we have to do is to ask,” Duterte said in a televised briefing as he veered from a prepared speech that included urgent recommendations of the Philippines’ Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases. The task force was created to combat the virulent coronavirus.
After announcing Filipino workers will be allowed to return to mainland China, Duterte also said, “Maybe there will be time if things deteriorate that I have to call on China to help. He said that they have managed the crisis very well in his country and he is very much willing to help kung kailangan (if needed),” he added. 
“So to the Chinese government, the people, especially to President Xi Jinping, thank you for the consoling words and maybe I hope it would not reach to that point, but maybe we will need your help. Salamat po (Thank you),” Duterte said. 
Model example? Since the coronavirus crisis began in January 2020, the Chinese government has been widely criticized both in China and abroad, for its handling of the outbreak.  
The reputation of Xi and other Chinese officials took a hit after reports showed a lack of transparency delayed critical response by health officials to the public health emergency.  
With cases now tapering in China, Xi recently made a visit to Wuhan – ground zero of the outbreak – in a bid to show the disease was “under control.”  
Other measures taken: Duterte’s public address at past 8 pm on Thursday was the first briefing he made since international health officials announced the outbreak had become a pandemic and additional cases of COVID-19 were reported in the Philippines. 
During his address, Duterte announced he would be implementing a lockdown on Metro Manila starting March 15, suspending classes and government work until April 12, and banning non-Filipinos coming directly from countries where there were locally transmitted cases of the coronavirus. 
The Philippines has recorded at least 52 confirmed coronavirus cases as of Thursday, 5 of whom have died.
Worldwide, the virus has infected more than 125,000 people and killed 4,600 across 115 countries. More than 62,000 people have recovered from the virus. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – The Davao City government is prohibiting residents from leaving its borders as the country deals with an increasing number of novel coronavirus cases.
In a Facebook post on Thursday, March 12, the city government said all residents are prohibited from going out of Davao City. 
All short-term visitors are also “advised” to leave Davao City immediately.
The city government “requested” those planning to visit the city to postpone their trip until after President Rodrigo Duterte, the father of Davao City Mayor Sara Duterte, lifts the state of public health emergency.
Despite the strict travel restrictions to and from Davao City, its local government said it is “not on lockdown.” 

Before imposing this sweeping local travel ban, Mayor Duterte already temporarily closed off the Night Market along Roxas Avenue starting Thursday. All parks and playgrounds were ordered shut as well. 
The city government said it may soon have the capability to test samples of the novel coronavirus at the Southern Philippines Medical Center later this month.  
“We are waiting for the materials to be sent here, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). It will be the molecular laboratory that will be doing the tests,” said Dr Marie Yvette Barez, the hospital’s Infection Control and Prevention Unit chair.
On Thursday evening, the President said he will place Metro Manila under lockdown from March 15 to April 14. Local government units outside Metro Manila may also declare localized lockdowns within their respective jurisdictions. 
A city-wide quarantine, like the one being implemented in Davao City, may be imposed when there are at least two positive coronavirus cases living in different barangays.

MANILA, Philippines – More than 600 stranded overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) are now allowed to go back to their jobs in all of mainland China except Hubei province, the epicenter of the novel coronavirus outbreak.
President Rodrigo Duterte announced this late Thursday, March 12, after approving the recommendations under Resolution No. 11, Series of 2020 of the Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF) for the Management of Emerging Infectious Disease.
OFWs who wish to return to mainland China will be allowed to fly there upon signing a declaration “signifying their knowledge and understanding of the risks involved,"" according to the the IATF resolution.
President Duterte read from the resolution submitted by the task force, with the premise that he would turn the resolution into an executive order to make it enforceable.
A health advisory pamphlet will be also given to the OFWs upon their departure from the Philippines. 
The Philippines had imposed a travel ban on China and its administrative regions Hong Kong and Macau after the cases of COVID-19 – the disease caused by 2019-nCoV – started spreading worldwide.
The Philippines already allowed OFWs to return to their jobs in Macau and Hong Kong on February 18. 
Wuhan City, the capital of Hubei province in China, is the epicenter of the new disease which has infected more than 80,700 people and killed at least 3,169. 
As of Thursday afternoon, the Philippines has confirmed 52 cases of COVID-19, two of which were fatal.

MANILA, Philippines – San Miguel Alab Pilipinas has asked the ASEAN Basketball League to suspend operations amid the worsening COVID-19 pandemic, per a statement by team owner Charlie Dy on Thursday, March 12. 
Alab is joined by 3 Chinese teams, namely Hong Kong Eastern, Formosa Dreamers of Taiwan and the Macau Black Bears, in asking the league to stand down amid the global health crisis.
“With the World Health Organization declaring COVID-19 as a pandemic, Alab Pilipinas wishes to put the safety of our fans and our team first,” the statement read. 
“Since the ABL is a regional league and travel will be difficult and risky, Alab Pilipinas together with Hong Kong Eastern, Macau Black Bears, and Formosa Dreamers deem it appropriate to request the ABL to follow the NBA and other sporting leagues in suspending our season.”
Macau, Hong Kong and Formosa have all posted similarly-worded statements on their Facebook pages.
The Philippine team has not played a game since February 23 as the league underwent a ravaging chain of postponements for multiple teams involved due to the COVID scare.
However, some teams have continued to play amid the health crisis including the Singapore Slingers, whose import reportedly boarded a plane with a COVID-positive individual. (READ: ABL import quarantined due to coronavirus scare)
Incidentally, they played the league’s most recent game last March 6.
“Alab Pilipinas believes that our fans and supporters will understand this move as it is for the best interest of everyone to take precaution,” Dy’s statement continued.
“Many experts have shared that social distancing is the best way to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 and we wish to take part of this solution.”

MANILA, Philippines – President Rodrigo Duterte suspended classes in all levels and government work in the executive branch for one month or until April 12, in a bid to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus in the Philippines. 
Duterte announced the measure in a televised public address on Thursday night, March 12.
The measure was based on the recommendation of the Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases, which met earlier on Thursday to discuss urgent measures to combat the coronavirus crisis.
The President read from the resolution submitted by the task force, with the premise that he would turn the resolution into an executive order to make it enforceable.
What to expect: Schools are covered by the pronouncement, but all students will still be made to continue their educational requirements during the one-month period.  
The latest move is an expansion of Duterte's earlier pronouncement to suspend classes in the mega-city from March 10 to 14. 
Suspension of classes and work in government will take effect on Sunday, March 15.
Local government units outside the National Capital Region may exercise “sound discretion” on determining whether or not to suspend classes in their areas. If they choose to do so, local officials must ensure students will continue to fulfill academic requirements and remain in their homes for the measure to be effective. 
For government work in the executive branch, suspension will likewise be in place for a period of 30 days, though agencies may form skeletal workforces to ensure government services continue. Only offices in Metro Manila are covered by the order. 
Health and emergency services are not covered by the pronouncement, and will continue in full operation. 
Legislative and judicial offices are ""encouraged"" to adopt the policy. 
What about workers in the private sector? The task force encouraged all private business in Metro Manila to observe flexible working arrangements. The labor department earlier issued guidelines for these arrangements. 
However, all manufacturing, retail, and service establishments were advised to remain operational, provided employers put in place strict social distancing measures.  
Why this matters. Sweeping measures set in place were drafted by a technical advisory group led by infectious disease experts to quell the spread of the virus in the Philippines. 
Duterte on Monday, March 9, earlier declared a state of public health emergency after the health officials announced more confirmed coronavirus cases, including the first case of local transmission in the Philippines. 
The Philippines has recorded at least 52 confirmed coronavirus cases as of Thursday. Two people have died.

The governor noted in his order that the national government has already reported the rise of locally transmitted cases of COVID-19 in the country and that President Rodrigo Duterte has  declared a state of a public health emergency.
For private schools, the suspension of classes is under the discretion of the school administrators, Bimbo Miraflor, provincial public information officer, said.
For Negros Oriental, aside from the confirmed case, 3 persons are still under investigation, while 20 persons are under monitoring, he said.
He said the three PUIs are improving, while the 20 PUMs have a travel history in Hong Kong, China, and South Korea.
Commitment
Miraflor said that provincial officials also met with the administrators of the 3 private hospitals and one public hospital in the province on Thursday, March 12.
During the meeting, the hospitals committed to help the provincial government in case there will be a surge of patients, he said. The hospitals committed around 60 beds should there be additional cases, he added.
Hospital officials of Silliman University Medical Center and ACE Dumaguete Doctors Hospital have also talked regarding the alleged non-disclosure of the condition of the confirmed patient by the latter.
Miraflor said, “there was a shaking of hand after and they are all professionals.”
In a statement on Thursday, ACE Dumaguete Doctors said that on the dawn of March 10, the patient deteriorated and that his family insisted he be transferred to another healthcare institution.
The statement said they communicated with various medical personnel of the other healthcare institution to facilitate the transfer, adding that ACE Dumaguete Doctors did not hide anything when the patient was transferred.
It added that before the result of the throat swab was released, the hospital has already taken all measures and followed the Department of Health guidelines and protocol to isolate, contain the spread, and limit exposure to its health workers.
“It is understandable that this incident has created fear and anxiety among Dumagueteneous and Negrenses. Moving forward, ACE Dumaguete Doctors would like to assure the public that we will continue to strictly adhere with DOH guidelines and protocol regarding patient care,” the statement said. – Rappler.com "

Gaya ng ating panata, patuloy ang pagdaloy ng makabuluhang impormasyon mula sa Tanggapan ng Pangalawang Pangulo. Patuloy ang pagkonsulta natin sa mga eksperto. Patuloy ang ating pagsubaybay sa nagbabagong situwasyon ukol sa COVID-19, at patuloy ang ating mga rekomendasyon at panawagan.
Sinabi na ng World Health Organization: May mga katangian ng isang pandemic ang pandaigdigang situwasyon. Ibig sabihin, kumalat na ang virus sa iba’t ibang bansa. Sa pagkakataong ito, kailangan kong idiin: Panahon nang ipatupad ang areglong work-from-home. Huwag na nating ipilit pumasok pa sa opisina ang ating mga empleyado, maliban na lang ang mga nakatutok sa pagpapaabot ng kaukulang serbisyo na maaaring umampat sa pagkalat ng virus. Hindi sapat ang four-day workweek lang; hanapin natin ang mga alternatibong paraan para ipagpatuloy ang inyong operasyon. Kung talagang kailangan, magpatupad na lamang tayo ng skeletal staffing sa ating mga tanggapan. Walang dahilan na maibilad pa sa peligro ang sino man, lalo pa’t may dalang dagdag na panganib para sa lahat ang bawat bagong makakasagap ng sakit na ito. (READ: WHO labels coronavirus a 'pandemic' as Europe scrambles to contain it)
Malinaw ang posisyon ng mga eksperto: Social distancing ang isa sa mga pinakamabisang paraan para maampat ang pagkalat ng virus. Paraan din ito para hindi ma-overload ang ating mga sistemang pangkalusugan. Bawat sandaling mapabagal ang pagkalat ng virus ay sandaling naibibigay natin sa mga eksperto upang makahanap ng bakuna at lunas sa sakit na ito. Kaya nga kailangan nating idiin at ulit-ulitin ang panawagan para sa work-from-home arrangement. (READ: LIST: Philippine government officials under quarantine for coronavirus risks)
Ukol naman sa mga testing kits: Madaliin na natin ang pag-aambagan upang makapag-produce at maprocure na ang mga ito sa lalong madaling panahon. Tukuyin na agad ang kinakailangang pondo, ang pagkukunan nito, at ang pinakamabilis na paraan para ma-source ang mga kits. Ilabas na ang mga karampatang atas. Hindi ngayon ang panahon para magpahadlang sa mga alitan at burukrasya.
Nasa disaster mindset dapat tayo ngayon. Nananawagan tayo sa mga ahensya ng gobyerno, partikular ang mga frontliners: Pandayin, linawin, isiwalat, at ipatupad na ang mga karampatang protocols para sa mga apektado. Maging ispesipiko rin sa mga hakbang nilang gagawin sakaling kumalat ang sakit sa mga high-density areas, lalo na sa mga lugar na maraming maralita. Marami sa ating kababayan ang nakaasa sa pagpasok araw-araw para may maihain sa kanilang hapag. Ipaabot natin sa kanila ang financial assistance at iba pang ayuda, lalo na para sa mga mapipilitang lumiban sa trabaho at mawawalan ng kita dahil sa suliraning ito.
Isadiwa natin ang layuning “protect the vulnerable.” Gaya ng lagi, ang mga mahihirap ang pinakaapektado sa mga ganitong pagkakataon. Siguruhin natin na angkop ang pansin at pagpapahalagang maipapaabot sa kanila.
Alam po natin: Marami sa ating mga kababayan ang walang sapat na salapi para magpatingin sa mga pribadong ospital. Sa harap nito, dapat na ring tukuyin, italaga, at ipaalam sa publiko ang mga pampublikong ospital na kakayaning tumanggap ng mga may malalang sintomas. Ayon sa mga konsultasyon sa DOH, hindi pa aabot sa 400 ang pinagsamang mga isolation rooms at negative pressure facilities sa mga pampublikong ospital. Maganda na rin po sigurong kumilos ang pambansang pamahaalan para makapagset-up ng mga temporary isolation facilities. Bukod sa mga aparato at kagamitan para sa treatment, siguruhin din nating sapat ang protective equipment ng ating mga frontliner sa public health sector.
Dadami pa po ang bilang ng mga maysakit. Hindi ito haka-haka; nakabase ito sa mga pag-aaral at karanasan ng ibang bansa. Kailangang maging agaran ang pagkilos upang masigurong sapat ang mga kagamitan, sapat ang mga healthcare workers, at sapat ang mga tanggapan para matugunan ang posibilidad ng pagdami ng mga mahahawa.
Alam din nating pinag-aaralan na ng mga awtoridad ang posibilidad ng isang lock-down sa National Capital Region. Naniniwala tayo: Magiging mabisa lamang ang anumang lockdown kung mayroong sapat na probisyon sa mga komunidad, lalo na para sa mga mahihirap.
Tiyakin din sana ng gobyerno na sapat ang mga pangunahing pangangailangan, tulad ng pagkain sa food banks at mga gamit para sa sanitasyon. Ngayon pa lang, dapat nang mag-imbak ang mga komunidad, ayon sa isang pambansang direksyon, ng mga basic needs. Isa itong paraan para hindi na dumagdag ang pangamba ng ating mga kababayan: Kung alam nating magiging sapat ang supplies sa ating mga komunidad, papanatag ang ating loob, at hindi na natin kakailanganing lumabas pa.
Iisang komunidad tayo; walang paraang malagpasan ito kundi ang isaisip ang kapakanan ng lahat. Huwag makipag-unahan sa mga ospital at testing center; kung may sintomas tulad ng lagnat at ubo, mag-self-quarantine at obserbahan ang sarili ng dalawang araw bago sumugod sa ospital. Hindi rin po nakakatulong ang panic buying at hoarding. Ang bawat bote ng alkohol na iniimbak natin at di nagagamit ay isang boteng ipinagkakait natin sa ating mga kapitbahay. Sa huli, kung magkasakit sila, lahat tayo madadamay, gaano man karami ang maiimbak nating mga gamit o pagkain. (READ: Hoarding, overpricing would lead to criminal charges, warns DTI)
Mulat tayo na kakailanganin ng sakripisyo upang matugunan ang anumang suliranin. Pero ito ang paraan para masiguro ang kaligtasan ng mas nakararami. Nais kong ipaalala sa lahat: Narito pa rin ang pambansang pamunuan, sa kabila ng mga self-quarantine measures na isinasagawa ng ilan sa amin. Makinig at magkaisa tayo; sumubaybay sa mga pahayag at bulletin tulad nito, at sundin ang payo ng mga eksperto. Patuloy nating bigyang-pugay ang mga frontliners; suportahan natin sila, at tiyaking sapat ang kanilang kagamitan. Personal ko silang pinapasalamatan sa pahayag na ito. Huwag po sana kayong panghinaan ng loob. Sa bawat araw na lumilipas, lumalalim ang pag-unawa ng mga siyentista sa sakit na ito, at lumalapit ang pandaigdigang komunidad sa isang solusyon.
Inuulit ko po: Maiiwasan ang pagkakasakit. Maaampat ang pagkalat ng virus. Kaya nating pangasiwaan ang situwasyon. Maging malinaw lamang tayo sa pag-iisip, kalmado sa pagkilos, at may paninindigan sa pambansang direksyon.
Pilipino tayo; sanay tayo sa sakuna.
Palagi, sa harap ng ganitong uring krisis din natin naipapakita ang pagbabayanihang diwa ng ating pagka-Pilipino. Hindi tayo napapaluhod ng bagyo; nakakabangon tayo mula sa mga lindol. Mas malakas pa rin ang Pilipino sa COVID-19; kayang daigin ng ating pagkakaisa ang suliraning ito. Pilipino tayo, at sama-sama nating malalagpasan ito. – Rappler.com "

MANAGING THE OUTBREAK. Vice President Leni Robredo addresses the public through her Facebook account on March 12, 2020. Screenshot from Robredo's Facebook account 
MANILA, Philippines – In a Facebook video at past 6 pm on Thursday, March 12, Vice President Leni Robredo urged companies to begin implementing a work-from-home scheme for its employees now that the novel coronavirus outbreak has turned into a pandemic. 
She also asked the Duterte administration to prioritize protecting the country's most vulnerable sectors.
“Sinabi na ng World Health Organization: May mga katangian ng isang pandemic ang pandaigdigang situwasyon. Ibig sabihin, kumalat na ang virus sa iba’t ibang bansa. Sa pagkakataong ito, kailangan kong idiin: Panahon nang ipatupad ang areglong work-from-home,” Robredo said in a public address ahead of President Rodrigo Duterte's scheduled coronavirus-related announcement also on Thursday.
(This is what the World Health Organization said: The circumstance of the global situation point to a pandemic. That means the virus already spread to different countries. I want to emphasize now: It’s time we implement a work-from-home scheme.)
The Vice President said companies could instead have a skeletal workforce to keep vital operations ongoing. Otherwise, there’s no reason to put their employees’ lives at risk. 
“Walang dahilan na maibilad pa sa peligro ang sino man, lalo pa’t may dalang dagdag na panganib para sa lahat ang bawat bagong makakasagap ng sakit na ito,” Robredo said. (There is no reason to risk the lives of anyone, especially now that there is an added risk because of this new disease.)
The Vice President released the video to help allay the public’s fear over the growing number of 2019-nCoV cases in the Philippines. She addressed the public ahead of President Rodrigo Duterte’s scheduled announcement on the COVID-19 situation on Thursday evening.
So far, a total of 52 patients tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by 2019-nCoV. Two cases already died.  
‘Protect the vulnerable' 
Robredo called on the Duterte government to follow a “protect the vulnerable” mindset during the health crisis.
She said the administration should ensure that poor Filipinos will have easy access to government hospitals should they begin to show symptoms of COVID-19. If the government decides to impose any lockdown, then there must be enough supplies available for the poor as well.
“Isadiwa natin ang layuning ‘protect the vulnerable.’ Gaya ng lagi, ang mga mahihirap ang pinakaapektado sa mga ganitong pagkakataon. Siguruhin natin na angkop ang pansin at pagpapahalagang maipapaabot sa kanila,” Robredo said.  
(May we follow a policy of ‘protect the vulnerable.’ As always, the poor will be the most affected in times like this. Let us make sure we give them the response due to them.) 
The Vice President advised the public to stop panic-buying and refrain from trooping to hospitals if they are not exhibiting severe symptoms of the disease.  
“Iisang komunidad tayo. Walang paraang malagpasan ito kundi ang isaisip ang kapakanan ng lahat (We are one community. There is no other way to get through but to think about everyone’s welfare),” said the Vice Preident. 
Robredo previously called on the Duterte administration to be “very transparent” in its response to the COVID-19 outbreak, as doing so would help dispel speculations of alleged “underreporting"" of positive cases.
Health Secretary Francisco Duque III admitted that “problems” in their reporting system led to the delayed disclosure of 2019-nCoV patients’ details. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – The Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) warned that criminal charges would be filed against those suspected of overpricing and hoarding medical devices and products like alcohol, medicines, and face masks.
Trade Secretary Ramon Lopez said on Thursday, March 12, that he recommended to President Rodrigo Duterte the issuance of an executive order, arming the DTI, along with the Philippine National Police and the National Bureau of Investigation, with ""visitorial powers"" to quickly address profiteering.

Under the Consumer Act or Republic Act (RA) No. 7394, overpricing may be considered as an unfair and unconscionable sales act or practice since it involves taking advantage of consumers in this time of need. The Price Act or RA No. 7581 also considers this as an act of profiteering.
""Both of these laws provide criminal and administrative penalties and sanctions. Under the Consumer Act, if found to have committed an unfair and unconscionable sales act or practice, an administrative sanction of up to P300,000 may be imposed and/or imprisonment of up to one year,"" the DTI said.

MANILA, Philippines – President Rodrigo Duterte’s foreign trips will be suspended amid fears over the continued increase of novel coronavirus cases worldwide, the Presidential Security Group (PSG) announced on Thursday, March 12. 
The PSG said the measure was based on the recommendation of the Department of Health and would apply ""especially to countries where there are confirmed cases of COVID-19,"" the disease caused by the coronavirus. 
Duterte was tested for the coronavirus on Thursday afternoon, after several of his Cabinet members, including officials in his inner circle, announced they would isolate themselves following contact with a confirmed COVID-19 patient.
Presidential Spokesperson Salvador Panelo said Duterte’s testing was only a “precautionary measure” and the President was not showing symptoms as of posting. 
Duterte’s former aide-turned-Senator Bong Go, who got tested with Duterte, said results will be available in 48 hours or on Saturday, March 14. 
Experts have warned adults 60 years old and above to take extra precaution against the disease as they were more vulnerable to it.

CAGAYAN DE ORO CITY, Philippines – The first COVID-19 patient of Mindanao has been confined at the Northern Mindanao Medical Center (NMMC) here since March 3  but was just confirmed as positive of the disease by the Department of Health (DOH) on Wednesday, March 11.
COVID-19 is the illness caused by the novel coronavirus.
DoH Northern Mindanao (Region 10) Director Adriano Suba-an said that the patient was a 54-year-old male who was a resident of Pasig City since 2017 and went back here to return to his home in Lanao del Sur.
Suba-an said that the patient decided to come home to seek treatment here which resulted in his confinement in a hospital in Iligan City.
""His symptoms started last February 24, 2020 and was admitted at a hospital in lligan City last March 3, 2020 for pneumonia. He was subsequently referred to Northern Mindanao Medical Center (NMMC) on March 8, 2020. Specimens were taken and sent to the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM). On March 11, 2020, the result was confirmed to be positive for SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of Coronavirus Disease - 2019 (COVID-19),"" Suba-an said.
Suba-an said that the patient was being monitored by infectious diseases specialists according to the latest WHO Guidelines.
""The DOH is conducting contact tracing and heightened disease surveillance through the Barangay Health Emergency Response Team (BHERT) in the community and through Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI) surveillance in the hospital,"" Suba-an said.
Dr. Jose Chan, NMMC Chief of Hospital said: ""This is a viral infection so the usual protocol for treating viral infection are observed, for now it is about supportive (medicine).""
Chan said that the patient is being supported by ventilator since he was complaining of shortness of breath.
Local transmission
Chan said that the patient may have contracted the virus in Pasig City where he lived since 2017.
Suba-an said, the patient ""has no history of travel abroad, maybe transmitted locally in the National Capital Region where he works before,"" Suba-an said.
""When he came home, he was immediately brought to the hospital and isolated accordingly and referred also to NMMC to be properly managed as well,"" Suba-an added.
Suba-an added that the country cannot afford to have a 2nd generation of local transmission.
 
 
""We are preparing other areas in Region 10 as well for what could possibly happen,"" Suba-an said.
""What we are avoiding is people to start overcrowding hospital because they want medical consultation or laboratory test. Let's simplify, if you have symptoms like fever, cough, or diarrhea, but you have no exposure or travel to places with the virus, do not go to NMMC, seek consultation to your regular physician,"" Suba-an said.
""Now if you have no symptoms but you have travel history to those with confirmed case, now do not go to the ER of NMMC, do self quarantine,"" Suba-an added.
""Now if you started feeling something and you have exposure, then that's the time you really have to go to the ER to seek consultation and laboratory testing, so we can prioritize and triage who are our priority,"" Suba-an said.
Suba-an said reminded the public that virus is transmitted through droplets and not airborne. ""We enjoin the public to continue practicing handwashing regularly, avoid crowds and wild animals, never cough without a handkerchief or tissue,  wear a mask if you are sick or in healthcare settings, seek early consultation. – Rappler.com "

St Agnes Academy (SAA), Albay’s oldest Catholic school, also suspended classes from grade school to high school on Friday, March 13, until March 25, as a precautionary measure.
“We have decided to quarantine the grades 11 to 12 HUMMS (Humanities and Social Sciences Strand) and teacher-chaperones who went to Manila and visited the Senate.

MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – Investors clearly wanted out as the Philippine Stock Exchange index (PSEi) fell over 10% on Thursday, March 12, amid fears of the novel coronavirus' economic impact.
This triggered the circuit breaker or the 15-minute trading halt for investors to compose themselves.
This is the second time that the circuit breaker was implemented. The first instance was on October 27, 2008, during the global financial crisis.
The PSEi eventually closed at 5,736 on Thursday, down by 9.7%. This is the lowest percentage drop since October 27, 2008, when the index fell by 12.3%.
Thursday's close was also the lowest since December 2012, when it fell to 5,636.
The most actively traded stocks were SM Prime (down 11.2%), Ayala Land (down 11.3%), SM Investments (down 12.2%), BDO (down 11.8%), and Ayala Corporation (down 6.3%).
If you invested in the PSEi on the first trading day of the year, you have lost over P2,000 per share you bought.
The broader all shares fell by 8.3% to 3,492.
All other subindices were also in the red, with mining and oil suffering the steepest decline at 12.8%. Property, holding firms, and financials slipped by over 10%.
Luis Limlingan of Regina Capital said the next support level may be at 5,300. A support is a price level where the decline in stock prices is expected to pause as investors start buying the losing shares.
After the local bourse closed, the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the Philippines rose further from 49 to 52.
Japhet Tantiangco of Philstocks said the rising number of confirmed cases weighed down on the market.
""We're already seeing the initial effects in the form of weakening tourism, job losses, and office shutdowns. And things could get worse since the disease has no cure yet and is not contained,"" Tantiangco said.

MANILA, Philippines – The Philippine Sports Commission (PSC) ordered the evacuation of national athletes in its facilities as the coronavirus was declared a pandemic on Thursday, March 12.
Except for the athletes still preparing for qualifying tournaments for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, all national team members in senior and junior levels have been ordered to go home as all dormitories need to be vacated as part of the PSC's prevention plan.
PSC declared its two majors faciilites – Rizal Memorial Sports Complex (RMSC) in Manila and the Philsports Complex in Pasig – under restricted access. 
""We have to be pro-active in this situation and take these hard decisions for the safety of our athletes and employees,"" said PSC chairman William ""Butch"" Ramirez during the management committee meeting on Thursday, March 12.
Some of the national team members billeted in the dormitories are from boxing, weightlifting, muay, athletics, fencing, and Paralympic sports. 
Ramirez also instructed national sports associations to assess and give advice how to proceed with the athletes' training and cope with the spiking confirmed coronavirus cases in the Philippines. 
As for airport arrivals, athletes coming back to the country from competitions will be received at the airport by PSC personnel to assist them back to their respective residences.
They will be allowed to do preventive rest and monitoring for 14 days at the RMSC North Tower under the supervision of the medical team of the agency.
Foreign travel, though, will be suspended for all athletes, coaches, officials and employees from March 14 to April 14  to lower the risk of contracting the illness or spreading it locally as announced in an advisory from PSC commissioner officer-in-charge Celia Kiram.  
""Only those who get an endorsement to proceed from Olympics chef de mission Nonong Araneta will be allowed to travel overseas,"" said Ramirez. (READ: PH travel ban due to virus 'top concern' in Tokyo 2020 Olympics preparation)
The same advisory also informed that all bookings and reservations for the use of its facilities are revoked or canceled. 
It also reiterated a previous announcement that PSC projects, programs, and events including those sponsored and organized in cooperation with NSAs or LGUs are postponed indefinitely.
The agency has also advised the public that work is suspended on Friday, March 13, to give way to sanitation efforts to be undertaken by its Operations Department.
PSC chief of staff Marc Edward Velasco disclosed that the agency’s medical and scientific athletes services will issue self-quarantine guidelines for athletes and employees.
As of Wednesday, March 11, the Philippines has recorded a total of 49 confirmed cases of COVID-19.
The novel coronavirus has infected more than 118,000 people and killed over 4,200 across 110 countries. Still, more than 61,000 people have recovered from the virus. – Rappler.com

MANILA, Philippines – The Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) on Thursday, March 12, imposed a nationwide price freeze on basic necessities amid the spread of the novel coronavirus.
""The DTI is closely coordinating with other government agencies, manufacturers, and retailers of basic goods to ensure availability and continuous supply in the market,"" said Trade Secretary Ramon Lopez.
""Retailers are reminded that there should be no price movement on these goods while the price freeze is in effect."" (READ: Novel coronavirus: What makes an outbreak a pandemic?)
Basic goods that are under the jurisdiction of the DTI include canned fish and other marine products, locally manufactured instant noodles, bottled water, bread, processed milk, coffee, candles, laundry soap and detergent, and salt.
The Department of Agriculture will monitor prices of basic agricultural goods such as rice, corn, cooking oil, marine products, fresh eggs, fresh meat (pork, beef, and poultry), fresh milk, fresh vegetables, root crops, sugar, and fresh fruits.
Essential drugs are under the Department of Health, while firewood and charcoal are monitored by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources. Household liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and kerosene are under the Department of Energy.
""All these basic goods are placed under price freeze for 60 days with the exception of household LPG and kerosene whose prices shall be frozen for 15 days only as provided in the Amended Price Act or [Republic Act No.] 10623,"" the DTI said.
Trade Undersecretary Ruth Castelo also assured the public that they continue to intensify monitoring of the prices of basic goods in the market, including face masks.

Business establishments found to have violated the price freeze would face a fine ranging from P5,000 to P1 million, and imprisonment up to 10 years. – Rappler.com "

It is now accurate to say that the country is facing a crisis amid the COVID-19 outbreak. From having only 3 cases last week, it has now jumped to 33 – and counting. From the claim made by the health secretary himself that the Philippines was a model country for COVID-19 response, it is now a country that has just declared a state of public health emergency. 
As it seems, the Philippine health sector is ill-prepared for the COVID-19 outbreak. This is not surprising after budget cuts, corruption allegations, politicization of health governance, and the political leadership’s focus on security – going after opposition politicians, activists, and poor drug offenders. 
Health services deteriorating even before COVID-19
Late last year, it was reported that the health budget was cut by 10 billion in the 2020 general appropriations. This is despite emerging threats of measles, polio, and dengue outbreaks, which could be serious health emergencies. Last year too, there have been reports that health services in the Philippines have become more unaffordable and inaccessible to citizens. 
It is therefore not a surprise that the first Global Health Security Index showed that the Philippines scored zero in a total of 5 health security indicators, namely: (1) linking public health and security authorities, (2) communication with healthcare workers during public health emergencies, (3) dual-use research and culture of responsible science, (4) biosafety, and (5) joint external evaluations and performance of veterinary services.  
Yesterday, Duque admitted that the inadequacy of supplies and test kits negatively affects the country’s ability to effectively respond to COVID-19. Lack of proper and up-to-date health facilities and equipment, as well as serious understaffing, are putting a strain on the health care system. 
The estimated ratio of health care workers in the Philippines is 1 doctor per 33,000 patients and 1 hospital bed for every 1,121 patients. This is way lower than the recommended 1 doctor per 1,000 people and 5 beds per 1,000 people ratio by the World Health Organization. (READ: Philippines to borrow more than planned to combat coronavirus impact)
An Al Jazeera report summarized it well: “The already low health budget was further cut resulting in less (sic) medical supplies, poorly maintained medical equipment, and understaffing. Even before COVID-19, the public health systems was (sic) already deteriorating."" As it seems so far, how the government has responded to the COVID-19 outbreak is real-time evidence of why the Philippines scored 0 in the said Global Security Index. 
While we are not surprised by the news about the deteriorating quality of health services in the country, we are nonetheless puzzled. This is because the health budget was supposedly benefiting immensely from a so-claimed successful fiscal reform called the Sin Tax Law that has added a whopping P348.2 billion to the health budget since 2014.  
Sin tax’s significant addition to the health budget 
In 2012, the Sin Tax Law (or RA 10351) was enacted (1) to generate additional revenue for health and (2) curb smoking and alcohol consumption by simplifying and increasing the excise tax system on tobacco and alcohol. (READ: Duterte signs new taxes on alcohol, e-cigarettes into law)
Generally, all assessments show that the law has achieved its intended objectives. Positive gains have been reported by government and civil society so far on the impact of the sin tax. There has been an increase in the health budget due to sin tax. The DOH reports that 43% of its budget in 2018 was contributed by the sin tax. 
Increased revenues from the Sin Tax Law in 2013 have facilitated an unprecedented 57.3% increase in the 2014 national health budget, from P53.23 billion in 2013 to P83.72 billion in 2014. The bulk of the additional budget (P22.7 billion) was allocated for PhilHealth insurance coverage of the poorest families, benefitting around 24 million Filipinos. As a result, according to reports, there are more Filipinos, especially indigents, covered by PhilHealth.
The sin tax has been hailed as an effective tool to support health or a successful fiscal policy to achieve improved health outcomes. The Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids (CFTK) concludes in its 2017 study that, “The Sin Tax Law has successfully reached its purpose of significantly simplifying the tax system, quickly reducing tobacco use, and raising high incremental revenue needed to fund universal health coverage – especially among the poor – as well as additional revenue for health and economic development programs.” 
Data from the 2019 Sin Tax Law Annual Report shows that 55% of the DOH budget comes from sin tax revenues alone. This seems to mean that the decline in the health budget from the national government (on top of sin tax) has been dramatically decreasing, kept afloat only by funds from sin tax.
Funds from sin tax should have helped Philippines prepare for COVID-19
Revenues from sin tax are earmarked for specific programs: 15% to LGUs, 85% to DOH and PhilHealth. From that 85%, 80% goes to universal health care (UHC) expenditures (i.e. PhilHealth coverage; strengthening of preventive health programs towards attainment of MDGs/SDGs; health awareness programs; and implementation research to support UHC). On the other hand, 20% is meant for medical assistance; health facilities enhancement program (HFEP); and service delivery networks. 
Some of the programs where sin tax revenues are supposed to go to are (1) health emergency preparedness and response, (2) epidemiology and surveillance (3) prevention and control of other infectious disease, and (4) health facilities enhancement program (HFEP) that primarily aims to upgrade health facilities and equipment. These are the very programs needed by the Philippine health sector in preparing well for health emergencies like COVID-19.  
Source: Department of Health. (2019) Sin Tax Law Incremental Revenue for Health Annual Report 2019.
The deteriorating state of the public health sector, despite increases in its budget from a fiscal reform measure (such as sin tax), invites important empirical questions: What happened to the health sector? Where did the health budget from sin tax go? 
An emerging lesson is that the success of fiscal reform measures (such as sin tax) are only certain to be true once tested. Its development impact must be seen and proven at the service delivery or citizen-beneficiary level. Fiscal reform outcomes can only come into fruition, such as the impact of sin tax on health services, if budget increases are ensured to have resulted in better quality received by citizens. This needs a monitoring and assessment system from the national level (budget allocation) down to the beneficiary level. 
Without a working multi-level accountability system on public health service delivery, any additional budget (note: DOH/DOF is asking for loans to effectively respond to COVID-19) could just go down the drain without making lives better for Filipinos. Worse is if the success claims will catch us off-guard. 
In the case of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak, one indicative evidence of the success of the Sin Tax Law should have been a health system responding well to the COVID-19 emergency, providing quality health services and protection for Filipinos now that they need it most. Unfortunately, COVID-19 has unnecessarily caught us off-guard. – Rappler.com

MANILA, Philippines – The Commission on Higher Education (CHED) called on state universities and colleges to prepare for possible community-level transmission of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. 
In a memorandum order released on Wednesday, March 10, CHED chairman Prospero de Vera III reiterated that schools should have protocols in place to stop the spread of the novel coronavirus within the campus in coordination with the Department of Health. 
These include creating screening procedures for symptomatic students, faculty, staff and administrators; preparing health clinics to accommodate and isolate patients potentially infected with the novel coronavirus; and performing decontamination and disinfection of buildings in schools. (READ :DepEd says proceeding with graduation ceremony 'up to school's discretion')
President Rodrigo Duterte suspended classes in all levels in Metro Manila from March 10 to 14 following the spike of confirmed cases in the Philppines. 
Schools are advised to coordinate with their affiliated training establishments for any adjustment on training hours; and consider alternative modes for on-the-job training, practicum and internships. (READ: How Metro schools continue lessons amid coronavirus threat)
But based on the assessment in their areas, all schools should be flexible in adjusting the academic calendar, foregoing other curricular activities for the semester and exercising discretion to possibly postpone graduation ceremonies.
CHED also advised schools to report the status of their students, faculty and staff. These include those who are now abroad, specially in areas affected by the virus.
Identified cases of COVID-19 within the campus should immediately be coordinated with DOH regional office or local government offices. 
“All plans and decisions by the Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) should be focused on ensuring the safety of all students, faculty, staff and administrators,” CHED added in its memorandum. – Rappler.com  "

MANILA, Philippines – Several Cabinet members of the Duterte government are placing themselves under quarantine in an effort to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus, while serving as the country’s top officials closest to President Rodrigo Duterte. 
On Wednesday night, March 11, Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III was the first Cabinet official to announce he would undergo self-quarantine after he shook the hand of a patient who tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.  
Transportation Secretary Arthur Tugade followed suit and announced he would also undergo self-quarantine after he was ""exposed"" to a patient confirmed to have the coronavirus last week. 
Department of Public Works and Highways Secretary Mark Villar also announced on Thursday, March 12, that he would be isolating himself, as he was with Dominguez and Tugade last week.  
All officials were at the North Luzon Expressway (NLEX) Harbor Link inspection ceremony last March 5. (READ: Coronavirus exposure prompts PH economic officials to self-quarantine)
Aside from this, Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea confirmed to Rappler he would also place himself under quarantine. He said he may have had ""possible exposure"" to a patient confirmed to have the coronavirus but that he had no symptoms as of posting. 
""I just want to be sure,"" he said.
Department of Education Secretary Leonor Briones likewise announced she would self-quarantine as an ""extra precautionary measure"" after some education officials were ""exposed"" to a confirmed COVID-19 patient last February 28 and March 5. 
All officials were showing no symptoms of the illness as of posting. Medialdea gave assurances they would continue to work and that the Palace was exploring telecommuting options.  
Efforts of Cabinet members to isolate themselves come as Duterte is scheduled to be tested for COVID-19 on Thursday. 
Presidential Spokesperson Salvador Panelo gave assurances the President was not showing symptoms of the disease and was only getting tested as a precautionary measure to ensure he was ""fit and healthy to perform"" his duties. 
Experts earlier said that older adults with preexisting health conditions were more vulnerable to the coronavirus, particularly those aged over 60-years-old. Duterte, 74, earlier claimed he suffered from a slew of medical conditions that include myasthenia gravis, Buerger's disease, Barrett's esophagus, and ""spinal issues,"" among others.
As of Thursday, the Philippines has so far recorded 49 confirmed coronavirus cases, two of whom have died. – Rappler.com "

With the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the Philippines rising nearly tenfold (5 to 49) in just 6 days, it’s clear the disease won’t go away any time soon.
Data suggest there should be a lot more cases by now. When there were only 3 confirmed cases in the Philippines, a statistical model developed by The Economist predicted there should’ve been about 200 already.
The Department of Health (DOH) admitted to “unintentional” underreporting of cases due to the inadequacy of testing kits.
On March 7, President Rodrigo Duterte reportedly agreed to declare a public health emergency, but he formally announced it two days later. On March 11, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III admitted he himself should’ve declared a public health emergency sooner.
COVID-19 is sickening not just Filipinos but huge swaths of the Philippine economy as well. What can the Duterte government do to ward off an impending economic slump?
Slump
The National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) foresees that our nation’s income, as measured by gross domestic product (GDP) will grow slower this year.
Growth might even fall to as low as 5.5%, well below the 6.5% target.
Tourism will take a big hit: lost revenues there could be as large as P93-187 billion. If the outbreak lasts till June, as many as 1.42 million passengers will not arrive and some 30,000-60,000 jobs will likely be destroyed.
But other sectors will fall sick as well.
A new study by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) shows the Philippine economy may lose somewhere between P34 billion and P99 billion, not just on account of weaker tourism but also weaker trade, business services, manufacturing, transportation, and even agriculture (see Figure 1 for a breakdown).
In the event of a “significant outbreak,” ADB thinks our economic losses may even balloon to a whopping P280 billion. This will hack away a full 1.67 percentage points off GDP growth – more than a quarter of our growth in 2018.

Figure 1.
 
All in all, NEDA and ADB's numbers both suggest growth this year is set to reach its lowest level since 2011.
Even before this, growth has already been declining steadily since 2016. (READ: Why did Philippine growth drop to an 8-year low?)
Demand and supply
Duterte’s economic team is not helpless. But they will have to go beyond textbook remedies because COVID-19 is not your run-off-the-mill economic shock.
First, the downturn is obviously induced by a widespread drop in people’s demand for goods and services throughout the economy (also called an “aggregate demand shock”).
Tourists are canceling their flights and hotel bookings. Mallgoers are shunning malls. Students have stayed at home following a weeklong cancellation of classes.
On the other hand, this downturn is caused, too, by a widespread reduction in the economy’s production and, hence, supply of goods and services (also called an “aggregate supply shock”).
Factories and firms around the world, especially in China, are shutting down. Global supply chains are breaking up left and right, impeding our ability to import and export. More and more workers are being told to work at home or, worse, being laid off.
One assistant secretary of the Department of Labor and Employment reported that since February some 66 firms in tourism have already closed down due to reduced tourist arrivals.
Hence, COVID-19 is likely causing a decline in both aggregate demand and aggregate supply. The government must address both with a comprehensive stimulus package.
Stimulus
As for aggregate supply, there’s little Duterte can do to revitalize damaged global supply chains.
But some form of temporary tax relief for cash-strapped businesses, as well as paid sick leaves, wage subsidies, or cash transfers for workers, might work to tide them over – at least until the global economy finds its footing again.
As for aggregate demand, the government can prop it up with a mix of monetary and fiscal policies.
For its part, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) can lower its key policy rate. In doing so, interest rates throughout the economy will also drop, making it more attractive for consumers to take out housing or car loans, and for entrepreneurs to take out business loans.
BSP Governor Benjamin Diokno hinted they’re open to cutting its key policy rate if “things deteriorate.”
By itself, however, monetary policy will not induce people to go out and do business as usual. Hence, it will have to be paired with fiscal policies such as tax cuts or aggressive spending.
Incidentally, the Duterte government is moving to lower corporate income tax rates with the Citira bill, recently certified as urgent by Duterte. But such tax cuts will be implemented over a period of 10 years, and what we need right now is a more immediate stimulus.
Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III said they’ll continue rolling out Build, Build, Build as a way to pump prime the economy. But infrastructure projects also take a while to complete, and until long-standing bottlenecks are ironed out it will not boost demand in the short run.
There is, however, one sector where aggressive spending might help tremendously: our public health system.
Aside from pouring money on much-needed COVID-19 testing kits, government could also employ more frontline hospital workers (doctors, nurses, etc.) and provide for their masks, gloves, overall gowns, and other protective gear. Government might also build more quarantine facilities.
This policy hits two birds with a stone: the health of our people and the economy.
To effectively respond to COVID-19, the DOH said they will need an additional P3.1 billion. But the Treasury said only P1.65 billion was on hand.
I wrote last week that the Duterte administration imprudently allowed their budget deficit (or revenue shortfall) to skyrocket to 6.8% (see Figure 2). That’s the highest deficit since 1998 and way above target. (READ: How the budget deficit exploded under Duterte’s watch)
Secretary Dominguez admitted they expect government revenues to drop this year by as much as P91 billion. This will inevitably raise the deficit further and force us to borrow more.
If only the Duterte government didn’t act squander last year its “fiscal space,” they could have more leg room this year for a COVID-19 stimulus.

Figure 2.
 
Health before wealth
Some experts think an economic stimulus might work best once the epidemic eases.
Therefore, even before the economic managers rummage through their policy toolkit, the first order of business is for them to support efforts of our health agencies to contain COVID-19 and mitigate its impact.
The longer it takes for government to identify cases and implement measures such as quarantines, contact tracing, and social distancing, the higher the risk our hospitals will be overwhelmed and run to the ground.
But we should ask: Is the Duterte government doing enough to contain COVID-19? Do we trust they’ll be able to do it? Are they treating this pandemic seriously?
If you just listen to Duterte’s incoherent and dismissive public statements, you might say no to all of these. Beyond a fiscal deficit, we should address as well a gaping and growing trust deficit. – Rappler.com

MANILA, Philippines – Saudi Arabia on Thursday, March 12, announced it was temporarily suspending flights to and from the Philippines and 38 other countries amid growing fears over the continued increase in coronavirus cases. 
In a statement, the Saudi Ministry of Interior said the measure would cover the Philippines, European Union countries, Switzerland, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Ethiopia, South Sudan, Eritrea, Kenya, Djibouti, and Somalia. 
The Saudi government will suspend the entry of travelers coming directly from these countries or had a history of travel to these areas within the last 14 days. 
Exempted from the travel restrictions were health workers from the Philippines and India, as well as those involved in evacuation, shipping, and trading trips though they would need to take “required precautions.” 
According to an Arab News report, the Saudi government said it was giving 72 hours to all its citizens and permanent residents to return to the Gulf state. Saudi citizens and residents were also banned from traveling to the 38 countries.  
Latest measures taken by the Saudi government widen the scope of earlier restrictions taken to ban tourists from countries, including the Philippines, judged to pose ""a particularly high risk"" of spreading the coronavirus. 
Saudi Arabia had earlier announced the unprecedented decision to ban ""umrah"" pilgrims from visiting Islam's holiest sites to try to contain the spread of the coronavirus. It had also suspended visas for tourists and “umrah” pilgrims visiting from countries where the new virus is a ""danger.""
As of Thursday, Saudi Arabia recorded 54 confirmed COVID-19 cases.

MANILA, Philippines – The Philippines' crucifixion reenactments will be canceled this year as coronavirus cases climb, said authorities in the city where the annual tourist spectacle is held.
About a dozen Catholics regularly have themselves nailed to wooden crosses on Good Friday as penance for their sins. The event attracts thousands of tourists.
This year's rituals were planned for farming villages around San Fernando city, north of the capital Manila on April 10, but local officials have stopped the event to prevent mass gatherings and a potential spread of the virus.
""We are not disrespecting religious beliefs and practices, but we actually are protecting them from the disease that may put them and their family at risk,"" San Fernando Mayor Edwin Santiago said in a statement.
Philippine health authorities said Wednesday, March 11, 49 people have tested positive for the virus in the country, up by 16 from a day earlier. A Chinese traveler, one of the country's earliest cases, later died.
""I'm disappointed,"" said resident Ruben Enaje, who was aiming to be crucified for the 34th straight year as part of a religious vow to atone for his sins, told AFP.
""I talked with the village chairman and he said we should postpone it because of the worries that many foreign tourists might come here and we might get infected if some of them have the virus,"" the 59-year-old added.
Enaje, a decorator, said he still plans to carry a cross across town to fulfil his religious vow.
The coronavirus outbreak has infected more than 118,000 globally with over 4,200 deaths, according to a tally compiled by AFP.

DAVAO CITY, Philippines – Davao City Mayor Sara Duterte has gone on self-quarantine as a precautionary measure against the spread of COVID-19 even if she had no symptoms,  her office said on Thursday, March 12.
The city government said in a statement that President Rodrigo Duterte's daughter signed up as a person under monitoring (PUM) with the Davao City Health Office after one of her staff at her house became unwell. The staff also got listed as a PUM.
Another reason for her decision was that she met Senator Sherwin Gatchalian over lunch in Manila on Wednesday. Sara was in the Senate for the confirmation hearing on her promotion as a reservist military colonel.
Gatchalian and Senator Nancy Binay placed themselves under self-quarantine beginning Wednesday, after they found out that one of the resource persons in a Senate hearing tested positive for COVID-19. The Senate was on lockdown starting Thursday, because of this.
""While Mayor Sara has not suffered from flu-like symptoms, she chose to undergo self-quarantine to protect others if she may be found to be sick in the next few days,"" it added,"" the city government said in a statement released by city information officer Jefry Tupas.

MANILA, Philippines (4th UPDATE) – Some members of President Rodrigo Duterte's economic team are undergoing self-quarantine, following exposure to a patient who tested positive for the novel coronavirus.
These officials include Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III, Budget Secretary Wendel Avisado, and Socioeconomic Planning Secretary Ernesto Pernia, as well as Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) Governor Benjamin Diokno.
Vince Dizon, presidential adviser for flagship programs and projects as well as president of the Bases Conversion and Development Authority, is under self-quarantine as well.
None of them have reported any symptoms, so far.
Dominguez earlier told reporters on Wednesday night, March 11, that he would be imposing self-quarantine, after shaking the hand of a COVID-19 patient last week.
""You may wish to follow suit,"" Dominguez advised beat reporters.
Avisado also placed himself under quarantine after he attended the government's economic cluster meeting last Tuesday, March 10.
""The protocol requires that I go on self-quarantine so I am doing it,"" Avisado told reporters on Thursday.
In a statement on Thursday afternoon, March 12, the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) said Pernia ""has gone on self-quarantine as a precautionary measure,"" even if ""he had no close contact"" with COVID-19 patients.
""The NEDA management is tracing officials and employees who were with the persons confirmed to have tested positive for COVID-19 during two separate meetings held last March 5 and 6, 2020,"" the agency said.
""All concerned NEDA officials and employees who came in close contact with (were within one meter from) the said virus-infected persons were also advised to go on self-quarantine.""
Work at the NEDA Central Office was suspended from Thursday to Friday, March 13, for disinfection and sanitation procedures.
Meanwhile, Diokno also announced on Thursday that he would be isolating himself, as he was with Dominguez and Transportation Secretary Arthur Tugade last week. Tugade is also under self-quarantine.
They were at the North Luzon Expressway (NLEX) Harbor Link inspection ceremony last March 5.
""I am glad to share that I am well and not manifesting any symptoms, although I also decided to go on self-quarantine as a precautionary measure,"" Diokno said in a statement on Thursday.
The BSP also suspended work at its head office and Security Plant Complex from Thursday to Friday for ""thorough preventive sanitation.""
""We have ensured, however, that vital BSP services needed by the financial system continue. Hence, open market operations, PhilPass settlement, as well as the servicing of bank withdrawals are being performed business as usual,"" Diokno added.
The Department of Public Works and Highways likewise said on Thursday that Secretary Mark Villar will go on self-quarantine.
Villar was at the same NLEX Harbor Link event. Duterte, Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea, and Senator Bong Go were also there.

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates – Visa runners in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) now have to spend a few hundred dirhams more to have their documents renewed or face possible deportation. This, following the temporary closure of the Oman border over new coronavirus concerns.
Consul General Marford Angeles of the Philippine Embassy in Abu Dhabi urged Filipinos staying in the country on expiring visit visas to follow the law.
He said the embassy and the consulate “are always ready to help those needing assistance.”
“We all have to follow the immigration regulations of the host country. That means one cannot overstay. Otherwise, there are fines and legal consequences,"" he explained.
“The embassy welcomes requests for assistance and we will do our best to provide help.... Our kababayans are advised to always be aware of ongoing developments.""
What is a visa run?
Visit visa holders need to exit the UAE to have their visas renewed or changed to employment status. The most convenient places for a visa run have been Sohar and Buraimi in neighboring Oman.
Land routes to these cities go through the border in Musandam, Oman, and Hatta in the UAE, which have been closed since last week until further notice due to the coronavirus outbreak. (READ: WHO labels coronavirus a 'pandemic' as Europe scrambles to contain it)
According to Malou Prado, CEO of MPQ Tourism, the remaining option is to go “airport-to-airport,” where the visa runner flies to Muscat, the capital of Oman, stays in the plane, and flies back to Dubai, where the new visa can be sent online via Whatsapp and shown to Immigration.
The industry rate for an airport-to-airport visa run costs approximately Dh1,450, whereas taking the land route costs Dh1,100.
Prado, who has been in the travel business for the past 10 years, said some 50 Filipino visa runners leave the UAE for Sohar or Buraimi every day.
She said they received a message on March 4 from their tour operator in Oman, who facilitates the issuance of Oman visas, saying the border-to-border (land route) visa change has been suspended.
“We regret to announce that the border-to-border visa change is temporarily closed. Kindly advise all passengers scheduled on this date that there is no trip and they can reschedule or transfer for airport-to-airport to avoid overstay.
“As of now, there is still no confirmation when this will resume, so please advise all passengers accordingly,” read the tour operator’s message, shared by Prado to Rappler.
Ordered back
Sid Rivera, marketing manager at Al Qadi Tourism, another travel agency, told Rappler that 5 of their visa runners were ordered to return to the UAE upon arrival at the Oman border post in Musandam.
He said the group was part of 13 busloads of visa runners.
“Pagdating nila sa border sa Musandam, may mga police sa Immigration post. Hindi na sila pinapasok ng Musandam at sinabihan na bumalik na lang,” Rivera said.
(When they got to the border at Musandam, there were police at the Immigration post. They weren't allowed to ender Musandam and were told to just head back.)
Rivera said travel agencies are also offering a “no exit” visa change, which is more pricey, and urges visa runners to act fast as the situation is very fluid.
“Hindi natin masabi kasi baka pati flights ma-apektuhan (We can't be sure, since even flights may get affected),” he said. – Rappler.com "

Belmonte said the patient was initially diagnosed as having dengue, and was only confirmed to be a COVID-19 case on Thursday.
She said the patient went to two private hospitals. The second private hospital confirmed that he was carrying the virus, but reportedly told him to go home because they could not accommodate him.
“Nagpunta po siya sa dalawang private hospitals na po. At sa second private hospital lang po siya nasabihan na ito po ay nCoV or COVID-19, tapos wala na pong lugar kaya pinauwi pa. Medyo nakakatakot din kasi alam na pala pero pinauwi pa. Tapos kanina sinundo ng DOH,"" she said.

The DOH already transported the patient to a hospital as of Thursday morning, said Belmonte. She did not disclose the hospital where the patient was confined.
She said the patient was ""doing okay"" and that a city government team would test his family, and interview the members.
Belmonte said that according to the patient's mother, they did not know how the patient got the virus.

MANILA, Philippines – The Department of Health (DOH) said on Wednesday, March 11, that the COVID-19 test kit developed by scientists from the University of the Philippines (UP) may be rolled out on Monday, March 16.
“The commitment is to start it within a week after it was approved. Their target is to start accepting testings by Monday next week, and they have committed to 1,000 tests every week,"" DOH Undersecretary Eric Domingo, officer-in-charge of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), said. 
The FDA has approved the UP test kit, but it needs ""emergency use listing"" with the World Health Organization before it can be rolled out. 
The test kit is capable of fast detection of the novel coronavirus in samples taken from patients. The results can be ready in two hours. It will be reportedly priced at P1,320, or 6 times cheaper than its foreign counterpart, which costs around P8,500. (READ: #SalamatUP: Netizens laud U.P. scientists for developing coronavirus test kits)

In a span of 6 days, the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the Philippines rose to 46 from 3.
DOH Assistant Secretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine has the capacity to perform 300 tests per day.
“Kaya pa naman pong tugunan ang mga request for tests. Kapag dumating po tayo sa punto na tataas pa ang mga kaso, kaya nga po mino-mobilize ang ating partnership with UP-NIH and also the testing kits that have been locally-produced, para po ma-expand ang capacity ng ating laboratoryo,” Vergeire said.
(We can still respond to requests for testing. We can still attend to testing requests. When we reach the point where cases continue to increase, this is why we're mobilizing our partnership with the UP National Institute of Health. Also, the testing kits have been locally produced to expand our laboratory's capacity.)
As of Wednesday, the DOH has probed 763 patients for possible infections. Of the 49 confirmed cases, 45 are currently admitted to hospitals, two have been discharged, and two have died.

They later confirmed the patient was admitted at Silliman University Medical Center.“He is suffering severe pneumonia, and is on a ventilator,” she said. She said the patient went to Manila for a convention. Upon his return to the province, he consulted at ACE Dumaguete Doctors Hospital on March 7. “That’s the time we were alerted. There was a request for a throat swab after,” she added. Dr. Socrates Villamor, the DOH provincial chief, said a second confirmatory test will be done 48 hours after the first test. Lapse? Meanwhile, the Silliman University Medical Center, in a press statement on Wednesday, said that a patient from ACE Dumaguete Doctors Hospital was transferred to their care at 2:32 am on March 10.“While the transfer of one patient to another hospital usually happens for better management and care, there may have been a lapse in the manner this particular patient was transferred, there being no full disclosure and transparency on the condition of the patient to the receiving hospital,” the statement said.It stressed the health facility immediately instituted stringent measures following the principles of isolation, containment, and crowd control.“As of noon yesterday, no new admissions to the ICU will be entertained in the meantime. If really necessary, ICU-bound patients will be referred to other hospitals,” it said. It also said that all staff and watchers taking care of current ICU patients are on hospital-imposed quarantined as a preventive measure. “All of them have been provided with adequate sleeping quarters, and meals for the duration of the quarantine,” it added. The hospital also reminded the public to be properly screened when coming to SUMC and to fully disclose their health condition, especially those who have a history of travel in affected areas. Cause for concernMiraflor, when sought for reaction, said there was cause for concern, but he didn't want to speculate if there was a lapse on the part of the other hospital. “We will ask them what happened. I think they have their own explanation” he said.He said hospitals know there are protocols that need to be followed. He added they will meet with the administrators of the hospital on Thursday, March 12. – Rappler.com  "

MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – Manila Mayor Isko Moreno is placing himself under quarantine at Manila City Hall after travelling to London on an official trip, in a bid to prevent the possible spread of the novel coronavirus while working as the Philippine capital's local chief executive.
""I will submit myself to self-quarantine. I will stay in City Hall,"" a face mask-wearing Moreno said on Wednesday evening, March 11, in a roundtable meeting with Manila health and hospital officials, and his vice mayor Honey Lacuna, who were all also wearing face masks.
Why the quarantine? Moreno recently came from an official trip to the United Kingdom, which had confirmed 382 cases in its territory as of March 11.
Self-quarantine is recommended by health authorities for people who have been to areas with reported cases of the coronavirus.
How will it work? Moreno's chief of staff Cesar Chavez said the mayor would stay in his ""secured office"" at city hall, and would have limited interactions with Manila officials. 
The Manila mayor is also known to use Facebook to reach Manila citizens and call out underperforming government officials and employees. Both did not disclose the duration of the quarantine, but health officials usually advise a period of at least 14 days.
Moreno's call for calm: True to form, Moreno went live at around 1:30 am on Thursday, March12, beside Lacuna at his office, just minutes after the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus outbreak as a pandemic.  
Both local executives alled for sobriety amid the panic sparked by the coronavirus outbreak, saying residents should refrain from the practice of ""panic-buying"" or the practice of hoarding food and supplies at the expense of others.
""I want you to live normally. 'Wag natin hayaang manalo ang virus over our normal lives. Kaya natin 'to mga kababayan,"" Moreno said. (Let's not allow the virus to win over our normal lives. We can do this.) 
He was seconded by Lacuna, who said: ""'Wag po tayong mag-panic. Kami po sa pamahalaan ng lungsod ng Maynila, makakasiguro po kayo na lalabanan natin 'to (Let us not panic. We at the government of the City of Manila assure you that we will fight this).""
The mayor, however, said he needed the public's help. He reminded viewers to wash their hands, to avoid crowded spaces, and to reach out to the local government for information on the outbreak. Beginning on Thursday morning, the hotline will be activated at 8527-5174. 
Moreno concluded his speech telling Manila government employees to hold fast to their vow to public service, especially amid the outbreak. The mayor then vowed to the public that the city would be transparent with all developments related to the coronavirus.
""We will be honest and true enough to you [about] the state and the situation of our city,"" Moreno said. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – A day after the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the coronavirus test kits developed by scientists from University of the Philippines (UP), #SalamatUP trends on Twitter.
Price of a #COVID19 testing kitImported: P8,500UP-made: P1,320#SalamatUP— Tonyo Cruz (@tonyocruz) March 10, 2020
The FDA said on Tuesday, March 10, it issued a Certificate of Exemption for the SARS CoV-2 PCR Detection Kit of the UP National Institute of Health.
Priced at P1,320, the kit is said to be 6 times cheaper than its foreign counterpart, which costs around P8,500. The kit provides results in two hours. 
The kit, funded by the Department of Science and Technology, will be used for field testing coupled with gene sequencing at the Philippine Genome Center, the FDA said in a statement.
Netizens took to Twitter to show their appreciation for UP for having developed the test kits.
#SalamatUP Please don't allow anyone to make this a business opportunity. These scientists need to be recognized and our government must take care of them. Imagine #COVID19 tests kits for Php 1,320.00, that's only around $26. Mabuhay!— Grace in Lines (@GraceInLines) March 11, 2020

Health Undersecretary Eric Domingo, who heads the FDA, said the development of test kits was a response to the ""increasing number of reported COVID-19 cases.""
The health department had been under fire for underreporting cases in the country, which was attributed to the limited number of test kits – only 2,000 were available. Now, the UP National Institute of Health has committed to conducting 1,000 tests every week, said Domingo. 
Online, Filipinos praised the state university for ""rightfully criticizing"" the administration while being able to contribute to the prevention of more coronavirus cases.
UP has been a target of hate speech and red-tagging by state forces and administration supporters for championing advocacies and exacting accountability from our government. (Read: Activism as the foundation of the university)

SINGAPORE – Three more Filipinos, all of whom recently visited the Philippines, were diagnosed with the novel coronavirus in Singapore on Wednesday, March 11. 
This brings to 6 the number of COVID-19 patients in Singapore. 
One of the new Filipino patients is classified by Singapore as an imported case. Identified only as Case 178, he is a 37-year-old Singapore work pass holder. 
Case 178 was in the Philippines from February 11 to 19 and from February 23 to March 2 “to visit a relative with pneumonia who has since passed on,” said the Singapore Ministry of Health (MOH) on Wednesday. 
He was diagnosed with the novel coronavirus disease, called COVID-19, on Wednesday. He is confined in an isolation room at Ng Teng Fong General Hospital (NTFGH). 
His Filipino family member in Singapore, a 35-year-old staff nurse at NTFGH, also contracted the novel coronavirus. The Filipina, who is Case 167, is now confined in the same hospital where she works. 
Case 167 was in the Philippines from February 11 to 17. She was at work in NTFGH before she was diagnosed with COVID-19. 
The other Filipina case of COVID-19 on Wednesday is a 42-year-old Singapore work pass holder. Known as Case 172, she was in the Philippines from February 27 to March 2. 
She was diagnosed with COVID-19 on Wednesday and is confined at the National Center for Infectious Diseases. 
Earlier Filipino cases involved two domestic helpers, aged 34 and 41, under the same employer, who also contracted the disease; and a 41-year-old Singapore permanent resident from the Philippines. The last one has been discharged. 
There have been 178 coronavirus cases in Singapore as of Wednesday, said the MOH. Of this number, 93 patients have been discharged from the hospital. Singapore has recorded zero deaths. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – The government can impose “localized lockdowns” due to the novel coronavirus only when the alert is raised to Code Red Sublevel 2, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said. 
On Wednesday, March 11, Duque explained to lawmakers that this highest alert level is raised when there is sustained community transmission beyond the capacity of the government to trace cases of 2019-nCoV. (WATCH: House briefing on PH coronavirus status)
This is the only time mayors or governors can declare a lockdown in their respective jurisdictions. 
""They need to follow the declaration of Code Red Sublevel 2. This happens when there is sustained human-to-human transmission in the community. This can be declared if there is evidence of transmission that we can no longer link, we can no longer identify the source of infection,"" Duque said in a mix of English and Filipino. 
The Philippines is currently under Code Red Sublevel 1 after the country recorded its first case of local transmission: a 62-year-old Filipino male with no travel history outside the Philippines infecting his 59-year-old Filipina wife.  
Should the situation worsen to a Code Red Sublevel 2, Duque would prefer localized lockdowns first than immediately imposing sweeping restrictions limiting people’s movements in the entire National Capital Region (NCR).
""The lockdown may be imposed only where the localized transmission or localized cases are recorded, so that you wouldn't need to lock down the entire NCR if the sustained transmission is only within a  small community. It's not ripe for any draconian measures,"" the health chief said.
President Rodrigo Duterte himself has rejected calls to place Metro Manila on lockdown due to the outbreak of COVID-19, the disease caused by the 2019-nCoV that has infected 49 people in the Philippines as of Wednesday afternoon. 
The President already raised a public health emergency due to the novel coronavirus.
On Wednesday, Duque admitted that “problems” in the DOH’s reporting system led to their delayed disclosure of coronavirus cases. 
The DOH is also “transitioning” its quarantine strategy, with mild cases being asked to undergo home quarantine so that hospitals will not be packed with patients. Those with severe symptoms will be prioritized.
Duque said hospitals that wouldl refuse to admit suspected 2019-nCoV cases may have their licensed revoked or their PhilHealth accreditation removed. – Rappler.com  "

REMOTE LEARNING. A medical school student refers to online materials provided by her professor. Photo sourced by Rappler 
MANILA, Philippines – Following the recent spike of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases in Metro Manila the past week, President Rodrigo Duterte ordered the suspension of classes in Metro Manila from March 10 to 14.
As of this writing, there have been at least 49 cases of the coronavirus in the Philippines – with those who have not yet recovered confined in hospitals in and around the National Capital Region (NCR).
The Department of Education (DepEd) ordered NCR schools on Tuesday evening after the President's announcement to implement “social distancing measures” amid the COVID-19 threat. By then, it had already suspended national activities requiring travel and congregation, such as Palaro Regional Meets.
With the uncertainty surrounding the incubation of the disease, schools are resorting to creative measures to keep classes running outside the classroom. Here are some of their practices:
Using online platforms
Here is a list of some online platforms some teachers have reported using or are encouraged to use to conduct their classes:

Google Classroom
Google Hangouts
Moodle (short for Modular Object-Oriented Dynamic Learning Environment)
Edmodo
Schoology
Turnitin
Skype
Zoom
Telegram
Facebook groups and Messenger

Ramon Avanceña High School (RAHS) principal Danilo Estavillo encouraged teachers in their Quiapo-based school to make use of Google Classroom to interact with students. In this platform, teachers can post announcements and assignments that students can accomplish online. 
In Pasig Elementary and Sta Ana Elementary, some teachers post slideshows of their lessons in Facebook groups and allow students to ask their questions and share insights through comments. Some also give assignments via Facebook Messenger.
Ateneo de Manila University lists Moodle, a free and open-sourced learning platform, as among online venues for learning.
Multimedia lectures. At the Ateneo School of Medicine and Public Health, some professors have opted for the following options on Facebook:

Livestreamed lectures
Audio lectures
Video lectures of a PowerPoint, along with an audio track of a discussion

Students can also comment on the multimedia lectures for questions. Professors provide links to supplementary learning materials, like YouTube videos.
Other online practices. The University of the Philippines (UP) and Ateneo suggested the following practices for faculty members in conducting remote lessons:

Adjusting syllabi and providing more detail on expectations of each session
Holding online classes on the same schedules as appointed course periods
Uploading learning materials or links to them in existing platforms
Adapting requirements to make them more compatible to an online delivery mode (e.g. essays instead of an exam)
Taking inventory of students' access to the internet, and matching students without access with those with access for peer learning opportunities
Conducting thesis defenses online
Determining contingency plans for laboratory classes, internships, and field immersion, among other out-of-classroom requirements

UP also made their Open University’s Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) accessible via their website for easy transition of lessons from face-to-face to online. According to the website, all educational institutions looking to do e-learning may avail of the MOOCs for free. (READ: [OPINION] A few possible benefits of the coronavirus outbreak)
RAHS principal Estavillo said there are no concerns about access to internet in their school. Meanwhile, for Sta Ana Elementary, principal Leo Pabaruan said that even if some students do not have access to the internet, they can just review their hard-copy lessons and modules for their postponed exams. The same is done in RAHS.
If teachers are unable to hold online class sessions, Ateneo advised them to break down the remainder of the course into modules, assign reading materials, and prepare an assessment to go with each module. Students would submit their requirements for the modules through email.
Ateneo decided that should the suspension of classes be announced within 3 weeks of the end of the 2nd semester, the semester would be deemed ended, and the final grades would be based on the latest class standing.
Staggered exams upon return
The week of March 10 to 14 coincides with the exam periods of some public elementary and high schools. The principals of the mentioned public schools said that this makes it easier for alternative learning, since lessons scheduled this week are not as heavy.
Pasig Elementary principal Emelita Medina said that once the students come back for their 4th quarter exams on March 16 to 20, they will come on a staggered basis – meaning students will come in batches at different times of the day to avoid too much contact.
This is also in line with the DepEd advisory for all basic educational institutions in the National Capital Region (NCR).
Postponement or cancellation of non-academic events
The University Athletic Association of the Philippines (UAAP) suspended all events until March 14.
A theater organization in Ateneo canceled its shows from March 11 to March 18, beyond the President’s suspension period.
Some high schools like Xavier School canceled its upcoming proms after the President’s suspension. Xavier also canceled off-campus retreats.
Advice dissemination
UP released a set of COVID-19 guidelines for its students through an online pamphlet. It contains answers to questions like, “I think I’m sick. What should I do?” It also contains illustrated guidelines of proper handwashing, how to use face masks, receiving letters and packages, and interacting with animals. 
At the end of the pamphlet is a list of contact numbers for each UP campus’ University Health Service. There are also QR codes for the official websites of the Department of Health and the World Health Organization.

ALBAY, Philippines – The provincial government of Albay is fast-tracking the rehabilitation of the Mayon Skyline Hotel in Tabaco City to set it up as quarantine center for cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.  
Located in Tabaco's Barangay Buang, the former commercial hotel near the active Mayon volcano can accommodate 24 patients. 
Trained medics will be assigned to the quarantine center, said Dr Cedric Daep, who heads the Albay Public Safety and Emergency Management Office. 
The Mayon Skyline Hotel is owned by the provincial government. Also known as the Mayon Rest House, it ceased commercial operations in the late 1990s due to the unpredictable outbursts of Mount Mayon, whose crater is around 4 kilometers away. The place has since been converted into a nature park.  
The area is accessible via Sabloyon area in Tabaco City or about two hours drive from Legazpi City but not via public transportation.
As of March 11, the Department of Health had reported 15 persons who were placed under investigation for coronavirus symptoms in the Bicol region, but they have all been discharged. – Rappler.com

MANILA, Philippines – The Department of Education (DepEd) on Wednesday, March 11, said that it would be up to public schools to decide on whether or not to push through with graduation ceremonies amid the novel coronavirus outbreak.
“Kung kaya ng schools i-implement strictly ang Department of Health (DOH) guidelines sa health eh magpatuloy sila ng graduation at saka gagawa sila ng paraan para mako-contain ang size ng crowds kasi ang sabi ni DOH, iko-control ang mass gatherings,” DepEd Secretary Leonor Briones said in a press conference. 
(If schools can strictly implement the guidelines set by the DOH, they may proceed with the graduation and they must find a way to control the size of the crowd following DOH’s protocols on mass gatherings.)
The DepEd reiterated that schools have the discretion to choose the date for conducting moving up and graduation rites within the week of April 13 to 17, 2020, provided that they follow the  DOH guidelines.
“We trust the schools, we trust the parents, and we trust their capacity to assess if they can implement the guidelines which are publicly known,” Briones stressed. 
Briones said that schools may opt to limit the number of parents or relatives who will be attending the ceremony in order to control the size of the crowd.
She added that she was not worried since students were being taught about health and personal hygiene protocols with or without the threat of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new virus.
However, if schools decide not to push through with the ceremony within the said week, they may, upon consultation with the parents and teachers, choose to reschedule the event.
Staggered exam schedule
With class suspensions in Metro Manila this week affecting the schedule of examinations for graduating students, DepEd said that all teachers are set to schedule all remaining 4th quarter examinations in the week of March 16 to 20 on a staggered basis to reduce the number of students in the school per day. 
Briones also reiterated that no mass promotion or passing of students would be done.
""No mass passing, no automatic or mass promotion because that is not the policy of the Duterte administration,"" she said.
In extreme conditions when suspension of work and classes ensue, DepEd Undersecretary Nepomuceno Malaluan said the department has outlined its alternative plan. 
“Sa tingin namin ay dahil nasa yugto na kami ng school year ay may sapat na na batayan para bigyan ng grado doon sa 4th quarter even in the absence of final test. Ang pinag-uusapan ngayon, paano ang transmutation na gagawin – only for extreme cases,"" Malaluan stressed. 
(As we see it, because the school year is now on its last period, schools have enough basis for giving grades for the fourth quarter even in the absence of a final test. What we are considering now is how the transmutation of grades will be done if extreme cases happen.)
DepEd has also encouraged private schools in basic education to adopt its guidelines as well. 
“Ang private sector dahil sila ay may autonomy na mag-isip ng anong paraan para ma-achieve din ang goals nila...pero ang purpose ay ibalanse ang safety ng learners, containment of COVID-19, and hindi madisrupt ang buhay ng mga bata sa kanilang learning process,” Briones said. 
(Although the private sector may have autonomy to think of ways to achieve their goals to prevent and control the disease in schools, the purpose should focus on striking a balance regarding the safety of the learners, containment of COVID-19, and not to disrupt the lives of the students in their learning process.)  
Briones added that conducting ""online classes are alright"" but may not be applicable in all areas due to possible internet connectivity issues. – Rappler.com  "

Since the outbreak began, at least 98 Filipinos outside the Philippines have contracted the virus. These include 80 from a cruise ship docked in Japan, 3 in Singapore, 5 in Hong Kong, 2 in the United Arab Emirates, 2 in Lebanon, and 6 onboard a luxury cruise ship docked in California, United States. 
But 40 from the cruise ship in Japan, 1 in Singapore, and 1 in Hong Kong have since recovered, leaving 56 still infected as of Wednesday.
The World Health Organization warned on March 10 that there is now a ""very real"" threat that the new coronavirus outbreak will become a pandemic, but stressed the virus could still be controlled.
The global death toll has reached 4,281, with 3,158 of the fatalities in China. The number of cases worldwide has risen to 118,554, with 80,778 of the infections in China. The virus has spread to 110 countries. – with reports from Agence France-Presse/Rappler.com "
,"March 11, 2020",nCov,Medical City says it will 'remain open to all patients',JC Gotinga,"
THE MEDICAL CITY. The Medical City's main hospital is in Ortigas Center in Pasig City. Photo from The Medical City's website   
MANILA, Philippines – The Medical City (TMC), an upscale private hospital, said it “will remain open to all patients"" for as long as the hospital can accommodate them, following the leakage of an internal memo telling its staff to “temporarily stop admitting” confirmed and suspected COVID-19 patients.
In the internal memo dated March 10, Tuesday, TMC Hospital Infection Control and Epidemiology Center Director Karl Evans Henson said the hospital’s main facility in Ortigas Center in Pasig City had already reached “full capacity” with 3 confirmed cases and several persons under investigation (PUIs) for the disease in its care.
“Currently available manpower will be unable to care for any additional patients. While our patients are our primary concern, we cannot ignore the fact that a healthy and safe workplace is imperative to sustain the level and quality of care that we provide to our currently admitted patients,” the memo stated.
In an official statement on Wednesday, March 11, TMC President and CEO Eugenio Jose Ramos explained that the internal memo issued on Tuesday night, March 10, was just a stopgap measure to control the inflow of new patients.
Ramos jabbed at critics, saying “they make things worse than they should be, contributing to the problem but offering no solution.” He called the leakage of the memo “a malicious virus that spreads faster than COVID-19.”
“Let it be clear, therefore, that as this epidemic evolves in ways that we cannot but anticipate, The Medical City, ever so proud of its Epidemic Rapid Response Team as well as its entire hospital staff, will remain open to all patients who deserve our care, for as long as our capacity to do so allows it,"" he said.
“This is a social responsibility that our enterprise – all 6 hospitals – does not shy away from. In fact, we intend to play a bigger role in this worldwide crisis in the days to come,” Ramos added.
He said that at present, the hospital already had 8 confirmed COVID-19 cases under its care, and that its Emergency Department handled 31 PUIs the previous night.
Worried that taking in more PUIs would overstretch the hospital staff and resources, the management decided to “temporarily control the inflow of new cases” and issued the internal memo on Tuesday night.
Wearing protective gear and following prescribed protocols do not guarantee the hospital staff 100% protection from the virus, and those exposed to confirmed cases are strictly placed on quarantine for 14 days, Ramos said.
“The impact of this on our hospital manpower base and other resources, plus the fear, uncertainty, and the onset of fatigue and burn-out is serious and very worrisome,” he added.

The TMC chief capped off his statement by saying that fear and misinformation are “the bigger enemy” than the novel coronavirus.
The mayor’s visit
Pasig Mayor Vico Sotto visited the TMC hospital in Ortigas Center before noon on Wednesday to clarify the matter.
“Partially because of several rumors, I went to The Medical City Pasig to meet with their officials. We are reassuring the public: TMC is not refusing patients. Even if they reach capacity, they will test and properly refer patients,” Sotto said in a post on his official Facebook and Twitter accounts after his meeting with the hospital’s executives.

Operations at TMC were “continuing as normal,” the mayor added.
Sotto then reiterated his call to spread only true and useful information, verified by legitimate sources.
Health Secretary’s take
At a House panel hearing on the novel coronavirus on Wednesday, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III faced questions on TMC’s alleged plan to turn down COVID-19 patients.
“Ang protocol diyan ay (The protocol there is) ‘not allowed to refuse patients. Unless the reasons are cogent, the reasons are clear, we cannot allow it. So we will have to look into this report. So I'm sending my regional director to make the assessment vis-a-vis the claim of the hospital of reasons why they are no longer accepting patients,” Duque told the congressional panel.
If any hospital is found to have unlawfully refused to admit patients, the government may revoke its Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth) accreditation, and its license issued by the Bureau of Health Facility Services Regulatory Board, Duque said. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – The Department of Health (DOH) on Wednesday, March 11, confirmed 16 more positive cases of COVID-19, raising the total number of cases in the country to 49.
The DOH said they were now conducting extensive information-gathering and contact tracing activities on the new confirmed cases.
According to the DOH, they also have yet to determine if these were cases of community transmission.
 
“Pumasok na po lahat most of the numbers at datos para sa contact tracing. Napapansin na po natin at nakikita na natin ang relasyon ng cases right now,” Health Assistant Secretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said in a press briefing on Wednesday, March 11.
(All the numbers and data are already up for contact tracing. We can already see the relationship of each case now.)
Meanwhile, Vergeire also said that the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) at present has a capacity to perform 300 tests per day.
“Kaya pa naman pong tugunan ang mga request for tests. Kapag dumating po tayo sa punto na tataas pa ang mga kaso kaya nga po minomobilize ang ating partnership with UPNIH and also the testing kits that have been locally produced para po ma expand ang capacity ng ating laboratoryo,” Vergeire said.
(We can still respond to requests for testing. We can still attend to testing requests. When we reach the point where cases continue to increase, we will mobilize our partnership with UPNIH. Also the testing kits have been locally produced to expand our laboratory's capacity.)
The test kit developed by the University of the Philippines National Institutes of Health is capable of faster detection of the novel coronavirus in samples taken from patients.
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has already approved the UP test kit, but it needs to get the nod of the World Health Organization's (WHO) ""emergency use listing” before this can be rolled out.
On virus-hit Japanese cruise ship
The health department also reported that together with the Overseas Workers Welfare Administration (OWWA), they have  sent home 442 of the 445 repatriates from Japan who were quarantined at the New Clark City.
Of those 445 repatriates, two tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus. The DOH said that rooms used by these patients were disinfected thoroughly.
“Close contacts of the 2 confirmed cases shall undergo additional 14-day home quarantine and will be continuously monitored by their respective municipal health offices,” the DOH added.
As of Wednesday, the global death toll of COVID-19 has reached 4,292 with 3,046 of the fatalities in China. The number of cases worldwide has risen to 119,541, with 80,967 of the infections in China. The virus has spread to more than 100 countries.
The DOH will release details of the new cases to media late Wednesday. – Rappler.com

MANILA, Philippines – The Liberian government has asked all travelers from the Philippines to monitor themselves for symptoms of the novel coronavirus disease to help quell the spread of the virus in the African country. 
The Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) urged Filipinos to take note of Liberia’s travel restrictions on self monitoring, which is being imposed on travelers from countries where there are less than 50 cases. 
Travelers should also report immediately to concerned health authorities in Liberia should they experience fever, cough, or respiratory distress. 
As of Wednesday, March 11, the Philippines recorded 33  COVID-19 cases, including two  in “critical condition” and the first death outside China – a Chinese tourist from Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak. 
The DFA also  urged travelers from the Philippines to be mindful of Liberia’s other measures that will take effect if cases rise in the Philippines.  
The measures include the following:

For those arriving from countries where there are over 200 cases: They will immediately be placed at the Liberian government’s designated precautionary center for a mandatory 14-day monitoring. 


For those arriving from countries where there are over 50 to 100 cases: They will be evaluated upon entry into Liberia. If coming from places with over 100 cases, they will be placed under observation.


For new passport holders: They will be immediately taken for a second round of screening at a designated screening center. If found to be circumventing existing travel restrictions, they will be subject to 14-day monitoring at a designated monitoring center.

The DFA said Filipinos en route to Liberia who encounter any issues with the restrictions may contact the Philippine Embassy in Abuja, Nigeria, at +2349053244916 or +2348102541252. 
“The DFA likewise advises the Filipino public to remain vigilant and continue to be accurately informed as countries impose and/or adjust travel restrictions that may suddenly affect Filipino travelers,” it said. 
There are currently no confirmed COVID-19 cases in Liberia.  
Worldwide, the death toll due to the disease surpassed 4,200 while over 117,000 cases were recorded in over 100 countries. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – The summer heat and the spread of the novel coronavirus are likely to increase water consumption in the coming weeks.
Moreover, the National Water Resources Board has kept raw water allocation for concessionaires at limited levels until April to preserve the water supply of the Angat Dam.
Despite these, Metro Manila concessionaires Manila Water and Maynilad Water Services assured customers that there is sufficient supply.
In a text message to Rappler, Maynilad said it has been implementing the following measures to cushion the impact of the reduced allocation:

Getting additional raw water from Laguna Lake through two treatment plants in Muntinlupa City that now produce 300 million liters per day
Sustained pipe replacement and leak repairs
Cloud seeding in partnership with the Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System and the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical, and Astronomical Services Administration 
Reactivation of several deep wells
Tapping small rivers in Cavite using modular treatment plants

Manila Water said its supply outlook is ""better this year compared to last year,"" as it has put in place several augmentation measures.
Manila Water has been implementing service interruptions since 2019, but only at reduced pressure at nighttime until recently.
""We do assure our customers in the East Zone that water is still available during daytime, so we have safe, clean water to use for hygiene in the face of the COVID-19 concerns. We will proceed with operational adjustments which may result to no water but only at nighttime, except for emergency leak repairs at daytime,"" Manila Water said.
""We still encourage the public to use water responsibly and wisely to help preserve the level of the dams,"" the company added.
On Monday, March 9, President Rodrigo Duterte once again warned of a government takeover of Metro Manila's water sector, should it experience another crisis amid the coronavirus scare.
""I'm warning you, I will industrialize the water industry and government will do the construction and we will force the issue,"" Duterte said.
The government is currently reviewing the concession agreements of Manila Water and Maynilad over supposedly onerous provisions. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – PBA commissioner Willie Marcial and the board of governors all agreed to indefinitely suspend the ongoing season due to the threat of the novel coronavirus in the country.
Starting Wednesday, March 11, the league has canceled all games and activities, including the PBA D-League and the inaugural PBA 3x3. 
""It was a unanimous decision by the board,"" Marcial said in Filipino a day after the special board meeting on Tuesday, March 10. 
The 45th season successfully kicked off on Sunday, March 8, with the traditional opening ceremonies at the Araneta Coliseum before reigning five-time Philippine Cup champion San Miguel crushed Magnolia. 
But since then, the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the country has risen dramatically, with the total spiking to 33 as of Tuesday. 
Marcial said the cancelation may last for at least 3 weeks. 
""We don't think of the impact on the league anymore, be it on the schedule or money. Our priority is the welfare of everybody involved."" 
But if the situation permits, closed-door games are a possibility.
""We'll see. We're on a day-to-day basis. If it worsens, we will have a longer season. This is for the sake of everybody,"" Marcial said.

MANILA, Philippines – Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said any hospital that will refuse to admit suspected cases of COVID-19 without valid reasons may face sanctions. 
Duque said in a chance interview on Wednesday, March 11, that hospitals are “not allowed” to close their doors on patients suspected to have COVID-19, the disease caused by novel coronavirus. (WATCH: House briefing on coronavirus status)
“Ang protocol diyan eh (The protocol there is that they are) not allowed to refuse patients. Unless the reasons are cogent, the reasons are clear, we cannot allow it. So we will have to look into this report,” Duque said.
Asked what possible sanctions the government may impose, Duque said the hospitals may be stripped of their license and accreditation.
“I’m sure there are [sanctions]. So we can probably impose some of the sanctions [like removing their] accreditation by PhilHealth [or] the licensing by the Health Facility [and] Services Regulatory Bureau,” Duque said.  
Duque was sought for comment on reports that The Medical City (TMC) in Pasig would temporarily stop admitting patients under investigation (PUI) fr COVID-19 since the hospital was supposedly at full capacity already with 3 PUIs already under its care. 
Duque said he would sending the Deparment of Health regional director to verify this information with TMC, but Pasig City Mayor Vico Sotto already said the private hospital “is not refusing patients.”
With the total confirmed cases in the Philippines at 33 so far, the health department is now “transitioning” its quarantine strategy, with mild cases being asked to undergo home quarantine so that hospitals will not be packed with patients. Those with severe symptoms will be prioritized. 
Due to limited supplies, DOH will also only test patients already showing respiratory symptoms and who have either traveled to countries with recorded cases of the coronavirus or were exposed to those who already have COVID-19. (READ: Duque: 'Problems' in reporting system delayed disclosure of coronavirus cases)

MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – Pasig Mayor Vico Sotto called for calm and cautioned against panic buying, as his local government responds to the threat of the novel coronavirus.
Sotto on Wednesday, March 11, addressed concerns that people have been trooping to markets and grocery stores to stock up on food and supplies, and that face masks, sanitizers, and rubbing alcohol were running out due to hoarders.
“Kawawa naman ‘yung mga mauubusan (How unfortunate for those who won’t have any left),” Sotto said in a media interview.
“Safe po tayo. ‘Wag po tayo magpanic (We’re safe. Let’s not panic),” he added.
Sotto urged his constituents to be considerate, and reminded them that neither the World Health Organization nor the Department of Health recommends wearing face masks to avoid infection. Only people with a cough or cold are encouraged to wear face masks.
Stores in Pasig will not close and there is “no problem at all” when it comes to the availability of food items, he added.
‘Very prepared’
Sotto on Wednesday oversaw efforts to spray disinfectant in the city’s school campuses, as classes and all major public gatherings were canceled.
Pasig has 45 public schools, all of which were routinely disinfected once a month before the viral outbreak. Sotto said the city plans to disinfect campuses twice a week when classes resume. Teams will be sent to disinfect private schools upon their request.
Much-frequented public places like the city hall and wet market will be disinfected daily, and the city government will distribute disinfectant kits to Pasig’s 30 barangays.

“We’re very prepared,” Sotto told reporters, adding that the local government is working closely with the DOH on efforts to combat the virus.
The city has dedicated response teams trained to handle suspected cases of infection. Areas have been designated for isolating suspected cases, and the city’s responders observe the right protocols on triage and referral of patients to the proper health facilities, the mayor added.
11 persons under investigation
Three Pasig residents were earlier diagnosed with COVID-19, which is caused by the new virus; two of them are a couple.
Health officials have traced the patients’ close contacts and identified 11 people as “persons under investigation (PUI)” for the virus. They were placed on home quarantine for 14 days, during which they are isolated and not allowed to leave their houses.
The city government has checked on the 11 PUIs and made sure they had everything they need while they are prohibited from stepping out out of their homes, Sotto said.
A private hospital in Pasig, The Medical City, said it had 8 confirmed novel coronavirus cases under its care as of Wednesday.
Go to health centers first
Anyone with flu-like symptoms or who suspects infection must immediately go to their barangay health center – not hospitals – to be checked.
If all people experiencing symptoms were to go to hospitals right away, it could “overload” Pasig’s hospital system and even increase the risk of infection, Sotto said.
Although Pasig is currently hiring new nurses, the medical staff on hand are so far able to keep up with the demands of responding to the viral threat, he added.
For any questions, Pasig residents may call the city’s health hotline at 8-643-0000. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles on Wednesday, March 11, said the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth) will shoulder costs for the testing of the novel coronavirus disease called COVID-19 in hospitals. 
Nograles said this will be on top of PhilHealth’s coverage of expenses for quarantine and isolation of patients infected with the disease. 
He added PhilHealth president and chief executive officer Ricardo Morales said the agency was ""in the process of formalizing and operationalizing"" the new measure. 
Nograles said the move was done in line with President Rodrigo Duterte’s orders for government to combat the coronavirus crisis. The measure, he added, would also be done to aid citizens in getting tested, as procedures may cost some P3,000 to P5,000 each. 
Coping with the outbreak: As the number of coronavirus cases in the Philippines continues to rise, health officials have been placed under scrutiny for the lack of test kits.  
The Research Institute on Tropical Medicine (RITM), which is the Philippines' sole laboratory accredited by the World Health Organization (WHO) to test novel coronavirus samples, earlier said there were only some only 2,000 kits available on hand. 
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has since approved the use of COVID-19 test kits developed by University of the Philippines (UP) scientists. The additional kits are expected to aid in field testing for the disease. 
The kits developed by UP will also be coupled with gene sequencing at the Philippine Genome Center.  
Nograles gave assurances the government was “working overtime” to ensure there would be enough tests to quickly identify those infected with the coronavirus. 
Specifically, he said research and development company Manila Healthtek was developing a “rapid diagnostic test kit” for COVID-19, which set for for a field validation study. The Philippine General Hospital, Nograles added, has also agreed to support the study. 
“At this point, they just need to conduct validation of 500 tests for COVID-19 to enable them to conduct clinical sensitivity analysis as a pre-condition set by the FDA. Once it passes the clinical tests, the FDA will grant full access by all hospitals, as guided by the DOH,” Nograles said. 
Aside from this, Nograles said private hospitals have also signaled interest to join field validation studies, though this would be subject to the approval of an ethics committee, which may come by Friday, March 13.
As of Wednesday, the Philippines recorded 33 confirmed coronavirus cases. The confirmed cases include two patients who were in ""very critical condition"" and the first death recorded outside China – a Chinese tourist from Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said on Wednesday, March 11, that ""problems"" in the Department of Health's reporting system caused the delay in the disclosure of new COVID-19 cases in the country.
Duque told lawmakers on Wednesday, March 11, that the DOH had no intention to hide any information to the public related to the cases. (WATCH: House briefing on PH coronavirus status) 
“‘Yon pong sinasabi ninyong hindi nagdisclose, nagkaroon lang po ng konting aberya sa reporting system (About your statement that we’re not disclosing, we just had some problems in our reporting system). But I assure you, there is no deliberate, there was no deliberate intention on the part of the DOH to not disclose important pieces of information as can be legally allowed under the law,” Duque said.  
This was his response to ACT-CIS Representative Nina Taduran, who asked during the House health committee hearing if the “delayed disclosure” of the confirmed cases would account for the recent spike in local transmission of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new virus.
From just 10 cases on Sunday, March 8, the Philippines reported 23 new cases between Monday, March 9, and Tuesday night, March 10, bringing the total to 33.  (READ: LIST: Confirmed coronavirus cases in the Philippines as of March 10)
The DOH has since drawn flak for failing to immediately announce these additional cases, as several local government units and the management of several hospitals where the patients were admitted issued statements ahead of the the health department. 
During the House hearing, Muntinlupa Representative Ruffy Biazon criticized the clear lack of communication lines even within the government’s Inter-Agency Task Force on the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases – the body tasked to manage the coronavirus outbreak.
Biazon said Duque should insist more on his authority as “incident commander” of this health crisis.  
“With due respect to the good Secretary whom I have a great respect for…personally I have some observations that the inter-agency task force was not fully functioning as it should be…. There are aspects of this crisis that could have been handled a better way in light of the DOH being incident commander,” Biazon said. 
“There was an appearance that there was no proper communication coordination between the secretary of health and the private hospitals and likewise with the LGUs,” the Muntinlupa congressman added. 
Biazon hoped that other member-agencies of the IATF would recognize Duque’s authority to lead the government's response to the outbreak. 
“I am fully behind the Secretary of Health and I make this statement because I want him to be recognized by everyone as the incident commander in this crisis,” Biazon said. 
In a press conference on Monday, Duque already said the DOH would disclose the names of the hospitals where the COVID-19 cases are admitted “to combat unverified or fake news.” 
The DOH will also inform mayors about positive cases in their areas, who can then make announcements to their respective constituencies. – Rappler.com

MANILA, Philippines – The lack of supply of face masks in the Philippines has reached “grave” levels that some private hospitals have been forced to improvise with old linen to help protect their health personnel from the novel coronavirus.
Philippine Hospital Association Dr Jaime Almora raised the alarm on Wednesday, March 11, as the Department of Health (DOH) briefed  he House committee on health on the status of the COVID-19 outbreak in the country. (WATCH: House briefing on coronavirus status)
“There is, there is, madam, danger, a grave deficit in the number of PPEs (personal protective equipment). We are resorting actually to improvising, like we turn our old linen into cloth masks,” Almora said when House panel chair Angelina Tan asked if they had enough supplies. 
This is in stark contrast to the steady supply of face masks and PPEs the DOH is getting from Bataan-based manufacturer Philippine International Trading Corporation (PITC) for government health workers. 
Undersecretary for Procurement and Supply Chain Carolina Vidal Taiño said the DOH currently has 59,000 pieces of N-95 masks in stock for public health workers nationwide, enough for a month’s supply. She said the PITC has committed to provide them at least 30,000 pieces every week.
Health Secretary Francisco Duque III explained that the demand for face masks has increased not just in the Philippines but across the globe, where more than 100 countries have recorded a positive case of COVID-19, the disease caused by 2019-nCoV. 
Still, Duque said the DOH was willing to give extra face masks to private hospitals in need, but government health workers would still be the top priority.  
“We are told also that the need has become so acute that the global supply chain is really under pressure. Hindi talaga nila ma-supplyan dahil (They really can't supply all because) 104 countries have COVID infection, almost 50 have local transmissions, and so they just have to ramp up their supply chains, Madame Chair,” Duque said.  
“But if we have some extras, we would be certainly willing to let the private hospitals have some. But we cannot promise that what they need we will be able to respond to because our priority is the public health workers,” the DOH chief added.  
In the Philippines, citizens had been panic-buying face masks in the past weeks as the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases rose to 33 as of Tuesday evening, March 10.  
This is despite the World Health Organization’s reminder that face masks should be reserve for high-risk people like the elderly and health workers who have to take care of confirmed cases. 
On February 3, President Rodrigo Duterte said the government would procure more surgical face masks for Filipinos as stockpiles continue to be depleted. He has already declared a state of public health emergency due to the novel coronavirus. – Rappler.com

MANILA, Philippines – The Philippine government will be borrowing even more this year, as revenue collection is expected to drop by as much as P91 billion due to the economic slowdown triggered by the novel coronavirus.
In a press briefing on Tuesday, March 10, Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III said the budget deficit may hit as high as 3.6% of the country's gross domestic product (GDP), assuming that the economic impact of the virus would last until June. 
Dominguez said the increased borrowings would help sustain President Rodrigo Duterte's ambitious Build, Build, Build infrastructure program. 
Socioeconomic Planning Secretary Ernesto Pernia said the economic team programmed the ceiling for the budget deficit to hit a maximum of 3% for 2020.
Pernia added that economic growth may fall by a full percentage point due to the economic slowdown. This means that the government may miss its GDP target of 6.5% to 7.5% for this year. (READ: 'A mess': Coronavirus economic impact on Philippines worse than projected)
Lower tourism-related activities and weaker trade are the main contributors for the economic slowdown.
Why does this matter? A budget deficit shows the government is spending beyond its means.
In 2019, the budget deficit exploded to 3.5%, higher than the target of 3.25%. It was the second time in Philippine history that the annual deficit surpassed the ceiling set by the government.
The rise was due to the aggressive increase in spending in the 4th quarter, with the budget deficit soaring to 6.8%. (READ: [ANALYSIS] How the budget deficit exploded under Duterte's watch)
Meanwhile, the Bureau of Internal Revenue did not reach the tax collection target last year. It only collected P2.17 trillion, which was below the P2.33-trillion target.
As the government fails to reach its revenue targets, it will have little option but to borrow and incur more debt.
The deficit figure is also dependent on GDP growth. Simply put, the lower the GDP, the less room for government to borrow in the future.
Will the Philippines' debt be too much? Data from the Bureau of the Treasury showed that the country's debt soared to P7.7 trillion in 2019. 
But so far, the debt-to-GDP ratio is at 41.9%, still within the government target of 42%.
The ratio simply compares what the country owes with what it produces, and indicates the country's ability to pay back its debts.
""Our credit rating is quite robust and we don't expect any difficulty in covering for potential deficit that might occur because of the expected drop in economic activity because of this COVID,"" Dominguez said. – Rappler.com "

In compliance to Proclamation No. 922 signed by President Rodrigo Duterte declaring a State of Public Health Emergency throughout the Philippines and calling for the implementation of urgent, critical measures to contain the spread of COVID-19, the Civil Service Commission (CSC) suspends the conduct of the March 15 Career Service Examination-Pen and Paper Test (CSE-PPT) nationwide until further notice.  The CS exams were supposed to be held in 66 testing locations nationwide, with an estimated total of 293,845 individuals nationwide registered to take the test. Of the figure, an estimated 253,419 will take the Professional Level exam, while an estimated 40,426 will attempt to hurdle the Subprofessional Level.
Thus, it is necessary to suspend the exams as a preemptive health measure to mitigate the rise in the number of COVID-19 cases and to support the national and local government units in undertaking appropriate response and measures in a timely manner to curtail and eliminate the COVID-19 threat.

As of Tuesday, the Philippines has 33 confirmed cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. Of this number, 30 are currently admitted to hospitals, two have been discharged, and one has died.
On UP testing kit
On Tuesday, Vergeire said that even though the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) already approved the COVID-19 test kit developed by University of the Philippines (UP) scientists, it still needs to get listed in the World Health Organization's (WHO) ""emergency use listing.""
""Kailangan kasi na mailista siya doon sa emergency use listing ng WHO. Mayroon silang kailangan i-comply na kailangan pang kunin sa ibang bansa bago mai-approve ng WHO. That's a step na pinag-uusapan ngayon na both ng WHO at ng mga gumagawa ng rapid testing kit na ito,"" Vergeire said. 
(It needs to be listed in the emergency use listing of the WHO. Before it can be approved by WHO, they need to comply with a requirement that needs to be accomplished abroad. That's a step that the WHO and the UP scientists are discussing now.)
The kit, funded by the Department of Science and Technology, will be used for field testing coupled with gene sequencing at the Philippine Genome Center, the FDA said in a statement.
Heath Undersecretary Eric Domingo, FDA chief, said that the use of the locally-developed test kits would help address the ""increasing number of reported COVID-19 cases"" that ""require immediate diagnosis and monitoring.""
Vergeire, however, said that the DOH has enough testing kits.
As of Tuesday, the DOH said it has probed a total of 725 patients for possible infection. 
The global death toll has reached 4,012, with 3,136 of the fatalities in China. The number of cases worldwide has risen to 114,151, with 80,754 of the infections in China. The virus has spread to 105 countries. – with reports from Agence France-Presse/Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – The number of confirmed novel coronavirus cases in the Philippines started spiking on the second week of March – a month after health officials confirmed the country's third case.
According to the Department of Health, the spike in the number of positive cases was supposedly due to their “heightened surveillance” efforts. (READ: Novel coronavirus cases in the Philippines now at 52)
The DOH said they were conducting comprehensive contact tracing for all cases. They are also in coordination with concerned local government units and Centers for Health Development for the implementation of infection prevention and control measures.

MANILA, Philippines – The Philippine Azkals will have to wait for another chance to pick up a win in the FIFA World Cup Asian qualifiers, while Ceres-Negros FC will be without its home crowd in their upcoming 2020 AFC Cup match.
In a statement released on Monday, March 9, FIFA and the Asian Football Confederation have agreed to postpone the World Cup qualifying matches in March and in June due to the coronavirus outbreak, but games can still go ahead if both sides agree and safety standards are met. 
But according to Philippine Football Federation (PFF) secretary-general Edwin Gastanes, Guam – which was slated to play against the Philippines on March 26 – did not allow its team to travel to the host country. 
""Like this month, the Philippines Azkals were supposed to go against Guam, but two weeks ago, Guam said: ‘Sorry, we cannot go because of our coach and team management doesn’t want to get this [coronavirus] problem,"" said Gastanes in the chef de mission to the Tokyo 2020 Olympics press conference in the Philippine Sports Commission (PSC). 
""World Cup qualifying matches will be rescheduled to a later month this year according to FIFA and AFC."" 
Philippines is bunched with group topper Syria, China, Guam and Maldives in Group A where the Azkals are running in 3rd. 
The team will not host nor travel for friendlies, either. 
Gastanes also said that the PFF will follow up on the World Cup qualifying home matches on June 4 against China and June 9 against Maldives, as well as the arrangement friendlies. 
""With regards to friendlies, it’s safe to say that by March, we have no friendlies, we’ll see about June. We have to keep following up. We have to see about the World Cup qualifying matches in June if the teams will come here to play,"" added Gastanes. 
The 2020 AFC Cup match between Ceres-Negros FC and Bali United hosted in the Rizal Memorial Stadium on Wednesday, March 11, will not be open for public. 
Football is one of the sports worst affected by the epidemic and especially in Asia, where the AFC Champions League and domestic competitions in China, Japan and South Korea are all on hold.
Some World Cup qualifying games, though, will go ahead during the upcoming international windows, when dozens of fixtures were planned across the Middle East and Asia.
The women's Olympic qualifying playoff between China and South Korea has been moved to June 1 and 9, while the AFC Futsal Championship in Turkmenistan has been postponed to August, the statement added.
""FIFA and the AFC will continue to assess the situation in relation to COVID-19 and will decide whether further changes to the schedule of Asian FIFA World Cup 2022 qualifiers are required,"" read the FIFA statement.
Philippines has 33 confirmed coronavirus cases as of Tuesday afternoon, while the global death toll passes 4,000.  – with reports from Agence France-Presse/Rappler.com

CEBU, Philippines – Starting Wednesday, March 11, the Cebu provincial government will require travellers coming Iran and Italy to undergo a mandatory fourteen-day quarantine if they want to enter the province. 
Governor Gwendolyn Garcia announced the latest health order Monday, March 9, during a meeting with Capitol reporters.
""The Bureau of Quarantine, the Bureau of Immigration, the Department of Health agree with me and so I shall be issuing that Executive Order today,"" she said.
She said her EO was effective two days later to spare incoming passengers from both countries who were in their flights going here.
Cebu province's mandatory quarantine imposition is on top of the DOH directive of implementing the same 14-day quarantine on all Filipinos coming from China, and those who arrived from Japan after their quarantine on the cruise ship Diamond Princess.
Garcia justified Cebu's stricter rules after noting the large number of COVID-19 cases from Iran and Italy.
 
Italy has recorded 7375 COVID-19 cases with 463 deaths on Monday. While in Iran has had 6566 cases with 237 deaths, also on Monday.
Garcia's order gives incoming travellers who have been to Iran and Italy in the past 15 days two options – undergo a mandatory quarantine or go back from their country of origin.
""This is the additional quarantine that I believe is within my authority to declare for those that may have visited Italy and Iran,"" she said.
The Provincial Inter-agency Task Force on COVID-19 convened in the Capitol to the impact of  President Rodrigo Duterte's declaration of a national public health emergency.
Present in the meeting were Governor Gwendolyn Garcia, Dr. Jaime Bernadas Department of Health Central Visayas Regional Director; Terence Bermejo, Bureau of Quarantine (BOQ)- Cebu Head; Dr. Christina Giango, Provincial Health Officer; members of the Philippine National Police (PNP); representatives from the airport and Bureau of Immigration (BOI).

MANILA, Philippines – No more holy water by the church entrance. Communion should be received by the hand. Instead of the traditional pagmamano, a bow with a smile will do.
The Archdiocese of Manila, the most influential Catholic territory in the Philippines, released a list of precautionary measures for churches and church-run institutions against the novel coronavirus disease called COVID-19.
The list was contained in a pastoral letter dated Monday, March 9, signed by Bishop Broderick Pabillo, temporary head of the archdiocese while Pope Francis is yet to pick the replacement of Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle, who now heads a powerful Vatican office.
Strictly speaking, these precautionary measures apply only to the Archdiocese of Manila's jurisdiction: the cities of Manila, Makati, Pasay, San Juan, and Mandaluyong. Bishops of other places act on their own and report directly to the Pope. The Archdiocese of Manila is, however, traditionally considered the first among equals in the Philippine Catholic Church, and its actions can influence other Catholic territories across the country.
Here are the Archdiocese of Manila's 12 precautionary measures against the coronavirus, quoted verbatim from Pabillo’s pastoral letter:
1. Suspend the practice of dipping of hands in the holy water font or stoup. Empty all fonts and let the faithful be informed that such practice will be temporarily suspended. Holy water can be made available for people to take home or sprinkling of the holy water can be done before or after liturgical gatherings.
2. Let containers of 70% ethyl alcohol be located at various entrance doors accessible to the public in our church institutions.
3. Advise the faithful to stay home when they are sick with flu-like symptoms and cough. They should get medical attention for their good and the good of their family members. Signages may be posted to this effect in prominent places. They can sanctify the Lord’s Day by praying in their homes and reading the Scriptures. TV Masses are available for them to watch at the Quiapo Church Facebook and website as well as TV Maria. Radio Veritas also airs Masses regularly and other parishes have their own video streaming facilities. Priests and lay ministers who have flu-like symptoms should also refrain from serving. This is an act of charity that we can offer to the people.
4. Routinely clean with disinfectants the high-touch areas, pews, benches, and door knobs, as well as microphone covers.
5. All should take care to observe cough etiquette (like covering their mouth with their sleeves or napkins which they should immediately dispose in safe places). Frequent hand washing is to be promoted to all.
6. Remind all that we need not hold hands when praying the Lord’s Prayer and when giving the sign of peace. For the time being, the beautiful Filipino sign of reverence in holding the hands of the priests and the elderly (the “mano po”) can be substituted by a slight bow with a smile or by a slight touch on the head for the giving of the blessing.
7. Until the virus is overcome all should refrain from the kissing and holding of statues and sacred images, and even the glass frames that protect them. Let barriers be installed so that people do not get near them to touch them.
8. Let ministers and priests thoroughly wash their hands before they serve. For the time being, holy communion is to be received by the faithful by hand.
9. Those parishioners who are weak or have non-communicable diseases like diabetes, cancer, etc. are encouraged to wear masks even during Holy Mass.
10. Churches and adoration chapels with air-conditioning and hardly any windows should be biomisted. Air purifier perhaps may be of help but it will be very expensive and there is no clear evidence of its effectiveness in large areas like churches. Open windows and doors after Mass and shut off the air conditioning in order for the air, heat and sunlight to circulate.
11. The World Health Organization (WHO) confirms that the coronavirus may spread through money. Those who count the money must wear mask and use alcohol after counting. It is good that they be provided with latex gloves.
12. Let the parishes be prepared for the economic effects of the COVID-19 phenomenon. Worst case scenario would be the suspension of public gatherings. We need to save at this time of impending crisis. Let us make our church institutions resilient. At this time, let expenses be made only in what is essential in order to save for any eventualities. Let us suspend purchases on capital expenditures and make our programs frugal. What we can save, let us put in a disaster resiliency fund. In this way, in case we have no collections, we may sustain the salaries of our employees maintain our religious institutions.
State of public health emergency
The Archdiocese of Manila released these guidelines as the Philippine government is under a state of public health emergency due to the coronavirus. The Philippine Department of Health said there are at least 33 novel coronavirus cases in the Philippines, including one death, as of Tuesday, March 10. Around the world, COVID-19 has affected at least 109,577 people and killed 3,809 as of Monday.
Pabillo said: “I encourage all to intensify our prayers to ask for Divine protection and intervention. Faith can avert evil. While we pray, let us also exercise good stewardship over our health. In the spirit of Lent let us keep a healthy lifestyle so that our bodies may be strong enough to resist infections. Thus eat healthy food, have enough rest, keep clean, get enough exercise, and avoid unnecessary travels and gatherings of large crowds.”
These guidelines show how the coronavirus has changed even the way people around the world practice their faith. Many of these measures, such as the advisory to receive communion by the hand and not by the mouth, have attracted theological debates, but church leaders defend these measures as necessary to contain COVID-19.
Pope Francis himself on Sunday, March 8, started delivering his weekly Angelus prayer via livestream, not in person, to avoid the spread of the virus. The Vatican also started livestreaming his daily Masses at his residence. (READ: 'Caged' Pope Francis receives guests – from afar)
Other religious groups around the world have implemented their own precautionary measures. 
In Singapore, the Catholic Church suspended public Masses from February 15 to March 13 as they installed thermal scanners and organized contact tracing methods for parishioners. Public Masses in other affected countries, such as Italy, however remain suspended.
The Islamic community in Singapore also implemented its own rules, including an advisory against shaking hands in prayer services.
Like ""communion by the hand"" advisory for Catholics, the guideline against shaking hands for Singapore's Muslim community also drew controversy, as critics said it goes against the teaching of the Prophet Muhammad. Muslim leaders however stood by this reminder, as the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore said it's not enough to trust in God without humans doing their part. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – If the novel coronavirus continues to spread in Metro Manila, the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) may cancel its first ever Metro Manila Summer Film Festival (MMSFF) from April 11 to 21.
MMDA General Manager Jojo Garcia told reporters on Tuesday, March 10, that canceling the film festival was a possibility when he was asked about the impact of the rising cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new virus, in Metro Manila. 
""It depends, but we are looking at that direction if there are still cases. It will gather a lot of people, and that's what we are trying to avoid,"" Garcia said, referring to the crowds who are expected to flock to the theaters to watch the film fest entries.
The MMSFF is the first summer film festival in Metro Manila and the Philippines, which is organized by the MMDA and the Cinema Exhibitors Association of the Philippines.
It is a spinoff to the Christmas-season Metro Manila Film Festival (MMFF), which attracts hundreds of thousands of movie goers. In 2020, the MMFF raked in P955 million.
Like the original MMFF, the MMSFF has a parade of stars planned to promote the films.

MANILA, Philippines – At least 6 Filipinos onboard a luxury cruise ship now docked in Oakland, California, tested positive for the novel coronavirus, a Department of Health (DOH) official said on Tuesday, March 10.
Joel Buenaventura, chief health program officer of the DOH's Migrant Health Unit, confirmed this development in a House of Representatives committee hearing.
Buenaventura said the confirmation was based on a report from the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
It is not yet clear if the 6 infected Filipinos are all crew members, or if some are passengers.
The Department of Foreign Affairs earlier said there are 518 Filipino crew members aboard the Grand Princess, while there was no confirmation yet if there are Filipino passengers.
What happened to the cruise ship? The Grand Princess, carrying some 3,533 passengers and crew, had been stranded off the coast of San Francisco since Wednesday, March 4, after two people who had been on the ship during its previous voyage contracted the virus. One later died.
Health authorities sounded the alarm after several passengers who were on the Grand Princess' earlier voyage and remained on the cruise ship for its next stop to Hawaii developed flu-like symptoms.
The United States started testing people onboard the ship last Thursday, March 5, with passengers confined to their cabins to help quell the spread of the virus.
US Vice President Mike Pence earlier announced that as of Saturday, March 7, 21 people out of the 45 tested were found to have the coronavirus disease called COVID-19. They consisted of 19 crew members and 2 American passengers.
The ship finally docked at the port in Oakland on Monday, March 9, and the first passengers started disembarking.
The Grand Princess is operated by Princess Cruises, the same company that runs the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which was quarantined in the port of Yokohama, Japan, last February.
The company as well as Japanese health authorities were widely criticized for their handling of cases after more than 700 people, including 80 Filipino crew members, tested positive for COVID-19. – with reports from Agence France-Presse/Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – The first Filipino coronavirus patient in Hong Kong has recovered and was discharged from the hospital, the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) announced on Tuesday, March 10. 
The DFA confirmed the Filipino, identified as Hong Kong’s 61st case, left the hospital on Friday, March 6, some two weeks after she tested positive for the novel coronavirus disease called COVID-19. 
The Filipino, who remains anonymous, is a 32-year-old domestic worker who contracted the virus after taking care of her employer, a 67-year-old woman who tested positive for virus. 
As for the other 3 Filipinos in Hong Kong infected with the virus, DFA said all patients were still confined in the hospital. 
Like the first coronavirus case, other Filipinos contracted the disease from their employers. 
The DFA gave assurances the Philippine consulate was closely monitoring affected Filipinos and would provide assistance as needed.  
At least 91 Filipinos outside the Philippines have contracted the virus since the outbreak began. This included the 4 cases in Hong Kong, 80 from a cruise ship docked in Japan, 3 in Singapore, 2 in the United Arab Emirates, and 2 in Lebanon. 
 As of Tuesday, the Philippines has recorded 24 confirmed cases of coronavirus. The confirmed cases included two patients who were in “very critical condition” and the first death outside China – a Chinese tourist from Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak. 
Worldwide, the death toll has exceeded 3,800, while more than 111,000 people have been infected in over 100 countries. – Rappler.com

MANILA, Philippines – The 86-year-old American COVID-19 patient in the Philippines is in “critical” condition, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said on Tuesday, March 10.
Duque relayed the condition of the patient – who had a history of travel to the United States and South Korea prior to his arrival in the country – in a chance interview at the Batasang Pambansa on Tuesday, when he was asked for an update about the 24 who tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.
He said that the 62-year-old Filipino man, the first case of local transmission in the Philippines,  was still in critical condition and was intubated.
""'Yung isa naman is the [86]-year-old American. Critical, critical [‘yong sitwasyon nila] (The other is the 86-year-old American. Their situation is critical),"" Duque said.
The 86-year-old American has preexisting hypertension. He had a history of travel to the US and South Korea, where more than 700 and 7,400 people, respectively, tested positive.
The American was admitted in the Medical City-Ortigas in Pasig City, while the 62-year-old Filipino was under observation at the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM)
The 62-year-old Filipino patient had been in a “very critical” condition since Saturday, March 7. He has preexisting hypertension and diabetes. 
On Tuesday, Duque was in the House of Representatives to attend the hearing of the committee on appropriations, which approved the bill allocating a P1.6 billion supplemental budget for the agency’s anti-coronavirus efforts.  
This happened a day after President Rodrigo Duterte declared a state of public health emergency. Classes in Metro Manila were suspended from March 10 to 14.
The DOH has probed a total of 725 patients in the country for possible infection, but only 44 of them remain admitted in medical facilities nationwide. The other 657 have already been discharged. 
Outside the country, at least 91 Filipinos caught 2019-nCoV overseas, including Singapore, Hong Kong, United Arab Emirates, Lebanon, and the M/V Diamond Princess Cruise ship that had been docked in Yokohama, Japan. – Rappler.com  "

MANILA, Philippines – With transportation options usually bursting at the seams, how can commuters evade the coronavirus with the prescribed “social distancing”?
According to Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) Secretary Eduardo Año, they must at least wear face masks and use hand sanitizers.
“We really need preventive measures: to wear face masks, and to have hand sanitizers in place in entance and exits,” Año said in an interview with reporters on Tuesday, March 10, after a meeting with Metro Manila mayors convened as the Metro Manila Council.
Año said mayors would have to agree on how these would be implemented. He added that, if these measures will not suffice, local government units should resort to “special precautionary measures.” He did not elaborate.
On Tuesday morning, Año ordered Metro Manila local officials and cops to bar students from staying in public spaces. The night before, President Rodrigo Duterte ordered the suspension of classes in Metro Manila in all levels, both in public and private schools from March 10 to 14.
The virus has infected at least 24 people in the Philippines, and has placed hundreds more under investigation. The confirmed cases include one death – a Chinese tourist who came from Wuhan in China, the epicenter of the outbreak – the first fatality to be recorded outside of China.

MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – The House committee on appropriations approved reallocating P1.65 billion from the National Treasury to the Department of Health (DOH) to help combat the novel coronavirus outbreak.
Lawmakers unanimously passed the still-unnumbered bill giving additional funds to the DOH on Tuesday, March 10. 
The approved amount, however, is much less than the P3.1 billion the DOH needs to purchase surgical masks and personal protective equipment of some 5,000 health workers on the frontlines of the fight against 2019-nCoV. (READ: 'Coronavirus testing kits must be available in all hospitals' – Zubiri)
The two bills previously filed in the House of Representatives originally sought to give an additional P2 billion to the DOH for its campaign against COVID-19, the disease caused by 2019-nCoV. 
But the National Treasury said during the hearing that only P1.65 billion in excess funds are available to be realigned to the DOH. 
This means the health department will have to source the remaining supplemental funds from its own savings as well as contributions from Pagcor and PCSO. 
Duque told reporters after the hearing that Pagcor has committed to give P2 billion while the PCSO will be providing DOH with P420 million. 
""Okay naman 'yon, dahil karagdagan 'yan, dahil mayroon namang P2 billion na commitment ang (That's okay because those are additional funds on top of the P2 billion committed by) Pagcor. So, so far, that will satisfy our requirement for the personal protective equipment, about P2.25 billion thereabouts. So the other needs, which some congressmen have manifested to take a look at the inventory of respiratories, so hopefully it's enough,"" Duque said
""But if it's not, then the P1.6 billion may be used for procurement,"" he added.
The committee approved the supplemental budget despite being informed by House committee on health chair Angelina Tan that President Rodrigo Duterte refuses to certify the bill as urgent for now. This means the supplemental budget may not be approved this week, as the 18th Congress only has two session days left before it takes a two-month break starting Saturday, March 14.

MANILA, Philippines – The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the use of COVID-19 test kits developed by University of the Philippines (UP) scientists.
The FDA said on Tuesday, March 10, that it issued a Certificate of Exemption for the SARS CoV-2 PCR Detection Kit of the University of the Philippines-National Institute of Health (UP-NIH).
The kit, funded by the Department of Science and Technology, will be used for field testing coupled with gene sequencing at the Philippine Genome Center, the FDA said in a statement.
Heath Undersecretary Eric Domingo, FDA chief, said that the use of the locally-developed test kits would help address the ""increasing number of reported COVID-19 cases"" that ""require immediate diagnosis and monitoring.""
“This will provide our laboratories with technological reinforcement to accommodate the growing number of patients to be tested and aid in early screening of positive cases. Furthermore, this will provide greater access to a less costly diagnostic procedure,” Domingo added.
The FDA said the locally-developed kits supports the Code Red status raised by the Department of Health, and the recent declaration of a state of public health emergency in the country over the threat of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. 
The FDA approved the use of the test kits more than a month after UP-NIH scientists announced the development of the test kit that would help the DOH confirm more COVID-19 cases in the country. 
The total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the Philippines was at 24 as of Monday night, March 9. Of this number, one died – a Chinese tourist who came from Wuhan, China – the first death outside China. – Rappler.com

MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – Students in Metro Manila will be sent home if they are spotted in public spaces to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus, the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) announced on Tuesday, March 10.
“The President has directed all local officials in NCR (National Capital Region) from mayor down to Punong Barangays (village captains) as well as all units of the Philippine National Police to ensure that no children are seen loitering around and, if they are seen, they are to be immediately sent home to do their homework,” said Interior Secretary Eduardo Año.

The DILG has not set a definite period for the implementation of the order.
These places include the following:

Movie houses
Malls
Public markets
Other crowded places

The virus spreads from person to person through sneeze or cough droplets in close contact. As it is a new virus, scientists are still studying how easy the virus spreads.
Other measures: On Monday evening, President Rodrigo Duterte ordered the suspension of classes in Metro Manila in all levels, both in public and private schools from March 10 to 14 also in a bid to prevent any transmission of the virus.
Malacañang issued the directives as the Philippines races to stem the spread of the new virus, which has so far infected at least 24 people, and has placed hundreds more under investigation. The confirmed cases include one death – a Chinese tourist who came from Wuhan in China, the epicenter of the outbreak – the first fatality to be recorded outside of China.
Worldwide, the death toll has exceeded 3,800, while more than 109,000 people have been infected in over 100 countries.
How it will be enforced: The government is counting on cops and barangay officials to send the students home. Año also emphasized the role of parents in helping enforce the order, as they can  keep their kids inside their homes.
""We have no choice but to undertake these measures because public health demands it. Together with sustained hygiene, suspensions of classes and mass gathering will enable us to defeat this virus faster,"" Año added.
Under Section 6 Article III of the Constitution, the government has the power to limit the right of people to travel if it is ""in the interest of national security, public safety, or public health, as may be provided by law."" – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – President Rodrigo Duterte on Monday night, March 9, rejected calls to place Metro Manila on lockdown after health officials recorded a spike in novel coronavirus cases. 
In a late night press conference, Duterte said it was still ""too early"" to implement the sweeping restrictions that would limit people's movements. 
""We have not reached that kind of contamination,"" Duterte said in a late night press conference.
Duterte stressed the need to strike a ""balance"" in response measures to combat the coronavirus crisis as this could affect the transport of and access to necessities like rice and oil. 
Duterte earlier declared a state of public health emergency due to concerns over the virus, which has infected at least 24 people in the Philippines.  
Calls for a lockdown covering the National Capital Region echo China’s and Italy’s unprecedented decision to shutdown large parts of their territory in an effort to quell the spread of the virus. 
China and Italy are among the countries with the highest number of confirmed cases and deaths due to COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. 
For one, China – ground zero for the coronavirus – has the largest number of cases with over 80,000 infected so far. Italy is likewise the country with the third largest number of cases as it recorded over 7,400 who tested positive for the virus.

MANILA, Philippines – Senators on Monday, March 9, expressed dismay over the low number of available novel coronavirus testing kits, with Senate Majority Leader Juan Miguel pointing out that kits must be available in ""all hospitals.""
In a privilege speech on Monday, Zubiri cited a post from social platform Reddit where an unknown user said that a woman was denied testing at a hospital in Bonifacio Global City for not having a history of travel outside the Philippines nor close contact with a confirmed case.
""They should now allow all facilities, both private and public, to utilize and prepare and ready for such an outbreak. The key here is allowing DOH to make testing kits available at all hospitals,"" Zubiri said, as the number of patients with coronavirus disease (Covid-19) spiked to 20.
""So anyone with coughs or colds will be tested. I don't think this is excessive, Mr President. Let's not be complacent. Imagine the superpowers…if they cannot control it, what more we?"" the majority leader added.
So far, the Research Institute on Tropical Medicine (RITM) is the Philippines' sole laboratory accredited by the World Health Organization (WHO) to test novel coronavirus samples.
At the Senate hearing on the economic impact of the virus, Rosanna Ditangco of the RITM said that there are only 2,000 kits available stock on hand.
Because of the limited testing kit supplies, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III on Monday acknowledged that there is a possibility of underreporting, although not intentionally.
""As soon as we get more, then we will be able to expand the coverage of who will be tested. Kasi ngayon ang tinitingnan natin ‘yong mga may sintomas, (Now, we are just looking at those who have the symptoms). Later on, we will do a calibrated approach in expanding who should be prioritized,"" Duque said in a media briefing.
On Monday, the Senate adopted an unnumbered resolution urging the government to release all available funds, including those in the 2019 national budget, as part of an ""economic stimulus"" package to counter the effects of COVID-19.
'Alarming'
At Monday's Senate hearing, the Department of Health's (DOH's) Alethea de Guzman said that there will be some 4,500 extraction kits from the WHO that would be ""good for 2,000 individuals."" Extraction kits are used to check whether the virus is present in an individual.
Senator Nancy Binay chided DOH for the low supply of testing kits in a Senate hearing.
""I don't want to panic but you're making me panic,"" Binay said, referring to Duque's earlier remarks about local transmission being just a question of ""when.""
""Then maririnig namin sa inyo na we only have 2,000 testing kits out of our 100 million population. Hindi ba nakakatakot?"" Binay asked. (Then we hear from you that we only have 2,000 testing kits out of our 100 million population. Isn't this scary?)
De Guzman said that this is exactly the reason why DOH is requesting for a supplemental budget of at least P43 million, but she did not expound on whether it would be used to buy additional testing kits.
Binay said in response: ""Kung 'di tayo nagte-test, hindi natin malalaman."" (If we don't test, then we won't know if there are new cases.) 
In total, Duque had asked for P2 billion for the procurement of protective gear for health workers and another P10 million for face masks in the country. 
Senator Imee Marcos, at a media interview, expressed frustration over DOH, saying that the embattled department has a lot of issues to deal with, yet it has failed to procure testing kits now that they are needed.
""Asan ba ang listahan na paggagamitan na naman ng P2 billion na 'yan? 'Yung P43 million wala raw testing kit ni isa kaya nasa 2,000 na lang sila.… Ano bang mas urgent kaysa sa testing kit? Pambihira naman sila,"" Marcos said.
(Where is the list of items where the P2 billion will be used? I was told that the P43 million will not be used for testing kits but they only have 2,000 in stock. What is more urgent than testing kits? What a shame.)
Marcos added that the department should submit the breakdown of their supplemental budget request so that Congress can act on it.

MANILA, Philippines – Labor group Trade Union Congress of the Philippines (TUCP) on Monday, March 9, urged employers to refrain from using the novel coronavirus outbreak as an ""excuse"" to fire workers.
TUCP made the call over growing fears of ""massive unemployment"" spurred by the rising number of coronavirus cases in the Philippines.
The group appealed to the government for support, particularly for workers who are forced to stay at home or have difficulty going to work.
""Layoffs should be the last option in all of this,"" TUCP spokesperson Alan Tanjusay told reporters in a press conference on Monday.
TUCP earlier estimated some 7,000 layoffs could take place in the next 6 months as the coronavirus crisis deepens. It made the forecast after Philippine Airlines terminated 300 employees, citing losses incurred because of canceled flights due to travel bans, which have severely impacted businesses.
The group said other industries may follow suit and lay off non-essential workers. In particular, it expressed concern for workers in the manufacturing sector, which often observes a ""no work, no pay"" policy.
Aside from manufacturing, TUCP warned that the country's agriculture and logistics sectors may also be hit hard as exports could decrease following the rise in coronavirus cases in the Philippines. (READ: 'A mess': Coronavirus economic impact on Philippines worse than projected)
""Let's hope these are not self-fulfilling numbers.... If you expose workers to wage loss, they will be at the mercy of COVID-19 and poverty,"" Tanjusay said.
He added that while TUCP has not yet received reports of layoffs, some workers reported they were made to observe flexible work arrangements.
What DOLE, employers can do: TUCP urged the labor department to convene all national and regional industry tripartite councils to conduct rapid assessments and risk analyses, as well as craft guidelines to help workers cope.
Tripartite councils – composed of employers, workers, and labor officials – should immediately meet, TUCP said, as they are most familiar with problems faced by businesses and workers, and can come up with preventive measures to save jobs. (READ: Cebu Pacific execs take pay cut to save jobs as coronavirus hurts profits)
Aside from this, TUCP appealed to employers to provide free protective equipment like masks and alcohol for workers in frontline services, such as retail and fast-food chains. The group also advised employers to continuously sanitize business premises.
As of Monday, the Philippines has recorded 20 confirmed coronavirus cases. These include one death – a Chinese tourist – which was the first fatality to be recorded outside of China.

MANILA, Philippines – Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said that despite the rise of novel coronavirus in the country, it is still safe for the public to visit hospitals if they need to see a doctor.  
In a press briefing on Monday, March 9, Duque said that hospitals nationwide ""have infection prevention and control practices in place.""
“We would like to take this opportunity to reassure the public that our hospitals have infection prevention and control practices in place so there is no need to avoid going to these hospitals, especially if you feel unwell,” the Department of Health (DOH) chief said. 
Duque advised those who have gone to places often visited by the 20 confirmed cases of COVID-19 – the disease caused by 2019-nCoV – not to panic. Rather, they should monitor themselves first for possible signs and symptoms of the virus.  
“Let me clarify that all others who have visited places frequented by confirmed cases of COVID-19 are not required to seek medical consultation and subject themselves to COVID-19 laboratory testing. They are advised to self-monitor and if with symptoms, consult health centers or rural health units for appropriate management and monitoring,” Duque said.  
President Rodrigo Duterte already declared a state of public health emergency which paves the way for a more efficient government response to contain the spread of 2019-nCoV.
The DOH, however, has been drawing flak for being too slow to disclose information about patients who tested positive for COVID-19, including the places they frequented and the location of the hospitals they were admitted to.
Duque announced on Monday that the DOH will now be publicizing hospital names “to combat unverified or fake news.” 
Still, the DOH will only test patients already showing respiratory symptoms and who have either traveled to countries with recorded cases of the coronavirus or were exposed to those who already have COVID-19. 
The Philippines now has a total of 20 confirmed cases after the DOH reported that 10 additional patients – all of whom are Filipinos – tested positive for 2019-nCoV. They are all admitted in various hospitals across Metro Manila. (READ: Makati, Pasig, Quezon City take precautions vs novel coronavirus) 
Stay home if showing symptoms
World Health Organization (WHO) Country Representative to the Philippines Dr Rabindra Abeyasinghe also advised people already experiencing respiratory symptoms to stay home, even if they likely do not have COVID-19.  
“We want to reiterate again for people having respiratory signs and symptoms to practice social distancing. Do not go to work, do not go to school, do not go to crowded places if you are having signs of respiratory infection. This may not be largely COVID-19 but it is rational to follow the advise in view of the fact that we are having localized transmission,” Abeyasinghe said during the press conference. 
He said that doing so would help protect the elderly, especially those with pre-existing medical conditions. 
""We recognize the vulnerability of the elderly population in this scenario and we encourage especially those groups to refrain from going to crowded places as much as possible and to ensure that they protect themselves. For this, we need a community-wide reponse. Family members need to support the eldelrly to protect them and minimize their risk of infection,"" Abeyasinghe said.
Worldwide, 2019-nCoV has infected more than 111,200 people and killed over 3,800, majority of whom are from Hubei, China, the epicenter of the outbreak. But more than half or over 62,300 people have already recovered from COVID-19 across the world. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – The Department of Health (DOH) on Monday, March 9, said that isolation hospitals in the Philippines have enough bed capacities for cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. 
“Actually, pinagplanuhan at pinaghanda [natin] ating mga ospital, especially our government hospitals, for these isolation rooms in case that surge capacity ang ating ipapatupad, where 'yung kanilang original bed capacity ay ma-e-exceed nung ating sitwasyon ngayon. So meron ho tao sa ngayon existing. It is enough,” DOH Assistant Secretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said. 
(Actually, we have planned this out and we made sure that our hospitals, especially our government hospitals, have prepared isolation rooms in case we need to implement the surge capacity, where their original bed capacities exceed the needs for the current situation. We have existing [resources]. They are enough.)
Vergiere said the DOH was now changing its quarantine strategy for persons under investigation (PUI). According to her, the DOH was “transitioning to having home quarantine for individuals” with mild cases so hospitals would not be packed with patients. 
“So sa ngayon, 'yon pong ating nakikita na mga tao na mag-e-exhibit ng sintomas, may history of known exposure or history of travel to [countries] with local transmission, ay ina-advise natin ng home quarantine kung mild lang naman po ang sintomas,” said Vergeire. 
(As of now, for those individuals who exhibit symptoms, and have history of known exposure or history of travel to other countries with local transmission, we advise them to do home quarantine if they experience only mild symptoms.)
Vergeire said the quarantine facilities like the one at the New Clark City would not be utilized as much as before now that the DOH’s strategy would start focusing on “early detection, isolation, and management of cases because of our high alert level this time.”
However, if the case is severe, that will be the time the patient will be brought to a referral hospital, said Vergeire. 
On Monday, the DOH confirmed 10 new cases of COVID-19, bringing the total number of cases in the country to 20. This was less than a day after the health department announced 4 new confirmed cases of the disease across 4 cities in Metro Manila late Sunday night, March 8. 
In a press conference last week, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said that the DOH budget of P530 million to help contain the spread of virus would be enough for now while waiting for Congress' approval of the department's proposed P2-billion supplemental budget.
Duque also said the Philippine government was working to have 4 more laboratories across the country accredited by the World Health Organization (WHO) as official testing centers for the coronavirus.

Since the outbreak began, at least 91 Filipinos outside the Philippines have contracted the virus. These include 80 from a cruise ship docked in Japan, 3 in Singapore, 4 in Hong Kong, 2 in the United Arab Emirates, and 2 in Lebanon.
But 40 from the cruise ship, 1 in Singapore, and 2 in Hong Kong have since recovered, leaving 48 still infected as of Monday.
The World Health Organization raised its global risk assessment of the virus to the maximum level. It earlier declared the outbreak an international emergency.
The global death toll has reached 3,819, with 3,119 of the fatalities in China. The number of cases worldwide has risen to 109,946, with 80,735 of the infections in China. The virus has spread to at least 99 countries. – with reports from Agence France-Presse/Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – The Philippines now has a total of 20 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus, after the Department of Health (DOH) reported 10 additional patients who tested positive on Monday, March 9.
This was announced by DOH Assistant Secretary Maria Rosario Vergeire in a press conference on Monday, less than a day after the health department confirmed 4 patients across 4 cities in Metro Manila caught COVID-2019, the disease caused by the virus.  
“The Department of Health reported 10 new confirmed cases of the coronavirus disease 2019 or COVID-19, on top of the 4 new cases announced yesterday, March 8, 2020. This brings the total number of confirmed cases in the country to 20,” Vergeire said. 
All of the new coronavirus patients are Filipinos, at least 3 of whom had not traveled outside the Philippines:

Patient 11: 72-year-old male with no history of travel outside the Philippines
Patient 12: 56-year-old male who traveled to the United Arab Emirates
Patient 13: 34-year-old male who traveled to Australia
Patient 14: 46-year-old male with no travel history outside the Philippines
Patient 15: 24-year-old male, travel history still to be determined
Patient 16: 70-year-old male who got exposed to a COVID-19 case
Patient 17: 69-year-old female who got exposed to a COVID-19 case
Patient 18: 41-year-old male who traveled to Taiwan
Patient 19: 46-year-old female with no travel history outside the Philippines
Patient 20: 48-year-old male who traveled to Japan

They are all admitted to hospitals across Metro Manila. Patient 11 is currently at The Medical Center in Pasig City, while Patients 12 to 15 are admitted to the Makati Medical Center in Makati City.
The 16th and 17th positive cases, meanwhile, are under the care of the UniHealth Parañaque Hospital in Parañaque City, while Patients 18 and 19 are under observation at the Tricity Medical Center in Pasig.
Only the 20th case, the 48-year-old male with travel history to Japan, has been referred to the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM).
Vergeire said samples were taken from the 10 new cases between Friday, March 6, to Sunday, March 8, and the results were released only on Monday. The Research Institute for Tropical Medicine, the DOH’s research arm, is the Philippines' sole laboratory accredited by the WHO that can test novel coronavirus samples.  
Vergeire said the huge jump in the positive cases was supposedly due to the “heightened surveillance” efforts of the DOH. The government is now coordinating with local government units to trace all individuals with whom the 10 patients have made contact. 
The DOH has been drawing flak for being too slow in disclosing important information about the patients who tested positive in the country, with local government units and even companies where the positive cases have been employed announcing ahead of the government.  
DOH said it will only test patients already showing respiratory symptoms and who have either traveled to countries with recorded cases, or who have been exposed to those who tested positive for the virus.  
“DOH urges all individuals who will be [contacted] by surveillance teams to fully cooperate in the investigation and contact-tracing activities. Individuals with history of known exposure to a positive patient and/or history of travel to areas with local transmission, with mild symptoms such as fever, dry cough, fatigue, productive phlegm, sore throat, [and] headache are advised to self-isolate and be home quarantined for 14 days,” Vergeire said.  
Vergeire said patients presenting “severe and critical symptoms” are the ones who need to be immediately admitted to a health facility. 
Of the 20 confirmed cases, the country has recorded one death: a 44-year-old man who traveled to the Philippines from Wuhan, China – the epicenter of the worldwide outbreak. It was the first coronavirus-related death recorded outside China. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – The spread of the novel coronavirus pushed Philippine shares off a cliff, suffering their steepest one-day percentage drop since the 2008 global financial crisis.
On Monday, March 9, the Philippine Stock Exchange index (PSEi) plunged 6.8% and closed at 6,312.61. This is also the biggest one-day point drop since August 2015 and the lowest close since January 2016.
""The main culprit for the major sell-off is the mounting COVID-19 infections in the Philippines.... Worries have escalated on the negative economic impact of the epidemic from tourism, to foreign trade and investments, to supply chains, to possible work suspensions, to consumption, and ultimately, to the laborers who will be the No. 1 victims once the spread worsens,"" said Japhet Tantiangco of Philstocks.
A total of 204 companies suffered losses on Monday, while only 30 companies advanced and 23 remained unchanged.
The most actively traded stocks were in the red. Ayala Land (down 4.7%), Ayala Corporation (down 6.4%), SM Prime (down 6.4%), BDO (down 7.4%), and SM Investments (down 4.3%) all lost value on the first trading day of the week.
The government's economic team has already projected that they are likely to miss their economic growth target in 2020 due to the virus. – Rappler.com "

AKLAN, Philippines – Businesses in Boracay have slashed prices by as much as 50%, just to stay open and attract local tourists as the novel coronavirus spooks the foreign market.
One can now enjoy a sumptuous buffet under P300. Some luxury hotels offer rooms for as low as P3,800 a night (before taxes) from the normal rate of P8,000 to P10,000.
Boracay is now hoping for a surge in local tourists to offset losses from the decline in foreign visitors.
Total tourists in January dwindled by 40% from 172,695 visitors to just 103,834, according to the Malay Municipal Tourism Office.
Bulk of the tourists that visit Boracay are from China. With the travel ban in place, businesses relying mostly on the Chinese market have shut down.
Domestic boost
Domestic tourists increased by 6% to 117,359 in the first two months of 2020. However, this rate is still not enough to keep businesses open.
While prices have gone down, businesses are relying on volume just to break even. So far, the strategy has not worked.
""It's probably the most empty I've seen in almost 20 years of coming to the island,"" said Nowie Potenciano, a local business owner.
He has already closed one restaurant and moved the staff there to his 5 other shops that are struggling to remain open.
""We've heard businesses ask their staff to go on leave for a large amount of time. And when they come back, they don't have long duty days either,"" Potenciano said.
""We're lucky that we haven't reached that point yet. But at the rate that it has been going down, the situation is not looking good,"" he added.

Health Secretary Francisco Duque III clarified on Monday, March 9, that prior to the Philippines declaring local transmission of the virus, it was alright to visit crowded places like malls and hotels, as long as precautionary measures are in place.
He said establishments should have sufficient disinfectants and thermal machines at entry points.
However, government agencies will have to further refine their messaging and protocols now, as local transmission has been confirmed.

MANILA, Philippines – Aviation officials announced on Monday, March 9, that payment of charges for takeoff, landing, and parking will be deferred for local airlines, as the novel coronavirus cripples the industry.
In a press briefing on Monday, Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines Director General Jim Sydiongco said the payment will be deferred for one year.
""We have considered the deferring [of] payment [for] landing and parking while the impact of COVID-19 is present, or even up to a year. Deferment or payable after one year,"" Sydiongco said, referring to the disease caused by the virus.
""Our timeline is, we look at it up to a point of a year of deferment, and payment after one year,"" he added.
Manila International Airport Authority General Manager Ed Monreal clarified that the announcement does not mean waiver of fees. Guidelines will be released on the matter.
Monreal added that recovery is seen to slowly build up after the COVID-19 threat wanes.
""Kahit naman wala nang COVID-19, siyempre ang confidence kasi ng traveling public will still slowly go back. So kailangan natin tantiyahin kung kailan babalik at kailan katagal,"" he said.
(Even if the threat of COVID-19 is no longer there, of course the confidence of the traveling public will still slowly go back. So we need to consider when the demand will go up and when.)
The move would cause at least P58 million worth of deferred payments to the government per month, solely coming from the main gateway, the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA).
""We're seeing around P58 million a month in terms of expenses that cover takeoff and landing, parking, and tracking fees here in NAIA,"" Monreal said.
Despite that, Monreal explained that airports will be able to survive the deferment of fees, as it only covers local airlines.
""Meron po kaming recovery fund so we can still survive. Kasi 'di naman lahat, so we're just deferring payments for landing, takeoff, and parking. Mga terminal fee, babayad pa rin sila. So may portion pa rin to keep us afloat,"" he said.
(We still have a recovery fund so we can still survive. The deferment isn't for everything, just deferring payments for landing, takeoff, and parking. Terminal fees will still be paid. So there's still a portion that will keep us afloat.)
Sydiongco said regional airports have suffered from a 20% to 30% decrease in passengers, while Monreal said NAIA has seen around a 30% drop in passengers or about 476,000 passengers, mostly foreigners.
Monreal hopes local carriers will use their aircraft slots to boost local tourism.
The airline industry has taken a huge hit because of the virus, with flag carrier Philippine Airlines terminating some 300 employees due to losses.
As of Monday, the Philippines has had 10 confirmed cases of the virus. Of the total, 7 are confined, 2 have recovered, while a Chinese tourist died.

In various public addresses, Duterte, who is 74-years-old, claimed he suffered from a slew of medical conditions that include myasthenia gravis, Buerger's disease, Barrett's esophagus, and ""spinal issues,"" among others. In October 2018, Duterte also said he tested for cancer but that it came back negative.
Experts earlier said that older adults with preexisting health conditions were more vulnerable to the coronavirus, particularly those aged over 60-years-old.
The Philippines has so far recorded 10 confirmed cases of coronavirus, including the first death outside of China. Of the remaining 9, two have since recovered and left the country, while the others were being treated.
One patient, a 62-year-old man, was in ""very critical condition"" as of early Saturday morning, March 7, the DOH said. Having no recent history of travel, he is considered the first case of local transmission in the Philippines. 
Meanwhile, the health department said it has probed a total of 700 patients for possible infection, 48 of whom remain admitted in health facilities across the country while 646 have already been discharged.
Duterte has declared a state of public health emergency in the Philippines amid the rising number of cases.

MANILA, Philippines – The government of Cook Islands is prohibiting travelers from the Philippines and 13 other countries from entering its borders due to the outbreak of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. 
“We also have information that the Cook Islands has also restricted travel from certain COVID-affected countries,” said Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) Assistant Secretary Eduardo Meñez, in a press conference in Malacañang on Monday, March 9.
As he was speaking, the DFA official flashed a presentation listing Cook Islands among the foreign countries that have imposed travel restrictions on the Philippines. The others are Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Qatar.  
Apart from the Philippines, Cook Islands is also imposing a travel ban on passengers who have been to the following countries within the last 14 days:

China and its administrative regions Hong Kong and Macau
Taiwan
 Japan
Singapore
South Korea
Malaysia
Thailand
Indonesia
Vietnam
Cambodia
Laos
Italy
Iran

Cook Islands, an associate state of New Zealand, is a self-governed island country located in the South Pacific Ocean. 
In the same press conference, Meñez announced that two Filipinos tested positive for 2019-nCoV in Lebanon, increasing the total number of Filipinos who caught the virus outside the Philippines to 91.  
Locally, the Philippines has reported 10 positive cases so far, including 5 Filipinos, 3 Chinese, one Taiwanese, and one American. One of the 3 Chinese patients died, but the other two have already recovered from COVID-19.

ECONOMIC IMPACT. A shopper wears a mask at the Greenhills Shopping Center in San Juan City. Photo by Inoue Jaena/Rappler  
MANILA, Philippines – The novel coronavirus is seen to spoil the Philippines' economic growth rate in 2020, said Socioeconomic Planning Undersecretary Rosemarie Edillon, which would make the country miss its target.
Speaking at the Senate inquiry on the economic impact of the virus, Edillon said on Monday, March 9, that it may bring down the gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate to the range of 5.5% to 6.5% this year.
""Kung ang target natin (If our target) is 6.5% to 7.5%, then we're looking at 5.5% to 6.5% for the year,"" Edillon said.
Senator Imee Marcos, chairperson of the Senate committee on economic affairs, said the upper-range estimate of the government's economic team may not be feasible anymore.
""Wala na 'yung 6.5%, 5.9% sabihin na lang natin. 'Wag na tayo magtawaran sa numero, masakit sa bulsa 'yan,"" Marcos said.
(6.5% is unrealistic, let's just say 5.9%. Let's not bargain on the numbers, it will hurt our coffers.)
The economic team previously projected that growth would be slashed by 0.2% if the virus would not be contained within a quarter, and up to 0.4% if it drags on until the 1st half of the year.
If China continues to be crippled by the outbreak until June, the Philippine economic team estimates that around 30,000 to 50,000 jobs in manufacturing and tourism would be lost.
The Philippine economic team also expects around 1.42 million tourist arrivals lost, which would amount to foregone gross value added (GVA) of around P93 billion to P187 billion. GVA is the value of goods and services produced in a sector or municipality that contributes to the economy.
Besides that, Edillon said the country may face a wider fiscal deficit of 3.3% to 3.4% of GDP, or equivalent to around P680 billion, higher than the current cap of 3.2%. (READ: [ANALYSIS] How the budget deficit exploded under Duterte's watch)
The deficit ceiling was initially raised to 3% from the Aquino administration's 2%, when the Duterte administration pushed for infrastructure growth. The cap was later revised to 3.2% in 2019.
The Philippines has had 10 confirmed cases of the virus. Of the total, 7 are confined, 2 have recovered, while a Chinese tourist died.

MANILA, Phlippines (UPDATED) – President Rodrigo Duterte declared a state of public health emergency on Monday, March 9, after health officials recorded additional cases of the 2019 novel coronavirus, including the first case of local transmission in the Philippines.
In Proclamation No. 922 signed on Sunday, March 8, and released to media on Monday, Duterte ordered all government agencies and local government units to cooperate and mobilize necessary resources to combat the coronavirus.
Duterte's declaration was based on the recommendation of Health Secretary Francisco Duque III, who earlier raised the Philippines' coronavirus alert system to Code Red-Sublevel 1, due to the first case of local transmission.
Duque earlier said that a state of public health emergency ""will facilitate the mobilization of resources, ease processes including procurement of critical logistics and supplies, and intensify reporting and quarantine measures.""
The Philippines has so far recorded 10 confirmed cases of coronavirus, including the first death outside of China. Of the remaining 9, two have since recovered and left the country, while the others were being treated. One patient, a 62-year-old man, was in ""very critical condition"" as of early Saturday morning, March 7.
The 62-year-old patient, who was reported to frequent a Muslim prayer hall in Barangay Greenhills, is the considered the first case of local transmission in the Philippines.
What to expect: Under a state of public health emergency, Health Assistant Secretary Maria Rosario Vergeire earlier said patients suspected to have the novel coronavirus could face sanctions if they refuse to undergo quarantine.
""Itong (This) state of public health emergency would give the government more authority with regards to this procedure,"" she said.
In the proclamation, Duterte said Duque ""may tap the Philippine National Police and other law enforcement agencies to assist in responding to the outbreak.”
Duterte also urged all citizens, residents, tourists, and business owners to “act within the bounds of the law” and comply with advisories issued by the government to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. 
Duque earlier said that the government was conducting intensified contact tracing, while health officials were preparing for ""possible sustained community transmission.""
""Once there is sustained community transmission or increasing number of local cases whose links cannot be established, the strategy will be shifted from intensive contact tracing, to the implementation of community level quarantine or lockdown and possible suspension of work or school,"" Duque said.
As of Monday, the DOH has probed a total of 700 patients for possible infection, 48 of whom remain admitted in health facilities across the country while 646 have already been discharged.
Meanwhile, at least 89 Filipinos outside the Philippines have contracted the virus since the outbreak began. This included 4 cases in Hong Kong, 80 from a cruise ship docked in Japan, 3 in Singapore, and 2 in the United Arab Emirates. 
As of Sunday, March 8, 40 Filipinos from the cruise ship,1 in Singapore, and 2 in Hong Kong have since recovered.

MANILA, Philippines – Department of Health (DOH) Secretary Francisco Duque III confirmed that the 4 new patients who tested positive for the novel coronavirus are all admitted in private hospitals across Metro Manila.
In an interview with CNN Philippines on Monday, March 9, Duque said that the 4 positive cases are currently admitted in the following cities:

38-year-old Taiwanese male (7th case): Makati Medical Center in Makati City
32-year-old Filipino male (8th case): St Luke’s Medical Center in Taguig City
86-year-old American male (9th case): Medical City-Ortigas in Pasig City
57-year-old Filipino male (10th case) St Luke’s Medical Center in Quezon City

Only patients deemed by doctors as “severe” cases of 2019-nCoV would  be referred to the government’s official referral hospitals like the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) in Muntinlupa City, the Lung Center of the Philippines in Quezon City, and the San Lazaro Hospital in Manila, said DOH Assistant Secretary Maria Rosario Vergeire in a press conference on Monday.
Quezon City Mayor Joy Belmonte said in a speech at city hall on Monday morning that a coronavirus-positive patient is hospitalized in the city’s 1st District.
Vergeire clarified that the patient Belmonte mentioned was among the 10 cases already announced by the Health Department. 
Marikina City Mayor Marcelino Teodoro also confirmed in a statement that the 86-year-old American male is a resident of the city.
Vergeire reminded the public that only persons exhibiting flu-like symptoms after traveling to countries with 2019-nCoV cases or being exposed to confirmed cases should be tested for possible infection.
She explained that the coronavirus symptoms like cough and colds are similar to the symptoms of the common flu. Vergeire said that people who have not been exposed to a positive patient are “at very low risk” of getting COVID-19, the disease caused by 2019-nCoV. 
“But for those people who exhibit signs and symptoms like fever, sore throat, cough and colds without any history of travel at all to those affected areas or without history of known exposure to those positive cases, they don’t need to worry. They [should] just monitor themselves and if symptoms progress, they can consult their doctor. But they are the ones at [ a ] very low risk of contracting this disease,” Vergeire said.
The Philippines now has 10 confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV , including 5 Filipinos, a Taiwanese, an American. The country’s first 3 cases were all Chinese, one of whom died while the other two have already recovered from COVID-19.
The country has also recorded its first local transmission of COVID-19 after a 62-year-old Filipino man with no travel history outside the Phililppines infected his 59-year-old wife. The couple is the country’s 5th and 6th positive cases.
President Rodrigo Duterte is set to issue on Monday an Executive Order formally declaring a state of public health emergency, under which patients suspected to have 2019-nCoV will be required to undergo the 14-day quarantine period. 
The DOH has probed a total of 700 patients for possible infection, 48 of whom remain admitted in health facilities across the country while 646 have already been discharged.
Worldwide, the novel coronavirus has infected more than 109,800 people and killed 3,803, with most deaths still being recorded in Hubei, China, the epicenter of the outbreak. Still, over 60,700 have already recovered from COVID-19. – Rappler.com

MANILA, Philippines (3rd UPDATE) – President Rodrigo Duterte has approved the recommendation of Health Secretary Francisco Duque III to declare a state of public health emergency after the Department of Health (DOH) confirmed the local transmission of COVID-19.
Senator Bong Go was the first to announce this to media on Saturday, March 7. Hours before Go made the announcement, Duque said he had recommended the issuance of the declaration to the Chief Executive in anticipation of the possible sustained community spread of the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.
""Pursuant to the recommendation of the DOH and my suggestion as Chair of the Senate Committee on Health, President Rodrigo Duterte has agreed to issue a declaration of a State of Public Health Emergency due to the confirmation of a local transmission of COVID-19 in our country,"" said Go.
Malacañang issued a similar announcement over an hour later.
""The Office of the President also notes the recommendation of the DOH to declare a State of Public Health Emergency. The said proposal has been raised to the attention of the President who has agreed to issue such declaration after considering all critical factors with the aim of safeguarding the health of the Filipino public,"" said Presidential Spokesman Salvador Panelo.
Duque announced at a news briefing that the DOH raised the conoravirus alert system to Code Red-Sublevel 1 after it ascertained that the country's 5th case of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, got infected locally as he had no history of travel abroad.
""With this Code Red, the DOH has recommended to the Office of the President for the declaration of a state of public health emergency which will facilitate the mobilization of resources, ease processes including procurement of critical logistics and supplies, and intensifying reporting and quarantine measures,"" Duque said.
The DOH raised the COVID-19 alert system as it confirmed the Philippines' 6th case of COVID-19 – the wife of the 5th case, a 62-year-old Filipino man known to frequent a prayer hall at the Greenhills shopping mall in San Juan.
Duque assuaged fears about the raising of the alert level, saying it was just ""a preemptive measure"" that served as a ""signal to all concerned agencies, local governments, health care providers to be ready to [implement] planned response measures.""
At this stage, Duque said, the government will be conducting intensified contact tracing, as well as activation of other laboratories that can diagnose COVID-19. 
""Activation of other labs outside of Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) to increase capacity to diagnose are now being implemented,"" Duque said.
But Duque said that the DOH was also preparing for ""possible sustained community transmission.""
""However, once there is sustained community transmission or increasing number of local cases whose links cannot be established, the strategy will be shifted from intensive contact tracing, to the implementation of community level quarantine or lockdown and possible suspension of work or school,"" Duque said.
""This will be implemented in municipal, city or provincial scale as maybe warranted,"" he added.
He said that if this should happen, health staff and uniformed personnel from unaffected would be tapped. – Rappler.com  "

MANILA, Philippines (3rd UPDATE) – Multinational professional services network Deloitte Philippines confirmed on Saturday, March 7, that one of its employees tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.
Deloitte Philippines, which made the statement in a  Facebook post on Saturday, said the employee was being treated at a hospital.
""The colleague is currently in hospital receiving treatment and further tests, and Deloitte is supporting the colleague and family in every way we can,"" it said.

The company said that ""the health and safety of our people, our clients, and out community is our highest priority, and our immediate response has been to take all necessary actions to manage the situation.""
""Deloitte Philippines continues to comply with the instruction and directions from the Department of Health. All necessary actions were promptly taken to inform those who might have come into contact with the colleague for the appropriate checks and provide any possible form of support,"" it added.
Close coordination
The company did not say in its statement whether the employee was one of the two new COVID-19 patients in the country but Taguig Mayor Lino Cayetano confirmed this in a Facebook post on Saturday.
Cayetano said that the patient, whose office is located in Bonifacio Global City, was put under surveillance of the City Epidemiology and Disease Surveillance Unit (CEDSU) and was admitted to RITM the following day.
“He is currently receiving treatment there and his condition is stable. We continue to monitor his medical status while our CEDSU and city officials have been in close coordination with the concerned property managers. Contact tracing and proper management are ongoing,” he said.
The patient visited Japan and returned to Manila on February 25.
The Taguig mayor also said that local government unit has been in constant communication with the DOH and has been aggressive in reinforcing a two-pronged approach of fighting the virus – through prevention and protection, and monitoring and reporting. 
“The City Government encourages everyone to source their information only from reliable channels and stay calm,” Cayetano said. (LIST: Where to get official, reliable info on novel coronavirus)
DOH reminder
The Deloitte Philippines announcement was apparently made without the knowledge of the Department of Health (DOH).
Following the announcement, the DOH reminded the public that any official announcement regarding COVID-19 cases in the country should only be made by the government, and that anyone with such information should immediately relay it to the DOH for proper handling.
""Only the Secretary of Health has the authority to release such details,"" Health Assistant Secretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said in an interview on DZMM, citing protocols observed by the government in announcing new cases.
She said the DOH is “very careful with the personal information of our patients” as provided under the Data Privacy Act.
Health Secretary Francisco Duque III reiterated this in a press briefing on Saturday, saying that any official announcements on COVID-19 cases in the country should come from the DOH, and urged those with such information to coordinate with the department.
“Our objectives for sharing information are two-pronged: ensure the public's health and safety by facilitating contact tracing and ensure that the individual’s right to privacy is not impinged. Hence, we appeal to all to coordinate closely with the Department of Health when disseminating information to the public and within their respective institutions,"" he said.
""Let us make sure the information sharing process will yield the utmost benefit, and avoid unnecessary stress and stigma to individuals and institutions. The DOH commits to be more circumspect in reporting confirmed cases, to balance interests of public health and privacy. To this end only pertinent information necessary to facilitate contact tracing will be provided to the public, i.e. activity, location and time, if available,"" he added.

MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – The first batch of Filipinos who were repatriated from Macau arrived in Manila late Saturday afternoon, March 7.
A total of 163 ""stranded and distressed"" Filipinos arrived at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport Terminal 1 via a chartered Air Macau flight that landed  at around 4:30 pm on Saturday.
The Department of Foreign Affairs earlier announced that 167 Filipinos were due to arrive, but the total number was 163, composed of 130 adults, 5 children, and, 28 Overseas Workers Welfare Administration members.
Upon arrival at the airport, the repatriates were given a health briefing to guide them on their 14-day self-quarantine. Some of the pointers include wearing a mask when talking to others, disposing of the used mask properly after 8 hours of use, and alerting barangay health workers if they experience any flu symptoms such as cold, cough, and fever.
They also received financial assistance from the government.
The Macau repatriates were among the first batch repatriated from the area amid the continued global spread of the 2019 novel coronavirus. The Philippine government had been coordinating with the Macau government for their return after travel restrictions resulted in lack of direct flights back to Manila.
Health Assistant Secretary Maria Rosario Vergeire earlier said repatriated Filipinos will not be brought to the New Clark City (NCC) in Capas, Tarlac, for quarantine upon landing since they will be subject to home-based quarantine and considered persons-under-monitoring. The DFA gave assurances that all Filipinos coming from Macau were asymptomatic.
Despite this, the DFA said that if some displayed symptoms of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new virus, ""they will be immediately brought to a medical facility for further investigation and treatment if necessary.""
Filipinos repatriated from Macau will comprise the 3rd batch of Filipinos returning to the country as COVID-19 cases of continued to increase worldwide.
The DFA, along with officials from the Department of Health, repatriated on Februrary 9, 30 Filipinos from from China’s Hubei province, the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak. On February 25, a total of 445 Filipinos also returned home from the coronavirus-hit  M/V Diamond Princess cruise ship from Japan.
The Philippines has recorded 5 confirmed cases of coronavirus, including the first death outside of China. Of the remaining 4, two have since recovered and left the country, while the other were being treated. One was in ""very critical condition"" as of early Saturday morning.
Worldwide, the COVID-19 death toll stood at over 3,400 as of Saturday, while over 101,000 people were infected across 84 countries. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – The Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) on Saturday, March 7, urged all Filipinos to postpone upcoming trips to the Holy Land “until further notice” as the 2019 novel coronavirus continues to spread worldwide. The DFA issued the travel advisory as it announced that the Palestinian Authority was implementing a temporary ban prohibiting the entry of tourists to the West Bank, Bethlehem, and Jericho. The sites are among those frequented by tourists and hold significance for participants of prayer pilgrimages. The DFA advised also the public to take note that the Israeli government is implementing measures to restrict all travels to Bethlehem from Israel. “Prospective travelers are therefore advised to coordinate with their tour operators to avoid any inconvenience,” DFA said in an advisory.Israel and the Palestinian Authority are the latest to impose sweeping travel restrictions on holy sites to stem the spread of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus. The sites see thousands of tourists and pilgrims each year, as it holds significance for Jews, Christians, and Muslims. The restrictions can be likened to those recently imposed by Saudi Arabia on “umrah” pilgrims who were set to visit Islam's holiest sites. Worldwide, the COVID-19 death toll stood at over 3,400 as of Saturday, while over 101,000 people had been infected across 84 countries. The Philippines has recorded 5 confirmed cases of coronavirus, including the first death outside of China. Of the remaining 4, two have since recovered and left the country while one is currently being treated and another, in critical condition as of early Saturday morning. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – An elderly Filipino man who tested positive for the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is “in a very critical condition,” Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said on Saturday, March 7
Asked about the condition of the patient amid concerns that the senior citizen, who had preexisting illnesses, was more vulnerable to the new virus, Duque said in a text message to Rappler early Saturday morning, ""As of 1 am, March 7, [he] is still alive but in a very critical condition.""
The 62-year-old man was among the two Filipinos who tested positive for the virus in the country.
Duque was citing the latest update he received from Director Celia Carlos of the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM), where the two COVID-19 patients are currently admitted. 
Even before catching COVID-19, the disease caused by 2019-nCoV, the 62-year-old male was already known to have hypertension and diabetes mellitus. 
He started experiencing cough with phlegm on February 25 and was confined at the Cardinal Santos Medical Center for severe pneumonia on March 1. His specimen was collected for testing on March 4 and he tested positive for the new virus the next day. He was then transferred to the RITM.
The senior Filipino patient had often visited a Muslim prayer room in Barangay Greenhills, San Juan City, prompting Mayor Francis Zamora to temporarily shut down the area to disinfect it.  
Though the patient had no known travel history outside the Philippines, Duque had arlier said previously said it was “premature” to describe him as the country's first local transmission of 2019-nCoV, as the government was still tracing all individuals with whom he had made contact in the past days. 
As of Saturday morning, the Philippines has reported 5 positive cases of COVID-19 – 3 foreigners from China and two Filipinos.  Of the Chinese patients, one died and the other two had recovered.
The DOH has probed a total of 678 patients for possible infection, but only 41 remain admitted in medical facilities nationwide while 634 have already been discharged. – Rappler.com "

CEBU CITY, Philippines – Room occupancies in the Philippines have taken a hit due to the novel coronavirus travel bans, according to the Department of Tourism Central VIsayas.   There was about a 20% reduction in hotel occupancies across Cebu compared to the same period in 2019, the DOT-7 reported.
Shalimar Tamano, DOT-7 regional director, said on Friday, March 6, that this data does not include Air BNB properties.   Hotels in Bohol were hit even harder with a 35% reduction in hotel occupancies compared to the same period in 2019.   Some of the top visitors to the region include countries with known novel coronavirus with 37% of visitors coming from South Korea, 17.63% from China, and 12.85% from Japan. Central Visayas, home to the 2nd largest international airport in the country, received a total of 4.2 million visitors from other countries in 2019.Tourism is a sizeable contributor to the economy of Central Visayas. In 2019, tourism generated about P97 billion in revenues.   Tamano said that he expected the travel bans due to the novel coronavirus would hinder the DOT from hitting its 2020 targets.   “Best case scenario is that we can make up for the loss in the 3rd or 4th quarters,” Tamano said during Friday's press conference.   The first confirmed COVID-19 case traveled through Central Visayas, including Cebu and Dumaguete, before going to Manila.   The 26 South Koreans from virus-hit Daegu City, South Korea, were also quarantined here in Cebu.  According to national data from the Department of Tourism, the Philippines stands to lose P42 billion in revenues due to the coronavirus.
Tamano said they are continuing dialogue with the tourism sector to find short-term solutions for businesses suffering revenue losses.
Some solutions, he said, include tax breaks for hotels, special rates for regional tourists who patronize local hotels, and financial aid from the government.   “Financial aid would be the most challenging because we’re dealing with the BIR (Bureau of Internal Revenue), DBM (Department of Budget and Management), and other agencies,” Tamano said.   While the average occupancy drop was at 20% in Cebu, several higher end hotels which did not want to be named told Rappler they reported up to 40% to 60% reduction in occupancy compared to the same period in 2019.   “But the upside to this is sales and discounts for the local tourists,” the DOT-7 director said.
The Department of Health (DOH) also confirmed on Friday that two Filipinos tested positive locally for the 2019-nCoV. 
Prior to the Filipino cases, the Philippines had 3 confirmed cases who were Chinese tourists. Two of them have already recovered and the other died. As of Friday, the DOH has probed a total of 678 patients for possible infection. Of this number, only 41 remain admitted in hospitals nationwide while 634 have already been discharged. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – Afraid of losing their jobs in China, more than 600 stranded overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) appealed to the Philippine government to lift the travel ban on “safe areas” there so they could go back to work.
The government imposed the travel ban on February 2 as the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak worsened worldwide.
The virus was discovered in the city of Wuhan in China, capital of Hubei province, prompting the lockdown of several provinces, and several countries' travel ban covering the mainland and its special administrative regions.
""We wish the government to review the travel ban and start thinking about our situation. China is a big country and most of the areas have a very few new cases,"" the petitioners said in a statement. 
Reggie Medestomas, 45, who works as a brand director in a consultant firm in Shenzhen, China, started the petition. According to him, some offices in China – which have few recorded cases – have already resumed normal operations.
“Ang office namin nag start na ulit normal operations last February 24. ‘Yung position ko kasi ay kailangan na nandoon ako. Kapag hindi ako makabalik agad, baka mawalan na ako ng trabaho,” he added. 
(Our office has resumed normal operations last February 24. My position in the compnay requires me to be physically there. If I won’t be able to return to China immediately, I might lose my job.)
‘No work, no pay’
As the total ban in mainland China remains in place, OFWs with contracts there worry about making both ends meet, especially since most of them are in a “no work, no pay” arrangement with their employers.

“Ang amortization ko sa bahay buwan-buwan at tution ng mga bata ang magiging problema ko sa mga susunod na buwan (My monthly house amortization and my children’s tuition fees would be a problem in the next months),” said Medestomas. 

The Overseas Workers Welfare Administration (OWWA) has provided P10,000 to each OFW who was supposed to travel back to mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau, but was instead stranded in Manila airports after the announcement of the travel ban. 
The amount, according to the petitioners, is not enough. “Dumadami ang expenses pero wala naman kami income. Wala naman provision ang gobyerno na tutulungan kami sa mga pangangailangan namin habang andito kami (Our expenses are piling up, but we have no source of income. The government has no provision in helping us for our needs while we're here in the Philippines.),” Medestomas said. 
Asked for his message to the government, Medestomas said: “Hayaan lang kami na bumalik kasi may assurance naman na ang employer namin na kami ay iingatan kami kasi part kami ng organization nila.”
(Allow us to go back to China because our employers assured us that they would take care of us since we are part of their organization.) 
On February 18, the Philippine government’s Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID) allowed OFWs to return to their jobs in Hong Kong and Macau. This was after some 25,000 stranded OFWs and Hong Kong residents organized themselves and urged the government to exempt them from the ban. 
Medestomas told Rappler that Migrante International will be organizing a press conference on Monday, March 9, to urge the government to allow OFWs to return to “safe areas” in mainland China. 
Over 80,500 have been infected by 2019-nCoV in mainland China as of Friday, March 6. A total of 3,042 have died from COVID-19 – the disease caused by the virus – nationwide.
The Department of Health (DOH) also confirmed on Friday that two Filipinos tested positive for the 2019-nCoV locally. 
Prior to the Filipino cases, the Philippines had 3 confirmed cases who were Chinese tourists. Two of them have already recovered and the other died. 
As of Friday, the DOH has probed a total of 678 patients for possible infection. Of this number, only 41 remain admitted in health facilities nationwide while 634 have already been discharged. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – San Juan City Mayor Francis Zamora has temporarily shut down  the Muslim prayer hall in Barangay Greenhills that was frequently visited by a Filipino man who tested positive for the novel coronavirus (2019-nCov).
The prayer hall will be disinfected and sanitized, said Zamora in a statement around two hours after the Department of Health (DOH) confirmed two Filipinos caught the virus locally, bringing the number of confirmed cases in the Philippines to 5. 
One of the two positive cases is a 62-year-old male who often visited the Muslim prayer hall while the other is a 48-year-old Filipino who traveled to Japan.
“I have already instructed the San Juan City Health Office, with the support of the Department of Health, to immediately disinfect, sanitize, and close to the public temporarily the prayer room in Barangay Greenhills, which was frequented by a patient who lives in a municipality near Metro Manila whom the DOH has confirmed positive with coronavirus,” Zamora said.
The mayor said San Juan is working closely with the DOH to trace all the people with whom the COVID-19 patient had contact with in the past days. 
He then advised the public to exercise all safety precautions against COVID-19, the disease caused by 2019-nCoV. 
“I encourage the public to stay calm, practice proper hand washing using soap and water or alcohol, and executive proper cough etiquette. Finally, avoid going to crowded places, keeping at least a one-meter distance from other people,” said Zamora. 
The 62-year-old coronavirus patient has no known travel history outside of the country, but the DOH said it was not yet recognizing him as a positive case of local transmission in the Philippines.
In a separate statement, the Cardinal Santos Medical Center (CSMC) located in San Juan also confirmed that it had nursed the 62-year-old man before he was transferred to the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine in Muntinlupa.
""Cardinal Santos Medical Center took care of a male patient who had no history of travels or contact with those who traveled to the countries enumerated to have experienced positive COVID-19,"" the hospital management said.
The patient, who continued showing symptoms, was transferred to RITM so he could have the ""best care.""
The CSMC management then assured the public that they have taken ""all the precautionary measures"" necessary for all personnel who had been exposed to the coronavirus-positive case. None of them have shown flu-like symptoms so far.
Prior to the two Filipino cases, the Philippines previously reported that 3 Chinese nationals tested positive for COVID-19. One died, while the other two already recovered.
Three foreigners from Taiwan, Japan, and Australia also caught the virus after traveling to the Philippines. 
As of Friday, the DOH has probed a total of 678 patients for possible infection. Of that number, only 41 remain admitted in health facilities nationwide while 634 have already been discharged. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines (3rd UPDATE) – The Department of Health (DOH) confirmed that two Filipinos tested positive for the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) for the first time in the Philippines, bringing the total confirmed cases in the country to 5.
In a press conference on Friday, March 6, DOH Secretary Francisco Duque III said the 4th positive case in the Philippines is a 48-year-old male Filipino who visited Japan and returned to Manila on February 25.  
He started experiencing symptoms such as chills and fever on March 3, but is currently in a ""stable"" condition.The second new confirmed case is a 62-year-old Filipino male with known pre-existing conditions of hypertension and diabetes mellitus who started experiencing cough with phlegm on February 25. 
He sought medical consultation at a hospital in Metro Manila on March 1 and was admitted with severe pneumonia. The man frequented a Muslim prayer hall in San Juan City. 
Both cases are admitted at the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM).
This 5th case has no known travel history, but Duque said it cannot be treated as a confirmed local transmission of COVID-19 – the disease caused by 2019-nCoV – for now.“There is no transmission to speak of as of [now]. There’s only one. That’s why we’re doing contact tracing…But now it’s premature to say that there’s local transmission,” Duque said. 
Contact tracing
The DOH and concerned local government units are now tracing all the individuals the two additional confirmed cases came in contact with.
“These recent developments are significant, but we are prepared to respond to its potential consequences. Our priority is to protect our health workers and the most vulnerable populations,” Duque said. 
“We can still contain the spread of the virus in the country, which is why we are encouraging the public to practice proper handwashing, social distancing, and cough etiquette. We call on the public to be vigilant and continue doing their part in containing the disease,” he added.
Prior to the two Filipino cases, the Philippines previously reported that 3 Chinese nationals tested positive for COVID-19. One died, while the other two already recovered. 
The Philippine government has long been criticized for not testing a larger part of the population for possible infection. 
The RITM is the country’s sole laboratory accredited by the World Health Organization (WHO) to test 2019-nCoV samples. It uses a testing method that yields results within 24 to 48 hours, much slower compared to the speed of the rapid diagnostic testing (RDT) kits that countries like South Korea is using. The DOH is now eyeing 4 more hospitals across the country to be accredited by the WHO as official testing centers for 2019-nCoV.
Duque, however, still does not want to use the RDTs to expand the Philippines' testing samples, arguing these have not been accredited by the WHO yet. 
‘Wake up call’
Senator Risa Hontiveros said the latest COVID-19 cases in the country, as well as confirmed cases abroad involving people who traveled to the Philippines, should be a “wake up call” to Philippine health officials.
“This is a cause for concern and a wake-up call for our health officials. We should not give the public a false sense of security because the danger of local transmission is real,” Hontiveros said in a statement on Friday.
She urged the Doh to review its screening and testing protocols, following the latest cases.
“Parang hindi sapat (It seems that it is inadequate). DOH should intensify its monitoring and surveillance to include all travelers, not just those who come from countries with high prevalence of COVID-19,” the senator said.
“A weak health system poses a risk to public health. We need the DOH to be hawk-eyed and transparent with the public every step of the way,” she added.
Worldwide, a total of 90 Filipinos caught the novel coronavirus in the past weeks, including the two new cases recorded in the Philippines on Friday.Of this number, 80 were infected with 2019-nCoV while aboard the cruise ship Diamond Princess that was docked for days at the port of Yokohama in Japan. Another two Filipinos tested positive in the United Arab Emirates, while Singapore reported 3 cases. Another 3 Filipinos got 2019-nCoV in Hong Kong.Still, 40 of the Filipinos from Diamond Princess and one case from Singapore already recovered from the coronavirus.– Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – The Philippine Department of Health (DOH) just opened an account on Chinese-owned video-sharing platform TikTok as part of its campaign to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which also originated from China. 
On Thursday, March 5, the DOH’s official Facebook account shared a video of 3 of its personnel dancing to the song “The Weekend” while tips on how to prevent COVID-19 – the disease caused by 2019-nCoV – flashed on the screen. 
The health department’s 6-minute TikTok video advised its viewers to wash their hands, maintain a one-meter distance from their neighbors, avoid touching their face, and follow proper cough etiquette.

The video was an instant hit among Facebook users, garnering 68,000 views and 2,300 shares as of 8:20 pm on Thursday. (READ: PH coronavirus watch: Suspected cases per region, as of March 5, 2020)
The DOH post then asked the public to “join the #covidance challenge” and follow their official TikTok account.
“DOH is officially on Tiktok! Learn protective measures against COVID-19 in this TikTok video! Join the #covidance challenge!” the post read.
The DOH is not alone in tapping the video-sharing app widely popular among teens worldwide to help stop the spread of COVID-19. The Department of Tourism has also started encouraging Filipino millennials addicted to TikTok to help address the economic impact of the novel coronavirus.  
But United States lawmakers and intelligence officials already expressed concern over TikTok’s connections with Beijing, arguing the video-sharing app could become another tool exploited by China for espionage activities. 
As of 8:30 pm Thursday, the Philippines has recorded only 3 positive cases of COVID-19, all of whom were Chinese nationals who traveled from Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak that has so far killed 2,902 people in that province alone. 
Of the 3 positive cases in the Philippines, one died while the other two already recovered. There are also 669 patients under investigation by the DOH for possible infection. Only 37 of them remain admitted to hospitals, while 629 have already been discharged.  
Worldwide, the death toll due to the coronavirus stood at over 3,200, while over 95,000 people were infected across at least 84 countries. – Rappler.com  "

Since the outbreak began, 88 Filipinos have contracted the virus, all based outside the Philippines. These include 80 from a cruise ship docked in Japan, 3 in Singapore, 3 in Hong Kong, and 2 in the United Arab Emirates.
But 40 from the cruise ship and 1 in Singapore have since recovered, leaving 47 still infected as of Thursday
The World Health Organization raised its global risk assessment of the virus to the maximum level. It earlier declared the outbreak an international emergency.
The global death toll has reached 3,279, with 3,015 of the fatalities in China. The number of cases worldwide has risen to 95,265, with 80,565 of the infections in China. The virus has spread to more than 70 countries. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – Saudi Arabia is imposing a travel ban on tourists from countries, including the Philippines, judged to pose ""a particularly high risk"" of spreading the 2019 novel coronavirus, the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) announced late Wednesday night, March 4.
Aside from tourist visa holders, the Saudi government is also banning the entry of ""umrah"" pilgrimage visa holders to quell the spread of the virus.
The advisory follows days of confusion over the exact scope of the Saudi government's travel restrictions first implemented last February 27.
Saudi Arabia earlier announced the unprecedented decision to ban ""umrah"" pilgrims from visiting Islam's holiest sites to try to contain the spread of the coronavirus. The kingdom added it was also suspending visas for tourists visiting from countries where the new virus is a ""danger.""
But despite restrictions limited to pilgrims and tourist visas, the Philippine government sought to clarify the full scope of the Saudi government's travel ban, following reports that some Filipinos traveling to Saudi Arabia were unable to enter the country for other purposes.
Following this, the DFA said among Filipinos exempted from the Saudi government's ban are those who hold visas for the following purposes:

Employment
Work visit
Business visit
Family visit

Filipinos holding these types of visas will still be allowed entry into Saudi Arabia, the DFA said.
Aside from this, the Saudi government announced it is suspending the issuance of entry visas for the ""umrah"" pilgirms, visits to the Prophet's mosque in Medina, as well as tourist visas ""indefinitely"" due to the coronavirus crisis.
The DFA gave assurances the Philippine Embassy in Riyadh and the Philippine Consulate General in Jeddah are closely monitoring the situation and are coordinating with the concerned agencies of the Saudi government.
Filipinos on their way to Saudi Arabia who experience problems related to these travel restrictions can call the embassy at (+966-11) 482-0507, or the consulate at (+966-12) 667-0925 and (+966-12) 669-6303.
As of Wednesday night, Saudi Arabia recorded one confirmed case of the novel coronavirus.
Worldwide, the death toll due to the coronavirus stood at over 3,200 as of Wednesday, while over 93,000 people were infected across 81 countries.
The Philippines, meanwhile, earlier recorded 3 confirmed cases of coronavirus – all Chinese tourists – including the first death due outside China. The other two cases have since recovered and left the country. – Rappler.com "

MORE LABS. Health Secretary Francisco Duque III gives an update on the status of the novel coronavirus in the Philippines. File photo by Inoue Jaena/Rappler  
MANILA, Philippines – Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said the Philippine government is working to have 4 more laboratories across the country accredited by the World Health Organization (WHO) as official testing centers for the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). 
""We are now expanding our testing capacity. We have 5 sub-national laboratories that are up for accreditation by RITM (Research Institute for Tropical Medicine). These are one in Visayas, one in Mindanao, one in Northern Luzon, and another one in Metro Manila. So we will have 5,"" Duque said in a press conference on Wednesday, March 4. 
He said specialists from the WHO are currently in the country to help set up the capacities of the following hospitals so they will soon be ready to test 2019-nCoV samples: 

Vicente Sotto Memorial Medical Center in Cebu City
Southern Philippines Medical Center in Davao City
Baguio General Hospital in Baguio City
Lung Center of the Philippines in Quezon City

The RITM – the health department's research arm – is the Philippines' sole laboratory accredited by the WHO that can test 2019-nCoV samples. But if all goes well, Duque hopes the 4 other laboratories would also get accredited within a month or two. 
""Mayroong timeline 'yan. In fact sabi sa akin parang 8 weeks. Pero sabi ko baka puwedeng 4 weeks lang. Kasi 'yung 8 weeks parang ang tagal kako, so 4 weeks. So susubukan,"" the DOH chief said. 
(We have a timeline for that. In fact I was told the process will take about 8 weeks. But I said perhaps we can do it in just 4 weeks because 8 weeks just seem too long. So we'll try.)
Currently, the RITM is running tests with primers from a referral laboratory in Japan, of which it has a limited supply. 
Duque explained the machine used in this testing method tends to yield results between 24 to 48 hours – a longer process compared to the rapid diagnostic testing (RDT) kits used by countries like South Korea to identify 2019-nCoV cases.
He then addressed criticisms hurled at the Department of Health for not testing a larger part of the population for possible infection. 
In comparison, South Korea – where a total of 5,621 people have caught the 2019-nCoV – has been testing its residents by the thousands every day, a feat the Philippines just isn't capable of doing for now.  
Duque, however, is unfazed, arguing the DOH would rather stick to a WHO-accredited process that will not yield ""false negative"" results. 
The DOH chief said he had even talked to the ambassadors of South Korea and Japan to ask if their RDTs have already been vetted by the WHO. (READ: Test kits for novel coronavirus need WHO validation before use – DOH)
""Because the last thing I want to have is a rapid diagnostic test where it might produce false negatives. Nakakatakot 'yon! I'll say negative ka (That's scary! I'll say you tested negative), then I'll let you go out, then you're really positive…. I'm not into just using RDT that has not been vetted by a third party, a credible third party,"" Duque said.  
As of Wednesday, the Philippines has recorded no local transmission of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. A total of 39 persons under investigation are still admitted to hospitals, while the other 620 have already been discharged.  
Only 3 confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV have been recorded in the Philippines, all of whom were Chinese nationals who traveled from Hubei province, the epicenter of the outbreak. One died, but the other two recovered from the disease.

MANILA, Philippines – Labor Secretary Silvestre Bello III on Wednesday, March 4, denied the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak had a severe impact on overseas Filipino workers' employment, as he asserted cases of domestic workers displaced in Hong Kong were only ""isolated"" incidents.
Bello issued the remarks in a press conference with reporters at the Department of Labor and Employment's headquarters in Manila, saying there was ""no alarming rate of unemployment to our overseas workers.""
""That’s not true, we’re not losing workers overseas except for some few requests for repatriation. Wala naman ganung (There is no) loss of work if you’re talking of Hong Kong, Japan, and even Taiwan,"" Bello said.
""There are no incidents of unemployment. There are isolated cases, but by and large, there is no alarming rate of unemployment to our overseas workers,"" he added.
At least 40 Filipino domestic workers in Hong Kong were displaced from work as of Tuesday, March 3, according to figures from the Philippine Consulate in Hong Kong, Philippine Overseas Labor Office, and Overseas Workers Welfare Administration (OWWA).
According to OWWA Administrator Hans Cacdac, 35 of the 40 were let go by their employers, who had plans to relocate from the city. Others, he added, were fired in relation to issues regarding days off.
This came after the Hong Kong City’s labor department earlier urged domestic workers not to leave their employers’ homes for their days off, saying it could reduce the risk of transmission. Some employers misunderstood the advisory as mandatory, leaving many workers unable to take days off or punished if they did.
Meanwhile, Bello downplayed challenges that may be faced by affected overseas Filipino workers when looking for new employers. He expressed confidence that many would find work as Filipino workers have become ""very indispensable.""
""We're not alarmed of any employment loss,"" he said.
Despite this, Bello assured workers the Philippine government was ready to repatriate them and provide aid in case they returned to the Philippines.
Cacdac earlier said the Philippine government was helping affected Filipino workers in filing complaints related to their right to take days off. Efforts were also being carried out to assist displaced workers in claiming settlements against their employers. – Rappler.com "

FLEXIBLE WORK. Metro Manila commuters wear face mask as protection from the coronavirus on February 3, 2020. Photo by Jire Carreon/Rappler 
MANILA, Philippines – The Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) on Wednesday, March 4, issued guidelines that employers should follow when implementing flexible working hours in response to the ongoing 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak. “The objective (of flexible working hours) is to help both employer and employees to get over the hump (caused by the coronavirus),” DOLE Undersecretary Ana Dione told reporters in a press conference on Wednesday. DOLE said implementing flexible working hours was among the measures taken by the department to avoid “outright termination of employees” or “total closure” of establishments. (READ: A mess': Coronavirus economic impact on Philippines worse than projected)According to Dione, implementing flexible working arrangements will not be mandatory for employers, who will have full say on whether or not to take such measures. “The effectivity and implementation of any of the flexible work arrangements shall be temporary in nature, subject to the prevailing conditions of the company,” DOLE said.
Why this matters. Labor group Trade Union Congress of the Philippines (TUCP) earlier estimated some 7,000 layoffs and retrenchments could take place in the next 6 months amid the growing coronavirus outbreak crisis. 
TUCP made the forecast after Philippine Airlines terminated 300 employees, citing losses incurred because of canceled flights due to coronavirus travel bans, which have severely impacted businesses. The group said other industries may follow suit and lay off non-essential workers.
Aside from flexible working arrangements, Labor Secretary Silvestre Bello said the department will also require regional and overseas labor offices to submit daily reports on workers displaced by the coronavirus outbreak. He likewise gave assurances affected workers will be provided livelihood and financial assistance.

What employers need to know. DOLE Department Advisory No. 1 series of 2020, issued on Wednesday, listed the following arrangements employers may consider:

Reduction of work hours and/or work days: Normal work hours or work days per week are reduced
Reduction of workers: Employees are rotated or alternately provided work within the week 
Forced leave: Employees are required to go on leave for several days or weeks using leave credits

Meanwhile, DOLE urged employers and employees to discuss other possible alternative work arrangements to ease the effects of loss of income on employees. Employers and employees will be responsible for administering and supervising flexible work arrangements should they opt to implement it, DOLE added. If employers and employees disagree on the interpretation of the arrangements, DOLE said differences can be tackled under the company’s grievance system.In cases where no system for dealing with grievances is in place, regional labor offices where workplaces are registered will have jurisdiction over conciliatory talks. DOLE said employers who will implement flexible working arrangements must ensure documents are kept on record as proof the measure was adopted. Employers will also need to inform regional or provincial labor offices if flexible work arrangements are adopted. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – The Philippines is tapping millennials addicted to popular video-sharing social networking app TikTok to address the economic impact of the novel coronavirus.
On Wednesday, March 4, Tourism Assistant Secretary Howard Lance Uyking said that the campaign, which uses the hashtag #GoCreatePH, invites Filipinos to dance while featuring their hometown’s tourism spots.
“It’s a crowdsourcing initiative for people to promote where they are in order to entice people to travel,” Uyking said. 
The campaign has over 15 million views on TikTok as of writing.

The effort is reminiscent of the Department of Tourism's (DOT) award-winning ""It's more fun in the Philippines"" campaign, where the promotions also banked on crowdsourced content to amplify its messaging.
Will President Rodrigo Duterte be featured on the campaign? Tourism officials are keeping other details of the campaign under wraps, but they said that this is a possibility.
Duterte is set to visit Boracay in March to encourage Filipinos to travel.
The Philippines stands to lose at least P42.9 billion in tourism revenues due to the threat of the novel coronavirus.
Tourist arrivals in popular destinations like Boracay, Cebu, and Bohol declined significantly in February.
The DOT will be spending P6 billion to support local tourism. 
Hotels and airlines have slashed prices just to encourage travel.
The DOT said that travelling around the country is safe, as the Philippines has not recorded domestic transmission. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines –  Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said the Department of Health (DOH) can use P530 million of its 2020 budget to help contain the spread of the novel coronavirus while waiting for Congress approval of its proposed P2-billion supplemental budget.
Duque gave the assurance in a press conference, when asked if the DOH had enough funds to sustain government efforts to stem the spread of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new virus, without a supplemental budget.
“Yes! We have enough budget. I just received a guidance from the DBM (Department of Budget and Management) during our Cabinet meeting last Monday and he (DBM Secretary Wendel Avisado) has pointed out to us that we have about close to P530 million available budget of the DOH that we can use in the meantime that we are waiting the P2-plus billion,” Duque said. 
He stressed the importance of the the DOH's requested supplemental budget, which would be used  to purchase surgical masks and personal protective equipment of some 5,000 health workers in the frontlines of the fight against the new coronavirus.
Two bills were filed at the House of Representatives seeking to give an additional P2 billion to the DOH for its campaign against COVID-19.
The House committee on appropriations has yet to approve the measures due to the ongoing power struggle in the House. Davao City 3rd District Representative Isidro Ungab was sacked as House appropriations panel chairman on Tuesday, March 3, and was replaced by ACT-CIS Representative Eric Yap. 
Under the 1987 Constitution, all bills on the national budget must first be passed by the House before they can be voted upon by the Senate.
When asked, Duque declined to comment on whether he thought the alleged coup against Speaker Alan Peter Cayetano was delaying the approval of DOH’s additional funds. 
“Wala akong inside information [tungkol sa] nagpalitan ng mga chairmanships so I don’t know how that one is affecting [our budget proposal]. But we have been writing follow-up letters,” Duque said. 
(I have no inside information about the changing of chairmanships so I don’t know how that one is affecting our budget proposal. But we have been writing follow-up letters.) 
The DOH chief planned to write a new follow-up letter addressed to Yap to expedite the approval of the  supplemental fund. 
Of the total of 662 patients probed by the DOH for possible infection, only 39 remain admitted in hospitals nationwide as of Wednesday afternoon. The other 620 patients under investigation have been discharged.

MANILA, Philippines – The Department of Tourism (DOT) will be spending some P6 billion to boost the tourism industry, which is heavily hit by the global spread of the novel coronavirus.
On Wednesday, March 4, Tourism Secretary Bernadette Romulo Puyat said the DOT's tourism resiliency program will focus on promoting domestic destinations and on assuring the public that it is safe to travel in the Philippines.
The money for the program will come from a pooled fund from various agencies.
Of the amount, P2.2 billion will be allocated for infrastructure development and expansion, which will be determined together with local government units of top tourist destinations.
P1.6 billion will be used to improve secondary airports.
Some P500 million is allocated for a sewerage treatment plant in Coron, Palawan, while P300 million will go to various projects in Puerto Galera, Oriental Mindoro.
P725 million will be used to mount tactical programs, international events, and market initiatives.
P421 million will be spent on developing new campaigns, while P467 million will be used to create ""engaging content"" tailored for countries that are not affected by the novel coronavirus.
P85 million is earmarked for orientation and emergency response protocols training.
The Philippines stands to lose at least P42.9 billion in tourism revenues due to the threat of the novel coronavirus.
Tourist arrivals in Boracay declined significantly in February, amid travel restrictions imposed to prevent the spread of the virus. From the 172,695 visitors in January, the number dwindled by 40% to 103,834.
Hotel occupancy rates have also declined by 27% in Cebu and 40% in Bohol, according to Puyat.
Aside from additional funding, Puyat said President Rodrigo Duterte is set to visit Boracay in March to encourage tourists to visit the rehabilitated island. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines  – Fifteen of the 16 Filipino repatriates from the Diamond Princess cruise ship who showed flu-like symptoms while quarantined at New Clark City (NCC) have tested negative for the coronavirus.
The Department of Health (DOH) on Wednesday, March 4, said that the 15 repatriates have already recovered from their symptoms and were asked to return to New Clark City to finish their 14-day quarantine.
 “Labing-lima po sa kanila ay nakabalik na sa New Clark City dahil ang kanilang mga test ay negative na (Fifteen of them have already returned to New Clark City because they tested negative for the disease),"" said DOH Assistant Secretary Maria Rosario Vergeire.
Vergeire said the one remaining case at NCC is experiencing diarrhea. 
The 16 repatriates are among the 538 Filipinos who had been quarantined aboard the Diamond Princess docked at the port of Yokohama, Japan, since the outbreak of the novel coronavirus, which infected a total of 763 people aboard the ship.
As of Wednesday, the DOH said it has probed into 662 cases for possible infection. Of this number, 620 have been discharged and 39 remain in hospitals. There had been 3 confirmed cases who were Chinese tourists. Two of them have already recovered and the other died. There is still no recorded local transmission in the country.
No definite time yet
Meanwhile, the DOH said that there is no definite time yet this week for the repatriation of Filipinos in Macau. The repatriates from Macau will be categorized as persons under monitoring (PUM).
PUMs are individuals who have not shown any symptoms of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), but have traveled in the past 14 days to areas with issued travel restrictions, or have been in contact with a confirmed or probable case of COVID-19.
The Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) on Tuesday, March 3, announced it will repatriate 148 Filipinos from Macau amid the continued global spread of the novel coronavirus.
The Overseas Workers Welfare Administration (OWWA) said it will repatriate 48 of its active members from the area. The repatriated Filipinos will return to the Philippines via a chartered flight, while OWWA members will arrive via one commercial flight.
The DOH said that the DFA and the OWWA will have separate repatriation intiatives. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – Half of the 80 Filipinos who caught the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) while aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship docked in Yokohama, Japan, have already recovered.
Department of Health (DOH) Assistant Secretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said that as of Wednesday, March 4, 40 out of the 80 Filipinos no longer have COVID-19, the disease caused by 2019-nCoV, and will now be allowed to go back to the Philippines.
The rest remain admitted in hospitals in Tokyo, Japan.
""'Yung sa Japan, we had a total of 80 positive cases. So sa ngayon po, 40 na lang po 'yung naka-admit sa mga different facilities or ospital sa Tokyo tapos naka-recover na 'yung 40,"" Vergeire said. 
(For those in Japan, we had a total of 80 positive cases. So now, only 40 of them remain admitted in different facilities or hospitals in Tokyo while the other 40 already recovered.) 
Of the 40 Filipinos who recovered, 21 have already been repatriated to the Philippines and are being treated as ""persons under monitoring"" by the government.
This means they are required to undergo another 14 days of quarantine at their respective homes. The DOH and the local government units where their residences are located will then regularly monitor their health during the self-quarantine period.
Another 19 Filipinos who recovered from COVID-19 are still in Japan, but their repatriation is already being processed by the Philippine government.
The Diamond Princess cruise ship carried about 3,700 people – among them 531 Filipino crew members and 7 Filipino passengers – when it reached the port of Yokohama in January.
The Japanese government then quarantined the cruise ship after an 80-year-old passenger who disembarked on January 25 in Hong Kong tested positive for the deadly virus. (READ: All crew members have left virus-hit ship in Japan – minister)
Since then, 705 cruise ship passengers and crew members of different nationalities have been found to have COVID-19, including the 80 Filipinos.
The Philippine government already repatriated another 458 Filipinos from Diamond Princess who did not catch the virus while inside the cruise ship.
They are currently finishing their 14-day mandatory quarantine period – set to end on March 11 – at the New Clark City in Capas, Tarlac, the country's designated national quarantine facility for COVID-19.
Aside from those who were aboard the cruise ship, 7 other Filipinos abroad tested positive for the virus: 2 each in the United Arab Emirates and Hong Kong, and 3 in Singapore. One of the Filipinos in Singapore has since recovered. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – As the 2019 novel coronavirus continues to spread worldwide, an increasing number of Filipino domestic workers in Hong Kong have lost their jobs after employers fired them over mounting concerns spurred by the global health crisis.
The Philippine Consulate in Hong Kong, Philippine Overseas Labor Office, and Overseas Workers Welfare Administration (OWWA) received reports some 40 Filipino domestic workers from the city were displaced as of Tuesday, March 3.
Of the 40, 35 were let go by their employers, OWWA Administrator Hans Cacdac announced on Twitter.
Why are workers losing their jobs? The reasons for firing domestic workers range form employers' supposed relocation amid slowing business operations to issues regarding days off taken by workers.
According to Cacdac, 16 out of 35 Filipinos reported being fired after employers claimed they were leaving the city, where 100 confirmed coronavirus cases have been found as of Tuesday afternoon. Among those infected were two Filipino domestic workers. 
Meanwhile, 12 of the 35 employer-initiated terminations were due to issues regarding rest days.
Hong Kong City’s labor department earlier urged domestic workers not to leave their employers’ homes for their days off, saying it could reduce the risk of transmission. But a report by the South China Morning Post, based on accounts from migrant groups, said employers have taken the suggestion too far as they misinterpreted the government’s advisory as a mandatory measure.
The situation has left many domestic workers prohibited from leaving their homes on days off, but still made to carry out work errands such as going to the market and buying supplies outside.
How did the Philippines respond? Upon hearing of reports of fired workers, Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr said he was ""deeply disgusted"" with the city, which ""begged"" the Philippines to allow domestic workers to return.
""When the West turned on China for COVID-19 I stood up for her before the vicious West at the ASEAN-COVID 19 MEETING. I said that I begged my President to let Filipino domestic workers return to their jobs in HK showing my trust in the Chinese city. This I guess is thank you,"" Locsin said.

We'll prepare for their repatriation pronto. Deeply disgusted with HK wch begged us to let domestic workers return to work. I extracted promise from Chinese ambassador that they'd be given same protection from COVID-19 as HK residents. I shoulda specified ""from Hongkongers."" https://t.co/3Ly1CHCfCm— Teddy Locsin Jr. (@teddyboylocsin) March 3, 2020

Locsin was referring to the Philippines' earlier decision to allow stranded OFWs to return to work in Hong Kong and Macau, provided they sign a declaration stating they know and understand the risks involved.
Cacdac said the Philippine government is now helping concerned overseas Filipino workers in filing complaints related to workers' rights to take days off. Efforts are also underway, he added, to assist displaced workers in claiming settlements against their employers.
Aside from this, OWWA will also provide aid to displaced OFWs who decide to permanently return to the Philippines.
Cacdac said majority of domestic workers displaced due to their employers' relocation have returned to the Philippines to await their new job visas. – Rappler.com "

The World Health Organization raised its global risk assessment of the virus to the maximum level. It earlier declared the outbreak an international emergency.
The global death toll has reached 3,116, with 2,943 of the fatalities in China. The number of cases worldwide has risen to 90,914, with 80,151 of the infections in China. The virus has spread to more than 70 countries. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – The Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) on Tuesday, March 3, announced it will repatriate 148 Filipinos from Macau amid the continued global spread of the 2019 novel coronavirus.
The Overseas Workers Welfare Administration said it will repatriate 48 of its active members from the area. The repatriated Filipinos will return to the Philippines via a chartered flight, while OWWA members will arrive via one commercial flight.
No date had been set for the arrival of the Filpinos from Macau.
In a statement on Tuesday, the Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF) on Emerging Infectious Diseases said it approved the DFA and OWWA's repatriation plans during a meeting held on Tuesday afternoon. The IATF assured the public that returning Filipinos would undergo the required screening and quarantine measures being implemented by the Philippine government.
As of Tuesday, Macau has recorded 10 confirmed cases of coronavirus. 
Filipinos repatriated from Macau will comprise the 3rd batch of Filipinos returning to the country as cases of coronavirus continues to increase worldwide.
The DFA, along with officials from the Department of Health, earlier repatriated on Feburary 9, 30 Filipinos from from China’s Hubei province, the epicenter of deadly novel coronavirus' outbreak. On February 25, a total of 445 Filipinos also returned home from the coronavirus-hit Japanese cruise ship M/V Diamond Princess.
All repatriates were placed under quarantine in the New Clark City Center in Capas, Tarlac – the Philippines' national quarantine facility for the novel coronavirus outbreak.
The Philippines earlier recorded 3 confirmed cases of the coronavirus, all Chinese tourists, including the first death outside China. The other two already recovered and have returned to China.
As of 12:10 am on Tuesday, the worldwide death toll due to the coronavirus stood at 3,048, while over 89,000 cases were recorded across 68 countries. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – The Philippine government eased restrictions on Filipino tourists traveling to South Korea, limiting the ban it imposed only to areas where the novel coronavirus outbreak is concentrated, instead of the whole country.
Presidential Spokesperson Salvador Panelo told reporters on Tuesday, March 3, that only North Gyeongsang Province, including Daegu City and Cheongdo County, are included in the travel ban.
Before leaving the Philippines, Filipinos visiting other areas in South Korea will be made to sign a declaration stating they know and understand the risks involved in traveling to the country. A health advisory pamphlet will also be given to them upon departure.
""The IATF (Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases) has resolved to partially lift travel restrictions to South Korea as their government has implemented stringent infection control measures to contain the spread of COVID-19,"" Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said.
""South Korea has also reported a low case fatality rate of only 0.5%, and the successful containment of local transmission to only certain areas.""
Last Wednesday, February 26, the Philippines banned Filipino tourists from traveling to South Korea, but allowed permanent residents, overseas Filipino workers, and students based in that country to leave.
Non-Filipinos coming from North Gyeongsang were also barred from entering the Philippines. Exemptions were only granted to Filipinos and their foreign spouses and children, as well as holders of permanent resident cards and diplomatic visas.
Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles earlier said the Philippines decided to impose only a partial travel ban on those arriving from North Gyeongsang since the South Korean government gave assurances it will be able to isolate coronavirus cases.
As of 2:46 pm on Tuesday, South Korea has registered the highest number of coronavirus cases outside China, with 4,812. The death toll there stands at 28.
The vast majority of cases were seen in Daegu, South Korea's 4th largest city and the epicenter of the outbreak, and the rest of North Gyeongsang, Agence France-Presse reported.
No new bans, for now
As for other areas, Panelo said no new travel restrictions have been imposed on countries where a high number of coronavirus cases have been found.
The IATF, he added, has also agreed to maintain existing travel bans on China, Macau, and Hong Kong.
""The IATF assures [the public] that the review concerning travel restrictions and protocols to and from the Philippines shall be regularly conducted,"" Panelo said.
But travel exemptions are now granted, ""allowing dependents of permanent residents of South Korea, Hong Kong, and Macau to travel to these areas as long as they also sign a risk-acknowledgement declaration,"" said Duque on Tuesday.
The Philippines earlier recorded 3 confirmed cases of the coronavirus, all Chinese tourists, including the first death outside China. The other two already recovered and have returned to China. – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – The government's economic managers are set to issue a more dire assessment of the novel coronavirus' impact on the Philippine economy, as the deadly virus further spreads around the globe.
""The whole world is in a mess [due to the virus],"" said Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas Governor Benjamin Diokno in The Manila Times business forum on Tuesday, March 3.
The economic team previously projected that growth would be slashed by 0.2% if the virus would not be contained within a quarter, and up to 0.4% if it drags on until the 1st half of the year.
However, Diokno noted that they were basing the figures on the ""wrong assumption.""
The calculations were based on how the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) affected the global economy over 16 years ago.
""This is not SARS, this is different.... Slightly worse than recent computation,"" Diokno said. (READ: How does COVID-19 compare to SARS and MERS?)
In February, the novel coronavirus overtook SARS in terms of the number of deaths.
During the 2002-2003 SARS outbreak, 774 died, while the novel coronavirus has killed more than 3,100 people and infected over 90,000, with figures still rising.
The Philippines' revised economic estimates are likely to be out by late March or early April.
As the public continues to avoid crowded spaces like malls, Diokno is banking on government spending to shore up the economy.
Less collections
The Bureau of Customs (BOC) is expected to post lower collections due to less imports from China amid the outbreak.
Finance Undersecretary Antonette Tionko said in the same forum that imports from China plummeted by 44% in February, while overall imports are down by 22%.
""We have to work to find ways to recover,"" Tionko said.
However, she noted that the amount of collections ""didn't go down much"" because of higher taxes from oil imports.
The BOC fell short of its collection target for January by at least P2 billion, collecting some P56 billion for the month. 
The tourism sector is among those hardest hit by the virus. The Department of Tourism estimated that the country is set to lose some 1.2 million Chinese tourists due to the novel coronavirus.
In February alone, tourists arrivals in world-famous Boracay declined by 40%, resulting in the closure of some 20 establishments on the island and in the airport. From an average of 4,100 Chinese tourists, only 1,400 came to visit the island.
The Philippines has had 3 confirmed cases of the virus, so far, all of them Chinese tourists. One died, while the other two recovered. There is still no recorded case of local transmission in the country.
At least 87 Filipinos were found to have the virus, but all are based outside the Philippines, including 80 from a cruise ship docked in Japan, 3 in Singapore, and 2 each in the United Arab Emirates and Hong Kong. – Rappler.com "

Photo courtesy of Cebu City Public Information Office CEBU CITY, Philippines – The Cebu Chinese Chamber of Commerce donated 5,000 face masks to help prepare for a possible outbreak of COVID-19 in the Philippines.   The masks were delivered by local businessman Francisco Benedicto.  The donation comes after it was reported that at least 26 Koreans from coronavirus-hit Daegu City traveled to Cebu. All except one have been accounted for, but none exhibited symptoms of the virus. 
Cities around the world have been dealing with mask shortages due to panic buying.  Shortly after news of infections spreading in China began, pharmacies in Cebu started implementing a ""one box per person"" policy in the purchase of face masks to prevent hoarding.

This means they are not symptomatic, but came from areas with known outbreaks.   If there are young children, elderly, or other vulnerable persons in their homes, they will be placed under quarantine in a newly-built facility in Barangay Taptap.""

SINGAPORE (UPDATED) – A Filipina maid, a coworker of another patient from the Philippines, contracted the novel coronavirus disease called COVID-19 in Singapore, said the city-state’s Ministry of Health (MOH) on Monday, March 2.
The 34-year-old domestic worker is the 3rd Filipino coronavirus patient in Singapore. She is the city-state’s 108th case of the novel coronavirus.
“Case 108 is a 34-year-old female Filipino national who is a Singapore Work Pass holder, and has no recent travel history to China, Daegu, and Cheongdo. She is a foreign domestic worker employed by Case 101, and works in the same household as Case 102,” said the MOH.
“She was confirmed to have COVID-19 infection on 2 March morning and is currently warded in an isolation room at Ng Teng Fong General Hospital,” the ministry added.
The Filipina is among two new COVID-19 cases reported by the MOH on Monday, as 4 other patients have been discharged. Of Singapore’s 108 cases of the novel coronavirus, 78 have completely recovered and have been discharged from the hospital as of Monday, said the MOH.
Like her Filipino coworker and their employer, the 3rd Filipino novel coronavirus patient in Singapore is linked to a cluster of cases involving the Singapore e-learning company Wizlearn Technologies. (READ: Filipina linked to coronavirus cases in Singapore firm)
The second Filipino coronavirus patient is a 41-year-old domestic worker with no recent travel history to China, Daegu, and Cheongdo. She tested positive for COVID-19 on Saturday, February 29.
Their employer is an anonymous 61-year-old Singaporean who, also on Saturday, was confirmed to have contracted COVID-19.
The Singaporean employer is linked to Case 93, who had earlier been linked to the COVID-19 cases involving Wizlearn Technologies. The MOH said 12 of Singapore’s 108 novel coronavirus patients are linked to this e-learning company.
Earlier, the first Filipino coronavirus case in Singapore was discharged from the hospital. Identified only as Case 89, he was a 41-year-old Singapore permanent resident who was allowed to leave the hospital on Friday, February 28,nearly a week after he tested positive for COVID-19.

MANILA, Philippines – One of the 26 South Koreans in Cebu who flew in from Daegu, South Korea is still being tracked by the Department of Health (DOH), Assistant Secretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said on Monday, March 2.
Daegu, South Korea's fourth-largest city, is the center of the country's coronavirus outbreak. The 26 flew to Cebu on a direct flight from Daegu on February 25, a day before the government imposed a travel ban on South Korea after it saw a sudden spike in coronavirus cases. (READ: South Korea wages 'all-out responses' to virus with 586 new cases)
The following is the status of the 26 South Korean tourists, according to Vergeire:

15 went home to South Korea on Sunday, March 1
2 are going home on Monday, March 2
1 has gone to Angeles City, and is endorsed to the DOH Central Luzon office
7 are still quarantined in Cebu in their respective hotels
1 is ""for verification""

By ""verification,"" Vergeire said that this meant health authorities are still trying to trace him. The man told port officials that he was staying at a particular hotel in Cebu but when the DOH went to look for him, he was not there.
In the regional press conference in Cebu also held on Monday, DOH Region 7 Director Jaime Bernadas said ""everyone is accounted for"" despite the unverified location of one of the 26 Korean tourists.
Bernadas said that there were ""a lot of ways"" the person can be traced. He said that this included the help of local governments, the provincial health office, the different branches of the Philippine National Police, the Bureaus of Investigation and Quarantine, and the private sector including hotel operators.
Bernadas said that 6 of the South Koreans still in Cebu are tourists and have expressed intention to stay longer after the 14-day quarantine period lapses.
Contact tracing
Vergeire explained that contact tracing refers to tracking down the people who came in contact with confirmed coronavirus cases.
The Health official said that since the 26 South Koreans were not showing signs and symptoms of COVID-19, the disease caused by the 2019-nCoV, contact tracing was not required. However, since they came from a coronavirus-hit area, they still have to be monitored by the DOH as a precaution.
As of Monday, there have been 638 cases monitored in the country, although only 43 remain admitted and 592 others have already been discharged. Even with the significant decrease, the DOH said it ""won't let their guard down."" – with reports from Ryan Macasero/Rappler.com

MANILA, Philippines – Ten Filipinos from the coronavirus-hit Diamond Princess cruise ship who showed flu-like symptoms at the New Clark City (NCC) quarantine facility tested negative for the virus, the Department of Health (DOH) said Monday, March 2.
They are among the 14 patients under investigation (PUIs) in NCC. Ten of them manifested sore throat, 3 had a cough, and one had a fever.
The four others are still waiting for the results of their novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) test. 
""We are more than ready to cater to the needs of our kababayans (countrymen) should they test positive for COVID-19. We are also geared up for the possibility of local transmission,"" said Health Secretary Francisco Duque III. 
COVID-19 is the disease caused by the 2019-nCoV, which originated in Wuhan, China. So far, the virus has killed more than 3,000 people worldwide, with 2,912 fatalities in China alone.

There are 458 individuals currently quarantined in the Clark facility, nearly all of whom were from the virus-hit Diamond Princess and were repatriated by the government to the Philippines last week.
The cruise ship was placed under quarantine since February 5 in Yokohama, Japan after passengers tested positive for the new virus, six of whom had died from the disease.

MANILA, Philippines – The Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) said it was seeking clarification on the full scope of the Saudi government's travel ban, following reports that some Filipinos traveling to Saudi Arabia were denied entry over restrictions put in place due to the 2019 novel coronavirus.
""We're quite concerned about reports of the Saudi government's actions with regard to this particular COVID-19 issue.... We are clarifying the scope and existing policy and if there are those negatively affected we will bring (such) cases to the attention of Saudi government,"" DFA Assistant Secretary Eduardo Meñez told reporters in a press briefing in Malacañang on Monday, March 2.
In an unprecedented move, Saudi Arabia earlier announced it was banning ""umrah"" pilgrims from visiting Islam's holiest sites to try to contain the spread of the coronavirus as the number of cases and deaths soared in neighboring Iran.
The kingdom – which hosts millions of pilgrims every year – added it was also suspending visas for tourists visiting from countries where the new virus is a ""danger."" (READ: World 'simply not ready' for virus spread – WHO China mission chief)
But despite restrictions limited to pilgirms and tourist visas, Meñez said the Philippine embassy was monitoring reports of some Filipinos who were supposedly unable to enter the country for other purposes.  
Among those affected by the Saudi government's travel restrictions was House Minority Leader Bienvenido Abante Jr who was supposed to visit and meet with overseas Filipino workers. Abante was in transit in Dubai when his airline informed him he would not be allowed to enter Saudi Arabia due to restrictions barring Filipino tourists from entering due to the coronavirus.
At the time, Meñez said the Philippine government was confirming the “exact details” of the Saudi government's travel ban.
Following the outbreak of the coronavirus, several countries have imposed sweeping travel restrictions in an effort to quell the spread of the virus. The Philippines is so far imposing travel bans with varying degrees of restrictions on China, its administrative regions Macau and Hong Kong, and South Korea.

MANILA, Philippines – The Overseas Workers Welfare Administration (OWWA) said the government has distributed some P84 million in aid to overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) who were stranded in the Philippines due to travel restrictions imposed over the novel coronavirus outbreak.
OWWA Administrator Hans Cacdac gave the figure during a press conference at Malacañang on Monday, March 2.
He said the assistance was given to 8,448 OFWs who were stationed mostly in China, Hong Kong, and Macau.
The Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) earlier announced that each affected worker would receive P10,000. Repatriated OFWs coming from China will also get at least P20,000 from DOLE.
Last February 2, the Philippine government had banned travel to and from China and its administrative regions Hong Kong and Macau. All Filipinos were not allowed to go to the 3 areas, while only Filipinos and permanent resident card holders could enter the Philippines.
The situation left thousands of OFWs stranded in the Philippines, including those who were set to return to work after Chinese New Year and those who were newly deployed. They feared losing their source of income.
The Philippine government later lifted the ban on OFWs, permanent residents, and Filipinos leaving abroad for study in China, Hong Kong, and Macau on February 18.
'No negative signals'
Aside from this, Cacdac said OWWA is ready to assist Filipino workers from the Diamond Princess cruise ship quarantined in Japan, should they wish to permanently stay and work in the Philippines.
But he added that the workers' manning agent assured the government that all workers will be rehired when they are cleared to return to work.
Cacdac also said there have been ""no negative signals"" on possible effects of the coronavirus on the overseas hiring of Filipinos.
""No negative signals in the sense na magbabawas sila o ayaw na nila ng Filipino (that they will lay off workers or will no longer hire Filipinos),"" he said.
Cacdac likewise assured the public that the government has enough funds to continue helping OFWs affected by the coronavirus outbreak.

Health Assistant Secretary Maria Rosario Vergeire told reporters that as of Monday morning, March 2, there have been 638 cases monitored in the Philippines, but only 43 remain admitted while the 592 others have already been discharged.
""This may be attributed to our strengthened surveillance, early travel restrictions, and enhanced laboratory process. But this is not enough reason to let our guard down,"" Vergeire said in a press briefing in Malacañang on Monday.
Vergeire said the DOH is continuously assessing the situation and working to improve health surveillance protocols based on evidence and latest developments related to the coronavirus.
She added that the DOH has geared up for the possibility of local transmission.
Aside from this, Vergeire said the DOH is adopting contingency plans as the World Health Organization raised its risk assessment for the virus to its maximum level of ""very high"" worldwide.
Meanwhile, of the 458 individuals quarantined at New Clark City in Tarlac, 14 have been admitted to health facilities. Of this number, 10 have tested negative for the coronavirus, while health officials are waiting for the results of 4 individuals.
The Philippines earlier recorded 3 confirmed cases of the coronavirus, all Chinese tourists, including the first death outside of China. The other two already recovered and have returned to China.
As for Filipinos abroad, the DOH has recorded 86 Filipinos confirmed to have the coronavirus. This includes 80 from the Diamond Princess cruise ship docked in Japan, 2 in Hong Kong, 2 in Singapore, and 2 in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).
Of the 80 Filipinos in Japan, 48 remain admitted in hospitals while 32 have been discharged. A Filipino remains admitted in both Hong Kong and Singapore. In the UAE, both Filipinos are still in the hospital.

CEBU, Philippines – Cebu Governor Gwendolyn Garcia said that she is against any huge gathering of students in Cebu province so as not to expose the children to risks amid the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak.
Garcia is set to meet with local government units to consult whether or not to go on with scheduled inter-school activities.
“I don’t think it’s really the right time,” Garcia told reporters on Friday, February 28. ""Is it worth the risk? I shall be calling the mayors as soon as I can… next week.”  
Delegates from Cebu province are set to participate in a number of inter-school activities, including the Central Visayas Athletics Association regional meet on March 15 to 12, and the National Schools Press Conference on March 9 to 13.  
Cebu Schools Division Superintendent Marilyn Andales, co-chairperson of the Provincial School Board, said that the final decision whether to let the province participate lies with the regional office of the Department of Education. 
But the province already complied with the prior suggestion of Garcia, which is to bypass elimination and choose delegates among winning athletes from previous years. 
DepEd has already cancelled several scheduled events amid the outbreak. 
Originating from Wuhan, China, the novel coronavirus so far killed over 2,976 and infected over 86,927 people globally. 
The World Health Organization earlier declared the outbreak an international emergency, warning that the novel coronavirus poses a ""very grave threat.""

AKLAN, Philippines – The 11 tourists from South Korea were allowed to return home to Incheon via Kalibo International Airport on February 28 and 29 after they were monitored in Boracay Island without flu-like symptoms.
Madel Joy Tayco, deputy information manager of Malay inter-agency task force against COVID-19, said no people have been diagnosed with the 2019 novel coronavirus (Covid-19) in Malay, Aklan and Boracay Island.
Tayco said that the Koreans were classified as persons under monitoring (PUMs) after the Philippine government banned the entry of visitors on Wednesday, February 26 from South Korea’s North Gyeongsang province.
The Koreans - 6 males and 5 females - were not under mandatory quarantine since they arrived in Boracay Island for vacation on Tuesday, February 25. But Tayco said that the tourists had been medically cleared and took the direct flight out of Aklan to South Korea.
“Zero na tayo sa PUMs na South Koreans, nag check out na sila sa Boracay at bumalik sa South Korea. No PUMs na ibang nationalities, so far (We have zero PUM South Koreans because they have checked out of Boracay and returned to South Korea. We have no PUMs of other nationalities, so far),” Tayco said.
North Gyeongsang province and Daegu, South Korea’s epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak, have tallied over 2,300 confirmed cases of coronavirus, with 13 casualties. (READ: South Korea reports 376 more coronavirus cases, total 3,526)
Ahead of the summer season, Boracay Island is expected to experience a drop in the daily influx of arrivals from China and South Korea, the two biggest inbound tourist markets of Aklan.
Health authorities in Aklan have also instituted measures in Caticlan port in Malay, Aklan to reduce the risk of the coronavirus spreading.
The Covid-19 threat forced the Provincial Health Office (PHO-Aklan) and Caticlan port medical staff  to conduct health screenings to monitor the body temperature of drivers and passengers using thermometer guns.
Last January 30, travelers from Macau, Hong Kong, and mainland China - the epicenter of deadly virus - were also banned by health authorities from entering the Philippines. – Rappler.com

MANILA, Philippines –  Thousands of workers may lose their jobs in the next 6 months as businesses take a hit from the novel coronavirus disease COVID-19 outbreak, a labor group said on Saturday, February 29.
""TUCP sees 7,000 more layoffs and retrenchments in 6 months amid the growing corona virus outbreak crisis,"" the Trade Union Congress of the Philippines  said in a statement on Saturday.
It made the forecast after Philippine Airlines (PAL)  terminated 300 employees, citing losses incurred because of canceled flights due to the COVID-19 travel bans.
""In TUCP discussions with unions leaders in other industries, they said the PAL retrenchment is just the beginning of the bigger adverse economic effect of the escalating outbreak of COVID-19 phenomenon,"" the labor group said.
TUCP Representative Raymond Mendoza said that based on their assessment, other industries would follow suit and lay off non-essential workers.
""The PAL retrenchment program and the travel bans will trigger more layoffs in several of its supply chains that includes hotels, restaurants, land transport service, logistics, catering and other suppliers of the airlines,"" Mendoza said.
""It is now inevitable that other airlines, to cope with the crisis, will also make similar retrenchments of non-essential jobs which will also affect workers down their supply chains,"" he added.
Mendoza said they would call to reconvene the National Tripartite Industrial Peace Council composed of labor, business and the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE), the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), and the Department of Finance to come up with mitigating measures for the labor impact of COVID-19. 
The TUCP also expected layoffs of Filipino workers in cruise ships, especially cruise lines  hard-hit by the virus.
The labor group said that it is in discussions with shipowners and manning agencies to honor unions' collective bargaining agreements (CBA). In the worst-case scenario, the TUCP said it reminded agencies to ""make a reasonable retrenchment and separation package with those crew who do not have contracts and collective bargaining agreement with them."" – Rappler.com "

MANILA, Philippines – The Quezon City government is training its health workers and volunteers on handling biosecurity risks in communities amid the COVID-19 scare.
Following the directive of Mayor Joy Belmonte,  the Quezon City Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Office (QCDRRMC) and the City Health Department taught barangay-based health workers and first responders to prepare the city in the event of an outbreak of the disease caused by the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)
During the training sessions of the  Quezon City Epidemiology and Disease Surveillance Section, members of the city’s Barangay Health Emergency Response Teams (BHERT) would be given instructions on how to properly wear personal protective equipment (PPEs) before directly handling patients under investigation.
“Wearing PPEs involves a tedious process to make sure that the responder is fully protected from possible contamination,” said city epidemiologist Dr Rolando Cruz.
The PPE kits contain anti-fog goggles, disposable latex gloves, disposable plastic shoe cover, disposable coverall, disposable surgical gown, N95 face mask, disposable surgical mask, and disposable head cap.
The QCDRRMC said that so far, more than a hundred BHERT members from 20 out of the city’s 142 barangays have been training. The first training session was held at Barangay Batasan Hills with over 30 participants, and was followed by another session at the newly-opened Regional Evacuation Center in Barangay Fairview.
“Nakakamangha na sa barangay level pa lang may traning na ganito. Handa na tayo sakaling magkaroon ng case na ganito (It’s amazing that we already have these measures starting at the barangay level. We are ready if ever a case hits our area),” Barangay Batasan Hills captain Jojo Abad said after participating in a session.

DIPOLOG CITY, Philippines – As parents threatened to pull out their children from schools after learning of teachers coming home from vacation in Seoul, South Korea, the Dipolog City Schools Division immediately ordered the teachers to go on 14-day self-quarantine. 
“In all, 8 school teachers, a supervisor, and 6 other companions are now on mandatory self-quarantine,” provincial health officer Esmeralda A. Nadela told Rappler on Saturday, February 29.
“We are now coordinating with the Dipolog City Schools Division as we sent surveillance personnel to visit and investigate our persons under monitoring (PUM),” Nadela added.
On February 26, the Philippine government imposed travel restrictions on North Gyeongsang Province in South Korea after detecting a rise of COVID-19 infections. Exempted by the travel restriction are permanent residents in South Korea, those leaving for study, and overseas Filipino workers.
Nadela said she only knew of the teachers from Korea after parents had raised apprehension of sending their children to school.
“Some of the teachers arrived in Cebu on February 26, took a ship and arrived in Dipolog the following day. Some also took the Manila-Dipolog route air travel also on February 26,” Nadela said.
A parent commented: “Dangag kayo aning taga-Dipolog ga-travel anang lugar nga positive sa COVID-19, wala gyud sila gahuna-huna sa atong safety… pwede ra man unta i-postpone bisag nakapalit na silag promo tickets (These teachers from Dipolog are careless, they travel to a place that is positive of COVID-19, they did not think of our safety… They could have postponed their travel even if they already have bought promo tickets).”
Virgilio P. Batan Jr., Dipolog Schools Division assistant superintendent and officer-in-charge of the division, issued Division Order to the teachers and officials concerned to go on mandatory self-quarantine for 14-days.
“As of now, these teachers are not showing symptoms. In case they will – God forbid – they will be immediately transferred to our isolation facility,” Nadela said.
Dipolog City Mayor Darel Dexter Uy also issued a statement on February 29 assuring the people that the city is safe from COVID-19, and that “measures are in place following established protocols issued by the Department of Health, other government agencies, and concerned authorities."" – Rappler.com

Tayco said the Koreans – comprised of 6 males and 5 females – are the only persons under monitoring (PUMs) in Boracay Island and were being closely monitored by the task force and the Municipal Health Office in their hotels for any signs of the deadly virus.
Majority of South Koreans classified as PUMs left Boracay Island for Incheon, South Korea via Kalibo International Airport on February 28, after undergoing health screenings with the local Bureau of Quarantine.
“Safe na tayo sa mga persons with history of travel in China kasi more than 14 days na from the lockdown. Unless kung galing ang mga turista sa mga bansang affected ng coronavirus case at may fever, cough or cold. So far, walang reports na may signs or symptoms,” Tayco added.

 Central Visayas' Department of Health (DOH) Regional Director Jaime Bernadas said they would also need to track where the persons from Daegu have been in the country so far.  
The task force said the patients were not in the hotels where they said they would be as listed in their health cards.   Because of this, the task force proposed penalties of P5,000 for not putting the correct information in their health cards. 
""This should be a warning. With the help of the GMR (Cebu airport management), we shall be revising the health declaration forms for all international arrivals as well as domestic arrivals,"" Garcia said.
She said that in addition to the fine, she wants prison time as well for health card misrepresentation.

According to the task force, they are being monitored by the Philippine National Police, barangay tanods, hotel management, and DOH personnel.   The persons being monitored were also given the option to return to Daegu instead of completing the quarantine period.
  So far, the 19 are asymptomatic. Once they start showing symptoms, they will immediately be sent to a hospital.   
Garcia also signed a new executive order implementing a 14-day quarantine for Philippine citizens and visa holders who have been to Daegu or North Gyeongsang province in South Korea.   This is in addition to the existing mandatory quarantine on passengers from mainland China and its special administrative regions.
